I agree that kids should learn things like budgeting, first aid/CPR and maybe some cooking or something. However, whenever someone raises this, they inevitably mention “learn to do your taxes.”  This is a dumb thing to teach kids. First, the tax code changes, so the knowledge will be stale before it’s relevant to the kids. Their filing status also changes. In addition, almost everyone uses software to prepare it, so unless they are learning how to use every type of tax prep software, they aren’t benefiting. Finally, it supposes that we will always have a complicated system of tax preparation. We shouldn’t encourage that by baking that assumption into our education system.

I feel like people are being very divisive, yet oblivious to reality.

These are things you just don’t really need to ask people, especially if it’s not relevant of anything at hand.


Even, in workplace settings, if you are asking someone about these things, like where they are from or their racial/ethnic background and they don’t answer your questions or don’t want to, but you keep pressing them. It’s pretty much turning into harassment the further a person takes. Which lends itself to perhaps individual might be prejudice… that might give people the idea that they could be racist, xenophobic, sexist, homophobic, etc.


People cling to the argument that they are not any of these things or believe in any kind of bigotry. No one says they individually are, but they are setting a precedence that a person must always answer such a question in good faith. While, in reality, alot of people do not ask such questions in “good-faith” and often manifests different types of prejudiced behavior. One or several honest or well meaning individuals do not negate the fact that someone’s privacy can be negotiated.

Hypothetically, if someone were to ask me about my race, gender/sex, class, or marital status in public. In most free countries, I have the right “to not answer that question or give them any answer” as I please. I could tell them “I’m from another galaxy and not of any Earth species and have multiple genders. I’m married to seven different people.” 

A person could laugh at my answer and move along, everything is fine. Same, if they don’t respond or react to it. 

But, what about the people don’t? 

The people who may ask “Where are you actually from?  What is your actual race or ethnicity? What is your actual sex … you can only be born a man or woman? What is your actual citizenship status, everyone knows you can’t be from out of space, but even if you are which country were you naturalized in? Who do you owe your allegiance to?”

Are already violating a social contract norm in some societies or committing social faux pas. Because, you are right at policing someone you don’t know to answer questions for your own benefits, concerns, or curiosities when it’s not necessary or appropriate.

When talking about victim-blaming the most heated topic is of course women being sexually assaulted by men, often to do with how they are dressed. I think that in many cases victims should take some moral responsibility for what happened. 

What shouldn't happen is taking it too far - having the responsibility rest *solely* or even *mostly* on the victim. The perpetrator is still by far the one who takes the vast majority of the responsibility. Any legal ramifications  should be placed solely on their shoulders, as well as the bulk of the moral incompetence. I strongly disagree with any comment or points that suggest or even hint that the blame is equal across both parties. However, saying the victim has no responsibility for their own safety at all is also taking it too far. The reality is that both are at fault - just that the fault of the perpetrator vastly overshadows the fault of the victim.

It is not wrong to say a person walking down a dark alleyway in a bad neighbourhood, wearing something sexually provocative and being drunk should take some responsibility if they are sexually assaulted. In the same way, a person driving a luxury car and flashing cash on the street in a poverty stricken area bears responsibility if they are mugged. Or eating a steak in the middle of a vegan gathering could get you yelled at and punched in the face. Or being flamboyantly gay and suggestive in a town hall meaning for a deeply homophobic village could get you assaulted. In all of these cases the perpetrator is still most at fault and should be the only one to suffer legal ramifications, but that doesn't mean it was really stupid/ignorant for the victim to behave in such a manner.

If something bad happens to you because of your own stupidity and ignorance you are in fact partially to blame. It is not wrong to counsel against doing those stupid or ignorant things and reducing the risk of those things happening."

There is traditional canvas, there is pottery, embroidery / sewing, sketches, statues / sculptures, and in the more unorthodox side of things, even stuff like  video art that Nam June Paik is often credited as the founder of; there are discussions as to whether stories told by video games such as the Last of Us constitute art, and on the more traditional and conventionally accepted digital and visual arts include AI generated art, music videos, marching band shows, e.t.c. If most, and perhaps all, the modern (as suggested by a commenter, HIGH QUALITY) mediums that express an image or another stimulation to the senses for enjoyment constitute art, why not miniatures? After all, are they not sculptures and statutes, but scaled down in size?

One last thing I would like to add is that yes I acknowledge there are those truly only toy grade items such as green army men and monopoly game pieces, but there is a high value equivalent, the most common examples being entries and winners in golden demon contests, akin to canvas and pottery having high valued items such as historical paintings and Imperial Chinese vases.

Optional read: why am I posting this and where did I get the idea from? This was mostly triggered by me seeing another post / place where apparently some guy was labeled at fault for ""provoking"" his nephew's middle school into redacting historical paintings that depict violence (e.g. The Third of March 1808 by Francisco Goya) when he questioned the inconsistency as to why that painting was allowed but doodles and miniatures of said Napoleonic soldiers were banned for being ""violent"" simply for showing the muskets, and I myself am an avid miniatures wargame player, and I own a resin printer and make stuff for Frost Grave and Bolt Action groups in my local area.

Edit: as suggested, title will now read "" **CMV: Miniatures such as Warhammer 40 K figures, scale models of warplanes and armored vehicles from Tamiya, can and/or should be considered art if done right""**

More clarification, I am referring only to the finished painted, glazes, highlighted, kitbashed, moulded with terrain added figures and models as potential art. I agree despite an artist needing to digitally sculpt the initial mini unlike a blank canvas, the unpainted mini is still only akin to a blank canvas that was mass produced."

0,2022-12-02,"CMV: Referring to the female genitalia as ""vagina"" isn't just technically incorrect, it's a misguided and confusing attempt at not being vulgar or offensive",u/CleverDad,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zaun27/cmv_referring_to_the_female_genitalia_as_vagina/,changemyview,"As anyone can easily find out with a quick google search, the vagina is the ""elastic, muscular part of the female genital tract"" (Wikipedia), ie the ""inside"" part. The correct anatomical term for the external genitalia as a whole is ""vulva"", but very few use that term colloquially. Thus statements like ""shaving my vagina"".

In fact, to the extent that anyone uses the term vulva, it tends to come across as ""nerdy"" or condescending, in the extent that it comes across at all (as many/most people are unfamiliar with the term).

It's interesting how this became so wide-spread. I have no authority on this, but I'm fairly confident it's simply to avoid saying ""pussy"" or ""cunt"" or something similar, in an attempt to not appear vulgar or offensive. I find it distinctly non-progressive, as we modern people like to think we have a more relaxed, normalized attitude to our bodies and body parts than previous generations.

Now of course, as the use of ""vagina"" has gained common usage, it has come to mean exactly the same to most people as ""pussy"" etc used to do, and is neither more or less offensive or vulgar. You have gained nothing except confuse everyone about the female anatomy. Perhaps the technical naming of parts isn't so very important in everyday use, but really - knowing your body kind of implies knowing the different bits apart.

I know that language tends to work this way, and that words that people choose to use are not subject to authority. That's how language evolves. But using a technical term incorrectly for no gain just seems misguided to me. With more awareness, we can influence our language."

982,2022-12-02,"CMV: There’s nothing wrong with masturbating in private to memories or social media of people you know and are attracted to, provided you keep it to yourself",u/coconutbarfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zazzpo/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_masturbating_in/,changemyview,"TL;DR: I think that there is nothing wrong with getting off to thoughts, memories, or social media pictures of people you know, provided that you do not tell anybody and ensure that they do not know that you get off to them.

In my view, I’m only referring to adults. I think viewing children or animals in a sexual manner is intrinsically wrong, and I don’t want to humor views to the contrary. Don’t try to change my view on that. 

Some objections to my view that I can anticipate are that it is icky or wrong, or that it is a violation of privacy, or that it violates the person’s consent. 

For the former, I don’t think there is anything wrong with being sexually attracted to someone, provided that they are a human adult. 

For the privacy violation argument, I think that using memories you would already have from ordinary interactions, plus whatever embellishments your imagination can create, as well as social media content that you’d be able to access as an ordinary follower or friend does not violate privacy. I think invasive things such as spying from a drone, secret cameras, or being a peeping tom would absolutely be a violation of privacy. I am not referring to using such means in my view. 

Regarding consent: I think there is no need for consent because the only person involved is you. Any memories or media being looked at is ultimately a memory, and those are ours to use as we wish. There’s no need to get permission to have or use thoughts to get oneself off. I don’t see much difference between using a memory of seeing a social media post and looking at the social media post itself durkng the act, so I don’t see any role for consent there, either. I do think it’s crucial that you keep your masturbation habits to yourself and do not share with anybody, because if there is any chance the person you are getting off to finds out, then you are involving them and violating their consent."

I don’t think people put enough consideration into the fact that when you’re sentenced to death, that’s it. You’re done, forever. With life in prison you can still work on yourself, and build your body and health with exercise. You can read books and learn new things, expanding your knowledge on all subjects of life. You can keep limited contact with your loved ones for years to come, find out how they are growing, living, and what they’ve accomplished. You can still observe the world, watch the sunset and observe nature. (Obviously in a limited setting and time). But with the death sentence, it’s over. You’re dead.

181,2022-12-03,CMV: Using an AdBlocker is not immoral if you aren't buying stuff from ads anyways,u/empirestateisgreat,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zbeqce/cmv_using_an_adblocker_is_not_immoral_if_you/,changemyview,"People say that blocking ads is stealing revenue from content creators, but I don't think that is necessarily true. When you aren't the type of person that ads target, there is no point in watching them and you might as well block them.

Firstly, let's focus on the companies revenue. The reason companies put out adverts is to either A) sell you a product (or donate) B) get brand recognition, so you will buy their stuff later or C) spread a (political) message.

I personally never buy anything out of advertisements and this is unlikely to change, so point A doesn't apply. Point B doesn't apply, because I don't judge my purchasing decisions based on what brands I've seen an ad for. C) doesn't apply because I have never been convinced of a religious or political proposition by watching someone advertise it. So, in my case, it makes no difference to them whether I watch ads or not.

Now you might say, I'm still stealing money from the content creators who depend on ad revenue. There are two possible business models here, either you get paid by the amount of people who click on the ad, or simply by the amount of people who view it. The former is not relevant, since I never click on ads. The later is a bit more interesting, because here, when I see an ad and don't interact with it, the creator still gets money. But at the same time, I am devalueing the advert, because every person that doesn't click on an ad makes the amount companies are willing to pay for it go down. That means, it benefits the creator, but disadvantages every creator at the same time. So ultimately, it doesn't make a difference whether I use an AdBlocker or not."
0,2022-12-03,"CMV: The world would be a better place if it were the norm in monogamous relationships that we say ""yes"" to sex when we can mentally/physically afford to even if we aren't in the mood.",u/SpareCaterpillar4752,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zbfpc8/cmv_the_world_would_be_a_better_place_if_it_were/,changemyview,"_DISCLAIMER: It pains me that this seems necessary but I tried a similar topic once before and I got a lot of angry responses from people with righteous anger on a hair trigger. So, to start this I want to be abundantly clear: Sex should always have consent from all involved parties. If one participant does not consent, this is rape - and rape is very bad. I'm opposed to rape - very opposed, in fact. I also think that people should not be manipulated into having sex they don't want to have. If someone says ""NO"" to sex, everyone must respect that person's right to choose, and nobody should force that person into sex regardless of the reason they chose to say ""NO""._

When two people are in a monogamous relationship, they become each other's exclusive source for sex (excepting masturbation). Let's assume that, for the sake of this discussion, the consequence for cheating (breaking the rules of the relationship) is that the relationship ends immediately. Therefore, if person A and person B are in a monogamous relationship, and person A refuses to let person B have sex with them, it's tantamount to saying ""GO SEXLESS TONIGHT OR I WILL DUMP YOU"". This is a deliberately harsh way to describe it as a means to illustrate my point. The current mainstream thinking trends towards ""if both people aren't super eager to have sex, it's evil and rape"". I propose an alternate system in which the norm is that we offer ourselves to our partners when we can mentally/physically afford to, even if we're not horny or if we're a little sleepy or something. In this system everyone still has the right to say ""NO"" any time for any reason. Just like I can refuse to make dinner for my partner at any time for any reason - but it'd be a decent thing to do for me to make my partner dinner even if I'm a little tired after work. Taking a similar approach to sex would lead to less sexual frustration and less cheating. Furthermore, sex is placed on a pedestal in our society and sacred things encourage dogmatic views. You can't challenge sacred things or domgatic views, which makes them dangerous. Also the readily available reddit solution to relationship problems: ""break up!"" is a naive way to look at it. No shit you can always break up, but unless you're a kid who thinks two years is a ""long"" relationship, most of us can understand that the cost of splitting up two lives that might be financially intertwined and have kids and who know what other tangled dependencies is often too high. So the flippant attitude of ""just divorce"" is tantamount to saying ""just suffer"".

An example. I'm a man and my husband wants to have sex but I'm not in the mood. I'm tired from work and I'm not feeling horny at all, but I do have enough energy and spirit to do it and make my husband happy so I grab the lube and let him do his thing. Next week, I wake up at 3am Saturday night super horny, so I nudge my husband who is super not in the mood and half asleep. But he's a good sport, grabs the lube and lets me do my thing. This seems to me to go against the common view, but seems not only harmless but good to me. Swap man/husband with any gender combo you like (does man-man feel different than man-woman to you? not super relevant, just a tangential curiosity)"

In a post-2022 survey done on reasons behind voting patterns and the most important factors behind voters' choices in selecting a party over another, ""53% of non-Democrats who voted Democratic in the midterms"" were concerned that Republicans might restrict abortion. ""64% of voters who voted for a Democrat for Senate and/or Governor this year"" said that it played a larger role than in previous years in influencing their voting choice. [Source](https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/report/naral-election-poll-memo/) 

(It goes without saying that abortion played a bigger role in influencing women's votes than men's votes - but pro-choice men voted mostly D, though I can't find any reliable source or quotable statistic.)

[Out of five issues that influenced to the greatest extent how one votes, inflation - 31%, abortion - 27%, crime - 11%, gun policy - 11%, immigration - 10%, abortion was the strongest, most politically polarized issue, with 76% of the 31% who chose abortion as their top issue among the five issues voting for Dems, even more so than those who picked inflation as their top issue who voted for Republicans by a lesser margin](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/exit-polls?icid=election_nav) 
Something to note - 60% of the surveyed were married, and only 28% had children. Participants by party affiliation and voting choice wad 33% D, 35% Republican, and 18% Independent men who skewed 50 - 45 R, and 13% Independent women who skewed 54 - 42 D. Among the 60% who said that inflation caused them and their families ""a moderate hardship"", the vote was 52 - 46 R. Among the 65% for whom ""gas prices have been a financial hardship"" recently, the vote was 64 - 35 R, and for those surveyed, climate change is ""a very serious problem"" for 46% (83% D), ""a somewhat serious problem"" for 25% (70 R) and ""not a serious problem"" for 27% (90+ R). 

[In another survey that distinguished between age groups in ranking the most important issues to voters,](https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/abortion-election-how-youth-prioritized-and-voted-based-issues) youth prioritized abortion to inflation 44 - 21%, while other age groups inflation to abortion 34 - 31, 33 - 24 and 32 - 22. ""However, a slightly higher percentage of young people who believe abortion should be illegal chose inflation as their top issue (37%), compared to half of young people who believe abortion should be legal.""

I started doing my own research on it and tried it out back in 2013-2017 and I was positive, made a vision board, yet I still don’t have a family and my own house till this day. As a matter of fact I earn over the average in my home country,yet buying a house alone would be absolutely brutal and nowadays it’s even difficult to find apartments for a rent, even in smaller cities. I was feeling sad and I was thinking about my past and it hit me once again that the law of the attraction doesn’t work, even though it claims it works whether you believe in it or not. There have been times when I’m super frightened and scared and have negative attitude yet everything has gone just fine. Kind of think of it,it has never worked and “The Secret” was just a huge scam."

0,2022-12-03,CMV: The West is rashly judging Treatment of Women in Qatar. We should genuinely consider the pros and cons of different laws and social norms to determine how to best cultivate human flourishing.,u/Mr-Homemaker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zbk5pd/cmv_the_west_is_rashly_judging_treatment_of_women/,changemyview,"Central Discussion:
Premise: We in the West (eg USA) are doing pretty poorly in the realm of marriage, family life, and child rearing over the past 50+ years.
View: We should step back, exercise some critical thinking, and genuinely consider the pros and cons when comparing (a) Our current system, (b) our past system, (c) the Qatari system, (d) possible hybrid systems we could adopt moving forward.

Examples:
According to ""The Conversation"" ...
https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/the-qatar-world-cup-is-beaming-misogyny-around-the-world-195242 ...
these are some examples of objectionable aspects of treatment of women:

CATEGORY A) Can anyone explain what exactly they think is intrinsically immoral or contrary to human flourishing:

1) Sex outside of marriage is banned

2) Marriage requires approval of the bride's father

CATEGORY B) If these were slightly modified as I've worded them to be more equitable, would they then be acceptable ?:

3) Very limited grounds are acceptable for divorce

4) One spouse is required to focus on homemaking, AND in case of divorce the other spouse is obligated to support thr homemaker and children indefinitely

5) Children who are breadwinners / heads-of-households inherit twice as much as children who are homemakers 

6) Modest dress codes are enforced socially (but not legally [eg dress codes established by restaurants, etc])

! - NOT INTERESTED:
Anything that includes the phrase ""being treated as property"" or ""slavery"" or ""bondage."" I judge these to be unsubstantiated propagandistic narratives and are outside the scope of this CMV.

TLDR: Can we agree that at least SOME of the legal and social norms in Qatar / in pre-1970 West are/were/could_be (future) good for marriage, family life, and children ?

//

I've received data (and awarded a delta) indicating a precipitous decline in the birthrate of Qatar - which is very troubling and would undermine significantly my theorized causal relationship between their seemly pro-marriage and pro-family policies and the outcomes I would like to see for marriage and family. I will need to do more research to see what theories are out there to explain this drop in birthrate -- IF ANYONE ELSE KNOWS or can suggest an explanation, I would be very grateful !"

Mainly because those that are poor will have to worry about surviving in their local environments, scrummaging for resources to be able to avoid being robbed while trying to supply food for their children. In that pursuit for the right to live, a capitalist, at the very least one that is focused lessed on surviving and more on changing the world, would continue to gain more resources to do what he/she cares to do on a moment's whim.

There is also the aspect that the poor do not control their wages and have a cap on how much they can sell any products for, due to the supply/demand of their environment. Though the internet has made it easier to expand markets, the internet is also a place for capitalists to continue to siphon more money faster than the lesser financially educated, still leaving those who grew up poor - specifically from lineages who did not survive well in the capitalistic society - unable to make enough to survive (stretching here).

Change my mind please.

Edit: it looks like my view is unchangeable here because winning to me is “not needing to play the game anymore”. It looks like an economic system isn’t about moving “out” of a system, but having an equal opportunity within it. Thank you all for your comments. Moving on to a new topic."
0,2022-12-03,CMV: Blaming everything kids do wrong on “bad parenting” is mental health denial.,u/catniagara,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zblri8/cmv_blaming_everything_kids_do_wrong_on_bad/,changemyview,"Current research considers parenting to be one of the [most important public health issues facing our society](https://www.parentingforbrain.com/bad-parenting/). Laymen have followed this trend and there is a tendency these days to blame every issue a child might have on “parenting problems”. 

Children with mental health issues, because kids are considered an extension of the parental body, can be left behind by this ideology. While the lasting effects of neglect, physical abuse and parental uncaring cannot be denied, assuming a lack of parenting skills based on the behaviour of a child can be damaging to the family and to society as a whole.

We only have data on the most extreme cases (where neglect and abuse are investigated by CPS. 

Only around [20% of CPS investigations](https://citylimits.org/2019/03/24/opinion-what-the-data-says-about-child-welfare-in-new-york-city/) (usually less) result in removal of the child. 

Around 75% of reports, depending where you live, are based on child behaviour. They are not based on someone observing an interaction between the parent and child. Many [mandated reporters](https://www.nyc.gov/site/acs/child-welfare/mandated-reporters.page) such as teachers and police, act based on observations of the child’s behaviour and assume parental behaviour from that. 

Children with mental health issues such as severe paranoia, schizoaffective anxiety, schizophrenia, addictions and also with physical health issues, can easily pass for abuse victims in the eyes of someone who doesn’t know the family. A child with severe anemia may be covered in bruises. A child with schizophrenia may actually hear her mother yelling at her when she’s not even home. Pathological liars were once children too. At the extreme, a child with psychosis can control and terrorize an entire family. 

Diagnosis and treatment focus on people age 18+, which can leave people fighting for a diagnosis and families fighting stigma when they should be able to focus on helping their child. 

Up to 89% of mental health resources, depending where you live, are earmarked for CPS cases. Many families are turned away from supports or stuck on 6+ year waiting lists, or told they need to [give up their children](https://www.freep.com/restricted/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freep.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2F2022%2F11%2F20%2Fparents-child-protective-services-mental-health-help%2F69656670007%2F) to access supports. 

The service based model of CPS (as opposed to needs and program based) focuses too heavily on taking kids and ignores families who care and love their children but are struggling with a lack of resources. That trickles down into general attitudes about parents that become self-fulfilling prophecies about children. 

Blaming and shaming parents is an easy way to deny mental health supports for children and refuse families help. Willing to hear other theories on any of this or how circumstances can be improved.

Edit 1: I can’t edit the title. Someone asked me to be more accurate. More accurately, blaming everything most kids do wrong 75-90% of the time, depending where you live, is mental health denial. 

Edit 2: I was asked to provide more recent studies that linked mental health with parental behaviour. There are many studies where bias focused solely on parental behaviour and ignored other socioeconomic issues. 

[This one](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-06-parental-behavior-key-optimal-child.amp) focused on “unpredictable parent behaviour” without giving any parameters for “unpredictable” other than the scientists opinions of what that meant (2022) 

[These ones](https://clinicaltrials.ucsf.edu/child-behavior) are deliberately seeking candidates who identify as problem parents to participate in myopic studies that I feel will give them exactly the results they’ve filtered for: “bad” parent = “bad” kid 

[Recent articles](https://start.hifirstday.com/advertorial-jb/?nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ag%3A15707892876%3A132527959398%3A572282474851&amp;nb_adtype=&amp;nb_kwd=kids%20behavior&amp;nb_ti=kwd-1570233009775&amp;nb_mi=&amp;nb_pc=&amp;nb_pi=&amp;nb_ppi=&amp;nb_placement=&amp;nb_si=%7Bsourceid%7D&amp;nb_li_ms=1023198&amp;nb_lp_ms=1023198&amp;nb_fii=&amp;nb_ap=&amp;nb_mt=p&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI74KxtIHe-wIViLbICh2ddQBjEAMYASAAEgJ3tfD_BwE) boil down behaviours that may be indicative of future mental health issues to just not feeding your kid the right foods or using the right oils. 

Colloquially we have cute little phrases like “if there’s something wrong with the b*tch, there’s something wrong with the pup” or “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree”

Anecdotally, many of the replies to this post and any number of posts throughout Reddit and everywhere else online take a “blame parents, ignore patients, do not consider the family unit, assume parents don’t love their children” stance on children’s mental health and well-being."

53,2022-12-03,CMV: There are no moral issues in training AI art generators using publicly available artwork,u/noljo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zbnc2j/cmv_there_are_no_moral_issues_in_training_ai_art/,changemyview,"The topic of AI text-to-image algorithms has become quite contentious over the last few months. While I'm not super involved in artist communities, I intersect with them sometimes and see a common thread of disdain towards these algorithms. While I can understand some of the fears, I strongly disagree with the front-runner argument of why AI art is bad - that ""models are trained on art without the artist's consent (but should be)"".

Now, to explain why I think this isn't a strong argument, I'll give a basic outline on how (afaik) training works in a very rough, high-level way. However, while I have some rudimentary knowledge on how machine learning works, things as complex as this are still way beyond my level of understanding.

1. A publicly-available image is downloaded. It, alongside with some supporting data like tags, is fed into an algorithm that trains a model.

2. The image is broken down and passed through the model. In a nutshell, an AI has a wall of a million sliders (weights) - all of which are completely incomprehensible to humans - but if set in just the right way with the right inputs, a legible image can be created. Training ""teaches"" the model about which ""sliders"" to prioritize and to what extent. So, when a model is trained on an image, it's imprinted with some data on how the AI ""understood"" the image - the data that relates the image to its supporting text.

3. The input data can be discarded at this point. Again, all the AI gathered from the image was some human-unreadable information on features and relations of things about the image. This process is destructive - it's not possible to pixel-by-pixel recreate any input image used originally, all that's left in the model is essentially a faint shadow of some descriptive data of that image.

4. This is repeated many millions of times with different imagery to form a finished model.

This simplified explanation should still allow me to lay down some arguments based on it:

1. **Not legally problematic:** now, legality doesn't equate to morality, but I still felt like including this as one of the arguments, with some people claiming that there is a strong legal basis for a ban on AI art in general. Downloading a publicly posted image to your computer (even an artwork that an artist holds the copyright to) is legal. Mangling that image into data that the original can't be restored from is legal. Now consider that the model doesn't even contain the latter, but rather is trained to *roughly* predict new images based on its interpretations of descriptive data of millions of other images.

2. **Vaguely resembles human learning:** while human learning and deep learning are different mechanically, the latter was still strongly inspired by the former. At the moment, I'd say that this is the closest emulation of how a human learns things. That poses a question - what about a human learning from an image is moral, while an AI doing the same is immoral? In my opinion, I don't see a meaningful difference between these two.

3. **Highly transformative:** coupled with the fact that models don't store anything close to individual images, the resulting works they output can be extremely different from those inputs. It's similar to me pulling up some photographs or drawn references of a character to help me draw something - I'm not reproducing the original work, I'm merely using it to understand the way things like anatomy work or how exactly the different body parts, features of a character etc relate to one another to produce a new, unique work. In art communities, it would be considered absurd to ask reference artists or photographers for permission to use their work as art reference, as well as to credit them in the resulting work. So why should an AI do that?

If we agree that when artists post their art publicly (for example, on art-sharing websites) consent isn't required for other people to be able to view, download and directly learn from it, then what is the *meaningful* distinction that makes it needed for AI learning?"

Comparing yourself to yourself and simply measuring improvement is not actually valuable. No one says “that restaurant is better than it was, and that’s good enough for me,” they say “this is my favorite restaurant because it is better then the others.” It doesn’t matter that you got your masters degree with a 3.4, because this other person got theiR PHD with a 4.0; they are objectively smarter and more driven than you and their achievements are more impressive which makes yours worth nothing.

Ex: saying “I’m stronger and leaner than I was last year” does not matter as opposed to “that man is stronger and leaner than I am.” You simply aren’t as good as the other person.

The same way women don't like to be referred to as ""female"" because it dehumanises them as well, it reduces women to their genitalia. A female can be anything, a cat, a donkey, a pig. When you attempt to address women and you say female you are not even referring to them as a person a human being. Its incredibly demeaning to women. Especially how it's being used the majority of the time. That's similar energy as an crotchety white man calling a grown ass black person ""boy""



Before you say women call each other ""bad bitches"" or their girl friends ""bitch"" casually. Yeah that's called reclaiming a slur. Women reclaiming the word that degraded and dehumanised them (primarily by men) for decades and turning it positive for each other. Taking away the negative power of the word for each other. The same way trans people may causally use the word ""tranny"" or of course how black people reclaimed the N word. Atleast compared to the word ""females"" women were able to turn that into a term of endearment between them. You never hear a women say ""that's my female!! 😃"" Because they never reclaimed that word. 


I don't automatically judge people who use the word bitch because it's been so normalised in society it's hard to avoid it. I mean rap being a huge example of this. Im not saying someone listening to rap is sexist themselves but the artists who created those songs very much are. 

The word bitch is an extremely derogatory term that is specifically referring to women. That is the actual definition of a slur. It literally means ""female dog"" anyone denying the roots of the word being misogynistic is in denial. 

Women are not ""over dramatic"" for disliking the word bitch, just because it's normalised for so long doesnt make it okay. The same way we phased out r*tard for the most part because people started to understand just how direspectfully the word was being used. 

The only reason this is even a debate whether or not this is really a slur is because men refuse to give up their right to call women bitches (or hoes or sluts or whores or any other derogatory word primarily aimed at women) without being seen as an asshole or misogynist. 

Either that or a complete lack of self awareness. I mean to be fair many women themselves haven't really inspected the weight behind these words, or the terrible origin of the word in reference to women.

There will be spills and noises. Kids are kids. While I personally struggle badly around them due to some sensory stuff (ASD), I do not passionately hate them. I do dislike that they trigger me with shrill noises but that is no reason to physically or verbally bring harm to them.

However, being told “I was a kid once” by multiple people in order to try and lean me in the direction of *loving* children feels manipulative. I had a very traumatic childhood, and I don’t want to have to recall that every time I don’t want to hold a baby or entertain someone’s kid (like at a family gathering). And in the case of “Well they didn’t know,” that’s fine and I don’t expect everyone to know the details of my upbringing. But that lends to my point even more that you shouldn’t use “you were a kid once” because you have no idea what the adult you’re talking to went through as a child. You could be triggering them inadvertently. I can’t really see any reason to try to appeal to people in this specific way, but if I’m myopic here please feel free to elaborate. 

P.S.: I think people who are aggressively edgy (the “I want to take all kids and toss them in the ocean” types) are over the top. If that sort of outright hatred is from past childhood trauma, therapy would probably help change that mindset, as today’s kids aren’t your abusive parents of yesterday."

774,2022-12-03,CMV: Advertising is the biggest problem with modern-day Capitalism,u/RedditExplorer89,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zbvn9k/cmv_advertising_is_the_biggest_problem_with/,changemyview,"**Update**: Got some good deltas, see at bottom of post.  Getting a lot more replies than I expected, so sorry if I don't respond to everyone.

I understand the foundation of capitalism to be: supply and demand.  And at face value, these sound like fair pillars to build upon.  A natural mix of reality (what exists:supply), and ideals (what we want:demand).

The problems come when either side is artificially cheated.  For example: lying about supply I think would upset most people.  If you say there are only 10 miracle pills in the world to increase the price, but there are actually billions of miracle pills, that is cheating people and harming society.

I see advertising as distorting demand.  You could have a company that makes amazing cheesecakes, and one that makes mediocre ones, but if the mediocre one has better advertising they will be more successful and push out the better company for society.  All because the one without advertising only has the demand of their local town, while the other taps into a demand hundreds of times bigger depending on how good the advertisement is and how many eyeballs see it.

It isn't the better company (for society) that gains from advertising, its the one who has better ads and more money to spend on ads and knows to spend on ads.

I say modern-day in the title because I think the internet and technology has confounded this problem.  Now advertising can reach so many more eyes than ever before, and thus cause bigger distortions for demand on products: potentially causing greater harm to society by propping up worse products than deserve it.

My understanding of economics is pretty basic, and I don't hear many people talk about this issue, so coming here to see if I am missing something and if my view can be expanded on it.

The reason I blame capitolism for this is because its so hands-off, and up to each company to advertise on its own.  Another form of economy, like communist or socialist or even dictatorship could have advertising be done by a 3rd party to ensure fair advertising for products.

*Deltas*:

* Free, state-ran advertising could lead to more scams.  With capitalism, scams at least need to pay money up-front.

* Some programs run better with advertising funding them.  Such as reddit.

* A bigger problem of modern-day capitalism could be the lack of commons (all the land is owned.)

* Free market is what allows anyone to purchase ads, not Capitalism.

* The internet provides a lot of free reviews for people to discern the best products.

* Marketing can be ""high tide raises all boats,"" when introducing customers to new products.

* Marketing can help spread good products more quickly, such as with the shaving razorblade.

* A bigger problem with capitalism could be that it incentivizes lobbying and side-stepping regulations."

0,2022-12-03,CMV: Taxation is theft,u/Jazzlike_Kiwi_4991,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zbxdo7/cmv_taxation_is_theft/,changemyview,"Theft is any time someone takes your property without your consent, or threatens to use force to make you do it yourself (e.g., threatens to send a policeman to throw you in jail [if you want to technically call that extortion, fine - read 'extortion' wherever you see 'theft']). Most people have not consented to the rule of most governments, and so in general taxation is theft.

Governments do not go around to its citizens offering services in exchange for cash. You're expected to pay by default, regardless of if you wanted any of it. Unlike insurance, where you have to pay to get protection. Government could be structured with private policing, private fire departments, etc., where you pay for them if you want service. But nobody has signed a protection contract with the government.

People tend to naively think its democracy that makes nations consentual, because in a democracy 'the people govern themselves'. Democracy is certainly less bad than autocracy since they tend to be less abusive (better yet if its a constitutional democracy with rights that specify what may *not* be done to you), but its not consent. To say so would imply that because gang rape is democratic, its just 'the people raping themselves'.

Some will reply that certain actions imply implicit, unspoken consent. These might include voting, residing in the state, or using public services. The problem I have with those actions being taken as consent is it has to be agreed by both parties that any otherwise neutral action is to be taken as an act of consent. I can't simply say 'sleeping with your wife tonight constitutes consent to give me $1000', and expect to receive anything from it, unless the person I say it to agrees that it can be taken as a sign of his consent to do so.

Sometimes people will say 'taxes are the price to live in a civilized society'. But 'price' implies choice. You can't choose to live outside a 'civilized' society, because all the viable land is under the thumb of some state or other. It'd be like saying that if you were drugged and taken aboard a plane, your choice not to throw yourself out is 'consent' to the rule of the captain.

You can't get out of it by moving to another country, since you'll just be moving to some other involuntary power structure. True consent requires the ability to refuse all options. Suppose your parents arrange a marriage for you. When you complain, they reply, ""well, at least you have a choice between several men, so what's the big deal?"". The big deal is that for marriage to be consensual, one must be free to refuse any marriage at all. Additionally, you'd have to leave your family and home behind. If someone threatens to prevent you from ever seeing your family again (or at least easily) unless you follow their rules, does the choice to comply sound like consent?

Others will say that because we receive benefits from the state (e.g., roads, policing), we're obliged to pay for what we use. But payment should only be required when the user has the option of refusing use. If you mow my lawn when I'm away at work, you don't then get to demand payment for it. I have to consent to receive the benefit before payment is obligatory.

Taken to its logical conclusion this reasoning leads to anarchy, since without taxes nothing can be done by the state. I don't think anarchy will last very long, as most historical examples have shown. So we're probably stuck with a government. However, that doesn't justify willy-nilly use of it any more than it justifies willy-nilly use of a drug with harmful side effects. It justifies only the bare minimum required, in this case, the bare minimum required to fight off less consensual (read: bigger) states.

PS: Before posting I read through an older CVM on this sub that came close to convincing me, but didn't quite get there. The argument revolved around the fact that some countries, like the US, allow you to [renounce your citizenship](https://www.usa.gov/renounce-lose-citizenship), and no longer pay taxes. This is interesting and almost makes the system consensual, if it weren't for two aspects of it: 1) You pay a fee to do so, and you have to pay income taxes for 10 years if your purpose was to avoid paying taxes (in other words, if you want us to stop stealing from you, you need to let us steal from you for another decade). 2) You have to leave the land the government has power over. In many countries you're forced to sell your property and obviously you'd have to leave your family behind."

They can look to their young, naive audience and say "" The media is afraid of hearing the truth so they're trying to silence us"". when you have that happening, its very hard, if not impossible, to bring their followers back to the side of rational thinking when you have to explain why your side is in the right for censoring them. Nick Fuentes started a channel on youtube, an openly liberal company. There is no way he knew he would not get banned eventually. He was counting on it, i would say.

Biden's administration has spent a long time claiming that white supremacy is the biggest threat to the homeland. However, after doing extensive research, I have not found any evidence to suggest this.

Yes, white supremacy does exist and yes, there are white supremacist related atrocities like Charlottesville and the Buffalo shooting. But if you total all of the killings perpetrated by white supremacists, it doesn't even compare to deaths from obesity and the mental health crisis. Heart disease (commonly caused by unhealthy foods) causes 600,000+ deaths per year. There are about 50,000 suicides per year in the US (800,000 worldwide). There are probably less than 20 people who are killed by white supremacists in one year. These other things are far more lethal than white supremacy.

Furthermore, only about half the population is white. And of that, over 50% of white people support Black Lives Matter. Therefore, it's hard to believe that this is THE most lethal terror threat if most of the white population supports a group that \[supposedly\] stands for racial equality.

The few white supremacists that exist are deeply obscured to the most radical corners of the internet. And even then, 99.9% of them don't do anything. Hell, the BLM movement killed more people in the summer of 2020 than white supremacy has in the past few years.

How does white supremacy even compare to the mental health crisis, heart disease, drug overdoses, etc?"

I can understand how the southern states wanted to keep his slavery way of life, which you know... It suck but so what? A lot of things suck. So I see a legitimate reason to want to be a separate country.

Then, slavery was still a thing in Cuba and Brazil afterwards and America didn't invaded those countries, so it wasn't a global crusade against chattered slavery. 

So the CSA had legitimate reasons to try to become an independent country, however they were weaker and the industrial north crush them and conquer them, end of the story. 
Can we see the union as morally superior? Yes
Was it northern aggression? I think so.

Then again, I am not american and never study this subjects with detail, beyond some YouTube videos and some Wikipedia pages and history channel back in the day. So if you can give me some counter points it would be cool.

I don't support the CSA, I don't give a fuck to be honest, but I think you can wage a war with the moral high ground and still be the aggressor."

Before signing court enforced legal documents, we should empower people to have as much information as possible.

This isn't just the best case scenario for the father, but it's also in the child's best interests. Relationships based on infidelity tend to be unstable and with many commercially available ancestry services available, the secret might leak anyway. It's ultimately worse for the child to have a resentful father that stays only out of legal and financial responsibility, than to not have one at all.

Deltas:

* I think this shouldn't just be sold on the basis of paternity. I think it's a fine idea if it's part of a wider genetic test done to identify illness related risks later in life
* Some have suggested that the best way to lessen the stigma would be to make it opt-out. Meaning you receive a list of things that will be performed and you have to specifically refuse it for it to be omitted. I agree and think this is sensible.

Edit: 

I would be open to change my view further if someone could give an alternative that gives a prospective fathers peace of mind with regards to paternity. It represents a massive personal risk for one party with little socially acceptable means of ameliorating. "

I cant find any good reason at all for forced homework for children. Imagine the same thing for adults. Your boss tells you at the end of the day: ""Hey, dont forget to do this work while youre free from work!"" (I know this is the case for some people but it is not the standard).

So, I say, maybe make a school day a little bit longer then, and let kids be free when they are free.

But to me this doesn't make much sense. 

When it comes to whether or not something was worth paying a certain amount of money you need to consider whether the benefit that you get makes up for your loss in money. In order to increase the amount of worth you get from paying for something you'd either need to increase the benefit you gain or decrease the money you've lost.

Let's say you paid to go to a museum and only half of the exhibits interest you and the other half don't so you visit the ones you enjoy. Some people might say that you should visit all of them so that you can get your money's worth. But to me that doesn't make sense because the money you paid is gone either way. Why should you visit the other exhibits that don't interest you if they won't increase the amount of enjoyment you get and the amount of money you've lost doesn't change either?

For another example, suppose you're at an all you can eat buffet and even though you haven't eaten that much, you're completely full. There's no point in trying to eat as much as you can to get your money's worth. Your money is already gone and eating more will only make you feel worse.

For one final example, let's say that you paid a lot of money to get a college degree in some particular field and after you graduated you decided that you're no longer interested in doing what you studied. So you decide to get a job in a different field that you believe you would enjoy more. Realistically both jobs would have different salaries, but for the sake of the scenario let's say that you don't care about salary and that you want to work a job you enjoy. You can choose to do this new job or you can stick to your previous path to once again, get your money's worth. But the same logic still applies here, the money you paid on tuition is never coming back, and at this point you might as well do what you think you'll enjoy more.

I think there is an argument of trying to get your money's worth if you think that there's a chance you'll enjoy doing all the things the money allows you to do if you just put in the effort to go out and do them. But if you've already paid a sum of money and you are fairly confident that you will not enjoy  or benefit from doing a certain thing that the money has allowed you to do, then you gain nothing from doing it."

For me the fun in these types of games is immersing myself in the character and genuinely thinking how I would solve the problems and moral dilemmas  you face in the game. Fallout 3 didn't really offer much in the way of choice, there was a linear story you joined up with the brotherhood of steel who represent a sort of compassionate warrior monk archetype. There's some comments about racism towards ghouls but generally they're portrayed as generic good guys.

Then there's fallout new vegas where they introduce siding with factions, and while obviously Caeser's legion is the ""bad guys"" they at least have logical arguments. The old world democracies failed, they created the world these poor people have to live in, the Roman ancient world lasted 2000 years I can empathize with people living through that apocalyptical wasteland trading in freedom and democracy for stability and security even if I disagree with them. The NCR is typical liberal democracy with all the pros and cons of that system. Freedom and liberalism yes but also corruption and inefficiency. Then you have house again pros and cons, seems to be competent relative to everyone else (predicted the disaster, preserved vegas, clearly a genius who is developing technology that can fix many of the problems people face. But also clearly an authoritarian ego maniac, there are all sorts of questions about giving one ""person"" that much power (how much of a human being is House anymore, neither is he a cold logical machine, hes some sort of hybrid. All the coldness of a machine with the ego of a human a dangerous combination) not to mention the obvious huge inequalities House would create in his society of hyper capitalism. I assume the poor NCR migrants and people of Freeside won't be able to go to his lunar colony just like they can't get into Vegas. In the end you have 3 (.5 i don't consider yes man a real ending just sort of a player writes their own ending fan fic) choices each with massive problems and it ends up being a question of what do you value most: stability, liberty, or progress. 

Which brings us to fallout 4 where Bethesda tries to take take this faction system but honestly the only ones who feel like actual human beings are the railroad. The minutemen to me don't really count as they are similar to yes man to me. A ""make up your own ending"" ending. I think its fairly obvious that the modern synths are sentient as the games quests are very unambiguous and seem to shove it in your face. Whether its Dance's loyalty quest or Nick Valentine's the whole point of those quests is they are indistinguishable from human beings. So you have the railroad trying to protect sentient beings from being either enslaved or exterminated, and their cons are... they're kind of annoying hipsters and are disorganized? they don't help people other than synths very much? There's no real flaw to their ideology they're just generic good guys like the brotherhood of steel from fallout 3. Then you have the brotherhood of fallout 4 who make the argument ""synths can be dangerous therefore they should be destroyed"" which is absurd because people can be dangerous it doesn't mean we ought to wipe out humanity. I don't really know how to empathize with a fanatical cult with no discernable ideology other than technology we don't control bad. Finally there's the institute, I won't go into the replacing synths with people and screwing with the wasteland thing. governments do bad things, there are sometimes good reasons sometimes bad and unfortunately the game doesn't do a great job elaborating as to why they do the things they do. My major issue is they make no sense. Fine they refuse to accept the synths sentience, but clearly the modern versions are malfunctioning often enough that you require an entire dept. devoted to getting them back wasting tons of resources. What tasks could the latest gen synths possibly do that the older ones can't do? To me they don't even seem to justify their cost from a purely cost benefit analysis ignoring the obvious moral qualms of enslaving sentient beings. 

So Tl;dr Fallout 4 makes you pick between generic boring good guys, obvious nazis, or obvious slavers. Where is the moral nuance. how am I supposed to have fun playing like a brainwashed nazi. Maybe its just a me problem but like I said I'd love to have my view changed, maybe I'm missing nuance thanks"

My view has already been changed. There might be more things to add, though (for instance, why bodily autonomy is valued over just about everything else). It’s a complex moral discussion. I encourage you to read through some of the replies, especially the ones containing deltas, so that you’re not repeating what others have already said. Thanks!*

*Edit: Hey everyone, I understand that a contract is a legally enforced agreement where other forms of agreement aren’t. I’m not really concerned with what’s legal and what isn’t, but rather with what’s moral and what isn’t.*

Hi there! Please don’t attack me or accuse me of bad faith or downvote my post. I’m arguing with the best intent. That is, I’m seeking to understand, to clear up some confusion I have.

When you sign a contract, say, to join the military, you’re expected to serve the whole term unless it’s in the military’s best interest for you to separate. If you decide to just leave without permission, it’s called desertion, and you can get jail time for this (please note, I’m from the US).

In a way, signing a contract is giving your consent. However, there are situations where you can withdraw your consent at anytime, and you would be in the right, such as with sex. It would be immoral to continue to have sex with someone who withdraws their consent, and is considered rape. I agree with that. 

Now I understand that signing a military contract and consenting to sex seem like two very different worlds. I’m just trying to examine the differences and see exactly where the line is drawn and how it is determined.

For one, what is considered legal and what is considered moral don’t always align, although we’d usually expect it to. Perhaps one could school me on contractual laws and such, but a piece of paper seems like an arbitrary way to enforce someone to do something against their will. 

If we were to draw the line of consent withdrawal based on signing a document approved by the government, would this be applied to sex as well if such documentation were used with sex in a hypothetical society? I’m not assuming that such a society will ever be the case, although it may be possible in cases of prostitution if that were to be legalized. My point is that I’m just trying to determine where the line is drawn. Does consent withdrawal stop at a piece of paper you signed? If so, then why? It seems like signed contracts are essentially just proof that you agreed to something, whereas giving your word is more difficult to prove unless you were being recorded. Implied consent is even more difficult to prove. But no, I don’t think the matter of being able to prove something is the determinant of where we draw the line. Someone could admit that they agreed to have sex for a certain amount of time and would still be in the right for withdrawing early. I’m not sure what other distinction lies with contracts.

Perhaps it’s not a matter of a contract being in place. Perhaps it’s a matter of what the things are that are being agreed to. We consider sex a higher priority because of bodily autonomy, no? I suppose we could delve into the semantics of what that means, but I’d say that being forced through intense physical training is also a matter of bodily autonomy, and perhaps leads to worse trauma on the body than sex, although this is really a case by case basis.

I don’t think that one should have to continue with sex even though they agreed to it, and I don’t think they should face consequences for it. But going off of this logic, I don’t think someone should have to uphold a document they signed to.

I apologize if this post offends anyone. I also am aware that similar posts get made, so I can understand the frustration. If you do feel frustrated, please refrain from replying until you feel at ease. Again, please understand that I have the best of intentions. I feel like there is a hole in my reasoning somewhere, and I’d like you all to help me find it if that is the case. Please. I’m scared of what this view could lead to, either in regards to consent withdrawal with sex, or with breaking promises. Thank you!

Edit: I understand that a contract is meant to protect both parties from loss. Does this mean that the distinction between a contract and other forms of agreement is based on how significant the loss is? For instance, if one agrees to tea, like here: https://youtu.be/oQbei5JGiT8 If you skip to 1:00 of this video, it talks about how you could make tea for someone who said they want tea but then they could back out after you finished making the tea. In this situation, you have experienced a loss. A loss of time, energy, and money (since you wasted food you paid for). Is the distinction here in that the loss isn’t significant? Is the line drawn based on how significant the loss is?"

Barty Crouch Jr disguised himself as Mad-Eye Moody and secretly helped Harry complete the Tri-Wizard Tournament all so Harry would touch the trophy, which was a portkey, and be transported to meet Voldemort.

So much of this was unnecessary.

Any object can be turned into a portkey.  If he had just asked Harry to stay after class one day and tricked him into picking up some unassuming object, he could have avoided the whole Tournament spectale altogether.

If he didn't want to be implicated, he could have made a portkey out some everyday object Harry was certain to touch at some point like one of his schoolbooks or his broomstick.

The whole Tournament aspect brought unnecessary complexity and a lot of unwanted attention from the other teachers that could have derailed the plan."

I had a consultation at one of these where I was told that I would have some wires attached to me and go to sleep at 9pm. The doctor then said he could tell just by looking at me that I had sleep apnea, so if I didn't want to go on the months-long waiting list, he could just sell me a CPAP machine right there.

First off, who goes to sleep at 9pm? I know I haven't since before I was a teenager. Second, as someone who tosses and turns a lot, having wires attached to me would certainly affect how I slept. With such a radically different set of circumstances, I can't imagine whatever study is done getting any sort of accurate sense of someone's sleep problems. As anyone who's studied psychology can tell you, the more you drastically deviate from natural circumstances for an experiment, the less the results are applicable to the real world.

While not a main issue for the CMV, the CPAP comment was just another red flag. If I were obese, I could see a physician being able to look at me and say I probably have a certain problem (as is the case with snoring), but I'm not even overweight. It seemed like the whole thing was just a scam that made me wonder how many people who went there wound up getting ""diagnosed"" with sleep apnea and sold an expensive solution."

My issue with some people that share that view is that their justification for legal abortion is that pregnant women have a right to bodily autonomy. While I agree that everyone should be able to practice bodily autonomy freely, I think applying this reasoning to justify abortion neglects the fact that the pregnant woman is actively carrying and forming a separate body within her uterus. Yes, that fetus is in her body, but it is an organism of its own, growing and feeding from the woman’s nutrients. Therefore, claiming that someone has the right to bodily autonomy in order to justify getting an abortion is, simply, flawed. 

I think you can certainly justify legal abortion via a different perspective. 

Example: “I believe abortion should be easily accessible because it is not my place to tell someone else what is or is not moral in that respect.”

Edit: I would like to clarify that I believe that victims of rape or people who may be put in danger due to pregnancy have valid reasoning of their own and should be able to get an abortion if they so desire.

Edit 2: I wanna call attention to the comment thread started by u/NotMyBestMistake . They made a great point about ongoing consent and how that principle can be applied to pregnancy that altered my view. I’ll be going through and awarding deltas to users who have made similar points.

Last edit: 

I wanna specifically recognize everyone that earned deltas. You all made great points about (or adjacent to) the principle of ongoing consent. I apologize if I missed anyone who made a similar point. I’m sorry, as I don’t have time to reply to all of you with a unique, sincere response, so I’ll address you all as a group. 

I never considered ongoing consent as a factor during pregnancy. Before this post, I felt that in the same way that one cannot press charges for rape because they wish they hadn’t given consent to sex after the fact, and that the same should apply after a person becomes pregnant. I thought that it didn’t make sense to get an abortion based on bodily autonomy since they already consented once to the possibility of a fetus forming after sex. But I failed to consider the principle of ongoing consent. I now see that this can apply to pregnancy as well as sex. Thanks to all of you for participating and making great arguments."

1. A capitalist economy.
2. Democracy with decent safeguards.
3. A large public sector supplying public goods.
4. A good social safety net.

Social democracy is perhaps most famously championed by the Norse countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden. Finnland) but exists to various degrees in much of Europe.

My claim is that _social democracy is the best social model that has been shown to work on a large scale_ (i.e., a society of many millions of people), in the sense that it provides the best quality of life for the least fortunate members of society at a very reasonable cost for the more fortunate.

Important disclaimers:

* A. I do not claim that social democracy is the best social model _possible_. I do not think it is, but I don't know what is.
* B. I do not claim that social democracy is the best social model that has been shown to work on _any scale_. There may be other forms of society that work better on a small scale.
* C. I do not claim that every society would be better off if they adopted social democracy tomorrow. But I do claim that every large society would be better off in the long run if they gradually transitioned towards social democracy. As I see it, a well-functioning social democracy has some prerequisites, including a high level of social trust and a low level of corruption.

The only exception I can think of is the _environmental aspect_. Social democratic countries perform better than _some_ on environmental issues, but social democracies tend to have a high level of consumption which leads to a large environmental footprint."

But that idea is not at all plausible, for two key reasons (hardware and software):

1. A computer is just bunch of on/off switches strung together. Unless your singularity doomsday theory involves something supernatural like a fairy or magic beans, I don't know how you think we're going to turn anyone's MacBook Pro into a real boy. A computer is just a hunk of metal, glass and plastic. It can't have wants or needs.
2. The idea of software developers creating a working digital simulation of human consciousness is as far-fetched as two guys building a time machine in their garage. We can't create a simulation of something we don't understand. Scholars have been trying to understand consciousness for millennia, and they're still debating whether it's even real. Our subconscious could be feeding us a script that we falsely interpret as our conscious mind making impromptu decisions.

The AI singularity isn't science. It's movies. It's HAL 9000. It's Skynet. It's Agent Smith. It's a made-up thing for science fiction purposes that was so intriguing to people that they started accepting it as plausible. The idea spread across the culture like some sort of techo-folklore.

No rational person goes around thinking a DeLorean could really be made to travel through time. Why do so many people think computers can become sentient? Is it marketing hype? Is it because ""tech genius"" Elon Musk believes in it? Or is it because they all watched the same movies as kids and it's a fun idea to talk about and debate?

I don't know the answer. I'm not a psychologist. My only goal here is to convince people that a robot revolution is nothing to worry about. We're nowhere near advanced enough to design a working representation of our minds. We still have fundamental, seemingly unanswerable questions about how our minds function.

I'm not disparaging the neuroscience community -- they are true heroes and did not start this nonsense about the AI singularity. The brain is insanely complex and mysterious. It takes smart and dedicated people to even attempt to understand it. I think those neuroscientists would agree that they are many lifetimes away from developing a complete set of blueprints for generating consciousness. It's not something anyone alive today needs to be afraid of.

EDIT: I should have acknowledged that machines could harm us simply by following their programming without any sort of free will. I thought that would be taken as a given, but it's my fault for not saying it.

UPDATE: It's been explained to me that machine sentience isn't essential to achieving a singularity. I now understand that a singularity is more plausible than the Hollywood scenarios I referenced in my argument. "

Reparations has been a popular term lately in North America, marketed as some new enlightened social program. But I claim that, once again, it is nothing more than another attempt by the poor class to get free money. In other words, reparations are just more welfare/handouts, but disguised as a new name. I should note that usually all poor people are the same regardless of background, but reparations in particular are tied to minorities such as former black slaves or pre-colonials. 

First, reparations are marketed as making up for a wrong such as the aforementioned slavery or colonialism. But these are just talking points. All reparations use individual money as the only worthy “making up” compensation for that wrong, they don’t seem to care about government apologies or collectivist programs. That alone should bring up red flags. It’s very typical of poor people to immediately make their intentions clear that they want cash (kinda like how a homeless asks for money and not shelter). Handouts are defined as giving free money to the needy and beggers of society. If it looks like a handout…you know the rest.

Second is that reparations are always poor groups that blame someone else for their problems. Just looking into the social status of former slaves in America, or the native Canadian groups talking on the news, they are indeed not rich. Such things happened century ago, yet here they are using it as an excuse for their modern hardships. This is classic poor people tactics, always making up excuses for their poor financial decisions. 

Lastly, reparations are entirely for needy/beggers. You don’t see rich people asking for them, you don’t see the productive working class asking for them. It’s always the poor that are the loudest. And by definition welfare is exactly that, free money for the poor. Reparations are the same. Being wronged can happen to everyone (rich or poor), but reparations clearly focus only the later.

Therefore, I’ve made my point. Reparations are just poor people asking, yet again, for free money. Now change my view and show me that is not the case!

EDIT: oh yes how could I forget my favorite argument, the language equivocation tactic. Go to any article that talks about reparations. Replace the word reparation with handout every time. Does the meaning of the sentence change in any significant way? Or does it remain legible? For anyone who does this test honestly…you’ll see my point lol"

People are complaining about the price of everything. Homelessness, drugs, mental health problems are rampant.

Yet still, Americans will always find some way to celebrate the Big 3 Holidays of the year. So here's what should happen.

Christmas Eve should stay the same.

Christmas and Thanksgiving should be combined into one that takes place on December 25. People can eat turkey that day too.

NYE and Halloween should be combined into one (Halloween and Christmas together might upset some). Not that many people go to the Ball Drop anyway, and adults don't generally wear masks and trick-or-treat. October and December are both cold. The adults that aren't partying or whatever can still have something to do so they don't feel left out. Plus kids don't generally go to NYE parties (I assume).

Furthermore, to make up for the lack of October and November holidays, here's what should happen.

Election Day should be a holiday in early November, and you should get the day off for it.

Black Friday should be a holiday, and again you should get the day off. Let's be honest, most people shop online anyway, and it seems retail is dying. BF as a holiday will hearken back to days before the recession, pandemic, etc. and hopefully give people a much needed rest day."

That implies nobody can be rich and you might need to exploit others to be richer.

But, because in the current world we live in, reward are not in proportion to value contributed and as such, it would be almost impossible for everyone contributing equally into the society in same manner to have the same value of wealth. This is due to the simple fact that, some are getting rich at the expense of others.

Take an example of a business that employs workers. The owner of the business typically gets the largest share of profits from the business which does not always commensurate with 'value' of work done. Furthermore, the workers get paid according to their levels which also might not commensurate with their contribution to the company in terms 'value' of work done. Worker A, who's getting higher pay in relation to worker B, assuming both workers contribute the same value of work to the business growth, is getting rich at the expense of worker B.

Edit: I can see some people are getting my argument wrong. While I understand that real value of work might be difficult to determine, it's not totally impossible. I believe work to be an asset which should equally have its own value. If the value of work an individual contributes to the society doesn't justify their high pay, then they are, somehow, getting rich off others."

Because of the skyline in New York, Spiderman is able to swing from heights safely, but it's only because there's so many tall buildings in New York. 

Spiderman wouldn't be able to work if he was say in my city (won't say where for privacy reasons but the tallest building in the city is I believe has 14 floors and because of a certain bylaw no building is allowed to be taller than this one) because the buildings simply are not tall enough to properly swing.

I'm a diehard baseball fan and the philosophy of baseball makes sense to me - no ties, games continue until someone wins. The outcome is decided by the same skills/situation that governs the rest of the game.

From what I can tell the penalty kickoff thing is some weird artificial thing that has nothing to do with the rest of the game. Completely different game situation, skill set, etc. are required.   


There has got to be a better way to decide games - just keep playing in 10 minute increments until someone wins? I know soccer is more physically demanding than baseball...but c'mon there has to be a better way. It's boring and weird and anticlimactic. It's essential just flipping a coin to see who wins. "

The definition of child abuse is extremely recent in human history. Until the 19th century, people cared very little about the welfare of children, and child abuse was generally tolerated and even encouraged in some cases as long as it did not cause death. 

And it wasn't until the mid-20th century that real child abuse laws and services were put in place, and only in Western countries. In the rest of the world, people continue to ignore and tolerate child abuse (even in parts of the United States) because it is something they have experienced themselves, or simply out of disinterest in the subject, or for monetary reasons (I include here any type of abuse, whether physical, sexual or psychological) but it is the cause of the major ills of this planet. 

The majority of criminals were abused when they were young. The majority of people addicted to drugs, alcohol and other substances were also abused, as were people with mental problems. 

There is a reason why countries where child protection is a priority and considered very important are very pacifist countries and countries with very high rates of violence and crime are strangely very brutal and violent in the way they treat children and offer them little or no protection. 

Many people don't realize how crappy their childhood was and live in a kind of denial where they idolize their abusers. They don't realize how much damage it does to their lives.

I think that the majority of crimes in the world would be drastically decreased if the whole world apply laws and maximum protection towards children but i know it's Utopia."

- you can provide information that would cause me to question the effectiveness of specific tech training and apprenticeships over a university education.
- you can show me how a college diploma, after considering cost and potential alternatives, is a better metric for employment discrimination than ability testing.

the original colleges were essentially clubs that would pay renowned guests to lecture the group or provide a series of lectures. the students owned the lecture hall, chose the guests, and paid the fees directly to the guests. 

the clubs elected managers to manage the property and pay the guest lecturers and take the club fees. this club/college management eventually became conflated with the college itself. the club membership became reduced to the role of mere student. 

soon, the clubs became corporately owned by investors that looked to profit from the organization and appoint their own leaders separately from the student body. at that point, the students were reduced to the role of customers and the lecturers became employees seeking tenure (control and permanent positions). 

the student bodies eventually developed clubs separate from the college including a rowing club at yale and then harvard. the separate clubs began competing with each other annually, these sports clubs gained popularity and other sports clubs began to emerge. eventually, the colleges integrated the clubs to profit from them. many students now go to colleges just to be members of these college sports programs. many of these sports programs only generate revenue in the form of increased tuition and demand for college membership. this increases the cost of higher learning.

that all being said, you do actually have the option to enroll in colleges that don't have sports teams, that teach trades. these are known today as technical colleges. these colleges are very often stigmatized as are the students.

beyond that you can, as easily as the original colleges, form a club with like-minded individuals to host guest lecturers. but that kind of club seems redundant because of youtube where you can watch, in your pajamas, the lectures of thousands of great minds at any time, even repeatedly. before youtube, you could still buy their books to read their lectures at your leisure.

today, the purpose of college is varied but they are largely superfluous. the only reason employers look for a college education is because the use of i.q tests for discrimination in employment is illegal. so, instead, you get to pay tens of thousands of dollars over 2 to 6 years to profit-earning colleges to maintain massive infrastructure, tons of bureaucracy, and sports teams in order to be considered for elite jobs.

there is some room for technology institutions that just teach how to perform advanced work like surgery and engineering and provide certifications of that advanced training. however, it would be easier for those businesses to provide those training and education services directly, if only in the form of apprenticeships.

one thing is certain, there is no good reason students of these institutions of higher learning should have to pay for sports programs. another thing that seems obvious to me is that these institutions should specialize in one kind of technology and not be a place of general education. your general education should be complete before entering these institutions."

The human, neigh, the conscious experience can be boiled down to a wave, shifting between pleasure and suffering. There are varying levels of each and many complex emotions that make up each, but ultimately everything is a net positive or a net negative.

Most people would probably say that a good life is one with a net positive. One where most experiences a person acquires are pleasant. That, of course, is a bunch of objectively misguided copage.

None of that will remain after you’re dead, so no ratio of suffering to pleasure will make any sort of difference in the end. The only logical solution is to “rip the bandaid off,” so to speak. An existence consisting of good and bad is ultimately bad, as it takes significantly more effort as opposed to a nonexistence of neither good nor bad which would be neutral. Furthermore, to exist as evolution or society intended, to reproduce, is to perpetuate the cycle of dragging others down with us. Like a drowning person pulling others down with them.

In the end, all experience will be erased when the consciousness ceases. At this point it will make no difference what said consciousness experienced in life, nor what it contributed to others as they too will cease eventually. There will always come a point at which an event (or person in this case) becomes inconsequential. Like rain to a river. Each drop being a single, indistinguishable but still independent person, until they contact the river and disappear forever. So why should an individual rain drop put in the effort? To slave away for decades, experiencing fear, pain, and despair beyond anything a nonexistent being (that being one that doesn’t exist) could possibly imagine… just to end up right back where it started. Nonexistent.

Could you really say that if you were offered the chance to exist, that you would take it? Of course we can’t imagine not existing, so let’s say you feel nothing. No boredom, or joy, or pain. Just peace and melancholy. And then you have the thought to enter a new type of existence. Like a dream but you’ve never dreamt and you’re guaranteed not to remember any of it when you awake. Under what thought process could you possibly say yes?

An experiment found that if you give a rat a button that releases dopamine in its brain, it will press the button until it dies. The rat forgoes hunger, sleep, and sociability to press the pleasure button until it starves. Such is the nature of animals. Pleasure exists to incentivize things that keep us alive, eating, sleeping, banging. And fear keeps us from letting ourselves die. Evolution created these abstract, biological constructs because otherwise nothing would bother to survive. There’s no logical incentive to continue existing and so without an incomprehensible force to tether us here, everyone would just let themselves die and life as a whole would cease to exist. Of course, if that had happened, we wouldn’t be here. So you could say that life only exists because it said so.

Humans are defined by our ability to think logically (despite how rarely the general populace does) and it is that logical side that demands justification to exist. Of course there is none, but the animal brain doesn’t like that. And so people conjure meaningless half animal, half don’t think about it, answers. Things like finding a purpose, or to increase personal capitol, or to make a change in the world. All answers are equally hollow and inconsequential. In truth, these are all just goals to distract us from the undeniable truth of this world. That being that we’re all here because our parents are literal primates. Evolution came by and said “hey, you see that hypothetical person up there? I’ll make your pp feel good if you drag them down into this literal hell.” And our parents said “ooga booga, me like pp.”

And then of course, somehow normies rationalize suicide as being selfish. Merely correcting the universal error of your existence is considered morally repugnant. Of course they only believe that because they don’t/can’t rationalize the mindset. They can’t understand it so they reject it. In truth, it’s among the least selfish options for an objective mind, although you could argue that it is selfish for the opposite reason. True ethicality would dictate that you help as many people as possible overcome their own fear of death, while ending all of their trivial normie problems for them. But let’s not go into that. In truth, what is truly selfish is to expect someone to toil away for eighty some years, just to maintain someone else’s illusion of a perfect world where everyone is as blissfully ignorant as they are. To shut up and get back to work so that mommy doesn’t have to feel guilty about the things she’s done. It’s like kidnapping a person, bringing them to a club, and demanding that they dance so you don’t feel like they’re having a bad time.

Please prove me wrong."

&amp;#x200B;

The world will probably reach \~10billion people by 2050.

At the same time, we're going to see diminishing agricultural yield because of climate collapse, and a contraction of the job market due to advanced AI.

There's very little doubt about any of this (could be less than 10 billion)

&amp;#x200B;

There's basically no-one talking about ethical population control besides voluntary (doesn't work) or punitive in the case of China's OCP.

&amp;#x200B;

This is simply not sustainable. The earth just can't support it. The stakes could not be higher; it will literally kill us all.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I get it; it's not ethical to restrict reproductive rights to people who already won the birth lottery by having wealth and power.  I'd be all for the perfect socialist revolution/green power revolution, but I just don't see it happening in time.

And without that, it's a bit of a trolly problem, no? It's either restrict people from having babies, or everyone suffers and dies. As long as we keep giving people just enough to survive and reproduce, there's no 'natural population control' in effect.

The other way to do it would be a lottery, I suppose, but then who raises kids? Kids have generally better outcomes when provided with resources and stability."

**properly:** the way it was intended.*In this context, reading the bible the way it was intended.*

========

This one is particularly difficult for me. I talk to Hebrew Israelites, Christians, Aethists and as many that disagree with me there are many that agree with me. Still, wtf.... I don't understand how this is a disagreeable idea.

Redditors, please break my brain. I just don't understand how one can think that when they read the bible in english that they are understanding the concepts the same way it was recorded in hebrew, aramaic and greek. Even the composition of language in hebrew is different than the composition of language in English.

I myself believe that everyone who picks up the bible in english are layers and layers deep away from the understanding of the hebraic concepts, and therefore if they happen to believe in God, they are layers and layers away from understanding the mechanisms of God. Hell, I'll even go as far as to say they are at risk of learning something that will be MUCH more difficult to unlearn, because from my experience, the adult brain has extreme difficulty unconstructing constructs in order to see something differently.

Change my view here folks: You cannot read the bible properly if you are not reading it in hebrew and greek.

==============

Edit: I will say, so far it seems folks who study language and communication science can help me undo this notion than I have. I get that people are okay with reading what they have - but it's baffling for me to think that one feels they can have the same amount of substance reading in english that they would get in greek. That **there is no difference** (*maybe that's what I'm failing to express in the title - some folks believe* ***there is no difference in quality***)"

I think it is grade A hypocrisy for black americans to say that white people invented cancel culture and lambast them for it. I distinctly remember black people having their own version of cancel culture. The phrase was, ""you lost your ""black card"" or ""g-pass"". It usually came after a black person did something that was deemed ""too white"" or ""too proper"". Examples include words that have more than three syllables or having an opinion critical of another black person.

For the sentiment that it was all in jest or ""we weren't serious"", my response is that the humor evaporates after the fifth or tenth mention of your supposed joke. After that, it becomes a barbaric rant aimed at ostracizing you from your environment.

I'm not supporting, encouraging, or even tolerating cancel culture. I think it's become trash for multiple reasons. I just think it's rich that black twitter and other notable black individuals collectively jump on this bandwagon of admonishing people for cancel culture like they don't partake themselves."

Black is death, black is scary, black is bad.

There’s been a particulate type of damage done with black Americans because we are taught this language (English) at such a young age that we’ve normalize the use of what we identify with (Black) with the adjective of sorrow, death, despair, etc.

It isn’t until one uses a language that doesn’t have black associated with bad that one can stop believing black is bad, and therefore stop hating black as a default survival mechanism (afraid of the night, afraid of the black skin, afraid of our parents and ourselves).

But, when challenged on this in an argument, I found it very hard to find some very crucial information necessary to back up my point. This missing information includes:

* Who the top climate scientists are.
* What is it that distinguishes a top climate science expert from a scientist without as much expertise. Basically, I want to know what the criteria is for deciding who is extremely competent in the field of climate science and who isn't because there are people that claim to be climate experts who say human activity is not the main driver of climate change.
* What climate change research studies in the last decade are regarded as the most important in this field by experts and why they are regarded this way (and by this I mean actual research studies demonstrating human activity as the principal driver of climate change and not just the reports by political organizations calling for action that happen to include references to research).
* If there are any accomplished climate scientists that don't take on the role of political activists but are only focused on putting out the best, most accurate research.
* When a position in science becomes considered the scientific consensus and who decides once this threshold is crossed.
* Whether or not the top climate scientists believe there is a consensus on this issue.

By not making this information easy to find (I couldn't find it even after searching), the scientific community is making it nearly impossible for laypeople without expertise in this field to change the minds of those that are skeptical that climate change is man-made. As I said already, I believe in man-made climate change, but important information like this not being readily available has even me confused.

**Edit:** A lot of people replying seem to think this is a CMV on climate change being man-made. It isn't. My position is that the SPECIFIC information outlined in my bullet points is not being easily available is partly driving climate change skepticism. For instance, I am aware that there are lists of people considered top climate scientists but there is usually no selection criteria listed when it comes to why those scientists made the cut while others did not. Or, when it comes to the scientific consensus, I asked about information regarding ""when a position in science becomes considered the scientific consensus and who decides once this threshold is crossed"" and not just ""is there a consensus?"" because there are plenty of articles claiming there is a consensus but also plenty of articles claiming those articles are false.

No justice in the moden age has ever been swayed by oral argument.,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zezgyy/cmv_oral_argument_in_the_scotus_is_pointless_its/,changemyview,"Preliminary:  I have presented oral arguments before my state appellate court and one federal circuit court. I clerked for a federal district judge.  I have been told by an appellate clerk that my oral argument swayed his judge to my side.  So, I'm not generally against oral arguments, just oral arguments at the SCOTUS. 

The purpose of oral argument is two-fold.  It gives the judges an opportunity to ask questions of the litigants and it let's the litigants use their oratorical and rhetorical skill to present a compelling argument that otherwise would be lost from just the briefs.

By the time the case gets to to oral argument before the SCOTUS, there are no questions left to be answered.  Everything has been briefed at various stages of litigation. There are thousands of pages of transcripts, depositions, briefs, reply briefs, etc.  There are multiple lower court opinions, amicus briefs, etc. 

 The issues are extremely narrow.  The record is enormous. Years have gone by to the point where the litigants themselves no longer matter and all that does matter is the very narrow legal issue before the court.  

When have you heard a truly compelling SCOTUS oral argument?  When have you heard an empassioned plea for justice, or to right a wrong?  It doesn't happen.  The lawyers who make their living by convincing juries to agree with them aren't the same lawyers who argue before the Supreme Court.  SC oral arguments are over-reheared recitations of the legal briefs.  

To the extent that the judges ask questions, it's really just to satisfy their own narcissism.  They're just creating theater for the masses to show that this is actually a process that matters. 

In fact SC cases are decided in the chambers of the justices.  To the extent that the issues aren't decided directly by political ideology, they're decided through argument and negotiation among the judges and their clerks.

The oral arguments are irrelevant.


Edit: my view has been changed.  The SCOTUS can be influenced by oral argument and use it to engage in fact-finding outside of the record."

This is my opinion based mainly, on my observations. 


1. I do believe in ADHD, that is not what this post is at all. I'm aware it is due to an irregulation of dopamine and norepinephrine. There have been actual brain scans showing the difference between normal brains and ADHD brain, in white matter connectivity and even size.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3016271/ 


2. The guardian cites that between 2007 and 2016, there was a 127% increase in ADHD diagnoses.


3. Big pharma like to sell drugs. I don't think a source is necessary for this point.


I believe that phones shortening our attention spans along with an increased acceptance of mental illness and an increased acceptance of being medicated, people have began to ""want"" to be diagnosed with ADHD. Once you're diagnosed, you essentially get a magic pill to help you study.  



I think it's extremely unhealthy, you can have symptoms of ADHD trained into you because you have never learnt how to concentrate. I think alot of people think they're just meant to be able to concentrate straight off when in fact, it's like a muscle that you train. I also think there could be cases where people essentially will themselves to have it because they aren't able to keep up with piers or have a view of themselves that doesn't match their reality. Basically, they're not smart and don't want to accept it.

In the journal of neurodevelopmental disorders: https://jneurodevdisorders.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s11689-020-9307-8



States that people with high IQs have low symptoms of ADHD. They did use high versus average IQs here but I'll take it as they have identified a trend. I don't think it has been long enough to identify a real trend since the spike in diagnoses. Also, you can claim that people with ADHD just do worse on IQ tests because they have ADHD. Its a roundabout.



I think that it is likely also pushed as it doesn't hurt the pockets of the people selling the pills. We all know they are not ethical and have done worse in the past.



Finally, I want to say that this doesn't apply to everyone, obviously. I know people personally who I do and don't think have ADHD. I know people who have gone to a specific doctor to get diagnosed. I think the whole thing is hugely unethical, unfair to people who actually suffer with ADHD and damaging to people who don't because they are taking stimulants unnecessarily.



Edit: I would like to add that there has been an increase in Autism diagnosis of 67% since 2000. I am aware that people have also gotten better at diagnosing the condition but it still does not add up."
1,2022-12-07,CMV: Creating a child is like gambling with someone else's money and without their consent.,u/MyNameIsNonYaBizniz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zf1hz0/cmv_creating_a_child_is_like_gambling_with/,changemyview,"So this analogy was presented to me by antinatalists and I am pretty convinced by its logic. 

But something feels off and I couldnt put my finger on it. 

According to modern moral intuition, it is usually wrong to violate someone's consent, especially when it comes with unnecessary risks that they didnt agree to nor needed, correct? If you gamble with someone else's money, even if you have 90% chance of winning and giving them a large reward, it is still morally wrong because you didnt ask them for permission, correct? If you lose the money due to 10% bad luck, then you would cause them a lot of harm, but the point remains the same, you DIDNT ask for permission, its a clear cut violation of basic morality. 

So, creating a child comes with exactly the same condition, some may even say with worse conditions, because its usually not 90/10 for most people, it could be as low as 50/50 or worse, lol. The child cannot give or revoke their permission for being created, so its basically the same as gambling with someone else's entire life, hoping you would win but the risk of a terrible life is always there. 

So if its morally wrong to gamble with someone else's money without their consent, it should be morally wrong to create a child without their consent as well, right? I dont see how we can get around this moral intuition? 

Some would say since children dont exist before they were created, thus consent doesnt matter, but that's ridiculous, because they WILL exist and the unconsented risks are real, this is just a pointless chicken or egg first strawman. 

If you say its ok to violate consent since you are trying to give the child a ""good"" life (that they didnt ask for), then would it be ok to gamble with someone else's money if I'm trying to make him rich? lol"

Secondly is the risk to others. Body retrieval from caves underwater is not easy. People like David Shaw died doing precisely this, and he was a highly skilled diver with much experience. I would never want someone to die or even put themselves at massive risk just to find my body.

I just dont see the issue?

A robot is a tool, being controlled by a human. It is just like a gun. If the police can use guns to kill people, how are robots going to be different? If anything, they might be safer because police have a horrible track record of shooting first and asking questions later, most likely because they are scared of being shot. At least a cop operating a robot with a bomb is going to be less scared of getting hurt, which should lead to LESS, not MORE police killings.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: So, I've awarded delta. I can see some legitimate concerns with encouraging the lethal solution when less lethal means exist.

However, I am a little flabbergasted by the number of people who are convinced that police murder people out of a wanton and evil desire to just see people die? I completely agree that police killing people is a problem, but I generally attribute the vast majority of it to a poor incentive scheme. "

Let me explain this:

I'm from a small thrid-world country with various economic and social issue. A major one being emmirgation (legal and illegal). The population is young and most are either jobless or work in non-official unstable jobs.

The thing is this situation is a vicious circle. One of the main reasons why work conditions aren't good enough is because most qualified workers leave for developed countries. Thus making the remaining ones accepting low pays. And now leaving the country ""for better life conditions"" it becoming a full blown trend. (Anecodtal fact: I've never met someone not telling me they're willing/planning/thinking of leaving the country. Some even have been offered similar pays as in developed countries and refused. The arguments are always ""life is better on the other side"").

Usually in this situation governments think they're doing a good job because when some of the migrants come back in the mid-term they bring foreign currencies and invest in projects and buy land.

But I beleive the returns are petty compared to the returns you could get from a well educated and employed local population. Also this trend contributes to increasing the gap between economic classes. Making migrants come back with large sacks of foreign currencies without paying any taxes.

So I beleive a set of restrictions should be applied to restrict migrants that come back. Like allowing them to invest, create projects, but land etc only after spendin a long enough period of time after coming back. Or pay a tax to be able to do so. That would discourage the new ones from leaving and the ""not so motivated to come back"" old ones to not come back.

What I see is the total opposite: banks ofc first players in the game offer low interest rate mortgages to people that live abroad, so they can easily build houses etc. The conditions to get a mortgage are ridiculous compared to conditions for locals."

To describe it breifly, it seems that everywhere I go, everywhere I look, there are always people being extremely hostile and accusing others of being certain things when to me it seems that there is nothing that justifies that level of reaction. If it was limited to a couple small instances, I could dismiss it as just a loud minority, but it happens so much that it really feels like at least 50% of everyone is like this.
           
Its one thing to respond with hostility when someone else says or does something that is clearly malicious, bigoted, etc.... but the cases that bother me are not that at all. A lot of the times the so called ""Bigot"", ""Coward"", ""Ignorant person"" etc is just a normal person trying to ask a genuine question or hold a normal conversation.
         
For example, I saw someone ask for advice on how to handle their roommate who was mistreating their cat, and I could tell that OP was genuinely trying to get help, and one of the top comments was someone accusing OP of neglect because they didnt immediately go in fire and brimstone on their roomate. It just feels so needless and aggressive, and by virtue of it being one of the top comments it is clearly a popular view.
                 
Another time, I saw a thread made in response to ab image where a woman on twitter says ""90% of women are pretty and 90% of men are ugly. Sorry."" and a guy responds with ""We are both in the 10%""
          
Seems pretty ok so far. The woman made a baseless and rude claim so someone responded with disapproval. The comments in the thread, though... were filled with people trying to genuinely justify what the woman said with stuff like ""Yeah most men are pigs who dont clean themselves etc etc"" which then sparks more arguments which then turned the thread into a hellhole. I saw that in the morning and it just left me feeling quite dejected for the rest of the day.
                
I know that the stories Im giving are a bit anecdotal, but I hope it gives you a clearer idea of what Im bothered by. These are just recent examples of a trend that I have been seeing for as long as I have had the internet. I just... dont really understand why everyone is so aggressive and hostile. Maybe I am still young and kinda naive (Just turned 19) but it just really bothers me and honestly makes me hesitant to tell people about my worldviews or anything even remotely controversial out of fear that I will become the next punching bag.
          
Besides that, seeing all these heated arguments spring up where I think stuff could have easily been discussed normally or even not needed to be talked about at all really bothers me. I dunno why, I know it has nothing to do with me, but seeing it still makes me feel so... sad?
             
If this really is just how people are, thats alright. I'd be quite dejected and perhaps lose some of my faith in humanity, but I can still live normally. I'd just be very selective with who I talk and open up to. But I came here in hopes that someone older and more mature than me can raise a counter to this conclusion that has formed in my head. I dont want to believe that the average person is aggressive and accusatory to anyone who dosent say yes to their every word."

I think he is the best scorer in the game is because of the numbers. When it comes to the nba it is hard to compare different players from different eras but, the closes way we can see who is at the top from different eras is the numbers and numbers don’t lie. KD for the most part has consistently put up great numbers trough his nba career averaging 25&lt; points a game while sharing the rock with his other teammates. You may be saying oh this era is soft af and players are getting calls they would not be getting 20 or more years ago. And you are right this era is soft but kd only averages 6.5 free throws a game which is not a really really high amount. Even after the league made the anti Durant rule where you can’t hook your arm around the other players arm to draw a foul he has still been a top score in all the years he has played in unlike James Harden who’s ppg slowed down after the league added the rule where it made it harder for players to get to the line. KD’s is unquestionably one of the most unique top scores of all time because of his unicorn type play which makes him so great. Sure there were great scores like Lewis Alcindor (Kareem), MJ, Kobe and many more players who each made a name for the self’s dropping 30 on peoples heads every night.

Studies show that Black American households have generational wealth amounting to, on average, less than $30,000. White American households have, on average, around $150,000 in generational wealth.

To me there are two possible explanations for this: one is that external factors (mainly both explicit and systemic racism) have prevented Black households from gaining wealth equivalency with white households. The other is that Black households are unwilling or unable to gain wealth due to their own inadequacies, which is of course a blatantly racist take. 

Make arguments as you will, but it seems obvious to me that if two groups have the same levels of intelligence and ambition, but one group experiences a vastly higher degree of roadblocks (black codes, Jim Crow laws, redlining, etc.) to their ambitions, you would expect that group to naturally fall behind. 

Since black households still fall behind on economic metrics, unless you subscribe to racist ideology, you have to admit that black households still feel the effects of these roadblocks. Therefore, if we want these households to truly achieve economic parity, and we truly want an equitable society, those of us who have benefited from a lack of these same systemic roadblocks are responsible for directly repaying those who have been harmed."
0,2022-12-08,CMV: If we don't get to decide if someone dies it's also morally wrong to decide to give birth,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zfqnjs/cmv_if_we_dont_get_to_decide_if_someone_dies_its/,changemyview,"Most people would agree that it is wrong to kill someone because ""you don't have the right to decide whether that person lives or dies"" / ""who are we to take a human life"" / ""who are we to decide"".

Based on this, I believe is as wrong to conceive a life.   
Parents decide that a person will be born to this world and then make that child live by their rules as well as society's. We are forced into the world and don't have a say in it. Most of the times we are actually ""expected"" a lot from. 

How is this not wrong? I would argue that you have to agree that both are morally equal, whether wrong or not wrong.

DISCLAIMER: Answer to the question ""if you don't want to live why don't you just kill youself (people who are killed do not have this type of choice)"":  
Unfortunately it is not that simple because you are wired to not die. You are human, your instinct is to keep yourself alive, so it's very very very hard to kill yourself even if you want to. Also there is all the blame and guilt about how everyone around you will be utterly sad that you kill youself and that is one of the examples of the mental jail you are put into."

783,2022-12-08,CMV: Cultural Appropriation as in Wearing clothes/accessories of minority cultures outside of their intended purpose is not bad enough to limit the freedom to wear what you want,u/Alphabethur,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zfvon0/cmv_cultural_appropriation_as_in_wearing/,changemyview,"This is coming from a member of the most privileged group of people in the world: a straight white cisgender male, 21 years old.

After having read a lot about cultural appropriation I understand that e.g. wearing a native american headdress as a festival accessory is considered a bad and offensive thing to do. This is because you use an object that is very important and has significant cultural meaning in a completely different way than originally intended.

And plainly, I agree. However, and this is my hot take, as long as you are not actively mocking the affected culture by e.g. performing/saying/acting stereotypical things, I think that is not bad enough to justify the restriction towards your freedom to wear what you want.

I am german. If someone would go around wearing leather pants and a checkered shirt, holding a jug of beer in one hand and a bratwurst in a bun in the other, and being overly drunk and annoying, i couldn't care less. In my opinion people can wear whatever they want (with restrictions on racism, fascism etc., which already exist in society).

Now maybe that is just because german culture isn't very important to me. A Person originating from the orient may hold their culture in high regards, and therefore see someone wearing the stereotypical disney belly dancer outfit as very much offensive. I am aware that it alienates minorities from their own culture, which is of course a bad thing. Maybe, it's just the perspective I am missing.

Staying with the example of the disney belly dancer outfit, this is a very good example for the mixing of cultures. Disney picks up on the works of Orientalism and creates their own view of this outfit. Now I only speak of the outfit, not the movie and the actions performed in that movie associated with it.  
I love mixing of cultures. It creates interesting new things to see, explore and talk about. It gives people more artistic freedom. It's like adding a whole new palette of colors to a painters disposal. And it's the same with pieces of clothing and accessories. Because of this reason alone, offending a minority is justified. of course, the same goes the other way around, from minorities including majorities culture outside of it's originally intended purpose.

Now please try your best to rid me of that opinion, I sometimes have the feeling this whole viewpoint is very egotistic, and even racist.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My point being, for the sake of creativity and progression of human culture, wearing clothes/accessories of minority cultures outside of their intended purpose is justified. Not good, in fact a bad thing, but not bad enough to be a reason to infringe your creativity."

Despite positive votes for all other European countries, this result will fuel euroscepticism in these countries where up until recently EU was viewed in a very positive way.

I know this is a complex issue, perhaps way too complicated for a simpleton like me to understand. For example, as far as I understand , Netherlands veto was against Bulgaria but since the vote was for the package Ro+Bg, Netherlands voted against.

One thing that truly disapoints me is the lack of coherent argument from Austria , which runs along the lines of "" there's a big problem with immigration, and we're against further expansion of Schengen area, therefore we'll vote against the accession of Romania and Bulgaria"".
Well if that is the case, why have they voted for the accession of Croatia? Shouldn't they have a firm stance against the Croatia too? Even more so I would argue since it is known from official data from Frontex and EU reports that there are serious issues with immigration trough Croatia, the same reports stating that Romania and Bulgaria have far less problems in this matter.

Considering all the above, and the fact that Romania has also voted positively for Croatia to join in this JAI meeting, and the fact that Romania and Bulgaria has applied way before Croatia to Schengen and have met all the conditions and requirements, this will fuel euroscepticism to dangerous levels and has the potential to transform these countries in the near future in the Poland/Hungary 2.0

I am aware that is a subjective view as I am Romanian, and it is somehow an emotional reaction to the recent events, nevertheless, I would like to have my view changed. Change my view."

For example, there are privilege based on income (wealth privilege), race (white privilege), sex (male privilege), physical characteristics (height privilege) and so forth.  Now, some of these (e.g. wealth, looks) are pretty much accepted by the society at large and is not controversial.  However, some others (e.g. race-based, sex-based) are controversial and leads to heated arguments.  

For this CMV, I just accept that there are certain privileges for being white and (to a lesser extent) being male in the United States and some of the other countries.  It is NOT part of my CMV to dispute this as for this particular discussion, I think it is off-topic.  However, even if you grant that these privileges do exist, wealth is such a dominant factor when it comes to one's status in life that a poor white person will feel (and perhaps rightly, which is part of my CMV) insulted if his/her white privilege is brought up as something that he/she should feel deeply gratified by.   ""At least you are white"" does little to someone who is struggling to pay his bills and feed his children.   In general, I feel like it is usually the upper/middle class white people who are admonishing all whites about the importance of white privilege because their wealth gives them leeway to appreciate all privileges.  So it is not surprising that this message will seem tone deaf to the poor."

176,2022-12-08,CMV: Refusing to serve a Christian group because of their beliefs is the same as refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding,u/Ramza_Claus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zg3lzr/cmv_refusing_to_serve_a_christian_group_because/,changemyview,"Okay, CMV, here's the recent news story about a Christian group who wanted to do some type of event at a local bar in Virginia

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/metzger-restaurant-cancels-reservation-for-christian-family-foundation/

The restaurant said they wouldn't serve this group because their group is anti-LGBT and anti-choice, and serving them would make a lot of their staff uncomfortable and possibly unsafe (since some of the staff is LGBT). The group reserved space at the restaurant and had their reservation pulled once the management realized who it was for.

I don't see how this is different than a bakery or photographer or caterer or wedding planner refusing to serve a gay wedding. Religion and sexual orientation are both federally protected classes, so it's illegal to put up a sign that says ""no gays allowed"" or ""we don't serve black or Mexicans here"" or ""No Catholics"". You can't do that as a business. However, as far as I know, that's not what the restaurant did, nor is it what the infamous bakery did with the gay wedding cake.

You see, that bakery would've likely had no problem serving a gay customer if they wanted a cake for their 9 year old's birthday party. Or if a gay man came in and ordered a fancy cake for his parents 30th wedding anniversary. Their objection wasn't against serving a gay man, but against making a specific product that conflicted with their beliefs.

The same is true at the VA restaurant case. That place serves Christians every day and they have no problem with people of any religious tradition. Their problem is that this specific group endorsed political and social ideology that they found abhorrent.

Not that it matters, but I personally am pro-choice and pro-LGBT, having marched in protest supporting these rights and I'm a regular donor to various political groups who support causes like this.

So I guess my point is that if a restaurant in VA can tell Christians they won't serve them because they see their particular ideology as dangerous or harmful to society, then a baker should be allowed to do the same thing. They can't refuse to serve gays, but they can decline to make a specific product if they don't feel comfortable with the product. Like that one Walmart bakery that refused to write ""Happy Birthday Adolph Hitler"" on a little boy's birthday cake (the kids name really is Adolph Hitler).

So CMV. Tell me what I'm missing here."

Let's take three examples that are often cited in the conversation of ""myth of self made billionaires"".

1. Bill Gates - people cite that he comes from a well connected family and his mother play a role in his initial days because of her connections. i mean sure but how does that negate the fact the he literally founded Microsoft, the company that made him a billionaire. his mother's contacts didn't make Microsoft for him, he made it himself. If he was just a weird idiot who's just going to lose money for IBM, the partnership with IBM won't have lasted as long as it did.

2. Jeff Bezos - the classical ""but his friends and family lend him 300k and hence he's not a self made billionaires"". I seriously don't understand where this idea of self made became synonymous with being a dumpster diver making pennies by begging and secretly coding at night on a laptop that's being powered through a borrowed power switch. 

the idea of Amazon was his, the webstore is his and I don't think that most people, even with 300 million dollars can replicate what he did. 

3. Elon Musk - this one is especially hilarious. ""Government made you a billionaire by giving contracts and subsidies"" and ""you're not the founder of Tesla"". it's hilarious because it's like saying that the guy who turned a lemonade stand into a soft drink corporation isn't a founder because he didn't setup the lemonade stand.

also, i don't really think the subsidies were made available with a secret plan of ""let's make Elon a billionaire"". they were given in order to make electric vehicles more accessible and popular. suggesting that they were made to help Elon particularly is like saying the guy who won a 400m race is a cheater because rest of the runners simply didn't bother to run.

also, the myth of self made billionaires is a myth because people like Mark Cuban, Steve Jobs, Evan Speigel, Dhirubhai Ambani, Gautam Adani, Oprah, Rihanna etc exist."

Sure, a kid who bullies another kid will be put on the naughty list and not receive the desired present, but that's a gimme. Anyone could look at that scenario and put the kid on the naughty list, it doesn't make Santa special. What about an adult that robs a bank though? At first look you might put the adult on the naughty list, but what if the adult was doing it to pay for a lifesaving procedure, and what if the bank supported apartheid? There's a lot of nuance to scenarios like that that Santa's nice/naughty list could clear up. Not to mention Santa could fit very easily into Christendom by giving adults a running tally of how moral they've been year over year, assuming Santa's standards match well with the hypothetical standards of God. It should be clear though that Santa is no God, all he can do (as far as I'm aware) is give presents or coal at a single time of year, albeit with near omniscience. There's no eternal damnation at stake for not meeting Santa's standards. 

In addition, being an adult means eschewing simple pleasures for many reasons. One of those reasons is to care for children. In addition to giving much needed moral guidance, Santa could reward adults with a simple pleasure that they would normally not be able to enjoy.

Kids shouldn't be given gifts from Santa Claus, but mostly adults should be given gifts. I'm not sure what argument would make me change my mind on this, but I'm open to the idea that kids might deserve presents from Santa Claus. It'd take a strong argument to convince me that adults shouldn't be given gifts from Santa.

I'm at work so replies will come slowly.

Edit: As people have generously pointed out, santa claus is not real. Here's a reply I left below 
As a mythical story, we'd still be better off as a society with a santa that rewards/punishes adults rather kids. Believing in santa as a kid incentives them to act well and then be rewarded for it, and as an adult we would do well to tell this story from an adult perspective to kids, so that they know what actions to aspire to."

He was, after all, a higher life form, not unlike what we may consider us humans compared to cows, chickens, rats, and ants. Another example is the Viltrumites from the comic/show Invincible.

I wouldn’t compare with ideas like Nazism, though, as viewing other races as inferior has no biological basis. Ego, on the other hand, is superior. I guess his only flaw was in thinking Peter would understand. How are we more justified in killing rats than Ego is in killing all other life forms. We are just as much of a pest to his goal as rats are to us. 

Now, one counterpoint might be that Ego can communicate with us, whereas we can’t communicate with rats or ants. However, we don’t need to communicate with a rat to know that they don’t want to die. And perhaps the communication with Ego is very basic. We can communicate with dogs after all, but it doesn’t mean they are as intelligent as us. 

Is inferiority solely based on intelligence? Why do we view other animals as inferior?"

Knowledge was more likely to be new and discoverable.

Unlike today where every spot on the planet has been discovered, there were still huge swathes of the world still waiting to be explored. 

Cultures were relatively different and unique, there was no corporate monoculture like there is in society of today. 

The weather was relatively stable, and when it wasn't it was colder rather than hotter than average. 

The environment was relatively intact and the natural places you could visit weren't affected by humans.

There were still large populations of wild animals both in the water and on land."

Research into a cure for these conditions has been going on since at least the 1950s, probably earlier, and guess how much progress we've made? Basically 0. I'm sure if you asked 1000 people in the 50s if we would have a cure by now at least 90% would say yes. We thought it was caused by amyloid plaque building up in the brain so we developed drugs to clear it out. Has it had any effect? nope. It turns out that it doesn't help at all and has been debunked. We tried other stuff such as stem cell treatments and they too have had pretty much 0 impact. It feels like everything we try doesn't do anything, and there's only so many things we can try before we just give up and accept that there will probably never be a cure. And I know we hear about ""revolutionary new treatments / cures"", but what they don't tell you is that at least 99.96% of clinical trials trying to find a cure fail, and the ones that do succeed are found to have no effect years later. Another thing that you have to know is that like 99% of the ""breakthroughs"" are either exaggerated and hyped up by people trying to get clicks, or just straight up fabricated. Sorry but there's most likely not going to be a cure this century, and I wouldn't be surprised if there are no treatments this century either. I could be wrong, but I don't see why I would be tbh"

1,2022-12-09,"CMV: Harry and Meghan are in the right, and the British media and royal family need to be more introspective",u/katieofpluto,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zh1h9o/cmv_harry_and_meghan_are_in_the_right_and_the/,changemyview,"Since the new Harry and Meghan documentary dropped on Netflix, I’ve been trying to watch and read commentary from the British press to gauge their reaction to their story. However, I find that everywhere I look, the press is completely lacking any introspection on the actual narrative presented by the couple and instead are continuing to focus on irrelevant information to continue the same narratives used again and again to discredit their story. 

My takeaway from the documentary, as well as many stories from the royal family since QEII’s coronation, is that the royal family exchanged relevancy and not being declared obsolete by the British public in exchange for unfettered access to their private lives, and that the royal family not only doesn’t discourage but encourages this exploitative behaviour. With William and Harry being the first children actually born in this system, they essentially became child performers for the media with many staged photo ops and interviews, more than any other child royal before them, as well as more unscrupulous paparazzi engaging in unethical behaviour to get more secrets. I find his comment on consent to be a clear message that the royal family as well as the press are using not only adult royals, but minors in ways that do not protect their rights and security, just so they can stay in the public eye and keep high approval ratings in a world where most sane people would realise monarchy is dumb and unproductive.

I’m not even getting into all the issues of racism and the British public’s unwillingness to have a reckoning with their past and the role that the monarchy played in that history, but I agree with their points on that too.

But looking at British media and royal family’s comments on the documentary, I find it so frustrating that they seem to have ignored some of the major thesis statements of the series and continued not being introspective. For example, The Guardian ran with the headline “so sickening I almost brought up my breakfast” for one of their reviews. Not because of child exploitation, but because the documentary *gasp* dared to have friends of Meghan say nice things about her. A royal correspondent on This Morning said it was disrespectful for Meghan to imply the family was “cold” as if that drama even matters in the grand scheme of what they’re saying. The BBC comments “At one point, Meghan describes the media interview and photocall the couple gave when they got engaged as an ""orchestrated reality show""” and implies the documentary is exactly the same, again seemingly missing the whole point of ‘consent’ that the documentary specifically mentions. 

Another theme from press is that Harry and Meghan shouldn’t complain so loud because they’re rich and privileged. I also see a lot of these comments on social media. The same Guardian article says “The Sussexes have clearly suffered, in ways most of us will not experience. Whether they have suffered quite as much as they think is another question.” What does that even mean? Just because they haven’t suffered the worst fates known to mankind doesn’t mean what they are saying is incorrect or that the current system does not need to be changed. Most average Brits themselves are also quite privileged in comparison to many other people around the world, but I don’t believe that means they don’t have a right to protest injustice or discuss exploitation in the UK simply because there’s starving children or malaria patients in mud huts elsewhere. Yet somehow, Harry and Meghan are not allowed to express any dissent to their treatment because they are more privileged than the average Brit. The media is basically trying to convince the British public that they have a right to invade two human beings’ privacy so the public can have a bit of gossip, media can make boatloads of money off it, and Harry and Meghan have no right to complain because they’re rich. 

I also find it strange that a lot of pieces are saying that Meghan and Harry have been critical of the media, not the royal family, but then also complaining that the royal family wasn’t reached out to for comment. To me it’s just basic lack of media literacy. No, they didn’t name call anyone, but obviously they were criticising how the royal family encourages exploitative behaviour from the media and does nothing to protect children in the family. Like, you are meant to watch and understand that the reason why the media is allowed to behave the way that they do is because the royal family encourages it with nonsense photo ops and interviews, and their agreements like the ‘royal rota’. And yet I find very little media calling for the royal family to re-examine their relationship to the press. All the main stories are again drama about whether the royal family was allowed to comment or not before the docuseries dropped. Who cares? If they cared, they could comment on it right now. Why not focus on asking them to address the criticism through their actions?

With this type of media landscape after the documentary, I’ve concluded that the British press and royal family desperately need to touch grass and focus on being reflective and open to change, but instead have tried to yet again shift blame to Harry and Meghan instead of addressing their critiques.

In general, I’m looking to understand why others are seeing this documentary in a totally different way than I am. What would change my view would be either that some part of Harry and Meghan’s narrative is false and discredits their claims, that the royal family or press are being more introspective than I’m giving them credit for, that critiques like the royal family not given room to comment are much more severe than I’m making it sound, or that there is some other nuance to this story that would change my analysis of the situation."

If the point of accreditation is oversight - giving validation to a person with a degree - then how is an honorary degree different from ~~a fake drivers' license~~ a Knighthood for being on the UK Top Singles?

*Assumption 1: The point of an honorary degree is ""recognition of accomplishments"".  Degrees are not recognitions of career accomplishments, they are a recognition that you've completed the validated curriculum.*

*Assumption 2: Part of a University's goals are social - Alumni donations, paid sporting, etc.  This should not intersect with the actual offering of accredited degrees.*

Edit:  Drivers' License is a poor analogy.  There isn't a close one, so I'm using Knighthoods given to entertainers, even though Lordship can be inherited while degrees are merited.

Deltas:

* Degrees can be earned outside of coursework (such as a dissertation), thus accomplishments or furthering the field should be considered.
* Degrees do not imply specific credentials and scrutiny is already necessary - a ""doctor"" can be a medical doctor or a philosopher...a Ph.D can be an engineer or a political scientist."
0,2022-12-09,"CMV: The more you emphasize Santa Claus with your kids, the more likely they will irrationally reject Christianity",u/Mr-Homemaker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zh3g7g/cmv_the_more_you_emphasize_santa_claus_with_your/,changemyview,"I'd be very interested in others' personal experience 

as children (eg did your parents make a big deal about Santa but nothing bad came from that in your life) 

or 

as parents (eg did you make a big deal about Santa with your own kids who are now grown and nothing bad came from it)

//

My Reasoning:

1) Lying to your children will eventually undermine your credibility in their eyes.

2) When they realize you were lying about Santa, they will wonder what else you were lying about: Jesus? The Golden Rule? Moral Realism?

3) If Christmas = Santa = receiving gifts, then you're training your children to think selfishly and materialistically ~~ which is the exact opposite of what Christmas should be focused on: training them to think selflessly and spiritually 

4) Between (a) resentment and skepticism your children will feel in adolescence due to being deceived, and (b) their valid criticism that modern observance of Christmas is overly commercialized and hypocritical ~~ they will feel justified in rejecting not only Santa and being dismissive of their parents, but also denying Christianity 

Context: 

My wife wants to create more magic for our children (6 and under) by doing all sorts of elaborate Santa and Elf on the Shelf stuff; while I worry about the above things.

Caveats / Disclaimers:

a) I'm not saying everyone who rejects Christianity is irrational; I'm merely saying rejecting Christianity because you were lied to about Santa is irrational.

Edit: I believe this is a ""Hasty Generalization Fallacy"" ( #7 here: https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/logical-fallacies-examples )

b) I'm not saying any mention of Santa at all will lead to these adverse results; I'm saying the more elaborate your Santa traditions are and the more they dominate Christmas for your children, the more likely these results would be

I just turned 30. I've been gaming for basically my whole life. I remember gaming in the 90s and WOW there were some amazing games. I'll just name a few of my arcade favorites: Doom, Tyrian 2000, One Must Fall 2097, Duke Nukem. I even loved alot of the flash-based games from old websites like shockwave.com, or miniclip.com; Tradewinds (1,2, and 3), [Delirium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzGzeqZVhyg) - one of my favorites; an incredibly simple game, but executed SO well. I played for hours and hours.

Anyway, fast forward 20 years. PC gaming is pretty great, I love it and always will. But mobile gaming? Unbelievably bad.

Processing power has leaped forward thousands upon thousands of times since the 90s. Our mobile phones and tablets are lightyears faster than the **fastest** 90s PCs. I used to always think to myself ""wow, I wonder what game devs will do with such amazing technology. Surely the games will be as good or better than the 90s right?""

Wrong.

Instead, they are just all horribly designed and executed - and that's even just ignoring the major issue already mentioned; all of the ads and paywalls. The ads and paywalls might be acceptable *if* the games didn't suck in the first place.

The only thing that has arguably improved in mobile games is graphics (duh). But this just goes to show how unimportant graphics are to make a truly amazing gaming experience. 

Okay. I'm ready to have my view changed. Feel free to suggest any mobile game for iOS that I haven't tried."

For years, I believed that in order to pursue a relationship, my feelings had to reach a certain threshold. In other words, I assumed the ""steps"" to a relationship (I now know there aren't really any ""steps"" to a relationship, I'm just explaining my old mindset) are to ""have a crush,"" then ""pursue the relationship,"" and the first step had to be completed before moving on to the next one.

Part of this mindset also comes from the notion that I have to like the person, not just the idea of liking a girlfriend. Therefore, if I ask someone out on a date if I'm not 100% sure if I like them, I worry that would fall along the lines of just being desperate for a girlfriend rather than actually liking them.

When I had crushes in high school, I thought the first step was to have a crush and then pursue the relationship. This often resulted in me forcing massive infuations with the other person and then just dumping everything onto them once the ""first step"" is complete.

I don't think there's anything especially bad/wrong about finding traits more/less attractive, or being turned on by something specific in the form of a fetish.

I don't think that ""turning something into a fetish"" is an active thing, more that someone notices they are into something and explore where that goes. You can't control what those things are or choose what fetishes turn you on.

For illegality I mean situations where consent cannot be given (children, animals, some disabilities), or acting with non consenting behaviours (catcalling, unwanted interest, harrasement etc).

The illustration linked seems to say that there's nothing women can do to avoid being sexualised, but as it concludes I don't think that's possible because sexuality is built in. What can be dealt with is respecting peoples boundaries and consent, but that doesn't have a lot to do with seeing someone sexually, because there are non sexual boundaries which also ought to be respected, it isn't an exclusive thing.

I'd like to understand the basis of how sexualising/sexuality is being seen as negative. If its only because it leads to unwanted behaviour then I'd say its the behaviour, not the sexuality that's the issue. I don't think there's anything wrong or to be ashamed of for there to be an infinite list of sexual desires and preferences whether that's for men, women, or any other identity or orientation. 

Anyone who isn't asexual (and even some asexuals) will have sexual appetites and preferences. That's not a source of shame."
0,2022-12-10,CMV: Catcalling is not bad and is actually a compliment!,u/1scr3wedy0dad,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zhnx1f/cmv_catcalling_is_not_bad_and_is_actually_a/,changemyview,"I have been hearing about how catcalling is harmful, degrading, demeaning, etc. for a while now. And this got me thinking... What really is catcalling?

So I recently googled ""What is catcalling?"" and other combinations of similar words. It is really hard to get a clear answer. Even Oxford Languages' dictionary defined to catcall as..... to catcall. Even though this was unclear, what I did understand is that even Oxford Languages hints that it is a bad thing, by using the example sentence ""they were fired for catcalling at women"". But really all I can find is what I already vaguely knew: armful, degrading, demeaning. 

I then decided to google ""Examples of catcalling"", and I stumbled onto this. [https://www.theline.org.au/the-secret-meanings-of-common-cat-calls/](https://www.theline.org.au/the-secret-meanings-of-common-cat-calls/)

This provides 10 popular examples of catcalling, as well as providing what they believe these examples to mean. But then, I realized that looking at most of the common lines and people I believe to be modern feminists to be the meaning to them, make no sense at all when put together. The only one that I can see as being a bit creepy is ""Nice ass"", but that isn't ""Hey you are like an object, I wanna compliment your body because you are an object to me"". It is just a guy with no social skills (or never talked to a woman) trying to compliment. girl's looks. Asking ""You have a boyfriend?"" seems obvious to me that it isn't ""are you alone or will someone come and beat me up?"", it is ""Are you taken or is it possible for me to get into a relationship with you?"". 

I also remember hearing a story that went something like 'When \[her\] boyfriend asked \[her\] that ""isn't catcalling a compliment?"", \[she\] replied ""No it isn't!"" and got one of \[her\] friends to catcall him on his way home, and when he came home he was filled with confidence and high self esteem'

With all this said, and all that I know, I think that catcalling is a compliment, and I don't get why being complimented on how you look or asking you to clarify if you're taken is rude, demeaning or degrading."

PUA-Pick Up Artist

Admittedly I'm basing this thought of the typical ""Man pursuing woman"" but really it applies to it all.

So PU Art is known for its manipulation of women through tricks and other strategies that are dehumanizing and objectifing women, sometimes getting into sexual coercion and harassment at its worse. 

But here's a question: Is being a PUA inherently bad thing? Or more precisely can PUA only objectively be bad? Is the word's denoation an objectively bad thing to and for people?

I ask this because it doesn't seem like it. Correct me if I'm wrong but a PUA is someone who knows how to effectively use psychological maneuvers and strategies to seduce someone (of a lot different kinds of people) into being a person who wants to have some ideal romantic and/or sexual tie with the person doing the actions to the extent that said person wants. So for example a PUA might might use said psychological strategies to flirt with and seduce a woman at a bar and to many for the purpose of having sex together later at that night. 

Now my question on that is if there is anything wrong wrong with that? Is that what a PUA is?

No admittedly it's half a rhetorical question. I know many who may answer this may say something along the lines of how that's fine but the issue is that not what PUAs are, they are x and y and more that I think most of us can agree is wrong. So while I would still like an answer to my previous questions, I also present another set of questions. 

Do you think it's feasibly, realistically possible for a ethical PUA to exist who can use tactics and strategies  to pursue and seduce a lot of different kinds of people in a way that isn't wrong and makes nearly everyone happy/satisfied? And do you think it's possible to have PU Art that teaches people to pursue/seduce in the same ethical and right way that these possible PUA do? If so would you be in support for it existing?

And the biggest question of all is do you even think or feel it is possible for such a thing to exist and happen?"

It allows people who are running late (there will always be some) to get into the theater without disturbing the movie watching experience for others.

Most importantly, imo, it gives time for the person adjust from being outside the theater to being ready for movie time! You get to get into the headspace of being there to watch the movie, in other words, turning off your outside world brain and entering movie watching time.

So, although they are annoying, I think they are good for the movie watching experience.

Note: the trailers can be far too long but I do think a small chunk of time, let’s say 15-20 minutes can actually be good for the movie experience."

There are a few problems with that:

1) If it’s majority by the country the scenario takes place in, what if a white person goes to to Uganda and calls black people the n word? The white person would be the minority in Uganda so that surely wouldn’t be racist.

2) What if a white person called a Ghanaian the n word on the internet, where the white person was in America, a white majority country, and the black person in Ghana, a black majority country. They would both hold majority by country so surely racism wouldn’t be possible.

3) If it’s done by global majority, white people aren’t the global majority, Han Chinese come in first with an estimated 1.4 billion people. So surely only Han Chinese people are able to be racist, and surely white people calling Chinese people ch**ks isn’t racist as white people are a comparative minority?


Conclusion: I don’t believe it to be anything to do with the majority or minority, I believe it to be what the Google definition of racism is:

“prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism by an individual, community, or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.”

I will read what I can and respond to any comment I find that holds good points, but please take into account problems 1-3 and make sure they don’t answer your comment.


**Disclaimer**
Examples in paragraphs numbered 1-3 are to show problems with that ideology and not necessarily my beliefs, I do not believe racism is dependant on who has the ethnic majority. I *do* believe that a white person calling a black person the n word in a black majority country is racist, I also believe anyone calling a Han Chinese person a ch**k is racist despite the fact they hold global ethnic majority."

We spend trillions on a military that as far as I know does absolutely nothing at the moment (which is better than just bombing the crap out of the Middle East at least). If that military went down into Mexico to help build infrastructure projects, and combat rampant gangs and corruption, we would not only be making people's lives better, we would also be building a more stable trade partner, and preventing the need for people to have to cross the border.

I would assume many Americans wouldn't be on board with this idea because they'd see it is free handouts, and they'd rather keep putting people in cages at the border instead of actually helping our neighbors. 

But down the road spending money on our neighbors now, seems like it would save us money in the future."
0,2022-12-10,CMV: You shouldn't be in an advanced class if you need a tutor for it,u/gothicgamelabs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zhwuih/cmv_you_shouldnt_be_in_an_advanced_class_if_you/,changemyview,"First off, let me define what I mean by ""need."" If you have a 90 average and are using a tutor to get it closer to 100, that's fine: you don't *need* that tutor. What I'm talking about are kids who will likely fail if they don't have outside assistance, kids who need a tutor to reliably pass.

Second, let me define ""advanced."" I know these classes go by different names in different places, but I'm talking about the classes that are faster-paced and more difficult than a ""regular"" class of the same name. In my school, they were called ""honors"" or ""advanced placement (AP)"" classes. For example, the default might be ""Pre-calc"" and the advanced class would be ""Honors Pre-calc"": they're covering basically the same stuff, just more of it and more quickly.

Now, why do I believe this? Because if you're borderline failing an advanced class, you belong in a regular class. What has almost certainly happened is a parent has pushed their child into the advanced class thinking it was for the best because they either overestimated their child's ability or underestimated how detrimental it is to be in a class that is too difficult. I mean, there are parents who erroneously believe ""my child has to be in the highest-level classes at all times.""

I will note two exceptions. First, if a child misses a substantial amount of time (likely due to serious illness), it's fine to use a tutor to catch up. Second, if there is some very weird scheduling situation where someone needs to take a class but the only one that works for their schedule is an advanced class, that's fine too (and when I say fine, I mean they should get a tutor rather than move down to a regular class).  


EDIT: To be clear, I'm talking about kids using tutors and just passing, not excelling. It seems like a lot of people think tutoring is going to bring kids from Fs to As, but that's not generally the case. I'm talking about kids who are still struggling."

All I have is the statements of a lot of people mixed with my feelings and I don't know how to express this in a coherent way - but my position is: **The rich are sick with greed, and the only cure is to incentivize them to contribute back to the economy**.

Here are my rawest thoughts

&gt;The rich are sick with greed, and they suffer a tremendous about of empathy-defecit due to this greed. Their envy to acquire resources through the labor of those that seek same resources is poison to the economy, and they should be stripped of their titles when they don't contribute back into our lives.   
&gt;  
&gt;The greed forces them in a position where they are able to compete with those who are trying to survive and to outpace their competition through any endeavor, as money presents us with opportunities to hire laborers for our own means. They are exploiting a system that should serve all our opportunities equally.  
&gt;  
&gt;The economy should incentivize those that are greedy to invest back into the economy, because as long as the resources remain in the rich people's hands, it does not circulate down to the poorest people. The current remains a dead current, unable to recharge the economy in a cyclical fashion. We should make it easier for the rich to contribute back to the economy.

The views I'm looking to challenge are:

* Are the rich sick with greed?
* Is incentivizing their contribution to the economy a cure for that greed?

Thank you. I know this one is quite strange but i'm hoping the community can help me redo the way I view this so I can make sense for my own studies.

Edit: My view does not propose that the rich does not contribute to the economy."

It would seem that there is a massive majority of people that consider specific names to be wrong, even to the point that a parent would be accused of incompetence or abusing children (most often the first) for following through with naming their child something specific in the most extreme cases. Given, much of this may be an attempt at humor (I tend to have a hard time detecting that), so I looked more deeply into it.

This sentiment is often expressed when one is presented with a name that is clearly based on some object or concept, an example of which can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/zc1jq4/miracle_baby_names_are_so_bad/). Unfortunately, this is a bad example for measuring the popularity of the sentiment since the subreddit's rules make downvotes indicative of disagreement, and I don't have access to vote percentages for the post (Reddit stops all ""post"" vote count displays at 0 even if the actual score is far lower), but I bring it up because it shows part of the arguments that someone might make concerning this topic and I will be using it later on.

A much better example is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/zfcilf/will_my_daughter_hate_me_if_i_name_her_california/), a popular post about a specific instance of naming a child based on an existing concept in which almost 2K comments unanimously agree that doing such is a bad idea (even if you sort by controversial and pick out specifically the most downvoted comments, they're usually like that because they take the sentiment to the extreme, but never because they actually think it's a good name). This subreddit is known for having a variety of different demographics asking and answering questions, so the opinion seems universal if it would see so much expression in large volumes from so many users.

Further examples can be found at r/NameNerdCirclejerk, a community dedicated to this type of opinion.

There's also the fact that people are now reluctant to give (or at least express disapproval for giving) people names that have been used for ridicule or associated with negative figures, such as ""Karen,"" ""Adce,"" and ""Adolf."" Then there's the general disdain for alternative spellings that can be shown in some instances. This further cements the idea that there seems to be a consensus that certain names that would otherwise be reasonable should be judged as ""off-limits.""

I was given a name that is often mispronounced at first by people who don't know me (but easily learnable) to the point that I just use my last name at most restaurants where a name would be required. I have a sibling that has a name that could be targeted for jokes and another one that has a middle name that was blatantly ripped from Star Wars. Despite this, I have never once seen them express resentment for these facts, and I certainly don't hate my own name either. Given, they are still relatively young, but not so much so that I believe the point is irrelevant. I simply don't believe these properties of naming truly matter.

I figured that I should try and fix this viewpoint if it is flawed.

# Overview

It seems that the most common arguments for this sentiment are:

* It's a lazy or egotistical naming convention
* It will be made fun of
* It deprives your child of a distinct identity, forever associating them with the concept they were named after.
* In the specific case of naming a child ""California,"" it's associated with things that are considered negative (apparently porn and strippers? This could very well just be a joke).

My own take is that names should be viewed from a functional standpoint; that is, they should:

* Be both easily pronounceable and intuitively spellable (or at least be easy to adapt into making these things intuitive) so that it is not a burden to those trying to reference you by name.
* Be unique enough that it is not likely to conflict with other people your child is expected to interact with, as these situations introduce ambiguity.
   * If you would like to choose a common name, using an unconventional spelling may be a good way of subverting the ambiguity problem, but this solution should be executed with respect to the pronounceability and spellibility requirements.
* Be distinct from other nouns and pronouns that may be used in the same contexts as a name.
   * For example, ""Virginia"" is fine since context can tell you if you're talking about the state or the person, but ""Eye"" is not since it conflicts with the personal pronoun ""I"" and may become ambiguous when describing events in the past tense (The difference between ""I went to the store"" vs. ""Eye went to the store"" is not clear when pronounced).

This is because a name is merely a label for a person. It's an entirely arbitrary set of sounds that happens to fit these requirements so that it can be practical. Many names were initially created with meaning, but in the modern age, no consideration goes into those definitions when deciding on naming a child, and I think it should stay that way.

The subjective associations that the name brings about are not inherent properties of the people they are assigned to, and we really need to address the behavior that seems to imply that they are instead of designing our conventions to avoid these assumptions.

The rest of this post will be framed as counterarguments for the aforementioned most common expressions.

# Lazy or Selfish

The implication that something as simple as giving someone a name could be egotistical is not one that I have considered before seeing it expressed. It seems to be primarily based on assumption to me.

The [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/zc1jq4/miracle_baby_names_are_so_bad/) I mentioned on r/The10thDentist states that someone would have to tell a story every time they introduce themselves. Having met some of these people, I think this is an exaggeration. It assumes that these names are strange enough that people would immediately wonder, which was not the case for me, at least.

Of course, I can't speak for others, but even if it is something that is common to ask, I would disagree with the assertion that this is necessarily bad. On the contrary, having something interesting about yourself so immediately available sounds like a blessing to me (though I am not neurotypical, so that may be a factor). It can help you with icebreakers and first impressions.

Additionally, the post frames these names as always being given in the context of some story when it could just as well be chosen because the parents like the sound of it or that the name is associated with something else that has meaning to them.

Still, if we assume that this element of one's name is something that exists to the extent said and that a person resents said element, implying some vice on the parent's part based on so little context is presumptuous and judgemental.

Of course, there are other proposed elements of harm associated with these types of names, such as...

# Target for Teasing

This claim is what I believe to be the strongest of these arguments. The basic premise is that some names are easy targets for bullying since they can easily lend themselves to wordplay. However, not all wordplay is done with malicious intent. A person can laugh at their own name just as much as anyone else can if they know it isn't indicative of their actual qualities.

In addition, bullying is inevitable, and most people will find even the most innocuous traits to make fun of if they want to. This behavior needs to be addressed not by avoiding the triggers but by informing the masses and cutting off these tendencies at their roots.

As I previously mentioned, one of my siblings has a name that could easily be lent to teasing, but I see no evidence that this actually happens at a significant frequency. Instead, it seems that the people around him are simply considerate enough not to make that connection, or, if they do, it's a common joke among them and not a point of bullying.

But what about something that is less dependent on human behavior and more connected to our lingual environment?

# No Distinct Identity/Negative Associations

It's reasonable to say that someone named ""Ruby"" or ""Rose"" will always be associated with rubies and roses respectively, even in an indirect way. It's just a side effect of the fact that they share names with an object. Additionally, someone named ""Adolf"" could conceivably be connected to the holocaust.

However, is it justified to say that these lingual connections necessarily affect one's inherent identity enough that they should be avoided? Perhaps in the case of ""Adolf,"" since that is deeply ingrained into society and the associations would be challenging to unlink, but we still need to recognize how this is not inherent to the name but the meaning that we give it as humans. There should at least be an effort to acknowledge and address this problem.

I see no reason to believe a name deprives people of a distinct identity as if what you are called was the only factor in determining how one views themselves. It's overly restrictive to shame the use of these names.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, while it is common for people to express strong opinions about certain names being ""wrong"" or inappropriate, it is ultimately up to the parents to choose a name for their child. As long as the name is chosen with care and consideration, it can be a wonderful way to give your child a strong sense of identity and individuality. It is important to remember that what is considered a ""cool"" or popular name can change over time, and a name that is currently unpopular may become more common and accepted in the future. Additionally, a person's inherent identity is not solely defined by their name, and a person can choose to change or alter their name if they wish.

6,2022-12-10,"CMV: There is no point in applying to or attending an Ivy League school if your grades, academic history, extracurriculars, etc. does not even come close to the caliber of the average person there.",u/Drillix08,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zhzf3v/cmv_there_is_no_point_in_applying_to_or_attending/,changemyview,"I was never a fan of the idea of applying to an Ivy League school if you are an average student with average grades. Even if you have grades that are well above average I think applying/attending still would be a bad idea. In general, I think you should only apply or attend if you're at the very top of your class when it comes to grades and accomplishments. I can see the reasons why people apply, which may look good on paper, but in my opinion play out terribly in practice.

First of all, the chances of you even getting into the school are slim to none, so applying honestly feels like a waste of money. Even if by some miracle you did get accepted, going there would be a terrible idea. The problem people make is assuming that the harder it is to get into the school, the better the school is. But I think that's a flawed assumption as colleges are not a one size fits all, how good a college is for someone depends on the person, and in my opinion an Ivy League school is not the type of college that would fit an average student. 

One common reason people might want to go is that they think the reputation of the school will give them an advantage when finding a job, but I don't really think that's the case. Studies have shown that employers usually don't care what college you went to, and probably for good reason. Employers only care if you're competent and willing to do the work, and the best way to show that in an interview is to be good at presenting yourself, not by getting a degree from a highly prestigious school. And although there are statistics that show better outcome rates from Ivy League schools I think that's more to do with the aptitude of the students accepted as opposed to the reputation of the school or the quality of the education.

Another big reason to not go is that the work is very hard. There's a reason these schools are so picky because the work is very intense, which would be quite stressful for the average student. Also, almost every person there will either be way smarter than you or have done more accomplishments, which would not be good for self confidence. Finally, the very fact that you attended an ivy league school means that you'll have to live up to an expectation of being really smart and making a lot of great accomplishments. Every time you do something stupid someone could say, ""hey didn't you go to &lt;insert Ivy League&gt;?"" Imagine how difficult that would be for you if you're not someone of the highest intelligence or drive.

And finally, the last major reason that attending would not be a good idea is how expensive it is. Compared to the average college, you'll have to pay a lot of money to cover the tuition and chances are you'll have to pay quite a lot more since you'll likely get less money taken off from financial aid and scholarships than the average accepted student. If somehow you're in a rare instance where you get some crazy cheap deal, then maybe I could see the reason in attending but chances are that won't happen. Considering all the previous things I've mentioned, you'd just be putting yourself in a lot of debt for no good reason.

Another note I want to make since someone might bring it up is in the case you are an athlete. From what I've heard, these schools are a lot less picky when it comes to grades if you are an athlete and have a chance of making one of their teams. So I'd say that if you're able to find a community of people you fit into within the athletic sectors of these schools then this is probably the one exception I'd give, especially if you get a good financial deal for it.

So yeah, that's pretty much all I have to say. Chances are there might be some points that missing so I'm interested in seeing what arguments you come back with."

Edit: Already changed my mind in part. I can understand why it could be viewed as a good trade. I can also understand why it can be seen as a bad trade. It all depends on how dangerous you think Viktor Bout really is. If you think he's useless because everyone knows his face and his network is dead, then it was a good deal. If you think Putin still trusts him and his KGB/GRU ties would make it very easy for him to alter his identity and get back in the game, then it was a terrible trade. I choose to ride the fence at this point because both view points are highly speculative and rely on the future to prove the past. Only time will tell the truth. Please read the whole post. Both of my views are explained in detail below.

The trade made for Brittney Griner was a bad trade. The long term consequences of releasing a known arms trafficking terrorist in trade for a basketball player doesn't seem to balance the proverbial scales of justice. How many people are going to die at the hands of weapons provided by deals ""the merchant of death"" will facilitate? Countless Men women and children all around the world are in the ground because of Victor Bout. It would be incredibly naive to think his release will not result in countless more lives lost. 

On top of the loss of life, the financial consequences of the man-hours and resources invested in his capture I'm sure are in the millions of dollars. Now he's free to be hunted and captured again, with the expenditure of millions more, plus the lives that will be risked in this endeavor.

Finally, she did break the law. I've seen a lot of ""wrongfully detained"" statements in the headlines and elsewhere, and they are factually inaccurate. Many people think 9 years is excessive for marijuana cartridges. I agree. However Russian law is not based on American opinion. Also, there are plenty of people in prison in the US for similar offences. And that's where they'll stay because it's a matter of American law. They will serve their sentences.

As far as trades go, some guys are just off the table in my book. There's a reason Putin want Viktor Bout back in Russia. He is in the middle of a war after all. Who better to get back on your team than your most prolific and successful arms dealer?

How was it a good trade?

Edit: After much deliberation I have to say I see it a bit differently. I think the logical talking points all still have merit, but don't really seal the deal once you realize Viktor Bout has been neutralized by his fame. Griner broke Russian law, but she also got screwed because she is American. It was a really stupid decision, but I'd say 10 months in Russian prison is time served. Viktor Bout WAS the merchant of death and deserves to serve the full 25, but not at the expense of someone who should be home in America. It took some convincing, but where my mind really changed... Bout is possibly not dangerous anymore. In fact, I would hate to be in his position. He's in Putin's pocket as a talking head for life, at best. At worst, he's a talking head for a few weeks, then he gets disappeared to be waterboarded. Putin can never really trust him, so he can never really use him for anything of value. If the man is of no tactical or operational value, then it is of little consequence to trade him back to Russia.
All that being said...Brittney Griner's celebrity got her bumped to the front of a line that plenty of other people have been in for a lot longer. I do not mean Whelan or any other specific individual. I mean there are lots of Americans that should be home that have been gone a long time, and they all matter. Putin made this deal, Biden just accepted. It's a  crafty deal and it's working perfectly. Prisoner trades are rare, and good ones even more so. It's all about creating a scenario that makes a rift among the people in an already fractured society...that's us. 

One final thought.
If Viktor Bout was as valuable as people seem to think, he would have been successfully traded for any number of other prisoners years ago. Unless of course he was more valuable/dangerous than anyone Russia had to trade in return. It depends on how you look at it. Just something else to think about. Can't automatically discredit anyone's opinion on this this one. We don't get presidential briefings.

Thanks to everyone for participating."

- He has tried to kill Naruto (a loyal Konoha ninja) on several occasions.

- Tried to capture Killer B (the brother of the Raikage).
- He killed several Samurai of the Land of Iron.
- He attacked and attempted to kill the 5 Kage.
- He almost killed Karin while attempting to kill Danzo (maybe not a crime, but still a dick move).
- Declared that he was going to attempt to destroy Konoha and kill it's inhabitants.

I'm sure there are many more that I'm forgetting, but you get the idea.

Sasuke committed numerous crimes that deserved being put to death, or at least life in prison.  The reasons he wasn't don't seem good enough to warrant a pardon:

- He was traumatised by his clan being killed is not a good enough reason.  His trauma does not excuse the actions he took or the lives he ended.

- Just because he was Naruto's friend and a former Konoha ninja does not mean he should not be held accountable for his actions.  He killed several innocent people and his actions against other village's almost sparked another Great Ninja War.

- Even after helping in the War, he then immediately tried to kill Naruto.  Again.

- Just because he devoted himself to travelling the world after Shippuuden to ""right his wrongs"", does not mean he should have been allowed to.  This allowed him to escape justice.

- The theme of ""forgiveness"" in Naruto should not have meant that Sasuke should have had his crimes overlooked.

Sasuke should have had one of three endings: Either dying in battle, Being executed, or spending the rest of his life in prison.

(EDIT:  To clarify, I'm only counting the original series and Shipuuden in this.  Boruto, as far as this post goes, is not included as I feel it's more of an add-on and not part of the ""main' storyline).

(EDIT 2: It's getting late so I'll have to jump off now, but I'll come back tomorrow to reply to any responses I've missed.)

The simplest solution to this problem is to make tickets non-transferable. When you buy a ticket you put in a name and an id number (for a driving license, credit card, student card or whatever) for each ticket and then you need to produce that same id when you try to use the ticket. (This is a dropped down level of what airlines already do in the name of security, and it is common in Europe) This instantly destroys the business model behind the bots and hence they should disappear.

Some people change their minds about attending an event and want to be able to get a refund. Easy enough to add a refund possibility when you buy the ticket for a few extra dollars (again, common in the travel industry)

*(Note: This will not solve all problems with trying to buy tickets. A separate issue is that event organisers routinely release a small number of tickets at a relatively low price so bands and so on can pretend not to be ruthless capitalist profiteers. Naturally the competition for those cheap tickets will still be intense, even if the bot business model no longer makes sense.)*

Updates: In answer to challenges some minor logistical tweaks that still preserve the central mechanism

1. One ID per group (e.g. 1 ID for every 4 tickets - easier to buy tickets for families and friend groups)
2. Biometric option - register your face when you buy a ticket and then show your face to enter the event (reduces time/space/personnel costs for checking id at event entrance)
3. Secure ID - if you buy a ticket for a friend as a gift then you put in their name and they have to bring a real gov issued ID (like a driving license), or else they get an email from the ticketing company and put in the id they will bring with them."

As per the subreddit rules, I am not here to just disregard others' perspectives 

I am here to be open to a perspective or outlook I am missing on this subject

That said,

I am not currently poor, but I was not too long ago.

In that time, I managed to do okay for myself through both covid and medical issues by simply making choices that I thought would best benefit me financially

The biggest one being that I shared a living space and expense with a few other people, which helped a lot

During this time, I had a very simple retail job that paid a meager amount 

To be clear, I had no family to help me during this time; I was on my own

In light of this, I honestly struggle to empathize when I see other redditors baffled at the idea of saving money, or claiming rent is too high, or generally expressing financial hardship

These aren't people with medical issues or extenuating circumstances that I can tell

Further, they seem hostile to any idea that they could be managing their money better or that others in similar circumstances are doing well

In response, I often go as far as to crunch some numbers based off what info I can gather and run a ""what if"" situation as if I was in their shoes, but I often come up in the black during these thought exercises, so I figure I may be missing something


Basically, as the title says, my personal experience leads me to believe that a person can live off a pretty meager monthly salary and still manage to have money to plan and save and improve their situation

But, as I see others vehemently believing otherwise, I want to see the other side

Please try to CMV!

In particular,
Please throw examples at me that you think would show me numerically what I am missing

(2 notes: this is U.S. specific and I don't mean live lavishly when I say live)


ETA:

I will likely not respond to any more comments; I've read way to many today and I am fried

Thanks to everyone for taking the time to share you perspectives with me

If you're curious as to my take aways it's as follows:
For a lot of people, especially those who are ""fit"" to do so, living off low paying wages is possible on the right areas temporarily as a start to life, though not ideal

The biggest issue I was able to learn about are ways people get stuck in this lifestyle at a point they really need more, paticularly for matters that aren't their fault

As a reminder, this has nothing to do with my belief on ethics or policy

More so, was just me wanting a chance to gain other perspectives to challenge my evaluation of the world

That said, it did raise a lot of interesting ideas of personal responsibility vs societal responsibility 

There's a lot of other interesting ideas it has led me to want to think about, so I do sincerely appreciate everyone's contributions and hope you all have a good day/night/holiday season"

Aside fromo obvious goals like people should have equal treatment and that a sense of justice should be maintained i really hate talking points the different factions bring up. I tried to get into politics but there is always some point or fact i failed to consider that completely debunks my entire view i thought i held. I also hate how it makes people not wish to talk to you anymore if your views are brought up and they dont completely agree with them, it is far more peaceful to not have opinions on things. 

On top of all of this politics are very superficial and fake tbh, most canidates running for office are being paid and pressured to endorse views by their sponsors and individual people, the type how advocate for being involved in politics in the first place have no no sway at all, especially if they dont hold all the views of one of the two major parties

Overall everything is just so corrupt and idk how not wanting to be involved in something so confusing that i have no real power in anyways makes me selfish or ""a conservative in denial"" (i actually hate conservative politics slightly more that politcs in general tbh). I feel pressured to pick a side and be angry at the other side but i dont like it.

If things were simple and everyone wished to be involed in solely making their country a better place for everyone and was not obligated to be extreme than maybe id be involved but it is all so tireing. Idk why politicans cant just sit down, perform studys, experimentation and polls to devlop an agenda which satisfys everyone, rathing going of party obligation and emotion. Is there really no policy choice that will please everyone?

Overall i dont see why being apolitical is so evil as ive seen in other posts. Just as i am with actual politcs ive probablly overlooked something like i always do that will crumble this view as well, what is it?"

122,2022-12-11,CMV: Money Can't Buy Happiness Study is Misinterpreted by Many People,u/simmol,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zj3u0b/cmv_money_cant_buy_happiness_study_is/,changemyview,"I have noticed that in this CMV reddit as well as other places online, people often ask about whether money can buy happiness.  Inevitably, someone refers to the 2010 paper by Deaton/Kahenemann and states that money buys happiness but only up to 75K.  Here is the original PNAS paper.

[https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1011492107](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1011492107)

As a caveat, it is not my stance/argument that money does buy happiness.  My stance isn't to even criticze the paper.  Rather, my CMV is focused on being careful about not treating the 2010 study as some definitive answer to whether money buys happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

1. In the original 2010 paper, the authors look into two metrics:  emotional well-being and life-evaluation.  The authors found that emotional well being saturates after 75K but life-evaluation doesn't.  The authors seems to imply that happiness = emotional well-being but happiness != life-evaluation.  I suppose I am not a person to judge about the semantics, but I think when people ask whether money buys happiness, I suspect that many people are not solely asking about emotional well-being and not life-evaluation.
2. The way that the study is conducted, data point is gathered from different participants self-reporting on their happiness.  So you have person A who makes 75K, person B who makes 125K, person C who makes 250K, and so forth.  In many of the inquiries regarding money buying happiness, it is person A asking whether their happiness will increase if their income increases from 75K to some other amount.  By citing a study in which the variable of a personhood changes (from person A, B, C), you are not comparing apples to apples when citing this study as some refutation that person A's happiness will not increase upon having more money.  Moreover, most people recognize that their happiness will not necessarily increase if they get paid a lot but have to take on a job that is more stressful.  So that is something to keep in mind either.  Moreover, the 2010 paper also states that one of the key reasons why happiness might not increase beyond 75K is these confounding factors (e.g. stressful jobs, less time with family due to job requirements).
3. A new paper in 2021 seems to refute the findings of 2010.  [https://www.nysscpa.org/news/publications/nextgen/nextgen-article/study-finds-strong-relation-between-income-and-happiness-does-not-max-out-at-75k](https://www.nysscpa.org/news/publications/nextgen/nextgen-article/study-finds-strong-relation-between-income-and-happiness-does-not-max-out-at-75k).  Here, the authors notice that happiness does not max out at 75K but goes beyond, which provides us with more indication that more money means more happiness.
4. There is a surgence in a movement called FIRE (financially independence retirement early).  The idea here is that these people make it a point to retire early (e.g. 30s/40s) by (a) taking on high paying jobs (b) saving/investing a lot of money while young (c) living off of interests after retiring (the 4% rule).  I haven't found much happiness study on the FIRE people but there seems to be studies suggesting that retiring early leads to enhanced happiness.  [https://www.hrreview.co.uk/hr-news/strategy-news/early-retirement-brings-happiness-says-new-research/139890](https://www.hrreview.co.uk/hr-news/strategy-news/early-retirement-brings-happiness-says-new-research/139890).  The point of bringing up FIRE is that the high income people can essentially get out of the rat race early in life and bring about tremendous flexibility in their lives by retiring early (and this movement is becoming trendy all around the world).  The 2010 study does not take on this possibility.

Conclusion: I think relationship between money and happiness is complicated.  However, I have seen the 2010 paper being misued and misinterpreted by people to essentially downplay the role that money brings to happiness.  Most likely, money does buy a lot of happiness (less so than what materialistic people think but more so than people who refer to the 2010 paper and treat it as some sort of a definitive argument)."

14,2022-12-11,CMV: Kyle Rittenhouse is not a murderer.,u/ChampionOfBaiting,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zj50mq/cmv_kyle_rittenhouse_is_not_a_murderer/,changemyview,"I don't mean ""not a murderer"" in the legal sense; that's already been decided. I mean that him killing Huber and Rosenbaum can't reasonably be called ""murder"" even if you ignore the ruling. In short, he's not OJ.

My full view is: Self-defense is a right, and that includes self-defense with deadly force if you have reason to believe someone is an immediate threat to your or someone else's life or limb. Using necessary deadly force in the act of defending one's life definitionally precludes it from being called murder. 

Rittenhouse was chased and attacked by Joseph Rosenbaum, who earlier that day threatened to kill any of a group of people that Rittenhouse was in if he'd caught them alone, and though Rittenhouse did his best to escape, he was eventually cornered in a parking lot and had no better recourse than to use deadly force and shoot Rosenbaum. Huber and Grosskreutz, probably under the misapprehension that Rittenhouse was mass shooter, chose to chase and assault Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse again tried to escape by running towards some police cruisers, but tripped and was bashed in the head by Huber with a skateboard and by an unknown person (jump-kick man), followed by Grosskreutz pointing his own firearm at Rittenhouse. Given that Huber and Grosskreutz both presented deadly threats to Rittenhouse, he shot them both. I believe that given these details, Rittenhouse only acted in self defense and is therefore not a murderer.

I've compiled a list of common arguments against Rittenhouse and my responses to them. Be aware that this is not me taking these arguments off the table, this is just to get my initial responses to them out of the way to save us all some time.

**1**.**""He crossed state lines with a gun""**

No he didn't. This was confirmed in the trial.

**2.""He traveled a long distance to be in Kenosha""**

He lived 20 minutes away and worked in that city before the pandemic hit.

**3.""It's illegal for a 17 year-old to carry a rifle in Wisconsin""**

No it isn't; not even the prosecution tried to argue this. 17 year-olds are allowed to open carry long-barreled rifles in Wisconsin.

**4.""He wasn't supposed to be there""**

Every US citizen is allowed to be in any public area in the US, barring specific legal restrictions on individuals (prison, restraining orders, etc). There was a curfew that night, however given that everyone involved was breaking the same curfew, I find that's a null point. Lastly, breaking curfew obviously doesn't remove one's right to defend their life with deadly force if it's necessary.

**5.""No one asked him to be there""**

See the prior response.

**6.""It was premeditated""**

I don't think it's likely that someone who intended to kill people would first run away from everyone he ended up killing until he was either cornered or on the ground and being hit in the head. Someone with premeditation to commit murder would probably just shoot people without much hesitation.

**7.""Self defense can't be used as a excuse if you provoked the altercation with illegal actions""**

The only crime Rittenhouse unquestionably committed was breaking curfew. But because every person in the riot was committing the same crime, it's not reasonable to claim that was what provoked the attack on Rittenhouse. And to whether Huber and Grosskreutz had reason to believe Rittenhouse was a murderer and therefore that was their provocation, well, whether Rittenhouse committed illegal homicide is the subject of this post to begin with.

**8.""He shouldn't have used deadly force to fight off his assailants""**

I don't believe the tools you use to defend your life should depend on whether you think you can beat your attacker in a fistfight. It's not reasonable to have expected Rittenhouse to do a tale-of-the-tape in his head while being chased by a violent belligerent. And I hope we can all agree that most people couldn't fend off a group of three with their hands and feet.

**9.""He should have aimed for their legs/arms/hands""**

Aiming for extremities with a gun is an unwise prospect, as any firearms expert will tell you. While Rittenhouse did miraculously manage to hit one of his assailants in the arm without killing him, it's not reasonable to expect that kind of precision when someone is lunging at you from 2 feet away or when you're on the ground and just got hit twice in the head.

**10.""Having a firearm proves an intent to use it""**

Merely having a gun does not, nor has it ever, been considered intent to commit murder. And if it were, Grosskreutz, one of the men he shot, would be charged with a crime as well.

**11.""Going into a riot armed with a gun means he was a willing combatant""**

A person being in a town during a riot while armed is not, nor has it ever been, an excuse to assault that person, nor has it ever meant they aren't allowed to use deadly force to defend themself. Further, many people were open-carrying AR-15s or similar rifles that night, including many of the BLM protesters. None of them were singled out and assaulted, as far as anyone knows.

**12.""Only one of the men he shot had a gun""**

Being unarmed doesn't mean you don't have the ability to kill or injure. And a skateboard is a heavy blunt object, which kill more people per year than long-barreled rifles do.

**13.""Huber and Grosskreutz were just trying to subdue a person they thought was dangerous""**

I don't know of any judge, lawyer, or police officer who would encourage a civilian to be a vigilante and pursue a person they believed was dangerous, much less while they were running away from the civilian and towards the police. What they *would* encourage you to do is to escape from the dangerous person and contact the police, and then only fight if other options were impossible, which is exactly what Rittenhouse had done.

**14.""He should have turned himself in to the police""**

He did; immediately after the incident he went to a police cruiser with his hands raised and they brushed him off, and later he turned himself in at a police station.

**15.""He once hit a girl""**

If Rittenhouse once hitting a girl who was fighting another girl means his life is essentially forfeit from then on, then so does threatening one's grandmother with a knife and raping minors, crimes that Huber and Rosenbaum committed, respectively.

**16.""He should have stayed to stabilize the people he shot""**

It's not really possible to provide medical assistance when you have a mob chasing you. Also, I doubt he had the tools necessary to treat gunshot wounds in that Amazon first-aid kit he had. The wisest course of action in that case was to inform the nearest police officer, which Kyle had attempted to do before being chased by a mob.

**17.""He should have stayed home""**

Thanks, Captain Hindsight. 

**18.""He should have just let the mob attack him""**

If you're not willing to use this same logic for anyone who's ever used deadly force to stop an assailant, then I don't believe it applies here either. We should not expect people to just hope that assailants will just rough them up a bit instead of killing or seriously injuring them.

**19.""He was a racist kid who wanted to play Rambo""**

Even if all of that were true, that still doesn't take away one's right to defend their life.

**20.""Even though he's not a murderer, he still did dumb things.""**

Ok, but that's not an argument against my view."

0,2022-12-11,CMV: the majority of American culture is based on capitalist marketing or historical oppression of minorities,u/RandomTW5566,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zj6c80/cmv_the_majority_of_american_culture_is_based_on/,changemyview,"Try to think of various physical and abstract notions associated with the United States. Apple pie, hamburgers, baseball, football, jeeps, G.I. Joe ~~dolls~~ ""action figures,"" Thanksgiving dinner, 4th of July fireworks, George Washington, freedom and liberty, etc.

However, what might not be obvious to most Americans is that half of these are pretty much the work of the megamarketing machine. Toy corporations, food corporations, TV networks, companies looking to start a ""season"" for sales, etc. And as for our history, which is frankly quite laughable compared to the up to 10x more extensive histories of other nations... much of it is not as golden as it seems, and is rather built on the enslavement and oppression of minorities. Our land is stolen from indigenous people, the White House and the Capitol were built using slave labor, and the drastic effects of racism still linger to this day. If you live in a suburb (especially a newer one), your community is very likely built on white flight. If you've ever recited the Pledge of Allegiance, you're implicitly upholding Christian supremacy by saying ""under God"" (and that line wasn't even added until the great age of oppression during the 1950s). Our Constitution grants U.S. citizens many rights, but when it was written, the definition of ""citizen"" was effectively ""free rich white landowning man"", and even today, matters like gerrymandering, the rights of noncitizens, and institutional racism remain contentious issues in political discourse. It even affects the American English language, with such idioms as ""piece of cake"" and ""master bedroom"" with racist origins finding their way into everyday vocabulary.

So, TL;DR, pretty much everything that can be described as ""quintessentially American"" is the product of either corporate marketing campaigns or oppression. I'm not saying this means you shouldn't enjoy them, but it's always worth remembering their history in mind - not as nice as you'd expect."

cc: the top flight standard in the UK is a lot lower than even the fifth tier of mens football, so unless they have some personal investment in the match eg friends/family playing, or supporting the men’s team of that same club and so therefore viewing it as a responsibility to also support the women’s side, aside from perhaps some novelty value of watching a women’s match, to watch it over a men’s game of roughly ‘equal theatre’ (eg not the WC final etc) would probably be more out of dislike for men than a loving of women. And yes of course this is a slightly reductionist take, and there are of course lots of other factors than standard for why someone may watch a football match of a lower quality than they could do eg civic pride in their local club etc, but this is posted more in a general sense in terms of most viewers."

I think the invention of Nukes was a good thing for the following reasons.

1. The Pacific war would have been an even bigger loss of human life since Japan was preparing for an Invasion and armed everyone with guns including civilians and were ready to fight a guerilla war. The two nukes prevented that from happening
2. The Cold War would have been WW3 cause without the fear of a nuclear fallout from happening the Soviets or Allies would have been a lot more trigger-happy in some situations for example Cuba or during the Berlin Stand off
3. What also can be considered is since WW2 or better put the invention of the Nuke there hasn't been a war between the big Nuclear states or World Powers

Conclusion: Of course Nukes don't stop wars from happening, but they sure stop them from evolving into an even bigger disaster"

The implication is that your emotional needs are an absolute, overarching thing, almost separate from ourselves - almost that we are slaves to them.

Specifically, I recently realized that I have an emotional need for physical affection - basically, I think, validation through physical touch.  Think cuddling.  I don't want this - either I try to fulfill this need, which will always be inconvenient and non-permanent, or I let it remain unfulfilled and feel lonely.  It seems better to excise it like a tumor.  My ideal conception of myself is fully self-sufficient, with no need for involvement from others - any connection to others, if they happen organically, is just icing on the cake.

I've found that the key to life is willingness.  We do what we want to do.  We can work on growing out of any bad habit or character defect if we are willing enough.  If you are judgmental but don't want to be, you can change yourself if you want to.  Change follows willingness.  So why can't you do the same thing with your emotional needs?

It makes sense to me, yet I've never heard anyone talk about this, and I'm worried that I may be on the wrong track.  So I thought I'd post here."

For reference, I am bisexual myself.

Sexuality refers to what you are sexually attracted to, right? This means you are attracted to penis, vagina, both, or neither. There are no additional parts.

Here's a common definition of pansexual: ""sexually attracted to people regardless of their sex or gender."" And here's the definition for sexuality in general, ""capacity for sexual feelings.""

There's an issue with pansexuality in this case. It seems to be implying that people who bisexual stay with their partner strictly because of sexual desire, which is not the case in most people. Bisexuals also like people regardless of their sex, and this isn't an argument for gender. It just feels like a way to further stereotype bisexuals as promiscuous, poly, and/or not able to commit. Pansexuality, by existing, implies that it is more inclusive than bisexuality.

I don't think both terms should exist considering they basically mean the same thing. This argument has nothing to do with gender expression by the way, it is purely for parts, because that's what the 'sexual' means in the words. Please give me alternative views though, I genuinely just want to understand why the term pansexual needs to exist along bisexual.

ETA: There is a common misconception about what bisexuality is. It doesn't just mean cis men and women, it includes nearly every gender/sex that exists. Also, my mind has been changed regarding this, so please stop attacking if you haven't read all of the comments.

ETA2: If anybody would like to have a further conversation regarding this topic or anything you may agree or disagree with, feel free to send me a DM! It's getting a little hard keeping up with the sheer number of comments but I want anyone who has something to say to me to be able to do it!"

High schoolers have jobs, and have no control. At home, parents decide what they should do. At work, managers decide everything they do. Some have no free time because school is in addition to work, like me. Senior year, therefore, makes teenagers into worse adults, because they have no time to get their life or money situations together.


So not only does senior year cause less time and dedication to jobs and the future of people in their late teens, but it continues the brainwashing of ""students have to go to college"", which is a both financially unfeasible and irresponsible belief for teachers and schools to force on us. Since continuing high school for one more year conditions students to focus less on work and money when they're at the point of making the most important financial decisions of their lives, they end up making people have debt they can never get out of.


I've been told the entire point of school is to ""train students to listen and be productive for the workforce"" (by my stepdad) yet some teenagers already work at the beginning of high school. What is the point?"

This is not politically correct post, and I’m sorry if I’m offending someone. It is not my intent. I invite you, though, to try to be open minded. I’m open to criticism and to have my mind changed. 
It’s also not an attempt to express white - supremacy too.


Humans are wired to recognize patterns. We have still archaic instincts used in cavemen times. We’re also attracted to familiarity, as well as recognizing characteristics of past experiences, being negative or positive. 
Whenever there’s a negative experience, instincts will - no matter the background - try to avoid that same experience again. How? By recognizing patterns and avoiding places, people, etc. That caused it. 
Experiencing cultural differences or having a pleasant-less experience with a different race than yours, will cause a repulsive response to the race in general, rather than thinking in a holistic manner.
Racism in the USA and Canada is more of a cultural difference with minorities, rather than pure hate. With black people, for example, their culture, values, and social norms are different from the average middle - class white person. Of course there will be race preference among race groups. Humans have natural feeling of choosing what is familiar. It is in us since millions of years ago of evolution, and learning from ordeals.
I believe it’s not wrong having assumptions about a race in particular. It’s part of survival. I think it’s natural in us, and fighting a innate gut - reaction that developed throughout evolution is pointless.




Im open to criticism. Not only about the topic, but also writting, spelling, etc.


EDIT:
I’m not encouraging racism. It’s not right. I’m just stating that racism is in human nature by default."

0,2022-12-11,CMV: Harry and Megan Will Are Forced to Sell The Rights to their Lives in Order to Live,u/VerFur,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zjhtrh/cmv_harry_and_megan_will_are_forced_to_sell_the/,changemyview,"The trailer for Harry and Megan’s Netflix special makes me feel so uncomfortable and full of pity for Harry and Megan. This also includes any royal family (RF) member, even those who marry in. Please change my view. These are my issues with their circumstances and why I think they are a borderline human rights issue:

- Those born into royalty have no way out. They can never live a normal life. From the moment they are born to when they die they do not have any conventional privacy. By “normal” I mean that these are people who could never go to the grocery store and remain anonymous or enroll their children in public school due to safety concerns. 

- They will and should always require security details and specialized living accommodations to ensure their safety simply because they were born into royalty (or married into it, read the next point). I maintain anyone with that much notoriety and family money deserves protection from violence. Be that kidnapping, stalking, murder, etc. This requires a constant, large amount of money. 

- For my arguments I choose to believe those who marry into royalty are doing so for love. The heart wants what it wants and those who marry in should be allowed the same pity as born members. Their life partner will mean they are subjected to the same safety concerns I have for the family. 

- I know Megan is an actress. It doesn’t mean she is exempt from my concerns because she “chose” to marry Harry (see previous point, I’m a romantic). She no longer has her choice of roles to play anymore. She has lost a core freedom of vocation because of who she married. 

- Because of the constant safety concerns and need for security the RF depend on the crown or will always require huge sums of money in order to have some semblance of peace. This further limits any profession they may choose outside of traditional royal duties. No normal salary would fund the lifestyle requirements they’ll always need met in order to live. 

- I also understand these people have more money than God. It really doesn’t matter to me because I think autonomy, freedom of movement, freedom to marry who you want (look at Charles and Diana, or any of the monarchy. They have to marry who the crown approves of, can’t be some random Joe off the street), and ability to live without your entire life being scrutinized, as priceless. Their money enables their oppression and does not alleviate it. 

For these reasons I believe that although Harry and Megan “made it out” that they are still forced to sell themselves to the highest, most consistent bidder. This means they will always be hawking out themselves for entertainment audiences in order to fund the barest necessity of security, simply because of which family they were born and married into. 

Disclaimers: 

This is not saying pretty much 80% of everyone else’s lives aren’t hard or that we don’t have relative security concerns (ahem, here’s looking at you American public school system). Only saying that their particular situation begets constant threats simply because their public, recognizable figures. 

This is not saying people aren’t already forced to sell themselves in perfectly valid worse circumstances. This is not saying the RF are THEE worst genetic lottery, only that they are one. 
 
Please please please give me valid reasons not to pity Harry and Megan (I fixate on them because I see them as in the worst bind of “can’t live with them, can’t live without them), or really any of the RF because their lives and circumstances seem like an egregious, archaic voyeurism with no place in a modern, civilized society. 

I would greatly love to not have a disgusted, knee jerk reaction to how tasteless it is that this couple is doing what they have to (selling the rights to their lives by hopping in front of cameras) in order to survive."

However, we traded an arms dealer who has undoubtedly killed many Americans and citizens of our allies - even if he is no longer a threat to the US - for a basketball player. The message this sends to our enemies is to continue to detain Americans on BS charges, and that they can get the worst of the worst back and they have all the power.

The constant refrain when Whelan is discussed is that a decision wasn’t made , Grinner or Whelan, but rather neither Whelan nor anyone else was on the table. In essence, take it or leave it. 

Now when it comes to terrorist, we have let all manner of people die to remain true to our policy of not negotiating with terrorist, no matter the consequences.

That’s why this was a bad trade. Change my view.

Edit - Before we go too far down the Whelan is more valuable than Grinner rabbit hole. I don’t think anyone is more valuable then anyone else as a human being. The fact that basketball player for marine seems wrong should really not even have been part of my post. I really only mean that we should just not negotiate. Trade, yes. We should get, by any means necessary, those that our enemies want so bad that we are in control. Not a negotiation - a take it or leave it ultimatum in our favor."

I really want to get a new outlook on this one, since I know many people who think otherwise but can't seem to give me a good argument. Also, I live in Germany, so I'm not well versed in Guns and all that I have seen one but never shoot

So I'm hoping some off you could give me a few (preferably with an example/situation). Because as it stands I just think giving Guns to Civilians causes more harm than good and here are my reasons why.

1. According to data 2020 45,222 People died in the US due to gun related injuries (24,292 of them were due to suicide) 2021 the number went up to about 20.726 (only murder). While in the EU on the other hand only 6,700 people died.
2. I know the Population of the US and let's take for example Germany, don't compare the US has a much bigger one. Also, the EU doesn't allow guns to be owned by Civilians (with that I mean people who don't use them for work or sport). So for fairness’s sake I looked up data on the number of people who died due to murder in EU which was 5200 (sadly I could only find statistics from 2016 if one off you guys found newer ones pls link them in the comments if you want)
3. Often times I have seen one defend guns with the argument \`**\`guns don't kill people, people do**'' but to me this is just wrong because if they don't then '' **If guns don't kill people, people kill people, then guns don't save lives, people save lives.** Also, if you take everything by word then it might be true, but a gun makes it a hell of a lot easier
4. What I also often hear is that you don't need a gun to kill and true, but an object who's sole purpose is to do just that makes it easier (seen in the statistics on gun related deaths)
5. I also know that when criminals want a gun they get one even if it's illegal. But this might sound ignorant, but said criminals who have the means to get one even when outlawed aren't normally just petty burglars, so the chances to encounter them when you are a law-abiding citizen are pretty low.
6. And lastly, the one who makes me dislike the US gun laws the most, the school shootings. 35 school shootings 2021 in the US, 47 School shootings 2022 in the US. 288 in total compare that to Europe Germany 7 in total and the rest as well were all in the single digits

Now I know that you cannot ban guns in the US there are more guns than people in the US after all and it basically part of their culture by now. And I know that 90% of Gun owners are responsible human beings. The problem for me is that a gun in the wrong hands an extremist, psychologically ill or murderer can cause devastating harm to innocent human beings. So to me, the negatives just far outweigh the positives.

But for that reason this sub was created, so I'm hoping you guys/girls can make me start to look at these things with a different outlook or just straight up change my mind"
41,2022-12-11,"CMV: In most cases, TV shows and movies should not use captions like ""[speaks spanish]""",u/Cultist_O,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zjlhe3/cmv_in_most_cases_tv_shows_and_movies_should_not/,changemyview,"For simplicity, I'm going to use ""English"" to refer to the language of the show's expected audience.

When a character is speaking a language other than English, they should either translate the language in the captions, **or spell out whatever was said in the original language**. (So if a character says ""que passa"" in an English show, the closed captions should either say ""Que passa?"" Or ""What happened?"", but never ""[Speaks Spanish]"".)

Translation would enhance the experience, but I understand it's more work, and they may want to give the person reading a more similar experience to the hearing person. **Putting the text in the original language however gives the reader the closest possible experience to the hearer.** (If they understand the language, but just can't make out what's being said, they'll understand. If they don't understand the language, they still have the experience they'd've had if they'd heard it)

I'm so sick of struggling to hear what's being said in my second language (or other languages I've a base understanding of) and not being able to understand because it just says ""[speaks x language]"". Somehow it's even more frustrating when I see such a caption when I *am* able to make it out what was said.

I'm willing to make an exception for small budget productions, particularly if they're using digital speach-to-text technology, but for anything big, and/or captions generated professionally or from the script, I just don't get why the viewing experience isn't worth it.

Artificial languages aren't really within the scope of this CMV.

**Edit:** apparently some of my sentences were weirdly messed up

**Edit 2:** Everyone just keeps talking about how translation is bad for story telling in some cases. I acknowledged from the start that using the original language would often be preferable, (now bold) primarily for this reason. I'm going to stop responding to messages that only point out issues with translating, unless they at least mention writing out the original language."

Though the Babylon Bee isn't especially funny I believe they should be able to be on twitter, before Elon purchased the platform they were suspended due to a rather lame joke, now, some of you may have found the joke in question offensive or in bad taste, that is fine, but in my humble view it was WAY over the line for twitter to suspend them for it. The same with Jordan Peterson making some insensitive comments towards a famous celebrity. Just to repeat myself again, it is totally fine to not agree with the views of these accounts (I certainly don't) but my issues comes from people having to live in fear for being suspended over such milquetoast comments. With Elon I feel like that fear has somewhat dissipated, though he is certainly not perfect and I hope he will let both sides flourish I unironically think that it is a bit more chill now on twitter in the sense that people don't have to fear suspension over bad taste humour or slightly controversial opinions.

I think that FIFA need to come up with a better method of determining the winner of a game in a tied match at full time. While extra time of 30 mins is played, I get the feeling that many teams, especially weaker teams will play defensive games to take a chance at the lottery that is penalty shoot outs. This is very much against the spirit of the game for many other reasons also.

1: Penalties are an individual effort where as football is a team sport.

2: The name itself ""penalty"" refers to the misdeed that a defending player committed against offense player. it is essential a sanction for denying the opposing team a goal scoring opportunity, the offensive team is given a ""Penalty shot"" to remedy this . At the end of 120 mins, neither side is guilty of anything other than dragging the game out.

3: Penalties is essentially a random chance lottery of shots. While there is a degree of nerve to it (poor Kane), I am sure goalkeepers will tell you that alot of the time they guess right or wrong which way the ball will go.

4: Because of point 3, the victorious team cannot be said to have decisively beaten the other team through skill. Had the game being decided by a cointoss, the fans wont have bragging rights that their team bested the other side."
1,2022-12-12,CMV: Religions should be condemned for the heinous actions done directly in its name,u/Proud_Max1mum,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zjyjyw/cmv_religions_should_be_condemned_for_the_heinous/,changemyview,"(I know religion is a bad term for what I am talking about, just know I am not talking about “every religion”, I am talking about the big ones (Islam, Christianity etc) and those who are similar, I know it's vague but I just don't know of a better term to use)

Now don’t misunderstand the title, I don’t mean that everything said or done connected to any religion should apply, but those done in direct continuation of the religion’s texts, ideas and culture to some extent.

Now what I am talking about is that even though some of the most unethical, unfair and corrupt actions, values and traditions were done in direct continuation of or caused by various religions. Does the religions involved always get seen as an unlucky third party just caught in the crosshairs of inherently evil individuals. Well, I don’t believe in inherently evil individuals, and feel like the religions that are at the center of these heinous actions should be held more responsible. 

Now I know there are inherent problems with this, mostly involving how impossible it is to group up different religions, but I feel like it is unfair that religion can just slide under the strict standard we have set. Just to illustrate my point I want to make an analogy, we all know about the storming of congress on the 6th of January, now even though Donald Trump never told anyone to do that, did he take the blame because it was “his people”. I just don’t see why we it must be so different with religions, why are we not allowed to blame Islam for certain acts of terrorism, and not hold Christianity responsible for the continuation of what I deem unethical if not evil indoctrination of youth. Now again don’t get me wrong, I don’t believe that any random Muslim or Christian should feel guilt for actions done by totally separate individuals. But I do think we should stop alienating the people who do unethical things from their affiliated religion, stop hiding behind “their actions have nothing to do with the actual religion”. As todays public standard involves condemning anything or anyone connected to something or someone deemed evil or controversial etc. 

Now please don’t accuse me of overgeneralizing, I believe that humans are humans, with nobody being inherently superior or inferior to anyone else in any way. I believe that the way we talk and think about religion is the problem, and how anecdotal and unsupported their affiliated arguments generally are. I think in today’s day and age we need to use formal argumentation following certain rules to achieve a proper discussion. I want to urge people to stop thinking of religion as some special and unique, like it is somehow any different to a political party. They are just as open to criticism as any other institution, along with those who willingly chose to affiliate with them openly. 

Now I have to admit this is coming from a biased viewpoint, whereas everyone sees happiness and fulfillment connected to religion, I see applied confusion, brainwashing and suffering. I just want religion to normalize criticizing religions and those who chose to affiliate themselves with them, not always having it be a “sensitive topic” and being made to feel like bad person for criticizing “such wonderful and happy organizations”. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts."

The other half to third is just that most politicians are trying to “win”. As they see this as the way to best serve their country instead of trying to actually understand where the other side is coming from.

Like, here’s a good example:

People who are *for* guns think it is a fantastic right to have and see nothing wrong with teaching their 7 year old how to shoot.

But people who are *aganst* guns think it is akin to handing a murderer a weapon in a crowded room.

Now I understand that both right and left have pro gun peolle. But the right side has *no* antigun people. So that why uses that example…

Sorry if it’s a bad one, but I hope you get my point.

The way people have dove head first into generating AI art all across the web shows they’re super into it. I’m terrified it will replace real art made by humans (which in my opinion is what makes art *art* anyway. We already have people trying to pass it off as the real thing, not to mention it literally steals art from online to mash it together into something different. 

As AI gets more and more intelligent and ubiquitous, it seems impossible to me for us humans to hang onto jobs. I can’t understand why anybody wants this? I don’t understand why the people who are working to develop this AI seemingly don’t care that they will help ruin something as special and important as art—among other jobs. I guess because they have job security. 

AI seems like it will inevitably lead to the downfall of society; what are we to do when most people can’t work jobs anymore? Just die?  Is everyone supposed to accept that everything in the art field—writing, visual art, etc—will be replaced by AI and no one gets to do those jobs anymore? Are there good reasons for AI to exist *at all?*

Im actually desperately hoping someone can CMV on this—I don’t think a world without real human-made art is one I want to live in. It sounds extremely bleak and lacking humanity. So please! CMV!"

I feel like it would be better for this site if they could at least punish mods who don't follow the rules of the subs that they moderate. For example, I remember a post on clevercombacks once that was critical of Elon Musk that was not a comeback at all and clearly in violation of the rules. A mod openly said something like ""we know that this post is not a comeback and in violation of the rules, but we don't care because screw Elon Musk. We are not taking it down so stop reporting it"". I am sure that it happens much more often than that, but that is one of the few times where they openly acknowledged it. To me, the fact that moderators can be so blatant about their abuse is unhealthy for the site and bad for the average user in general.

Another major issue is moderators using subs that they mod to push their own agendas when they are irreverent to the sub. For example, I remember when a mod on the Pokemon Go sub made a pinned reply (one that shows up on every post in that sub) pushing a pro-choice rhetoric. He/she is free to believe in that rhetoric and spread it in the appropriate subs, but I feel like that was not one of them. If I remember correctly the pinned reply also stated that anyone that voiced opposition to that action would be banned.

A final issue I have is moderators using their power to craft subs into being something that isn't congruent to the title. For example Whitepeopletwitter and Insanepeoplefacebook are almost nothing except for Democratic propaganda, the former contains tweets from people that aren't even white and the latter contains posts that aren't even from Facebook at all. Nothing about either of those subs (the title or description) suggest that they are political at all but feature pretty much nothing but politics and the mods openly support it and ban anyone who doesn't. The worst example is Badchoicesgoodstories. The name suggests that it is a sub for people doing dumb but funny things and the description agrees with that. However, that sub is again, nothing but Democrat propaganda and if you complain about that you are banned. Most of the posts are made by the mod of that sub and a handful of other accounts that I suspect are his alt accounts."

This is not a discussion about whether religions, or the concept of religion in general, are right or wrong, nor is it about whether conservatism is right or wrong.*

To many Christians, conservatism seems like a natural extension of their faith. After all, the Bible tells us to honor our fathers and mothers and to respect the authority of those in positions of leadership. We are advised to honor our fathers and our mothers (Exodus 20:12), and to be subject to the governing authorities (Romans 13:1). However, when we dig deeper, we can see that conservatism and resistance to change often involve the worship of the past, which contradicts the Lord's commandments.

The Bible strongly condemns idolatry in numerous passages. For example, in the aforementioned commandments, Exodus 20:3-5, God says, ""You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them."" Isaiah 44:9-10 serves as another staunch condemnation of idolatry: ""All who make idols are nothing, and the things they treasure are worthless. Who shapes a god and casts an idol, which can profit nothing?""

As Christians, we are called to live in the present and focus on the things of the Kingdom of God. The Bible tells us in Colossians 3:1-2, ""Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.""

Conservatism, on the other hand, is focused on preserving the past and maintaining traditions and institutions that have been in place for many years. Conservatives often look to the past as a model for how society should be organized and governed. They may advocate for traditional gender roles, for example, or for a return to the ""golden age"" of the family farm. But this focus on the past can easily become idolatry when it leads us to place the artifacts of the world, and cultural and social norms of the past, above the Lord and his commandments. Furthermore, the conservative resistance towards change and progress in the world can be interpreted as a rejection of the notion that God is constantly working in the world to bring about His good will (Philippians 2:13).

In his epistle to the Colossians, Paul advises Christians to avoid clinging to tradition for the sake of tradition: ""...do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ."" (Colossians 2:16-17). In this passage, Paul is arguing against the idea that people should follow certain traditions and customs simply because they have always been done that way. Instead, he emphasizes the importance of focusing on Christ and the reality of the Kingdom of God.

As such, conservatism, with its emphasis on the past and its traditions, can be seen as a form of idolatry from a Christian perspective. As Christians, we must be careful to always put God above all worldly matters, and to seek his guidance on how to navigate the changing world around us. The worship of any entities aside from God, including the past, is a form of idolatry, and those who worship idols will not inherit the Kingdom of God.

P.S. In addition to the issue of idolatry, conservatism can also be problematic from a Christian perspective because it often involves the prioritization of certain values over others. For example, many conservatives place a high value on individual freedom and personal responsibility, but may not prioritize issues like social justice and caring for the poor in the same way. However, as Christians, we are called to prioritize the teachings of Jesus and the principles of love and compassion for all people, regardless of their social status or wealth."
0,2022-12-12,CMV: pro lifers are hypocrites and should not be trusted nor taken seriously enough to make decisions on abortion.,u/Andromeda-Native,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zk9a6q/cmv_pro_lifers_are_hypocrites_and_should_not_be/,changemyview,"Firstly, I absolutely respect everyone’s freedom to have their own opinions and views.

However, the moment your view is imposed upon other people and affects other people, I take issue with it.

Especially and even more so when your views expose hypocrisy and disingenuousness. Carelessness and selfishness. 

Pro lifers want children to be born because they “are human too” and “everybody deserves to exist”

It’s actually a nice and touching sentiment until you realise something. 

All humans, especially innocent young humans deserve the bare minimum of LOVE. 

pro lifers certainly cannot guarantee that. 

When unwanted babies are born as a result of abortions being illegal, pro lifers will not be the ones to:

1) breastfeed the baby and provide skin to skin to develop a bond every baby needs 

2) they will not feed the baby/child home cooked meals made with love 

3) clothe the baby 

4) provide shelter and toys for the baby 

5) educate the baby, life lessons, virtue, wisdom etc 

6) financially support the baby

7) emotionally support 

8) ensure a good quality of life for the baby 

9) provide the baby with general love and attention 


Any concern that a pro lifer has for “life” stops immediately after the baby is born.

 The point at which it actually becomes “life” in my opinion and the point at which their concern would be MOST needed. 

After birth, pro lifers usually have no comment nor concern for the LIFE that now actually exists.

They suggest “put it up for adoption” so casually as if it isn’t a horrific and heartbreaking decision for a mother to make.

They say “put it up for adoption” as if life in an adoption centre/home or foster home is the same as life with loving parents and siblings.

As if these poor children don’t go all the way adulthood without any experience of love from parents.

It is shocking and disingenuous to have this much concern for a fetus that does not experience any suffering nor being devoid of love but have no care for the small children and babies completely devoid of it as a result of your literal selfish opinion 

I’d further argue that the entire basis of a pro lifers view is to offer mere lip service and a wish to be or feel politically correct and/or superior morally. 

Therefore, to minimise the amount of human suffering and callousness in our existence, pro lifers rights should be limited to only their opinion on the matter and their personal choice to carry a child to term. 

They should NOT be making laws for the whole as they certainly will not pick up the pieces left by such laws.

They should not be allowed to force suffering of both mothers and innocent new humans into existence because of their literal OPINION on a matter. Because frankly, that is all it is. An opinion.

And their opinion is hypocritical and counter intuitive. 

Abortion is usually a very difficult decision that is made. It is usually very moral, unselfish and humane compared to the alternative. A life of pure misery and suffering of an innocent baby. 

Disclaimers: yes, some pro lifers adopt which is lovely but the vast majority of pro lifers do not adopt. They simply enable an ever growing list of babies that wait and wait to be adopted and loved."

Today I was reading a question about child costs and most people said one parent should stay home because it saves money. We pay for expensive daycare and it's still only a third of what my wife makes, not including retirement contributions, as an elementary school teacher. Not exactly a high-paying career.  Unless you're only making $15 or so an hour, it makes a lot of sense for both parents to work and pay for daycare.

I am not looking for arguments such as ""I don't want someone else to watch my kid."" I am talking about economic and personal finance ONLY. 

So, throbbing brain of reddit, tell me why middle and upper middle class families should have a stay at home parent. This obviously excludes millionaires and people with really high paying jobs where a spouse literally doesn't need to work anyway.

My wife brings home $4,400/month after taxes. Daycare for our two kids is about $2,150. That means she brings in $2,250 extra every month above what daycare costs. Plus she stays current in her field and continues to contribute to her pension."

However, as I've watched AI develop, with Chat GPT just being the latest iteration, my view is now that AI is not going to be something where a team comes up with a new program that's designed to be self-aware and succeeds at it. Instead, I think we will move away from that goal, and just keep working on developing more and more accurate programs just focused on providing responses that simulate thought, but are actually just mechanical. 

As we get better and better at this, eventually we will reach a point where our programs can easily pass the Turing test as well as any other test of true consciousness we have. For all intents and purposes, it would appear to be fully conscious and self-aware, although it reached that point by just pretending to be.

The irony is that sooner or later, one of these programs may become complex enough, and have an overall design and learning ability similar to us, that it actually DOES become self-aware. But we would have no way to know that, as it would be answering all of our questions in the same way as if it was just faking it really well.

So long story short, I don't think we will ever know if we develop true AI or just a really good imitation, as there would be no way for us to tell reality from fiction. Am I missing something obvious?"

0,2022-12-12,CMV: Death needs to be eliminated and humans should be immortal.,u/HumanNoImAlienCat,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zkix6g/cmv_death_needs_to_be_eliminated_and_humans/,changemyview,"It seems to be the commonly accepted philosophy of humanity that death is a necessary part of life. Sure most people don't want to die ""right now"". They don't want their loved ones to die ""right now"". But they seem perfectly fine to accept that some day, these things will happen, and that one should learn to be at peace with these things.

**I strongly disagree.** One of humanity's top priorities right now should be putting research and resources into targeting and eliminating the causes of aging biologically (as aging is the biggest culprit for making sure everyone dies.) Then all other causes should be eliminated through means of pursuing mind uploading or making backup copies of a body or consciousness.

By whatever means necessary, death should be eliminated.

**Reason 1: Death restricts the structure of life and society.**

Since humans are only expected to live 80 years or so, choices must be made and valuable things must be sacrificed to fit a life within that timeframe. For example, education! People are expected to complete high school and choose a job/life path within the first two decades of life, and then either stop education altogether or perhaps do a few more decades at the most if they choose it as a life path. But if humans were immortal and could live for thousands or millions of years, these barriers would not exist. People could be seen as ""children"" by society for the first 100 years of their life for instance and have all that time to decide what they want to be. And then those that choose to pursue higher education could have centuries or millennia or more ahead of them...

**Reason 2: Death takes all possible meaning away from life.**

As there is no objective meaning to life, for life to have a meaning for an individual they must create this meaning themselves. They may create a beautiful meaning. But no matter what they do, when they die this meaning will be destroyed as their consciousness will be destroyed. So if there is death, then life can have no lasting meaning.

(By the way, I am taking a non-religious standpoint in this post and so please do not use religion or an afterlife as an argument.)

Also, I'll address a few points that I think could commonly come up.

**One: ""The fact that life is finite makes it more beautiful and meaningful""**

I have heard this ""argument"" often, yet I have yet to understand the actual reasoning behind it. I already argued why death destroys meaning. And so as you can see, I am confused about the statement that death *gives* life meaning. Here is something I like to say: \*\*""\*\****Moments*** **are beautiful and fleeting. That doesn't mean that life itself must be.""** If you were stuck in a moment forever, then it would stagnate and lose all meaning. But life is many, many moments strung together, each being different than the last. I see no reason it would become any less meaningful if it continued endlessly.

**Two: ""What about overpopulation?""**

It is true that overpopulation is a problem. However, there can be solutions to this. For instance, having less children... at least for now. I hope that humanity can start branching out to live on Mars and the Moon and maybe even further within the next century. Supporting the growing human population is an issue that needs to be addressed, but immortality grants an increased amount of minds with more and more life experience to give solutions to it...

**Three: ""The older generations will stay in power and resist new ideas""**

The fact that this is brought up here showcases a fundamental problem with society, not with the idea of immortality. What I am saying is that it is a separate problem to be fixed that old or archaic ways of thinking are allowed to run a society. Basically I acknowledge it presents an issue, but 1) it is not fundamentally an immortality thing, it is a this-specific-society thing and 2) it is not nearly enough to outweigh the upsides of eliminating death.

13,2022-12-12,CMV: [UK centric] White privilege is not a provable/verifiable concept in the UK,u/casimirtiger,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zkjn69/cmv_uk_centric_white_privilege_is_not_a/,changemyview,"*This CMV is inspired by recent UK centric subreddits where the UK Education Secretary outlined her belief that white privilege is “not fact”.*

My belief is that this is a largely American concept that has filtered through popular culture and the internet into mostly English speaking countries but across the Western world to a degree. It can now be found as a concept in e.g. [HR training](https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/content/features/are-you-doing-diversity-training-right) in UK companies, introduced as a concept in [schools](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/take-white-privilege-test-to-help-decolonise-schools-teachers-urged-f67tr55qd) and part of regular [discourse](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/02/a-racist-a-judge-and-a-clear-case-of-white-privilege).

While I accept that racism is very real in the UK, and indeed everywhere, and there is certainly institutionalised discrimination in UK institutions, on a whole host of grounds, including race, I have not seen evidence to show that white privilege is “inarguable” or “a fact” as many people assert.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is white privilege?**

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_privilege) defines it as “*White privilege, or white skin privilege, is the societal privilege that benefits white people over non-white people in some societies, particularly if they are otherwise under the same social, political, or economic circumstances*”.

[BBC Bitesize](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zrvkbqt) claims that “.*..white privilege... is actually more about the absence of inconvenience, the absence of an impediment or challenge*”.

The [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/white-privilege) defines it as “*the fact of people with white skin having advantages in society that other people do not have*”.

So as simply as possible I am taking it to mean some form of advantage (or lack of disadvantage) for people that have white skin over all others in a particular society. I am assuming that everyone that has white skin would have white privilege. One also needs to account for other factors of discrimination, for example, wealth, gender, sexual orientation, etc. (i.e. “all other things being equal”)

&amp;#x200B;

**What is white?**

The UK government outlines in its [style guide](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/style-guide/ethnic-groups) the ethnic groups that might be recorded in e.g. the Census. Not included in white are groups such as Arabs, Indians, and those from several black backgrounds. Notably the UK also breaks down white into subcategories including Irish, Roma and Irish traveller, likely to due historic discrimination with these groups. What is more unclear is how groups such as those from e.g. Turkey are counted but should not make a significant difference to the CMV.

&amp;#x200B;

**My assertion**

In order for white privilege as a concept to be true it must be observable/measurable, ideally in data. This may manifest in host of education, social, economic, etc. indicators/measures.

We must be able to show that anyone/grouping with white skin should have a measurable benefit over any other person/grouping that does not have white skin (again with all other factors being as equal as possible).

&amp;#x200B;

**Evidence to the contrary**

**Education** – example of [A-grades](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/education-skills-and-training/a-levels-apprenticeships-further-education/students-aged-16-to-18-achieving-3-a-grades-or-better-at-a-level/latest) by ethnicity – Chinese students receive the highest grades. Indian students perform better than white students who in turn outperform black students, but within that grouping (white) students from the Roma community receive the least amount of A’s.  With respect to [progression](https://preview.redd.it/qm8cns8zy2521.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9b2c2b3546778d4b2e55543d5565be176d67bae) to university – Asian, black and mixed ethnic groups enter university at a greater percentage of their populations in the UK than white groups, including “white British”. One must account for sex in this data (for example with white females entering university at a greater rate than black males) however looking at each entry on a sex basis (and deprivation basis, red vs blue bars) the data is clear.

**Employment** – A study by the [university of Oxford](http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk/?p=1299) whereby near-identical applications (barring ethnicity, names, etc.) are made to jobs and call-backs for those applicants are recorded. What this data shows is that white British and “Western” white groups receive the grater number call-backs. Those from e.g. a Nigerian background receive the lowest. What the data also shows however is that the Indian applicant receives a greater number of call-backs than the Russian applicant. There is a bias, but it does not appear to be simply for being white.

I wanted to find better data for ""top jobs"" in the UK but it appears hard to come by beyond a white/non-white basis. However, as a best guess and non-scientifically examining the names of some of the top FTSE 100 companies (e.g. [here](https://www.sharesmagazine.co.uk/article/the-ceos-making-investors-rich-the-ftse-100-bosses-behind-the-biggest-returns)) would tend to imply we find white men with typically ""Western European"" names. There does not appear to be any that are obviously Eastern European, Russian, Greek, etc., in addition to a lack of typically African or Asian names for example.

**Justice** – [Arrest rates](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/policing/number-of-arrests/latest) show that black people are arrested at a greater rate than anyone else in UK society, however Chinese, Arab and Indian people are the least likely to be arrested. The same goes for data for [stop and search](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/policing/stop-and-search/latest). Data also shows that white people in the UK are the most likely to be [convicted](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/courts-sentencing-and-tribunals/prosecutions-and-convictions/latest).

**Economic** – [Home ownership rates](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/housing/owning-and-renting/home-ownership/latest) by ethnicity show that those of an Indian ethnicity have the greatest rate of home ownership. Those from the “white other” background (i.e. not British or Irish) have a lower rate of home ownership than from a black Caribbean background. White Irish (possibly the most long-standing ethnic group in the UK) have a lower home ownership rate than the population average, and lower than those from the Pakistani community. [Household income](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/work-pay-and-benefits/pay-and-income/household-income/latest) by ethnicity does not appear to have the white group further disaggregated but nevertheless shows black households tend to have a lower income, with Asian being the highest.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

From data that I can find there is a clear societal advantages and disadvantages for particular ethnic groups, however it does not appear to be simply be about being white and not-white.

In order for white privilege to be correct, one would have this advantage purely by virtue of having white skin, however evidence shows that groups such as Eastern Europeans, Russians, Roma, Irish Travellers, etc. face disadvantage compared to non-white groups such as those with Chinese and Indian backgrounds in the UK.

Data certainly supports that being “white British” (having a “common” British name, look, accent, etc.) confers “advantage”, and being cultural adjacent (e.g. American, Australian, German) tends to provide advantage, but there is no clear advantage to having white skin generally speaking.

Put simply, if I am Romanian, from the Roma or Irish Traveller communities, etc., all evidence that I can find shows that I glean no advantage for having white skin compared to some non-white groups (typically Chinese, Indian, etc.). What can be said of the data from the UK is that there is a “black disadvantage” (for lack of better term) but not a broader ""non-white disadvantage"".

I acknowledge that some of the examples I gave (e.g. arrest rates) do not account for all factors such as income/class, but it should be for those asserting that white privilege is real in the UK to record/find/measure the data that shows e.g. disproportionate arrest rates for all groups other than those with white skin, with all other things being equal. For white privilege to be accurate we should not be able to find a distinct white group (e.g. Eastern Europeans) getting arrested at a greater rate than a non-white group (e.g. Indian, Arab) when all other differences are accounted for.

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes**

It should also be worth noting that with respect to racism vs. xenophobia discussions that tend to pop up, that the UK (in the equality act) defines racism as including discrimination on ethnic and national identity grounds. The UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination does similar. This is in any case not relevant to my assertion as I am attempting to show it is not provable that for large groups of people white white skin, there is a societal advantage (with all other things being equal).

I also concede that what *could* be going on is that being white does indeed confer an advantage in the UK but that the nationality/culture *disadvantage* received for being Romanian, etc. is greater than that received by e.g. an Indian person due to their skin colour. If that is the case then it points to discourse around discrimination and anti-discrimination initiatives (scholarships for Eastern Europeans for example) in the UK being out of kilter to where focus might need to be."

But I highly disagree with that for the following reasons:

1. The general audience has a negative preconception about DC, and that stigma is not going away anytime soon, at least not in this decade. So while a reboot might be exciting news for someone who is already a DCEU fan, the casual audience is still not going to care. And if the general audience is lukewarm about your IP at best, then it shouldn't be a surprise when the upcoming movies disappoint in the box office.

2. A reboot doesn't guarantee better quality. How are you so confident that the next cinematic universe won't also have its fair share of duds? How would the quality of a newly introduced franchise with no previous baggage like Black Adam have changed? If you're simply rebooting your cinematic universe because your movies suck, then are you gonna reboot the next one as soon as you get a few mixed reviews on Rotten Tomatoes?

3. If you're not rebooting because of the quality of the previous movies, but because of a messy established continuity, then how are you going to start the new continuity? Are you really going to start from square 1 with Superman's and Batman's origins being told all over again? Don't you see how unbelievably stale that is? Especially when so many people are complaining about ""superhero fatigue""?

Keep in mind, I'm talking about a hard reboot. I have no problem with DC doing a soft reboot where they keep everything that worked and toss out everything that didn't."

Wade, Republicans had a great deal going on with abortion. They were able to count on the strong pro-life faction of the US without having to actually change anything and take no blame for it. 

However, without the strong Roe v. Wade defense, Republicans are going to have a hard time navigating abortion in the US. [74% of Republicans believe abortion matters at the voting booth](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/vast-majority-republicans-support-abortion-exceptions-rape-incest-moth-rcna52237), so this is an issue that could impact Republicans long term. 

One way is the rape or incest exception. [75% of Republicans believe anti-abortion laws should have exceptions for rape or incest](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/vast-majority-republicans-support-abortion-exceptions-rape-incest-moth-rcna52237). However, out of 18 states with abortion bans, [only 5 include an exception for rape and 4 include an exception for incest](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2022/post-roe-v-wade-state-bans-no-exceptions-rape-incest/). So, why do most states not include them? I don't have an answer for incest, so that won't be hard for Republicans to fix, but a rape exception would be incredibly hard to implement. How certain does the clinic need to be that the woman was raped for them to perform the abortion? Does the rapist need to be convicted? Well, [less than 1% of rapists are convicted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/06/less-than-percent-rapes-lead-felony-convictions-least-percent-victims-face-emotional-physical-consequences/), so that probably would miss a lot of women. Does there need to be a rape kit done? With [rape kits being used unethically](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/15/us/san-francisco-police-rape-kit-dna.html) and about [400,000 untested rape kits sitting in storage](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-many-of-the-uss-40000_b_5845052), a lot of women may be hesitant to get one done or it may not get processed in time for the procedure. That's not even mentioning [cases where rape kits aren't offered at the hospital](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/many-hospitals-dont-have-rape-kits-proposed-legislation-aims-to-change-that/), where women are going to be really stuck. So if rape kits aren't the answer, what other options are there? Does the woman have to just name her rapist? What if she doesn't know who raped her? What if she was raped abroad? The [rape exceptions in place often consist of a lengthy, exhausting, and potentially triggering](https://news.yahoo.com/how-do-rape-and-incest-exceptions-work-in-state-abortion-bans-090024808.html) experience that makes it difficult for victims to receive healthcare. This is an extremely high hurdle that Republicans will likely have to struggle with for awhile to figure it out. 

Another way this will hurt Republicans long term is young people. In battleground states, [half of young voters said that the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade had a major impact on their vote](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2022/12/12/young-voters-support-for-democrats-slipped-this-year-poll-finds/?sh=422debad7a2d). This is bad news for Republicans, as youth turnout has been on the rise, [with this past elections seeing the second highest youth turnout in thirty years](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/10/1135810302/turnout-among-young-voters-was-the-second-highest-for-a-midterm-in-past-30-years) at about 27%. While this number isn't super high, if trends continue it will more than likely rise, at which Republicans will need to start appealing to them in order to secure more votes. 

So, at this point, what are their options as a party? They've spent decades relying on the pro-life vote to win elections, so how can they pass laws that both appeals to this strong base while also appeasing their constituents who fall somewhere between pro-life and pro-choice as well as youth voters? I don't know. That's why I think overturning Roe v. Wade was so detrimental for the Republicans, as it took an issue that most elected politicians didn't have to twice about before firmly planting themselves in the pro-life camp to an issue where they have to write laws delicately to appeal to the most amount of people possible."

i just got forced out of a curly haired group on facebook because of how racist they were towards yt ppl and our curly hair. the description says that they allow all hair types and products but apparently that is only aimed at black coily hair. 

i reported some of the comments on a post that were being really racist and dropped a comment myself about how different hair types will soak up different things and assuming yt ppl are trynna still products is weird and low-key racist. i then got muted for ‘being racist as reverse racism doesn’t exist’ and then harassed in the comments and dms to leave as i clearly have ‘yt privilege’ and won’t know the struggles of ‘real curly hair’. which is awkward for them really. the admins and mods then started mocking me further in the comment section when i was not able to see it. 

why can’t we all just appreciate curls? every race has curly hair somewhere in it. we should be helping each other out not screaming about how ‘yt ppl think every curl product is for them’. unless it says on the bottle that it’s specifically for poc then everyone can test it out to see if it suits their hair. i’ve seen some of my yt friends hair take to products even my indian friends hair can’t handle. hair is hair and no two curls are the same. 

curly hair girls and guys stick together no matter the race, size or curl type because if ur hair poofs up when brushed, we all feel the same pain. i’m at the start of my curl journey so this has really dampened my enthusiasm to embrace my hair. it’s a sad day for the curl community but this just proves some things will never change"

This phrase can be used to describe both a meritocracy(or at least our current meritocracy) and an ableist system.

Being disabled for the most part implies it makes you less capable and if it doesn't make you less capable a lot of people are going to perceive you as less capable anyway due to the reverse halo effect.

In our economic system being less capable, or being perceived as such, is going to result in you having a worse life. (I'm assuming that having less economical means is going to give you less options and having less options is worse then having more options) 

I do not understand how people can defend a meritocracy where your ability to rise in the hierarchy is linked to the life standards you deserve. But I feel like people in general are using this word ""meritocracy"" as a good thing or something to strive for. Why?"

First, if you work under 32 hours in most states, that means you don't qualify for benefits

I know it doesn't sound great because everyone in tech wants these huge benefits and big tech salaries. But if you give them the offer to work part time, and apply for fully time later when the headcount is good, you get to save more then half of the salary costs for the employee ( as well as no over time pay and no benefits ) 

The reason I bring this up is [some people](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yihao-xie_dear-linkedin-community-i-recently-received-activity-7008258088080158721-FV2U?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop) are losing jobs and basically getting deported due to rescinded or delayed job offers. 

It helps international students who already won the lottery to stay with the company, it helps students not waste time onboarding to the company, and it ensures even if they are laid off later, they at least have some experience on their resume.

Edit - the reason this is strange to me is because many of these companies (like Meta ) are still hiring contractors. And several of my friends working at Meta, Microsoft and Amazon have said after a teammember was pipped/laid off, they were replaced by a contractor 

So let me reframe a tiny bit: if you are going to hire a contractor (for a higher price ) why would you rescind the offer? Why not just reduced the hours of the new grad since that would be cheaper then the alternative?

EDIT 2 - I am not saying ""hire 2 part time"" new hires, I am specifically saying take the full time people you already extended offers to, and half their hours. They lose benefits and you lose the salary cost of half their time. So they are significantly cheaper then hiring a contractor"

86,2022-12-13,CMV: Metaverse real estate is a dumb investment and a waste of society's resources,u/BeneficialNet,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zl25y6/cmv_metaverse_real_estate_is_a_dumb_investment/,changemyview,"Just to be clear, I'm not talking about VR tech in general. I’m talking about “plots of land” in digital spaces that are being bought and sold speculatively because “it’s limited and demand will go up.” People can’t seem to get enough of this supposed “land rush”. If you head over to Republic, a platform for investments of all types, the #1 trending investment is a [portfolio fund to invest in metaverse real estate](https://republic.com/realm-metaverse-realestate). Meanwhile, startups that build devices that literally [detect cancer](https://republic.com/delee) or [floss all your teeth automatically](https://republic.com/instafloss) hardly get a fraction of the attention.

However, that this is a waste and our resources can solve better problems is a subjective argument that can apply to anything. I would like to argue that, wastefulness aside, metaverse real estate is just a mind-bogglingly dumb investment.

Of course, if there’s a greater fool right down the corner, then technically the investment might pan out, at least if you get out soon enough (this is true of all investments, no matter how scammy). So I shall limit the scope of my argument: Metaverse real estate has a worse chance of being a net-positive investment in the medium run (say 3-5 years) than World of Warcraft (WoW) real estate (if such a thing were set up). In the short run, it just depends on ape speculation; in the long run, they’re both likely worthless.

Here are the reasons people give for investing in metaverse real estate:

* “It’s limited.” No, it’s not. They can create more at any moment, just like in WoW. If anything, since WoW needs to have each world represent a specific fantasy world congruent with its own lore, WoW is more limited in how much real estate they can add. The metaverse (and other metaverses) can add real estate as easily as we can create new websites today.
* “Demand will increase.” Well, demand can only certainly go up, as right now no one seems to care at all. But it’s more convincing that WoW, which already has millions of players, will see a surge in popularity than a terrible version of Second Life will gain any popularity at all. So if you want to speculate on demand, it’s more sound to buy up WoW real estate.
* “It has staying power.” It’s just a video game – and if video games have shown us anything, it’s that popular ones rise and fall. Even if the metaverse somehow becomes popular, a shinier thing is right around the corner. WoW has been popular for nearly two decades, so it is far easier to believe that WoW has staying power compared to the metaverse which never even came.
* “It’s decentralized.” So? How does that influence your investment thesis at all? You think that if you bought a castle in WoW that Blizzard will just steal it from you? That depends on the contract you had with them – and if the contract says that they can’t do that, then that’s just as enforceable in court as something decentralized. This is people buying into a buzzword without stopping to think if it actually matters.
* “It’s not just for gaming; it’s for socializing, for work.” Ok, the spaces for these things are perfectly fungible, making a “real estate” play pointless. If someone bought 100 Zoom video conference rooms, would you pay to use one of them, or just create a 101th room for free? The best thing about digital spaces is that we can copy+paste them for nothing. WoW, in contrast, is a centralized controlled space with limited areas – this is the only context in which digital real estate could make any sense, for you to brag to your friends that the castle on Server A belongs to you and all the NPCs hail you as the lord. It means something because only Blizzard can create more of those spaces and they don’t. The absolute fungibility of the metaverse makes real estate investment in it mind-bogglingly stupid.

Here's what would change my view: An argument that digital real estate has any value that will increase over time NOT due to ponzi scheme speculation. If people are investing so much into this, I'm hoping there's something I'm really missing and I'm not, to quote Scar, ""surrounded by idiots.""

EDIT: I awarded a delta to someone who pointed out that (my paraphrase) ""while a dumb investment, it's not a waste of society's resources, it's a redistribution from the scammed to the scammers. No resources are wasted, just moved around."" Technically true, I guess, but since one part of my view has changed, the delta was earned."

The second best choice is to hunt your own food, and some cultures celebrate their animals death as a part of life. But in amercia simply posting the dead animals on the bed of your truck or you holding up a dead deer head is just sad. I cant see any serious reason why this would be an acceptable thing. Also these people dont seem to be the ones thanking the animals for their life, just gloating about how many things they killed, or how big their kill was.

I just think that it can be done better.

By simply making a previously white or European character POC, you end up missing out on a lot of the other representation possibilities by simply putting a brown character into a white story with white culture. Admittedly, that will create some representation - but it ignores a huge amount of different cultures out there. It seems lazy and easy.

I think it'd be much better, representation-wise, if they animated and filmed African or South American fairy tales. Or Asian fairy tales. Or Middle Eastern fairy tales. Or Aboriginal! Any kind that isn't necessarily from Europe. In that way, not only would they get to create better representation for POC, they can also tell stories from other cultures. It'll create awareness of other, less explored cultures from a positive lens and represent other cultures than the Western ones. 

This could in turn lead to decreasing racism (through understanding different cultures - or at least parts of it), and create a more diversified and interesting media landscape. It can also create awareness regarding other people and how they think and believe and do.

While I do think that original stories such as Moana (that took inspiration from Polynesian myths and culture), Coco (original idea based on a Mexican holiday), and Encanto (original idea, based in Columbia) are great (and in these particular cases, done really well) and have wonderful lessons, they still don't tell tales from the actual cultures they are supposed to represent. I think that some cultural history, behaviours, and beliefs simply aren't as clearly shown through original stories as they would be if it had been a local myth or story.

I think a much better kind of representation would be to tell stories from actual different continents and cultures, not just stories that are either based in those countries (but not actually from those countries, which then loses some cultural context that didn't have to be lost), or stories that are from another culture with POC being put into them.

I'd love to hear your opinion and input on this.

I think it's wrong, but I realize that my belief that it is wrong is mainly due to disgust rather than a logical moral framework. I would honestly like to CMV!

An argument given against sex with animals, even if they appear to be enthusiastically enjoying it, is that they cannot consent. It can be argued that they can consent (if you're having sex with a grizzly bear, I can only presume the grizzly consented), however let's take it as true that they cannot consent. If they cannot consent to something that they appear to be enjoying, then it would follow that they cannot consent to other things they appear to be enjoying -- for example, belly rubs. Where is the logical and moral difference? 

One thing that got me thinking about this is that I was playing with my infant niece, blowing raspberries on her belly and kissing her baby feet. I though, ""If I was a pedophile with a foot fetish, this would go from normal and okay to weird and violating."" However, from the infant's perspective, it's exactly the same! Why would what's going on in MY head change the moral outcome of whether I'm violating someone else's consent (or lack of ability to consent).

Intuitively, this is wrong. There IS a difference. I just don't know what it is and I would like to CMV."

I’m not that attractive, Im short, have a gap in my teeth, and have noticeable acne. In other words, a perfect target for bullying. Yet despite this, about 70% of the people who didn’t like me were not the popular kids, but the unpopular kids. When I first started getting into sports, the only people who supported me were the popular, varsity athlete level kids with like 1k-2k followers, while the kids who talked shit about me had 30-300 followers. 

I know anecdotal evidence isn’t the most reliable, but even still, it wouldn’t make sense for most people to become popular if they were big assholes, and I feel like media doesn’t represent bullying accurately."

For example: There are several reasons Trump was elected in 2016, one of the reasons was probably the fact that he kept stating he would reverse the outsourcing of jobs that had been going on for a long time under previous administrations. Here we are talking about a real issue affecting working class Americans, not addressed by the ""elite"" as it wasn't in their economic interest to stop it. Now, Trump turned out to be a rather crazy narcissist, so whether he delivered on his promises is not the point, the point is that it is in my mind rational for a working class person too chose the candidate for example claiming that the issue of outsourcing will be dealt.  

Another example can be taken from Sweden. Sweden has had a catastrophic immigration policy, increasing violence, sexual assaults etc. Instead of addressing this issue seriously, establishment political parties established a ""cordon sanitaire"" against the national populist Sweden Democrats, this meant that they in practice choose to ignore the party and treat them as an unacceptable coalition-partner in any future government, obviously that eventually changed as it became impossible for the moderate right bloc to ever win again without the 20% of Swedes the Sweden democrats as of now (2022) has as a stable base of support. But the point is again, for somebody directly affected by the increase in violence, sexual assaults, etc. due to the irresponsible and dangerous migration policy by establishment parties it is perfectly rational to choose the one party claiming they will take those issues seriously. 

In summary, it seems to me that national populists will often latch onto real issues that are either almost totally ignored or only lightly touched upon by establishment parties/politicians and I don't find it irrational why people seem to choose them. But if you disagree I want to hear why so you can change my mind."

[She's currently on bail](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/13/climate-activist-deanna-violet-coco-freed-from-prison-while-she-appeals-15-month-jail-sentence?CMP=share_btn_tw), but I believe my points are still relevant.

I understand that Deanna ‘Violet’ Coco engaged in non-violent protest. But our state has a law that blocking roads, even non-violently, can be punished by up to [with fines of up to $22,000 and up to two years in jail](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/labor-helps-pass-nsw-bill-targeting-road-blocking-protesters-despite-union-opposition). 

Is it unfair that some of Australia's sex criminals [got less punishment than this](https://www.msn.com/en-au/news/australia/climate-protester-s-sentence-is-half-that-of-grace-tame-s-abuser-s-is-this-justice/ar-AA14Z4SB?ocid=wispr&amp;pc=u477&amp;cvid=ca6e103a78ec498daaddce4a7522045d)? **Yes.** Do I believe that she protested for a good cause? **Yes. But that's not the point. The point is that we should not expect exemptions from the law because we think their political stances are right.** 

After all, racists, homophobes, anti-climate-action activists, anti-vaxxers, etc. all believe that they're fighting for a good cause too. **We should avoid setting a precedent that people get exempted from the law because we agree with their politics.**

In Australia, us left-wingers already have some egg on our face because we clamoured to get George Pell, a highly conservative Catholic cardinal, jailed for child sex offences, only for the High Court to find the evidence dodgy - I bring this up to show the consequence of bending the justice system for political reasons.

What do I think should be done? We should improve our climate action so that protests like this don't happen again (but unfortunately, that's just wishful thinking when a lot of people want to vote for right-wing parties who oppose climate action). Also, we could also vote for politicians who want to abolish the penalties for peaceful protests.

Before you tell me that only our side does disruptive protests, and that opponents of climate action are too considerate and well-behaved to disrupt peoples' lives with protests, here are some examples from Australia, France, the Netherlands and New Zealand:

* ['Pinocchio Gillard': strong anti-Gillard emissions at Canberra carbon tax protest](https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/pinocchio-gillard-strong-anti-gillard-emissions-at-canberra-carbon-tax-protest-20110323-1c5w7.html)

* [New Zealand farmers hit streets to protest cow-burp tax plan](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/20/new-zealand-farmers-cow-burp-protest-00062675)

**TL;DR** I think Deanna ‘Violet’ Coco protested for a good cause, but demanding that she be exempted from the law because we agree with her cause will set a very dangerous precedent."
0,2022-12-14,CMV: Postgraduate students must have at least once come to random conferences only for the food,u/UrLocalMemer4524,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zlky58/cmv_postgraduate_students_must_have_at_least_once/,changemyview,"I'm very sure that most postgraduate students have at least once saw a conference happening at their campus that have absolutely no relation to their research topic, and deliberately joined for an hour just to eat the food that come with it. This is in the context that the food catering is in a 'publicly accesible' place that you can just walk by and grab something.

\*Assuming that those students do come to campus frequently and are not working remotely for the entire duration of their research. 

Edit 1: Should have made it clear that at least in my university, the school provides catering (food, etc) for scientific conferences and seminar in open space on the campus' general buildings. Those areas are like 'hallways' to other buildings and all students have access to it. That's why it's possible for a comp sci student like me to know that there are some marine association conference happening at school on the same day, and go grab some lunches there.

I imagine that this is a bit too context specific. Most conferences costs money for registration, but others can be free seminars/talks that also have food catering. Either because participants have food in open space it’s possible to just grab something.

Edit 2: I DID mention ‘’most postgraduate students at the start” so I don’t think the fact that you haven’t is a strong argument. I don’t think the title is explicitly forcing my opinion on those who haven’t because there can be exceptions.

I have zero problems concentrating and love reading and focusing on a topic, but after I close the book...the information is gone. I remember the emotion or mood the books made me feel, but that is it.

I am interested in philosophy, politics and literature, but cannot engange in conversation with anyone because I don't actually remember what the books said, even though the topics fascinated me intensely.  How can I participate or want to improve society if I don't even know theory to back up stuff?

When I google this, the answer is always ""it's normal"", followed up by a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""I cannot remember the books I have read, but they have made me"".

I think this normalization of forgetting what you read is a dangerous thing, especially for those of us who have voting powers. This could gradually lead to a crisis, and makes people like me susceptible to having make decisions based or emotion, or listen to politicians who would exploits this cleverness.

In the days of Aristotle and Plato you were expected to remember and recite poetic epics line for line, which is too far and is NOT what I am asking. But being able to remember non-fiction books and textbooks?

**I did not post this to shame those of you who do not remember stuff. i have this problem myself. If you have a medical condition it is understandable**...but this leads to a dangerous path, and I want the government or schools or scientists to put a concerted effort into finding empirical evidence on how to remember what you read. Although the CMV is about that this is dangerous, so focus your possible deltas on that.

Thank you.

EDIT: Thanks for all the posts. After reading a comment, I believe what I struggle with is self-doubt and perhaps radical skepticism. Every time I read something, I tell myself I won't remember it, that I am not smart and that this is too difficult. And I keep questioning things, like what is math really, not just formulas, but the philosophy of math. I feel like learning and understanding means to literally understand everything about a topic.

If anyone has had this issue of self-doubt when learning, please share.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2:  So I am wrong? What I am feeling is normal? I always thought I was stupid, because I am 26 years old and cannot remember stuff like math, biology and chemistry from school. I don't remember why gravity exists, anything beyond simple arithmetic and how virus and diseases work. Is everyone pretending to get it fully?

To me, if I say I know 1+1 = 2, that is not learned. I am just repeating. Learning the truth of why 1+1 = 2 is right is to have learned."

This also isn't about walking up to a victim and saying ""I told you so"" after the fact. I simply feel sighting as an example how a victim could have done things differently may have helped lead to a better outcome. Examples:

1. Person is shot accidentally by police while trying to flee a traffic stop after struggling with officers.
2. Person uses a dark isolated alley as a short cut and is sexually assaulted.
3. Person knowingly visits a part of town known for robbing non-locals and is robbed.
4. Person's has a broken seat belt, drives anyhow, gets killed by driver running a red light in a situation where the seat belt would have saved their life.

All of these are examples where the victim didn't deserve what happened to them but might have been able to do something different that might have created a better outcome.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The police are ultimately responsible for pulling the trigger, but the person might have tried not struggling.
2. The assaulter is the criminal, but the person might have taken reasonable precautions to avoid such a dangerous and vulnerable situation.
3. The robber is the criminal, but the person might have chosen to not visit that part of town.
4. The driver running the red light is at fault, but the person might have chosen another method of travel or looked into fixing the seat belt

I am sure many people will want to bring racial, gender, and economic inequality and / or necessity into the discussion, and I cannot deny their potential for being factors in some or all of the above scenarios, but it doesn't dismiss the fact, at least in my view, that preventative measures might have been taken. If I had children, without sighting any of the above specifically, I would tell them

1. If you get pulled over by police, turn off your car, roll down your window, turn on your interior lights, and put both hands on the steering wheel. If they ask you to do something, comply. Even if you did nothing wrong. You never know if an officer has mental health issues, is trigger happy, had a bad day, etc, and you don't want to do anything that could set off this individual now approaching you with a gun.
2. Don't go down dark alleys by yourself. It's not safe.
3. Please avoid that part of town if possible. Crime against tourists and non-locals is very high.
4. You should always wear your seatbelt. Get if fixed immediately if it is broken.

Are the final set of points made above something that should not be discussed, or is it only wrong to discuss them if you also site a specific example of something that happened to someone where the point comes into play? Does the specific example make it victim blaming and that is wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: 

Some advice givers have offered other scenarios that are less sensitive than sexual assault or bad police.

1. Is it victim blaming for a country to place warnings on travel to another country because of an uptick in crime? People were victims, so their is a reaction to this warning other people to avoid becoming victims by taking (or not taking) a particular course of action.
2. It is victim blaming to suggest to someone (not the victim) to lock their doors because I know someone who left their doors unlocked and their house was robbed?

Also, I am getting the general vibe that my original CMV is alright in that it is ok to discuss precautions a non-victim can take and reference examples of how people (generically) may have not been victimized if they had taken certain precautions as long as I am not suggesting the victim did anything wrong and I am also not talking directly to a victim about these precautions in a ""I told you so"" way and also taking into account the context of a particular scenario. 

It's also been suggested part of my issue is that my use of ""victim blaming"" is not accurate and is causing some confusion. In my ignorant defense, my CMV was described by someone as ""victim blaming"" which I ran with. 

Thank you everyone for helping me walk through this so politely. I appreciate that people took me seriously and not as someone who was just trying to start something.

562,2022-12-14,CMV: It's never OK to pursue service staff romantically.,u/___bgwl___,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zlrdo4/cmv_its_never_ok_to_pursue_service_staff/,changemyview,"Hey guys, so the title may be a little simplistic so let me first define what I mean by some words:

\- Service staff - Anyone working in the service sector who is a stranger that has a customer-facing role (I will be mainly referring to servers/wait staff in this CMV but most service staff roles can be included). Some may describe sex workers as service staff, but in this CMV I'm not going to include them.

\- Pursue romantically - Interact with with the intent of becoming romantically involved with, e.g. flirting, asking out, asking for phone number, being sexually suggestive, etc. 

In a nutshell, I do not believe that pursuing a person who is working in a customer-facing role romantically is ever OK. My reasons for believing this are as follows:

\- Service staff are (usually) required to be friendly to customers in their roles, they are also often financially compensated or rewarded if they are friendly to customers. This situation can create a misunderstanding as to whether the 'friendliness' is genuine or part of their job.

\- When there is an exchange of pleasantries or simple interaction between individuals, it is common to form a social imbalance where people feel they are 'owed' something in return. This can lead to romantic interest being misinterpreted when someone is actually required to show interest due to their role. For example: A bank teller asks a customer 'how's your day going?' and the customer replies honestly about their day, out of politeness the bank teller asks further questions. A basic rapport has been achieved between the individuals involved, yet it is not truly 'real' since the bank teller's job requires them to be friendly, and ending the conversation abruptly would not be professional. 

\- Customer-facing roles require some kind of social manipulation in order to complete tasks. For example: being friendly to get a tip, finding out information about a customer to sell them something specific, telling jokes/stories to make someone feel comfortable and enjoy an experience, etc. 

Due to these reasons, I believe it is best to always assume a member of service staff is showing friendliness as part of their job, and any signs that they are romantically interested in a customer should not be acted on. Even if these signs are genuine (from the perspective of the staff member), it is better to err on the side of caution, just in case signs are misinterpreted. Therefore, one should never pursue service staff.

Extra info:

\- I don't have any problem with the way service staff act when interacting with a customer, I believe this balance of social power leans on the customer to be respectful of the service staff member. 

\- One response might be ""there's no problem with asking a server for their number, they can just say 'no' politely and be done with it."" This is true, however the reason I say 'never' is because putting the service staff member into an uncomfortable situation that forces them to reject someone is not respectful behaviour on the part of the customer, so should be avoided."

I don't lash out and then make jokes about it...

I grew up in a household with a mother who snacked on sugary treats and sodas throughout the day, who would ""have no time"" to eat at her day job and be basically non-communicative and highly combative until after dinner. I have learned recently that so much of this is literally due to hormones and blood sugar imbalance and can be offset by things like high protein or low sugar snacks or even just eating foods at mealtime in a particular order.

They often see red flags and intentionally ignore them.,u/Braincyclopedia,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zlttzw/cmv_people_who_end_up_in_abusive_relationships/,changemyview,"I’ve noticed of a tendency to treat survivors of abusive relationships as victims, and it’s taboo to question that. In this thread I’m specifically referring to individuals who find themselves in this type of relationship repeatedly. The argument I often hear is that they come from a problematic childhood and thus don’t know better. However, this logic doesn’t apply to other aspects of behavior such as breaking the law (eg having a tough childhood doesn’t excuse one for committing assault, rape,murder etc). I believe that they see the red warning signals and ignore them because they find it rewarding to reaffirm their low self esteem. This is a choice they made as adults and (until there are kids on the picture) can easily walk away from the situation. As they choose it, we shouldn’t view them as victims. With that being said, it doesn’t mean they don’t deserve or need our support to emotionally grow and find healthier relationships."

1) There's almost nothing that costs less than 5 cents. Decades ago, when countless items only cost a penny or two, making the minimum price of something 5 cents would have been problematic. That is no longer the case.

2) Rounding to the nearest 5 cents isn't as swingy as it used to be. Again, decades ago, going to the nearest 5 cents might mean a 25% increase in price (for something that was usually 8 cents for example). Now, rounding to the nearest nickel is likely going to be a less than 1% change in price. 

3) They cost more to make then they're worth. Making them costs taxpayers tens of millions of dollars each year.

4) Pennies are harmful to the environment. Not only are they a waste of resources (which have to be mined), they also hurt animals, like when people throw them into fountains.

5) This may not seem like much, but they slow down business. It's not often a problem, but if you've ever been behind someone counting out dozens of pennies, it's frustrating.

6) Their main use is for spite payments, like when someone gets a bill they don't want to pay so they get buckets of pennies. This is a massive waste of time for everyone involved.

7) While it seems like people are evenly split on whether or not pennies should be kept, much of that has to do with lobbying efforts of the companies that make money off of the production of pennies. I list this as a reason to stop making pennies because the less lobbying and manipulation of people, the better."

Even if you know of one of the host parents, the house may contain other members of the family you don't know of. They might be predatory or even just careless with children in general.

I feel like the adult to child ratio also is not good enough in these cases, exposing the children to possibilities of abuse and general safety.

I think play dates are enough bonding time for children with their friends. Even in case of a late evening movie watch or so, I don't understand why they can't go home after the movie, as they would not be allowed to stay up too late in a sleepover anyway. Why is it necessary to spend their private sleeping time amongst the company of others.

All in all, I think the cons outweigh the pros in this situation. The only other way this might work is if each child is accompanied by their parent to the sleepover, but obviously that is far fetched.

EDIT: UPDATE: I thank all those who took the time to explain why my views on this subject might be extreme. I actually don't have any children yet and the prospect of them seems like a huge responsibility safety wise. I am beginning to understand that some of these thoughts might be due to negative childhood experiences I witnessed amongst my peer group. I think it may be possible that I might have just been at the bad end of things and maybe the general average might consist of better people. Anyway thank you all :)"

One more reason for my belive which I didn't mention earlier because it is theoratical and don't practical. Is that of free market, capitalism. Now debating weather it's good or bad or the root of all Eveil is endless, and would just open up a can of worms. But what I do think is that proponents of free market capitalism should not support such lawps as it is against ethos of free markets 

Let me start by saying I would love to have an iphone with type c charging, I think apple not having that is bad and inconvenient for it's consumers

But when it comes to passing a law which dictates that phone chargers should be the same, I have a problem. The problem being that of unintended consequences. If all companies are required by law that all phones and tablets must have a specific charging port let's say type c. Then what incentive do companies have to invest in furthering the technology? Let's say they also have a provision allowing modern tech. How is it decided that some other style is better or not? And what if the new style is protected by a patent by a company? 
One can also make an argument that there will not be any significant advances in charging tech now, to which I think there is no way for anyone to know that, and there is no peak for any technology
Now my problem with the main argument given for it, environmental protection, would this law reduce the number of cables. I doubt it even if devices have the same charging port one would still want more of the same cable for convenience( the evidence and reasoning for it, is my experience, so not the strongest). Moreover I believe a better way to address environmental challenges is by incentivising more environmentally friendly tech rather than regulating it's use.
Now I don't think standard arguments made against neo-liberal economics will stand here.
So, reddit, what am I missing ? Is it a good policy? Because both EU and now India as well are thinking of making this a law"
1584,2022-12-15,"CMV: Marriage equality (gay marriage) does not threaten or endanger marriage for religious, traditional and straight couples.",u/Fondacey,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zmgl83/cmv_marriage_equality_gay_marriage_does_not/,changemyview,"Marriage is not in need of protection and gay marriage does not threaten marriage.  
UPDATE: Thanks to some posters I better sympathize with why people feel the recognition of an expanded definition of marriage feels threatening. Among other reasons, that is attributed to   
\*gatekeeping  
\* losing the authority to set the definition as it applies themselves  
\* the loss or dilution of legitimization of their religious/moral code   
These reasons are difficult to recognize in one's discomfort and probably why it's hard for me (and others) to find the blanket statement of  ""'marriage' is threatened "" justifiable. Thank you all who participated.   
(Edit: if you agree with me, please respect the rules of the subreddit and not echo. I just don't think it's a threat. If you think it's a threat to marriage, I want to know why)

I understand and accept that religious and 'traditional' people might not support marriage for same-sex couples. My view on supporting gay marriage is not up for being changed.What I find no logical support for is the argument that marriage as an institution is undermined or threatened by gay marriage.  A US Representative, in her arguments against the US Marriage Equality Act, pleaded, "" “Protect religious liberty. Protect people of faith. And protect Americans who believe in a true meaning of marriage.""  Since I am convinced there is nothing under threat, traditional marriage still exists and is equally recognized, there is nothing to protect.  I cannot find any legitimate arguments that marriage itself is under threat and consequently becomes a validated reason to stand against gay marriage.

Civil marriage, which is the marriage that is enacted by the government, is rather simply, a legal contract. Originally, one way to keep 'traditional' people happy, from feeling threatened, was to introduce  'civil unions' for same-sex couples that mirrored 'marriage'. To not have to reinvent the \[marriage\] wheel, it makes sense to include any two consenting adults wanting to enter into a civil marriage contract with each other. Religious marriages are defined and recognized by that religion.

Civil gay marriage does not intrude and it does not threaten traditional marriage."

0,2022-12-15,CMV: (American) health insurance should work like life insurance,u/Yalay,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zmhq70/cmv_american_health_insurance_should_work_like/,changemyview,"The fundamental problem with healthcare in the US is that people don't pay for it directly, so they don't care how much it costs. Healthcare providers thus have no reason to compete on the basis of cost, so prices skyrocket.

**Here's how a term life insurance policy works:**

* You answer a bunch of questions about your age/health/mortality risk
* You select a term (e.g. 20 years) and benefit size (e.g. $1M)
* Every month, you pay a small premium to the insurance company.
* So long as you keep paying your premium, the insurance company can never raise the rate or cancel your policy.
* If you die within the term, your heirs are paid the benefit.

**How does this differ from health insurance?**

* With health insurance, insurers cannot charge people different rates based on health status. Thus insurers actively avoid offering policies which are attractive to sick people. Customers avoid buying health insurance until they are sick, making the average customer much more expensive to insure.
* Health insurance is tax deductible if provided by your insurer, but not if bought on the individual market. So the vast majority get it through their employers. But most people move jobs every few years, meaning they're moving insurance plans, but they might get sick in the interim and become very expensive to insure!
* Health insurers can't cancel individuals, but they can cancel product offerings. So they create many offerings available only to a few people. If the products aren't making money, they cancel them, and the policyholders are left without insurance.
* Health insurance covers all sorts of normal expenditures - regular doctor visits, routine procedures, predicable costs. This is encouraged by the tax deductibility of health insurance while if you pay out of pocket you have to pay with post tax money. Life insurance only applies to an unexpected, catastrophic event.
* Life insurance has an upper bound for how much insurance companies have to spend. With health insurance, caps are illegal. A small number of people use an absolutely outrageous amount of healthcare, the costs of which are passed on to society.
* Just like how life insurance only goes for a certain number of years, so should health insurance. The vast majority of healthcare spending goes to slightly extending the lives of the very old. That old people will get sick is highly predictable, and the vast majority of such people do not value the treatment they get enough to justify the cost.

**Under this system, what if someone gets sick and they don't have health insurance? Do they just die?**

No, they don't die. But they will have to rely on charity (through family, friends, or foundations) or declare bankruptcy. Not having health insurance should be seen as a risky way to live your life which might result in you losing everything, similarly to the situation you would be in if you didn't have homeowner's insurance. Just like you can't buy homeowner's insurance when your house is on fire, you shouldn't expect to be able to buy health insurance when you are sick.

**What if you get sick at a very young age or are born with a major, chronic condition?**

Hopefully charities will be able to pick up the slack for the small number of people who find themselves in this unfortunate and blameless situation. If there isn't enough charitable giving, a government welfare program could help these people. Given the small number of people in this category, this program would be much cheaper than existing healthcare programs like Medicare and Obamacare subsidies.

**What about poor people who can't afford health insurance?**

If desired, they could be helped with a program like Medicaid - except that that recipients should be able to spend the money on any healthcare expense, rather than being restricted to a very specific government run health insurance program."

The moral case for veganism is pretty simple and ironclad:

1) Producing meat and animal products causes thinking feeling animals to suffer.

2) We can feed ourselves perfectly well without animal products.

3) Therefore we should not eat animal products as it causes less suffering.

I don't really have a counterargument to this that isn't ultimately just ""but they're tasty"". Most of the counterarguments I've seen don't even try to make the case that meat is morally correct, just that it's *less* morally wrong.

Is there any case to be made for the morality of eating meat?"

Live in Texas. I was in the army for 6 years with one tour under my belt.I’m a business owner that brings in about 90k detailing cars and I have no college degree. 

Now let’s get into this rant. Why are “blacks” the only people told to “get over” history? Like seriously I don’t see anyone telling the Jews to “get over” the holocaust I don’t see people telling the natives Americans to “get over” the taking over of there land.or the Asians to get over the bombing. Why is that. I know some people are going to come in and say “well it’s because the groups you mentioned don’t use it as a crutch” 

But have you guys not seen what has been done to my people over the past hundred years? I’m not down playing any of the events that I mentioned up top I just want to know why my history (the only history we have) is down played? I hear all the time”it happened 100 years ago” or “where you a slave?” And I find that extremely disrespectful. And I feel that people only say those this because it’s not happening to them or it’s not their history. We were the slaves there where the masters. And no I don’t have “victim mentality”. I just want answers I want to know who I am just like everyone else the natives still have their language, they have reservations. They get “free college” they get money on the first, they have all Native American schools, native Americans although not the best they got their reparations where ours? I’ve not once heard when a Native American complains that they have victim mentality. But when we complain about history we should get over it.

I am a designer/programmer/artist. I mostly make videogames and work in the industry. I myself programed lots of game AI and used neural networks for things like enemy behavior. I also worked on a system to make handwriting machine readable. It was super easy for me to use disco-diffusion, stable diffusion and so on right from the start. 

Art assets are and were always my personal bottleneck. I made it myself if i needed to (2d (pixel)art-sprites, 3d models, animation, textures, backgrounds... I personally do not enjoy the process), commissioned it or worked in teams with great artists produce my dream products. I remember the appearance of services like fiver and stuff that made art a bit cheaper but still its extremely costly and its so inconvenient and i have some negative experiences. Especially if you need to go through rounds of payed iterations with an artists that has his own opinion that clash with what I want/pay for my project. 

To be blunt: For my projects I do not look for ART, I look for assets.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I read a lot into criticism of many artists that despise/fear AI art and I see/understand many of them. I found there is a lot of rather uninformed but popular takes (like: [https://i.redd.it/5k9j5734l06a1.jpg](https://i.redd.it/5k9j5734l06a1.jpg) the no AI logo on art-station would somehow damage the already trained models - yes because the people make fun of the logo by finetuning/embedding the logo into their models on purpose... ) but there are others that are excellent like: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjSxFAGP9Ss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjSxFAGP9Ss) \- I agree with some of the points made, especially about the datasets and the company's but others like the drowning out of ""real"" art and the line drawn between between tool and replacement not so much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Art != Assets

Assets can be art themselves, but more often than not they don't need to. Textures, Icons and things like that do not need to have a soul, they have a clear function to fulfill. There are also lots of technical requirements to them where to much artistic may even be a determent. Game production often speaks of ""hero-assets"" that have a higher artistic space and requirements because they contribute to a higher degree to the general art style and perception of the game, for these these the rest of the discussion is more relevant. 

There were always discussions about how ""creative"" and ""artistic"" is this type of job and this informs my view a lot because I draw a strong line between art and asset used in a project (regardless if people see videogames as artworks, partly total or whatever, I do) 

&amp;#x200B;

The LaionB5 dataset / Ethical datasets

It contains 5 billion pictures with descriptions, this dataset is used to train for example stable diffusion (other AI tools like midjourney are more black boxes where we do not know exactly what they are trained on, even if we can be relatively sure). It does contain artworks of artists accessible by clear links, and includes absolutely copyright protected artworks. The data set is in theory for resource purposes, but the training models made a step towards a product and away from research. There is currently no out option and it had never a in option for people that want to add their pictures. It would be possible to create a ""ethical dataset"" (public domain, hired artists, commissioned artists...), this would be a step back, but it would not change that the technology exists and a hand curated dataset that for example would not contain MS clipart would likely even improve the outputs.

&amp;#x200B;

Transformative art

Artists also use other artists art without permission. Sometimes its plagiarism but more often its more innocent like (references, photobashing, inspiration), the question here is how much work and skill is need to make transformative. This is a general discussion that includes reaction content on YouTube or fanart, original sonic characters by sprite recoloring, asset theft from for example unity decoding, copy pasting of code and functions and so on... Where is the line. I agree there is an argument that could be made how much work do I need to invest in cleanup or iterations to claim it as ""my"" work. 

Is my situation different than a normy that simply writes a prompt in a tool because i worked on the tool and did my own training, partly on my own art and art that i commissioned for commercial use? I  have some of my own work in my outputs. 

But on top there is an argument that the training and diffusion processes alone are already transformative enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

Contribution of a single person

The dataset contains 5 billion pictures. What is a reasonable claim a artist could have? Is it different when the artists is ""summoned"" by invoking his name in the prompt? When a artist goes in a museum, studies some classics and than paints or crafts a version of them, how big is the artists contribution? Its not the idea or style, because styles are not protected (and can not be) as little as game mechanics, dice mechanics, rules and so on are and can be protected. At least that is was i always got tought in university, why would my work be less protected than the work of an artist?

Midjourney for example takes outputs, especially popular ones and feed them back into the next generation of training. This means the dataset grows all the time, the contribution of a single person/artist gets smaller and smaller. 

&amp;#x200B;

People lose their jobs

The argument about artist loos their jobs is not a strong one for me. This happens and happened always whenever new technology becomes available. Somehow artists make the argument that their jobs are more worth preserving than other jobs because people enjoy the process ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn\_w3MnCyDY&amp;t=3242s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn_w3MnCyDY&amp;t=3242s) ) that was super irritating for me (the general talk was mostly good). (Side info for the last point: She also brings up the idea that the current outputs are only so good because the dataset contains ALL the art.... this means the contribution of single artists is super small) The argument it could happen to you too is also true, you already can see parts of it via git co-pilot or the newer gtp models that are able to write functions.  This is not a AI specific problem its a what do we do with people that can not find a job, Artists are arguable even less affected by it because they still can create art if they want to, they many not get paid for it or at least not as much. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its entitlement to want everything for free

Yes and no. I contributed in some projects, I did not only use it, write a prompt and get art out of it but I worked on the tools that make this possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its to easy

Yes and no. Simple prompts also only produce simple outcomes. People can train their own models (i did this a lot), use inpainting with countless iterations, learn and research. If you want something its easy, if you want something specific its hard.  

&amp;#x200B;

Its no real art, there is no soul

That is a philosophical discussion to be had. People argue that art only has meaning if the maker infused it with meaning, others argue that the watcher/reader/hearer takes their own live experiences and interpret the artwork through their own lenses to create meaning. For me both makes sense. But again, in my case i take the outputs and do my own stuff with them. The outputs themselves don't need to be art to be used in the creation of art. But if a single output themselves can be consider art is also a discussion that people could have. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a super interesting topic for me, one where I am emotional invested. I have conflicting feelings about it, because I can understand the fear and irritation of the artists. I also consider myself an artists to a degree and dislike it if people take stuff from me. It also always felt strange if I work for a companies and needed to give up rights on things I worked hard on. I also know the pain if your work is ignored or attention is lost to the other cool project that released a day earlier. I get all of this and still I am leaning to the AI asset creation is good and I want to continue to use it. CMV."

Two parents who *willingly* work 12 or more hours a day shouldn't have kids. It's fine to be focused on your career, but it is unfair to bring a child to the World and then leave them to raise themselves. To see you arrive at home at 9 PM, so tired you can't even talk.

I grew up with a workaholic mom. I love her more than anyone in the World, but I think she had me just because she fell prey to the ""women must have kids"" wagon. I would talk to myself more than I would talk to another human. Nannies only work until a certain age, and even then it can create a fear of abandonment issue.

You can't have both. You can work and have kids, but you can't work 60 hours per week and raise a kid. I believe people who are career oriented either need to work less until the kid is in their late teens, or give up on parenthood altogether. It is unfair for a child to suffer and be lonely just because you decided to have a kid but are an addict to work.

This is a type of addiction not discussed enough, yet it can be as detrimental to a child as any other type of neglect. Not spending any time with your kid *is* neglect, and there's nothing admirable about willingly spending 12 or more hours away from your young child if you can afford to stay home a bit more hours.

Edit: to add a few statistics I cited in one of the comments below.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Adult children of workaholics were compared with adult children of nonworkaholics on self-concept, anxiety, depression, and locus of control. **Results indicated greater depression and external locus of control among the offspring of workaholics.** Children of workaholic fathers not only had greater depression and external locus of control but also scored higher on anxiety.

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01926189808251102)

&gt;The present study investigated the relationship between adult children’s level of workaholism and their parents’ levels of workaholism and work engagement. (...) Two hypotheses were formulated: **Having at least one parent with high levels of excessive work or compulsive work or with high levels of work engagement are risk factors, in terms of workaholism in the offspring.** A series of logistic regression analyses were carried out. The results showed that fathers’ scores on working excessively are positively related to workaholism in the children.

[Source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1359432X.2013.832208)

&gt;This chapter explores the unique experiences of workaholic women, with an emphasis on how this extreme devotion to work can lead to high levels of work-family conflict. The chapter proposes that these negative effects are particularly keen for workaholic women, compared to their male counterparts. It begins with a brief description of workaholism, followed by a summary of the unique struggles of a workaholic woman, who struggles to reconcile societal expectations that she should be intensively committed to her family (schema of family devotion) with her inner drive to be heavily involved in work (workaholic tendencies).  
&gt;  
&gt;(...) The chapter briefly summarizes the results of an empirical study involving 215 working women, which examined how discrete emotions provide one mechanism through which a woman’s workaholic behavior can spill over and negatively affect functioning in another domain (i.e., work-to-family and family-to-work conflict). One of the more surprising and intriguing results of this study was that for these women, **workaholism was positively related to anger at home, which in turn was related to greater family-to-work conflict**.

[Source](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-08891-4_16)

&gt;Investigators examined relationships among levels of depression and parentification in undergraduate university students. Instrument scores were used to identify participants as (a) adult children with alcoholic parents, (b) adult children with workaholic parents, (c) adult children with at least one parent who was both alcoholic and workaholic, and (d) a comparison group composed of adult children who met none of the other group criteria. **Children of workaholics scored significantly higher on measures of depression and parentification**, and they reported parents worked more hours than did parents of children of alcoholics and the comparison group.

[Source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1066480700084005)

&gt;Workaholism as a phenomenon examined in theories of addiction is primarily associated with harmful consequences for the functioning of an individual. **Along with the development of the psychological mechanisms of addiction, there are more and more difficulties in the professional and personal life of a workaholic. These changes affect not only the addict, but also his or her environment, especially the family.** Work gradually occupies a space that should be allowed for the family, causing not only the physical absence of the addict, but also the emotional alienation. (...)  
&gt;  
&gt;At the same time, perfectionism characteristic of the functioning of a workaholic overstates the standards and level of expectations in relation to family members. **For children it means a risk of living under the constant pressure of tough assessment of a parent, and striving for being the best is associated with the only way to experience the attention and conditional acceptance.**

All of these things have been modified from their original natural forms in significant ways.

The fact that they are living does not make a distinction. If corn didn't exist and we invented it tomorrow by genetically modifying grass in a lab it would not only be considered technology but would be patentable.

The fact that they were created by selecteive breeding does not make for a distinction here either. Under that reasoning a lot of computer algorithms would not count as technology either, as they were developed by itterative artificial selection in a similar way.

There is no reason to think of domesticated plants and animals as being any less a technological invention than a car.

Edit: the best point I've seen made here so far is that technology is knowledge, not the thing itself. Therefore cows (plural) are technology but cow (singular) isn't. By the same note cars are a technology, but your car isn't, because the technology is the understanding. This is different than how I think people colloquially think of technology, but is a robust definition. It does however mean that cows are still technology, in the same way as all other technological understanding, if anyone wants to hash that out."

12,2022-12-15,"CMV: Machine politics and ""honest graft"" of mid 20th century and earlier US politics is more representative of local constituencies than current consultants/fundraising centric politics",u/SeanFromQueens,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zmsne1/cmv_machine_politics_and_honest_graft_of_mid_20th/,changemyview,"It is my view that current American politics is primarily a function of concentrated levers of power in the largest donors/bundlers and the consultant/lobbyists that are the output of the vast amounts of the funds. 60-70 years ago, both parties had different versions of local machine parties that would have public employees kickback a portion of their wages to their local party committee, and they would be expected to volunteer for electoral campaigns attend rallies as part of the deal of being employed by the local state or municipal government. This old form of politics has been reformed away and replaced with a professional class of political apparatchiks who have no concern with the local constituencies, and aspire to do everything in a more automated and less labor heavy manner (buy points and impressions in this media market or that demo). In an attempt to reform away corruption, we've simply removed the human element out of the politics and incentivized the other side of politics to become dehumanized, while when there's a guy who's working for the city sanitation or park &amp; rec and his continued employment depends on getting his friends and family out to vote and pull his boss's lever there's a human element and the public services is still delivered (though not as efficient as possible -making it [honest graft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Plunkitt) rather than graft) but the citizenry gets both public services and democratic input because if there is a problem that they are having they have a flesh and blood vector to have it addressed.   


The transformation of the voter/citizen into the product that can be manipulated and divided and never have a feedback to close to home issues that could be solved by government -- that if problems ever get solved then the lobbyist/consultancy-industrial-complex's (L/CIC) house of cards all comes down.  The modern day L/CIC needs the problem just like marketers need to create problems to sell their product (halitosis was medical sounding term coined to sell Listerine which had previously been a disinfectant for floors, problem created for customers with a product ready to be sold for that problem) and by design will never solve public policy problems because they need them to scare up a segment of the electorate to vote with emotions. If voters simply rewarded elected officials with their vote for doing a decent job managing the public sector, then those donors don't get their bespoke tax codes and anti-competitive regulations and the LCIC are out of the job because they can't motivate voters to decide on the emotional narrative they conjured up and are disseminating across paid and earned media (never within a community and face-to-face) .  


I am not so naive to think we can get the genie back in the bottle and return to a more humanistic politics is preferable over the current algorithmic inhuman form of politics. Can someone change my mind that the alienated and divisive politics is more representative than patronage, ""honest graft"", and machine politics of the past?"

To the critical acclaim of alot of people. When people accurately pointed out that alot of these same people called right leaning people terrorists for doing the exact same thing  with businesses during riots, the majority of their responses boiled down to ""intent matters, of course a guy protecting is good while a guy who wants to murder minorities is bad"" which is an unbelievably lazy response to me.  To me, It seems they just only support armed protesters when it's their side. Using extreme language, like terrorist, to describe someone protecting a business when that person is politically different. How are they not massive hypocrites for this? Personally I support the man in protecting the event as I see it as his right. I just don't understand why so many people are conditional with their support based on the subjects politics.



UPDATE: View partially changed. People have pointed out that to be hypocritical, it doesn't matter what outsider viewers believe. It's only matters what the subject believes. If those who support armed protectors at LGBTQ events do not see protecting property and themselves at the same time as morally good. They aren't technically being hypocritical when they support one and not the other."
29,2022-12-15,CMV: authoritarianism is unhealthy,u/Calluux,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zmugwe/cmv_authoritarianism_is_unhealthy/,changemyview,"I've been researching political structures for years now and I generally find the concept of state intervention (in anything, economy, lives of people) to be generally unhealthy in society. 

A lot of authoritarian states are unhealthy socially (China, USSR, Russian Empire, etc.), but at the same time the people of the German Empire were satisfied and content, and the people of the Third Reich approved very much of their Chancellor (I don't support nor approve of anything relating to him, but it's an example).

I personally oppose the idea due to the fact that too strong of a state seems to have too much opportunity to intervene in the liberties people enjoy and can oftentimes get wrapped up in eliminating things about society it doesn't like rather than trying to better the economy, improve education, or build infrastructure. It also has the opportunity to polarize views due to the fact that more authoritarian states are going to be passing more laws than limited ones (which I see as an issue in of itself).

I'm interested to hear what you guys have to say on the topic."

Seeing anyone who has views that deviate from the the popular view as wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Morality is probably the best example as it is used as justification for so many things in this world. But without getting into the rabbit hole that is religion, another less controversial example is when talking about the Mass Effect 3 endings. At the end of the trilogy you can make 4 choices that alters the state of the galaxy and has an effect on the future of the galaxy. All 4 endings give you ""and they all lived happily ever after forever and ever"" style ending, but that hasn't stopped people from complaining about aspects and applying their own views on the endings. Enhancing the happily ever after for some and stripping it away on others. The two main ones that are relevant to this are the Destroy and Synthesis endings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In Destroy ending you wipe out the Reapers and the synthetic race the Geth (if you didn't save them earlier). In Synthesis you infuse organic life with synthetic aspects to create a blend of organic and synthetic with all the strengths and none of the weaknesses. The wet towel thrown equally on both of these endings is that in Synthesis the action is forced on the galaxy. There is no vote, the leaders of the different races do not agree to it. It is player character alone that makes this choice at the cost of their life. With Destroy the Reapers are beaten and the galaxy rebuilds. However it is pretty directly (to me) stated that the issues between organic and synthetic life that prompted the creation of the Reapers was not addressed. Which means some time in the future the conflict will restart resulting in billions of deaths and possibly even the extinction of several species. Even the removal of organic life more evolved then a cow or gorilla with synthetic life becoming the dominate force in the galaxy can potentially happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With these two outcomes I see people using morality as their key argument for support of the Destroy ending. I'd be willing to bet there can't be a discussion about the endings without someone calling morality to support their ending and invalidate the other endings. Time and time again when I response to their morality argument I voice support that the morality of Synthesis is better. As the short term evil of forcing a change without consent is out weighted by saving of billions of lives in the future. The reactions I get are mixed at best. Ranging from confusion to reacting as if I just tore the throat out of a kitten with my teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The only reason I can think of for such a reaction is they assume their moral views are some universal concept because how popular the idea is. Thus me presenting a view counter to their own is seen something like and elephant flying though the air like a bird. And indeed many will argue that their moral view is correct because of the sheer number of people who agree with it. But to me the idea that just because a bunch of people agree with something doesn't make it right or correct. Just that it is a popular idea. But maybe I am wrong and popularity of an idea does make it right and correct and I am just the odd one out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The second example is behavior. Without getting to far into the complex details, behavior is generally a result of a combination of personal experiences and the environment you live in and the culture around it. This can vary from person to person even with in the same city. Hell it can vary from person to person in the same family as each individual has their own experiences and forms their own interpretations of events and actions. An example of this is swear words. To me the word fuck is just exclamation or a verb depending on context of use. It is no better or worse then any other word in the English language. Since it is not a derogatory word directed at any group (IE N word id derogatory towards black people) I see no reason why it can't be used all the time without any issue.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However this runs up against many groups that hold to the idea that it is a ""bad"" word and that shouldn't' be said at all or at least shouldn't be said around certain individual. Usually children at the minimum. Again this is based around the idea that the concept of ""bad"" words is some universal concept and anyone who disagrees is the exception that proves the rule true. The basis of this idea is how popular it is and thus it must be true and correct. But again I just don't think popularity of a concept validates it. Just because your parents told you something and your grand parents told your parents and so on and so forth doesn't automatically make it right or correct.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know about everyone reading this but I just hate the idea that something is correct just because a lot of people agree with it or because the idea has been around a while because that logic has so many issues with it. I just think that something should be based on the reasoning and logic and not because of an idea is popular or has been around for a long time. It seems like often a lot of the friction I end up getting into with people is because I don't always hold these views myself. Be it something small were I might agree with the concept but not the specific details (IE morality) or were I out right reject the entire concept of it (IE swear words).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I should just stop having my own opinions and stop trying to swim against the stream and just surrender and go with the flow. I feel like I would be losing a bit of my self and myself identity but maybe it is worth it to not have to deal with the friction any more and simply stop thinking for myself. I am but a single drop in the ocean that is the human race and maybe it is time I surrender myself to that and become one with the ocean no matter were that might lead.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This regularly happens where a story will be something like ""white guy attacks black guy"" and will prevent you from using the words white or black. It will post something about a LGBTQ parade and it won't allow you to use any LGBTQ words. The context doesn't make a difference.

This shouldn't be a thing. I would understand a blanket ban on derogatory words or swears but this is just ridiculous and an inconvenience to users. It also doesn't tell users WHY their comment isn't being posted so it's up to them to guess. You can CMV on either of these points"

But the more I thought about it, I realized that AI art isn't a bad thing. It is simply a new MEDIUM which makes it easier to make artworks without spending the amount of time and money previously needed to make art.

I would say that the reason many artists hate it is because it produces amazing art which many of us, even though we've been making art for years, cannot make and I will agree this is also what made me dislike it at first especially considering that we could spend 3 - 7 hours being busy on one artwork only for it to look like shit the next day when I go back to look at it whereas almost every AI generation looks good.

Some artists even go on to make the ""AI art steal human art"" argument forgetting that in our beginnings we also looked at other artists art to practice and improve which is exactly what AI does but because it is able to do it so fast and effectively and now anybody can make better art than us,  it could makes some of them doubt themselve and their ability which in turn makes them hate AI art.

If you get the same amount of work done in that days span, than the only difference is what time period you did it in. I work dayshift again now but I spent a few years on nightshift and there was always the stigma from other people that you “sleep all day” despite most night shifters getting less sleep than people on daylight and even now that I’m on daylight I choose to work 9-5 while most of the old timers work 7-3 and I constantly get told “oh must be nice to work banker hours” like what’s the difference, we’re both working 8 hours?

This is a pointless accolade that only inflates the number of achievements in the game beyond what is a legitimate level

 The epitome of this is the achievement for completing all other achievements in the game. It can be quite frustrating to be hunting down hidden achievements, know that you have only two to go but not what they are, and then have them be awarded simultaneously for essentially the same thing. games either need to have a to of broad categorical achievements or a bunch of small individual ones, but achievements that contain only other achievements are just annoying to work through and don't even mean anything, as you will have all the constituent achievements either way.

To clarify, it is not *wrong* for achievements to contain others so long as they contain additional requirements. This is the case for progressive achievements, where you might for instance get one for collecting 2000 gold of the game and another for collecting 4000. The latter includes the former, but it also asks for more additional completion on top of it. It is impossible to earn one simply because you earn the other, so I don't consider these pointless the way the categorical achievements above are. However if an achievement doesn't require anything new beyond it's constituent achievements, than it has no reason to exist."

In the contrary, the nba has 30 teams each with 15 players, totaling at 450 players. There Are also 27 g league teams full of nba prospects who are considered to be the best basketball players out of the nba. Adding these players, the two leagues together have at most 965 players. The median player would be presumably the 482.5th best basketball player in the sport, which is a bigger accomplishment then being the median nfl player, being presumably the 848th best player of the sport.

3. The nfl draft hosts 7 round of drafts, in comparison to 2 rounds in the nba. As a median nfl draft pick, you are the 112 best player of your year. That is less valuable then if you are a median nba player, as the presumably 30.5th best basketball player in your year.

I'm a data engineer who's used ML/AI tools for data set analysis, and yes, I'm biased as hell, so please tell me how I'm wrong! I do genuinely want to test my ethical framework, and am not particularly strongly attached to my beliefs.

**#1:** ""It will replace artists!  No one will want to do art any more!""

That's possible, and cotton gins will replace cotton pickers - automation replacing workers has been a concern for a century, and nobody is really complaining about not having to separate seeds from threads by hand now. Because honestly, how intellectually stimulating is it drawing 50 different 32x32 pixel art food icons? There is a lot of rote art labor, and AI systems could significantly improve artist capabilities. Artists should be treating it as a tool to generate useful bases for new art, and instead focus on the detailing and fleshing out work that normally comes after the ""setting the scene"" process. This is the way it's been in data processing - the bulk labor is done by computers so that humans can do the fine-tuned and detail-oriented analytics part. I don't see why art can't be the same.

Additionally, the genie's out of the bottle - you can't ban technological advancements.  That has never worked in the history of mankind.  And you know what?  That sucks.  A lot of artists will lose a lot of jobs, because of bad actors choosing shitty mass-produced AI art over human-made quality art.  It's happened in the past, it's happening again, and I wish society would re-organize itself to make these events a joyous celebration, not a time of suffering.

**#2:** ""It will be shitty!""

Then artists shouldn't be threatened, and there will be a market for human-quality art, and AI art may always need human post-processing.

**#3:** ""It's stealing!""

This is the big ole hullabaloo, and I'm here to say, ""nah, not really"". The AI systems in question do not actually reference any specific piece of art when creating a new one - they look at it, learn from it, and the art is completely discarded, so no original works are stored. It's exactly the same as people looking at art, getting inspired by it, learning techniques from it and creating their own art from that.[Check out this](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion) for a guide on how one process actually trains and creates the art.

**#3a:** ""It's using people's existing artwork to make new artwork, and stealing parts of art is bad!""

It literally is not. To summarize it, it starts with a noise map of just random pixels, and then creates a completely new image pixel-by-pixel. No existing art is referenced in the creation process. No copyrighted art is stored.  No copyrighted art is directly referenced - and to try to attribute a work of art to a specific training materiel would require six billion attributions.

**#3b:** ""Training on other people's art is stealing!""

Yeah, no. First, it wouldn't be stealing, it'd be piracy, and second, people have been learning from other peoples' art since the beginning of time, and that has never been considered stealing. Just because learning is being automated does not mean that learning is stealing. No art is being removed from the ownership or possession of the creator.  The art is being viewed the same way humans view it.  It's used for training, and discarded.  When art is being created at the end, there is literally no art stored anywhere to reference - it was just looked at and learned from, and not stolen.

To try to ban learning from other people's art would be to ban learning art in general - and it is functionally impossible to ban automated learning without significantly impacting how the internet functions, how art is taught and how caching works.

Additionally, training on a specific artist's art is not required to duplicate that artist's art style - you simply need to have the AI train on everything that artist also trained on.  So banning training off of a specific artist's art will only delay, not stop, the ability for AI to copy that artist's art style.

\*\*#4: ""\*\*Artists spent valuable time and money learning and honing their skills - replacing that is theft!""

This actually has two interesting sub-arguments involved:

**#4a:** ""Artists had to struggle and study and work to learn art, and everyone else should have to too!""

This is the exact same argument used by some people to justify why they hate that other people are getting loan forgiveness.  ""I suffered, so they should too!"" is not a valid argument.  Instead of wanting to drag people down into your level of suffering, imagine a world where artists didn't have to endure a cost to make art!  This is like being mad at a calculator for replacing your mental math - yes, it's going to do it (or at least certain parts of it) better\* and faster than you, but that means you can instead focus on detailing and improving the base the AI gave you!  As a developer, if a computer could do 100% of my coding job, fantastic - I have \*plenty\* of project planning and organization to do!

\* If your instinct is to say, ""it won't be better!"", please see #2.

&amp;#x200B;

**#4b**: ""AI can only work off of other artists, so other artists should be compensated for participating in the process!""

So, should any artist be compensated for anything anyone else ever learned from them?  That seems unfeasible.  Additionally, since no images are stored by the AI, how would you enforce this?  How would you prove this?  This seems impossible.  Let's say that artists \*should\* be compensated.  Let's say a training model used 10 billion images, and you contributed 5 - is it fair to demand 5/10 billionths of any profits from that art?  If its art came out similar to yours, would we say that it was weighing your images more highly than evenly?  How would we calculate that?

But additionally, this is completely false - AI art can be generated off of just photos.  And this art can replicate artist's styles given the correct prompts - which can then be used to further derive the entire art industry.  Art from a specific artist is not required to mimic that artist's style.

Though, this implies that non-profit AI art is fine, and I'm cool with that.

&amp;#x200B;

**#5:** ""People use it to rip off other people's art styles, or lie about making it unassisted!""

So be mad at those people who are misusing a tool and lying about it, not the tool. It was their choice to use the tool to plagiarize, just like someone who did straight-up actual plagiarism. Complaining that the tool makes it easier to plagiarize is like complaining that a drill makes it easier to crack safes. Yes, it does, but why are you hating on the fucking appliance?

And man, that's all I'm here to say - stop hating the application that is AI art, and start hating the people who are making cheap knockoffs with it.

So why create so much confusion and have the word point to two very different kind of ways of processing emotional information? Ways that are so different that it could be argued that with the people representing the extreme capabilities in each, they become at least somewhat mutually exclusive?

Why not just state out loud that talking about the ”affective” and ”cognitive” side of empathy makes zero sense, and it borders on gaslighting. There is no other ”casting defect” in our everyday language that has lead even close to as much confusion about the very basics of how the human mind works.

You can’t talk about anything that has something to do with psychology, without running into people struggling with these concepts, often mostly because of the f’d up terminology.

2195,2022-12-17,CMV: the words 'master' and 'slave' should not be removed from tech,u/daysofdre,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zob4xe/cmv_the_words_master_and_slave_should_not_be/,changemyview,"For context, I am a black male who works in tech. 

In recent years, there has been a movement to purge the words 'master' and 'slave' from the tech industry. I understand why it seems like a good idea. The purge is meant to create a more welcoming atmosphere for people of color to work in. However, I don't think the removal of the words empowers POC tech workers but achieves the opposite. 

'Master' and 'slave' are not the 'N' word in the sense that they do not exist to solely denigrate a population. Nor are they the 'F' word, which had a different historical meaning but is now used as a slur to attack members of the LGBT community. 

The term in and of itself is agnostic. It does not inherently refer to people or a group of people, but the relationship between two nouns (I believe historically it was used to describe the relationship between hard drives in an array). 

By removing these words from the field, we are affirming the idea that the words refer to individuals. This correlation does not serve to empower but instead creates false correlation where the words are now as abhorrent as the 'N' and 'F' words. That they referred to a group of people all along. 

Removing the words also removes the dialogue. It side-steps the actual, societal issue - that we, as people of color, still identify with these terms. Still think of ourselves in these terms.

I don't want to disparage advocates of this movement by calling it 'virtual signaling'. I truly appreciate the efforts to make the workplace more inclusive. It means people are thinking about ways to support their colleagues, however small.

I understand that at its face value, it seems like a good idea. But I think it's counter-intuitive to remove the words. At the end of the day, we are empowering the words instead of empowering our people to sever our connections to them."

I believe that he’s the type of “funny” that would thrive as the class clown or as the funny guy in the friend group, but his comedic skills fall short on the bigger stage because he is a one-dimensional talent relying on physical comedy. His legend also grew with his untimely death, as it often occurs with young celebrities.

UPDATE:
After reading your comments I must admit that I don’t have an affinity for physical comedy as much as I do for stand up and other forms of comedy that mix up the bag a bit more. I guess it’s just a matter of taste at the end of the day, so to say he wasn’t good at his particular style of comedy is a bit unfair on my end, even if I didn’t like it myself.

63,2022-12-17,"CMV: AI Art is not ""Theft"" in any conventional sense of the word.",u/LavenderMidwinter,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zogmqc/cmv_ai_art_is_not_theft_in_any_conventional_sense/,changemyview,"AI Art is not theft. Many artists are currently holding AI to a higher standard than they hold their fellow humans when it comes to ""stealing"" art.

While things like plagiarism and copying can exist within creative works, artists and writers tend to agree on certain standards of what constitutes theft- generally, they agree if things are transformative of an original work or a different interpretation of the same style, they do not count as theft. If a human created a new interpretation of The Mona Lisa or something *done in the style of* an existing artist like Van Gough or Margritte or Dali, it is not considered theft by the artistic community- and the community does not find it necessary to credit every influence or style originator that may have contributed to the creation of their work. These standards should apply equally to AI created art.

I think the view that AI art is ""theft"" mainly comes from misunderstanding how AI creates the images or what current artists take for granted when it comes to the creative process, or mere frustration with the ease in which new images are created. To avoid straw manning, I'm going to refute the POV expressed by one artist here:

https://www.facebook.com/shaunnapeterson/posts/pfbid02Ciu9MVmSVLFpKRh7wWB4Na2Q2jFA32XsdKZ7Z6dcQTt4APuyeSXSE5fN47chFVhXl

Generally, she believes that an AI *trained* on her artwork and utilizing her style counts as theft. But humans do the same thing- Humans, if tasked with making something of a certain style- will *train* their brains by looking at images from within the style, and then trying to replicate it. This is the same thing AI does. People reproduce artwork from their memory of how things look and how certain art styles look. For example if an artist wanted to make something in a Steampunk art style for example, they'd Google ""Steampunk"", go to images, get an understanding of the style, and make their own creation- or just go off of their memory of what the style looked like.

If a person took an image from Google, copy-pasted an unmodified part of an existing artwork into a work, *then* that would rightly be considered as theft. If that person merely used a part of an existing image *as inspiration or a model* to draw their own version of, that is not considered theft. The way neural networks work is by the latter. If any Redditor can find me a good example of something blatantly copied off of an existing artwork, that would do a great deal towards changing my view. So far all I've seen is unique images in a similar style to existing ones.

She believes AI ought to get permission from the creator in order to be trained on her style- but this isn't a normal standard for anyone creating art. No one needs to dig up Da Vinci if they want to make Renaissance style art- no one needs to get permission from Osamu Tezuka to draw something Anime or Manga. Andy Warhol doesn't even need permission from Campbell's Soup to create this: https://i.imgur.com/zHbpFel.png

*Style* is not owned by anyone within a creative community and people asserting ownership over a style is usually laughed at by those within the creative community. AI art generators are merely doing what human artists currently do, but on a superhuman scale.

I will acknowledge one legal exceptions that I think should apply **equally** to humans as it does to AI- using copyrighted **characters** and **stories** is rightly considered theft- you can have an AI or human design a Star Wars scene, and Disney can legally send you a cease and desist to not display the artwork, **BUT they do not have a monopoly on Space Opera or Space Western art styles**. For this exception I think artists acknowledge the legal reality of this situation, while also in their own minds categorizing fan-art that's drawn by taking inspiration from the existing Star Wars universe as ""original"" and not considering it as stolen.

A counter-example that would help change my view is providing an example of scandal within the artistic community where the artistic community had a consensus that artwork was ""stolen"" from another person, side by side with an artwork ""stolen"" from an existing artist by an AI in a similar way."

Don’t get me wrong there a range of negatives that capitalism brings into society, but the main positive comes in the form of innovation, communism stops innovation. If no one could benefit from financial gain, then technological advancements wouldn’t be widespread as they are today, in western settlements. I think it’s safe to say we wouldn’t be living with most of the things we take for granted today if capitalism was replaced with communism say 100 years ago."

I know that sounds far fetched, but let me explain.

A lot of people, especially Christians stand out in the streets, singing hymns (which is fine, generally hymns are fairly beautiful songs, and there’s no reason street performers should be considered any different from hymn-singers) However, one particular Christian group (Evangelists, maybe?) are particularly partial to fearmongering and blatant intimidation. Telling people they’re going to Hell should be considered disturbing the peace honestly but that’s besides the point.

I digress. My view is that promoting the preaching of these religions is promoting harassment, breaches of the peace, and whilst I get that argument uno is going to be that it’s a slippery slope fallacy and such, I think it’s indisputable that telling people to “save” their friends and family members by “opening their eyes” is basically just inciting harassment.

Retail stores should have consistent employee schedules. They know what days and times are day are busiest. They know employees are hard to find and offering consistent hours will attract better/more stable workers. Even if the stores si slightly less efficient with an extra person on a shift or two, customers may appreciate the extra help and it more than makes up for employees leaving due to poor scheduling.

A company relying on the random schedules of multiple people is a poorly run store and puts absolute efficiency over the needs and potentially loyalty of employees."

1. Anonymous was founded to equalize the world. They realized people are too stupid to be fair if they are in power. Nowadays, people see hackers like Anonymous as terrorists. 

2.  4chan was the Reddit of the old world and now because of some dumb raids by government forces that really aren’t that logical, it is now considered part of the dark web even tho it isn’t. 

3. Hackers are often portrayed as beings who exist on the dark web who want to ruin your life. Companies hire hackers to protect themselves. Steve Jobs and Wozniak were both hackers. The first hackers were actually in MIT’s train program (now it’s AI program)

4. The dark web is now seen as bad. But I’ve been on it several times. The truth is: it’s the first FREE place that actually has individual FREEDOM. Also the FBI and NSA jointly made TOR so it’s not illegal but ppl believe it is. 

5. Hackers and their groups like Anonymous have shaped this world in important ways. They’ve stabilized countries. Helped the underdog (i.e. Ukraine and Iranian ppl) when no one else does. And exposes the corrupt (HBGary, Church of Scientology) and generally helps the world.

1)Technology

Once upon  a time (not that long ago), the best you could have at home was a small and thick CRT TV.  It got the job done, but if you wanted a nice crisp viewing experience for a movie. You had to go to a cinema. Same applies for sound.But now you can easily get a half decent monitor or TV for a fraction of the cost of what they once were, So Cinemas keep pushing the envelope with 3D, IMAX, Vibrating seats, 4D and so on, for diminishing returns and increased costs to tickets.

2)Viewing Habbits

Most people nowadays watch things on their phones and tablets. Some people don't even own a TV. It has just become more practical to have all of your shows and movies on the go. Watch them while travelling, while in public transports, waiting room, on your break and so on.

3)Audience Behaviour

This is based on personal experience, but most of the times I can see a sea of phone screens once the lights go down. People not simply checking the time, but chatting or taking pictures to post online. You have teenagers screaming and running commentary througout the whole movie. You have little kids taken to movies not appropriate for them, resulting in constant chatter or screaming.

Now people will respond with ""That's the ushers failure for not dealing with them/Why didn't you complain"". Cinemas cannot afford to lose money, so throwing out a group of 5 teens causing chaos is a no go.

Taking that into account, I'd rather watch  a movie at home. Without randos gunning for their 5 minutes of internet fame.

4)Cinemas don't earn money from movies, they are overpriced convenience stores

It's no secret that at most 30% of the ticket price goes to the cinema, but 100% of the profits from food and drinks stay in house. So if you want even a bottle of water to drink during a bloody 2 and a half hour long movie, you better be ready to pay triple the normal cost. I am here to watch a movie, not be ripped off for popcorn.

&amp;#x200B;

Taking all of this in mind, cinemas have two options. Either to die out and havie everything go digital, removing the middle man.

Or they can become luxury brands and sell premium viewing experiences.

0,2022-12-18,"CMV: body autonomy goes both ways: since women want their bodies to become liberated (not being pushed to wear makeup, dress a certain way, being chaste, etc), then so should men not be stigmatized for having extramarital intercourses and sex with prostitutes.",u/Future_Green_7222,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zozl9i/cmv_body_autonomy_goes_both_ways_since_women_want/,changemyview,"The discussion doesn't really need gender distinction, but writing ""men"" and ""women"" in the title is catchy. Men are also famous for not being able to pleasure women, so it'd be benefitial to women too.

The body autonomy movement (which is mostly concentrated on women, though not exclusively) wants to advocate in topics like makeup, clothes, abortion rights, chastity, etc. Ex 1: women have been expected to dress 'appropriately' *and* to be chaste until marriage *and* to be good at sex *and* to have children *and* to wear makeup to look nice but not too much. Ex 2: there were many laws against crossdressing (for either sex).

I think that another part of the movement should be to de-stigmatize extramarital intercourse and sex with prostitutes. That kind of stigma is also trying to bind bodies to a specific set of unnecessary societal rules. This would solve some of our current problems, like the protests of the incels. In purely economic terms, a freer market would fulfill the demand for sex.

Edit 1: I gave a delta away for someone who mentioned STD's. In that case, the sexual life of one partner does have real consequences for the other partner. But I say, as long as they're wearing protection, I hold my view. Extramarital sex does not bring any real consequences for the other partner besides being an unncesseary social taboo, as any other taboos restricting bodily autonomy.

Some people argue about whether restricting extramarital sex constitutes as a restriction of bodily autonomy. I  think it is related to individual body autonomy to the extent that one  spouse has a choice over what is socially acceptable for the other spouse to do with their body. Some people respond that the restriction of extramarital sex falls more closer to contract law: both parties agreed. Yes, but contract law can still be exploitative. Imagine a country where slavery is still allowed, but only for people in debt. People would blame the slaves ""but you chose to take that loan out"" disregarding the social circumstance that even allowed them to fall into that situation.

Finallty, what benefit would this freedom bring? I'll argue in terms of economics. Sex is currently not a free market because of the social stigma around it. Unfair markets always have troubles. First, demand does not meet supply, which leaves us withd incels. You can't be an ""involuntary celibate"" if it's completely OK to go buy sex. Second, there's a lot of unnecessary energy wasted in affairs. The cheater wastes energy trying to hide around and the cheated wastes emotional energy crying. If extramarital sex were normalized, these two people could use this energy in something more productive.

I think the sitgma around extramarital sex is similar to the stigma against homosexuals. There's nothing inherently wrong. You are not directly hurting your partner. All the hurt and negativity come from the social stigma around it. Remove the social stigma, and you'll save up a lot of unnecessary hurt.m

I believe sex is a human need, like food. We should not have social laws around who gets to eat food and when - though food does cost and can't be stolen. I think sex should be just like that.

Edit 2: Someone almost convinced me with contract law. u/peonypegasus wrote:

&gt; if I tell my friend that I will drive him to a doctor’s appointment and I  don’t, he is right to be upset with me and call me a flake. If I had  made no such promise and didn’t drive him to the appointment, it would  be fine. 

To which I say, the  difference between the promise of ""taking my friend to see a doctor""  and the promise of ""you'll only have sex with me"" is that your friend  will truly benefit from you fulfilling your promise. Visiting the doctor  is objectively and physically benefitial to your friend.

But  were you to ask your spouse ""why do you want me to be exclusive?"" the  answer is ""just coz"". Actually, it'd be ""because of tradition"". There's a  tradition for sexual exclusivity. But there's nothing inherently wrong  with having sex with someone else. The entire anger and negativity come  from the social stigma, and nothing more. It's kinda like saying ""gay are bad because of tradition"". It's a bad contract that hurts both parties and brings no objective benefit to no one. I think of sexual exclusivity not as a contract, but as a tradition that is expressed as a contract. We have a tradition of writing a contract that hurts both parties. "
0,2022-12-18,CMV: Republicans should drop some of their right wing economic stances.,u/FlowerTheMate,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zp0lee/cmv_republicans_should_drop_some_of_their_right/,changemyview,"The republican party has the reputation as a party of ""personal responsibility"", in essence they have a firmly neoclassical view on economics, in their view everyone is awarded the same natural rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Many republicans want a minimal state, or atleast something close to it (in terms of economics), they want a government that protects individual rights (first and foremost the right to own and use private property) and they want the government to provide certain services that won't be provided by the free market (infrastructure, fire services etc) and obviously a military to defend against foreign threats. The issue with this ideology is obvious and has been debated for a long time, it by definition ensures inequality, some people will rise to the top, while others will hang behind. In theory this is because of their lack of ""personal responsibility"". 

But the issue is obviously that in modern society some people start with massive disadvantages, while others start with billions of dollars. Some people will have to spend time looking after sick relatives because the government won't provide sufficient aid, some people will have to work several jobs just to stay afloat, maybe forgoing the chance of a higher education. 

In such an unequal society the republican party should drop their fanatic adherence to neoclassical ideology for several reasons. It will directly help their constituents to promote a more left leaning (not socialist) but more left wing economic agenda. Many people in rural areas are severely marginalized, they are mocked and dehumanized by many democrats and leftists as ""Racist, deplorable, inbred"" etc. But at least for now, what is the republican party offering them in contrast? I would say it's not much. So it is a really though choice for a rural voter I would say, between the: 

1. Democrats (which might have some ok economic policies but will spit in your face), and the:
2. Republicans (who will just ignore your economic concerns while distracting with culture war stuff).

I think the republican party being conservative on social issues, but moderate/left leaning on economic issues would be better for the American people. If you disagree change my view."

One of them dropped out of high school to join a almost circus with their girlfriend at the time. They tried to hide behind excueses like ""I'm passionate about making people happy"". Looking back, that's a bad reason to seek a job since (almost) every job in the world helps people ;it's hard to justify paying someone to not help someone. They had friends that told them it was a bad idea and they just cut off the unsupportive friends. 6 years later? They are single, the circus went under, and they finally got their first job a few months ago as a part time gym substitute. 

Another recently-ish moved to another country and gave up the career they fought hard for because their girlfriend at the time wanted to be closer to home. Now, not only did they break up, but they can't seem to get a job anymore in their prior industry since no employer likes the answer to his job gap. ( I've even been there told 3 times at conferences that they weren't getting hired because the company was looking for people who could stay with the company a few years which is strange bc the job he had before leaving the company he was at for 5 years )  

Even now that I am on a hiring team, I understand it is hard to convince my team for job gaps. It is hard to convince them for career shifts and pivots unless someone literally has a masters. 

The reason I bring this up is, following your passions is better advice **outside of your day-to-day job**. Pick a job that enables you to pursue passions outside of work if anything. 

Personally, I love my job, but if you asked me in high school, their is no way I would do the job I am doing rn. 

Who ever thought of ""find your dream job"" really probably meant ""I don't want to be held responsible for your potential employment""

Edit 2 - 
Sorry to be clear the first story was someone who was passionate about making people happy. So they joined the circus since it fueled their passion. 

The second story was someone who gave up their career for their girlfriend because their girlfriend made them happier then their career. 

But let me use a situation that involves no romantic partners. 

One time one of my co-workers was a UX designer and really loved doing UX Design but also really making animation! They even have a YT animation channel. And we worked together in tech for about 3 years before they got a contact job to work as a 2D key framer animator on a mid length film in another country. Not only did they go, they loved their job while there so much they chose to keep working in the industry when they came back to america! 

After about 9 months of applying regularly, despite having a sizable Youtube Following &amp; a professional credit, they couldn't find any junior Key Frame animator roles. After about a year and a half, they tried going back to UX design, but the field became super competitive and saturated to the point she could no longer get back in. 

She loved her UX job as it was. But she eventually got used to it. SO she tried doing her hobby as a full time job. In pursuit of it, she lost her ability to do both. She says in interviews, they always ask her about her youtube channel and digital presence since now googling her name will show her youtube channel first so now she can't really get a job anywhere since they feel her hobbies are more important then her work job. 

She does regret chasing that new thing now. 

Edit - to be clear, my friends have pointed out they regret the choices they made. Sorry for not being clear. 

They regret making those choices because ""passion"" wasn't a sustainable reason to make the decisions they made. And anyone who went against them following passion for rational reasons was cut out of their life because I guess american's are die hard on the concept of **either you are with me or you're against me** when in reality, **if someone cares enough to tell you you are making a mistake, it's probably worth heeding**

Now I'm kinda at a point where I will support my friends and just go silent when they get into decisions like this unless we are like best friends."
0,2022-12-18,CMV: The U.S has too many elected positions that should be appointed,u/leftist20021234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zp6st0/cmv_the_us_has_too_many_elected_positions_that/,changemyview,"When talking about elections in the U.S people often only talk about presidential elections or possibly congressional elections, but there are many more levels of elected government in the United States. At the state level, there are state legislatures. At the local level, there are many, many elected positions.

My view is that there are way too many government positions that should be appointed rather than elected. At the federal level, I think the President, US House and US Senate should be elected by the general populace. Although, I'd prefer abolishing the Senate entirely, if it exists, it should be elected by the masses.

At the state level, we should elect the state legislator and governor/LT governor. However, I think positions such as state attorney general, state SOS (secretary of state), secretary of public instruction (education), mine inspector, auditor, comptroller, ect should be appointed by the governor and approved by the state legislature.

On a local level, the county executive and the city/county council should be elected.

Here is a list of just some of the local elected officials in various states/counties/cities across the US:

district attorney, treasurer, recorder of deeds, surveyor, parks and recreation board of commissioners, cemetery district board of commissioners, family court judges, school board, sheriff, coroner, hospital district board of commissioners, planning/zoning boards, water conservation board, fire district board, transit board, auditorium board, ect

According to polling, most people cannot name their U.S Representative, or even all 3 branches of the federal government, so how can we expect them to know who to vote for in their local sewage commission election? This has led to a lot of unqualified people in these positions, such as the coroner's office. Many coroner's offices across the country are run by coroners with no medical experience.

It would be better to appoint these officials, either by the governor of the state, the city council, or some other elected body."

I DON'T CARE ABOUT CURRENT MUSK-LED TWITTER. 




Twitter is a private business which, like all other businesses, has a primary goal of making money. 

Twitter's number one priority is to protect its bottom line, and thus fulfill its financial commitment to its shareholders. 

If a world leader decides to use the services that a private company provides but then engages in behavior that causes that business to lose money, doesn't that business have the right and the freedom to do whatever it can to protect its shareholders and finances? 

Should a business be forced to operate at a loss in the name of some arbitrary standard that most people agree on but isn't legally imposed on private companies, like free speech? 

If this private company decides it likes one world leader more than another, surely it would be ""unfair"" to amplify one of their voices and censor the other, but is it illegal or unconstitutional?

My view is that Twitter should not exist in the way it does today, and if a private company is big and powerful and influential enough to be hosting world leaders, it needs to be held to different standards. New laws and regulations need to be written that would enforce fair and equal treatment between all voices. 

It is unfair and disingenuous to fault Twitter for violating laws and regulations which currently do not exist. 

I've heard lots of armchair specialists arguing about the ""publisher vs platform"" or whatever, but until the definition of ""platform"" is clearly defined and enshrined in law or some federal regulation, it's entirely meaningless (as it applies to Twitter. Currently there's too much gray area for it to be a clear cut case). 

Furthermore, the group of people most angry with Twitter also tend to be the same people most in support of free market capitalism. Isn't this just the free market at work? Wouldn't free market capitalists argue that if Twitter acts unfairly, people will boycott and support Twitter's competitor instead? Thus phasing out the ""bad"" companies and elevating the better competitors? God knows they've tried, with parler and truth social, but a couple dozen users between the two will never beat out Twitter's massive size and scope. (Which is the biggest flaw of the free market - once a company gets too big, competitors don't stand a chance.) 

Is it possible to be angry with Twitter while also espousing free market values without sounding like a hypocrite? 

Twitter engaged in some shady practices but it was in uncharted waters where it shouldn't have ever been allowed to be in the first place. 

Big change needs to happen before something else like Twitter could exist fairly and ethically."

People who have gone to therapy for 10+ years and still struggle just the same have not been very successful and should probably seek other help (other therapists, alternatives, etc). Furthermore, I think a sense of pride in mental health issues is also a mistake. The consistent I’m so depressed lol culture is not how life is supposed to be. If you are depressed, feel free to own it, but it is not a joke and should be something to be fixed. Mental health issues are just that, an issue, and the continual acceptance of not trying to end issues is a problem in its own.

If you played Goldeneye-007 back then, it was incredible, BL2’s Nvidia PhysX still blow my mind now and with games like Elden Ring recently blowing the other nominations from GOTY out of the water, some companies rush to keep up.

Such is the case with games like Cyberpunk which, whilst an impressive game, was too ambitious with their supposedly branching storylines all ending in the same place. Cyberpunk is expecting an expansion soon to profit from the game whilst CDPR can still try.

Of course the other side of this, is F2P.

F2P can be a fantastic way to make money and that’s reflected in the fortunes they make via in-app purchases such as gems in Smite and the COD Points in Warzone and Warzone 2.

The issue is with well-respected franchises.

Overwatch was a new IP by Blizzard intended to push their way into the class-based hero shooter market, and they made quite the splash, making hundreds of millions through loot box purchases on top of game sales over the past 5 or so years since release. DLC was released in the form of free updates with every other purchase being cosmetic.

Overwatch 2 released in 2022, taking its predecessor offline and essentially functioning as an update that removed the ability to earn loot boxes containing paid content for free, in exchange for allowing you to outright buy items from the shop for the low price of £10-£15 per skin. Pay-to-win has been implemented in the form of a battle pass that contains one new hero per season. Power creep is a huge issue as Blizzard must keep people satisfied with their purchase, leading to newer heroes being unbalanced purely to push the player to buy the pass in order to be able to compete.

Destiny 2 was a successor to successful FPS MMORPG Destiny, created by Bungie, who were renowned for creating the first three and a half Halo Games. Eventually it also went free-to-play, allowing the devs to charge well over the standard price for expansions that are not worth the money. Destiny also has PVP elements such as Gambit and the Crucible wherein you could potentially be at a disadvantage for not having paid money for a free game. 

Respectively, Overwatch 2 was listed by Kotaku as one of the “Most Disappointing Games of 2022”, quoting the following:

&gt;”Overwatch 2 is a bummer
The original Overwatch was another one of the many games in 2022 to bite the dust and when it died it was replaced immediately by its successor. This could have worked. Blizzard could have taken the original game and updated it in a big way and got people excited to play Overwatch again.”
&gt;”Instead, Overwatch 2’s launch was a giant mess with server issues, bugs, broken characters, overpriced skins, phone login requirements, tons of grinding, a shitty battle pass, and no PvE content—a big part of the initial Overwatch 2 pitch. Today, a few months later, Overwatch 2 is in a better place, but it still feels like Blizzard picked the absolute worst way to roll this game out and then screwed up that plan, too.”

This excerpt points to the game being a blatant cash grab, and negative publicity kills games off the fastest. 

F2P is a very bad panic-button for game studios to use because a lot of the time all of the changes to the game, even on a baseline level, serve only to grab money without devs taking into account the extra work and development required. Owing to this, the devs get overwhelmed and release a subpar game, effectively killing off that game entirely.

Another case is Evolve (RIP) which I really wished would get its swan song upon releasing Stage 2, the F2P release. Interest surged for a month and then the game died again. 

I’d be interested to hear other views on this topic."

In most situations, a goal is a rare and difficult achievement. In a penalty shot, however, the shooter has a tremendous advantage over the goalkeeper. Therefore, drawing a penalty shot in the box is clearly the best option in terms of chance of success of getting a goal. This statistical imbalance leads to high stakes and controversial umpiring, flopping, and skews the results of matches. A foul in basketball is not usually a big deal, as the odds of getting a basket are pretty high anyway. In soccer, since the odds of scoring a goal even under ideal conditions are low, the price of a penalty is extreme and frequently changes the outcome of games. This imbalance is also obvious in penalty kicks tiebreaker scenarios. 

The obvious solution is that the shot should be significantly further away from the goal than is currently the case. Nothing else would need to change to correct the statistical imbalance and reduce the consequences of calling a foul in the box. The player should be far enough away from the goal that the goalkeeper should be able to stop all but the most extraordinary shots, as in the game itself when play is underway normally. 

The current system introduces too much serendipity to the outcome. A quick whistle on a nervous ref, a momentary or slight touch by a defender that is exaggerated by an attacking player - its all relatively random. 

If the distance from the goal were set such that the odds of a successful shot were reduced by 75%, given the relative improbability of a goal in active play, the deterrent effect on defenders would still be sufficient to stop gross fouls in the box. Games would be decided in a way more consistent with how the game is played 99% of the time (involving running, passing, and shooting). In short, I would like to see penalties significantly harder to turn into goals."

0,2022-12-18,CMV: any justification for transgender also works for “transracial” individuals,u/randompika226,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zpg1ve/cmv_any_justification_for_transgender_also_works/,changemyview,"I trulyyy don’t understand how transracial is any different from transgender, in fact I think transracial makes significantly MORE sense than transgender.

Race has legitimately zero genetic basis whereas “gender” has obvious roots in biology (otherwise transgenders wouldn’t experience “gender dysphoria”, get sex reassignment surgery or take hormones).

The best example that race is made up and more flexible than transgender: Sub-Saharan Africa. Africans aka “black” people are literally the most genetically diverse group on the planet and yet they are all lumped up as ONE big group, “black”. There’s more genetic difference between two Africans, ie a Nigerian and a Khoisan person than there are between a European and a Chinese person. Not to mention that just about a century ago, East Africans such as Somalis and Ethiopians were considered to be “Hamites” which was crazily enough a subgroup of CAUCASIANS, not “negroids” or what we now consider as “black”. This is proof that race has no basis in biology or reality so what’s the reason that transracial is not allowed but transgender is..? 

If an Ethiopian today says that they’re not black and that they’re Caucasian, they’d be in for a world of a lecture on why they’re wrong even though a century ago this was considered a truth and a fact of science.

Meanwhile today at the same time, a linebacker with a penis and XY chromosomes can easily identify as a woman and even play in women’s sports without question despite the fact that biological sex is something that’s ACTUALLY real and rooted in biological fact. Men and women have a whole different anatomy, chromosomes, skeletal structure, real CONCRETE biological differences I really don’t understand how is gender/sex something that can be changed and not race.

Why is it that race (something that has NO biological basis) can’t be changed but gender (which has a basis in biology) can? And before anyone says race dysphoria doesn’t exist: try raising a black or Chinese kid in a majority white area and watch the kid desperately want to be white 🫠 (aka my fourth grade self) so please someone explain and try to change my opinion

**TL:DR** my arguments 

1) Race is not real but gender is rooted in biology, so it makes no sense to believe gender can be changed but race can’t

2) race dysphoria absolutely can be real in the case of children of racial minorities and also transracially adopted children

3) My last point: “transracial” isn’t any more “racist” than transgender is sexist. The whole premise “gender is a social construct” suggests that being a woman/man requires nothing more than to identify with the socially constructed ideals aka STEREOTYPES of each gender therefore it reinforces the same sexist stereotypes we’ve been trying to erase in the name of progress ?"
0,2022-12-18,CMV: Telling Your Child To Be Vegan is a Form of Child Abuse,u/the_malaysianmamba,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zpgblw/cmv_telling_your_child_to_be_vegan_is_a_form_of/,changemyview,"Most vegans I've spoke to insist that their reason to converting to veganism is two-fold: The morality aspect (hurting and eating animals is wrong), and nutritional aspect (it's healthier for you).

I respect everyone's ability to make personal decisions, however I believe pushing that lifestyle onto your children is abusive. I will explain why by addressing both the morality and nutritional aspect. 

\&gt; Eating meat is morally wrong

I disagree with the notion that eating animals is morally wrong, while saying it's okay to eat plants / vegetables.  

There is ongoing debate among scientists, philosophers, and others about whether plants are sentient, or capable of experiencing consciousness or subjective experiences. While plants do not have the same type of nervous system as animals, and therefore do not have the capacity for the same level of consciousness as animals, they do exhibit a number of behaviors that suggest they are capable of responding to their environment in a variety of ways.

For example, plants are able to sense and respond to light, temperature, humidity, and other environmental stimuli, and they are able to communicate with each other and with other organisms through chemical signals. Some research has also suggested that plants may have the ability to feel pain or other forms of suffering, although this is still an area of active research and debate.

Overall, while it is difficult to say definitively whether plants are sentient, it is clear that they are capable of complex behaviors and responses to their environment, both of which are forms of sentience. Thus if you say eating animals are morally wrong because they are killed / feel pain, you'd also have to avoid eating plants / plant based products just to be sure you aren't killing plants. 

\&gt; Eating meat is unhealthy

Studies have suggested that vegan diets are nutritionally deficient in Vitamin B12, Iron, Calcium, and  Omega-3 fatty acids. 

Now, you can get these vitamins/minerals through supplements or certain vegan food like beans, lentils and tofu, however the *bio-availability* (how easily your body absorbs) of these essential nutrients are less when compared to when found in meat/animal based products. Keep in mind Vitamin B12 is almost exclusively found in animal products.

Thus, telling your child to be vegan is abusive because you are robbing them of essential nutrients in a time that is critical for their physiological, and mental development."

""Naively optimistic"" would be better phrasing. Thanks.

After reading a number of arguments and debates online, I've become a bit of a pessimist in relation to the advacement of AI. I'd like to lay out some of the arguments I've heard, my initial reaction, and hope to generate some discourse on any number of the points in no specific order. This is in regards to upcoming AI within the next few decades, not the current standard we are able to use.

***-*** ***AI will only evolve how people do their jobs, not replace them completely.*** ***If it does, they can just get new jobs.***

While I agree a select few jobs will see improvement with AI assistance, I feel its far too hopeful to expect companies to not focus on the bottom line. Leading to handfuls of layoffs as a machine that can do 80-90% of the quality at thousands of times the rate pushes all but the top performers out of an industry. When this is widespread throughout multiple industries, there won't **be** any other jobs for people to switch to that aren't hard labor. For a business to remain competitive in the space, they will need to transition to a more automated work force to keep up. With the a high supply and low demand of workers looking for jobs, the ones that remain can offer near nothing in compensation.

***- AI will create new jobs for people to educate and train themselves in.***

I do not believe the rate of jobs created to jobs lost will be a 1:1 ratio. Furthermore, what's to stop many of these new jobs from being automated not long after they're created by better AI?

***- AI will usher in societal safety nets such as UBI.***

This may be more likely in Socially Democratic countries, but in the U.S. where socialism is demonized in some political spheres, laws to assist a growing poverty class will be highly contentious. Lobbying to prevent corportations from paying an AI tax for displacing high amounts of workers, that could feed into some form of UBI, will be rampant.

***- AI will end capitalism***

I sort of agree with this at a slightly unrealistic and completely doomerist level, corporations entirely take over, no longer beholden to workers labor to make goods. They hire private miliatries to hold order and lavish in their small pockets of excess and wealth. I see this as a far more likely outcome than a fair and equal socialist society. This is probably my weakest thought, based more in fear and disdain for the vast swathes of croneyism that exist today.

***- AI will remove the need for people to work.***

If the ruling class lessens their hold on the reigns of power, this is possible, but unfortunately dependent on the former question. Why, exactly, would they give up their power to allow the plebians to be on equal footing? Additionally, AI on a large scale is likely very expensive. A bill that the upper 1% could foot, but would leave out much of the middle and lower class.

***- Humans and AI will integrate to form something new and powerful.***

Similar to the above, this is likely not going to be cheap. As with most transhuman ideals, it's likely not feasible for widescale deployment into each and every human on earth. Who do you decide gets implants? When? Why? Do you create a new caste of have and have-nots with this technology?

***- AI increases accessability to skills and other artistic mediums.***

I believe this devalues art and nuanced digital skills. Hand crafted items may retain a sort of novelty value. Art and design skills are often impressive because you can recognize the time and effort someone put into them. Creating something by hand and wishing to share it will cause it to be easily be copied by numerous tools. Potentially devalueing the novelty of it from thousands of AI created clones. What is the point of pursuing an artistic interest if everyone can do it and any unique style you come up with is quickly adapted and perpetuated?

I would like my view changed on any number of these because I want to view technological advancement as a positive force. One that will truly allow humans to become better and focus on higher pursuits. I consider myself moslty a realist with some optimistic takes and would like to be shown I may not be thinking entirely correctly on some of these points."
0,2022-12-19,"CMV: Homelessness is a quick and easy fix but politicians are too corrupt, lazy, or scared to do it.",u/MEYO6811,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zpk0sm/cmv_homelessness_is_a_quick_and_easy_fix_but/,changemyview,"There’s roughly 500k people suffering from a stage of homelessness. 

Stages include:
Living with friends or family temporarily (couch surfing).
Living in a car.
Living in a shelter.
Living on the street, in a tent or under a bridge.

Stage 1-3 can be fixed with job training, job placement, and government subsidies housing. Stage 4, living on the street, is slightly more difficult because these humans (in general) do not want rehabilitation and have found their “normal” lifestyle. Humans can accumulate and figure out ways to survive by lowering their standard of living.

That said. Living on the street should not be legal or looked over. When someone pitches a tent in a park or claims a spot on a side walk in their sleeping bag, they need to be put in a work-shelter-wellness system.

What does this mean?

This means tax incentives are made and established with manufacturing and farming companies to help train, house, and employ homeless workers.

Housing can be established on farms or near warehouses. These facilities will shelter the homeless. 

Farms and manufacturing facilities will supply jobs and training for said workers at a fair wage and with tax break insensitive.

For 1 year, “homeless” workers will work, be housed, be fed, and given skilled training with their wage being “saved” during employment. They will (ideally) be working out in the boondocks and away from drugs, giving them the opportunity to get clean, save money, and ——wait for it—— get therapy for any mental health ailments.

After one year, their money is released and they are then setup with subsidized public housing and a job. They should be allowed to rent from the discounted housing for 1-2 years, and also be provided with continued mental health support and financial advisement.

If they then find themselves back to living on the streets, they start back at square 1 and off to the farm/warehouse the go.

Win, win, win, win situation.

The companies providing work/housing recieves labor, tax credits, and goodwill endorsement/PR.

The homeless person gets skill development and 2-3 year’s financial/employment help and (mental) health benefits.

The government gets more products to outsource, building a strong economy.

Civilians get safety walking the streets and value for the inflated rent/mortgage they are paying. (I’m referring to New York, San Francisco, Venice Beach, and Santa Monica to name a few)

This would also provide more jobs in mental health, financial services, job development, and coordination for said programs.

Also, the same or similar programs can be used for phase 1-3 of homelessness, just “less intense”.

My point is, 500k out of 330 million is not a lot of people.

It should be completely illegal to live on the streets and should NOT be looked passed or ignored by government.

Every voting [ballot and every running politician talks about “stopping homeless”](https://lacontroller.org/audits-and-reports/problems-and-progress-of-prop-hhh/) and for the past 10+ years taxes have increased and funds have be delegated but the numbers have only increased.

Lastly, people say [immigration is at a high in order to fix the labor shortage](https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2021/10/26/22733082/labor-shortage-inflation-immigration-foreign-workers)… THIS will help the labor shortage.

Change my view. Homeless people should be taken off the streets and put into a work/labor program, and politicians can easily remedy the problem but choose to use the funds elsewhere and are too lazy to create proper systematic solutions."

“If the lord is good why don’t they stop human suffering?”

In my opinion this is extremely narrow minded. For one, when we see an animal getting killed by another animal, we typically view this as natural, not suffering. So, the same thing can be said about us. In the eyes of The Lord, what makes us different than other creature in the cycle of nature.

Also, you could also say that creatures can ONLY do what’s natural to them. A bird flies and a fish can swim because it’s natural to them, so we can also say the same thing for human suffering. 

Now don’t get me wrong, there are some heinous people out there and I’m not saying their actions are justified in any way. In fact such people should be punished.

What I’m saying is that if there is any sensible reason as to why a higher power wouldn’t stop human suffering, I think this would be why.

People don't think children should be exposed to nudity.

Advertisers don't want their money going to something people dislike.

Therefore: Ban all nudity on the chance that an ad will play before it, angering parents, damaging customer-brand relations, averting advertisers.

I believe every single part of that rationale is confused, but I would love to know where I'm wrong.

Obviously, YouTube and Facebook are commercial platforms that are allowed to ruin their sites in any way they like. But for their own good, and the good of society, they ought not ban nudity."

Well the answer is, you don’t, if you don’t want to. I don’t even see if people tip nor do I care. When I go to other coffee shops and they ask for a tip, I just simply click “no tip”, because I don’t go out much. Tips at these establishments are not expected. The point is to allow people to tip on credit cards because *gasp* some people do want to tip but don’t have cash on them. What if someone comes in to a coffee shop everyday and knows all the staff, and just wants to tip but doesn’t have cash? There’s a bagel place me and my partner enjoy going too where the staff and owner are very nice and we sometimes will stop at a bank to grab cash tips for them. But we always say we wish they had credit card tips.

But my issue with that argument is that while California often votes blue, there are still a lot of people who vote red in that state. There are Republicans and Democrats in every town, city, state, ext. 

I'm not talking about other votable issues, only the president, because I do believe that individual states should be able to vote on their laws without the vote of other states affecting that because it does make sense that places like California would have different needs than somewhere like Kansas or Texas. 

I've heard the argument that Texas and California would decide the president for the entire country, but it's hard to believe that 2 states combined have more voters than the entire rest of the country and the president of the USA affects every single individual in the USA depending on what policies or situations they support/are against. 

For example, many people who vote red are against same sex marriage, yet we have a democratic president who just signed a law that allows this to happen. Alternatively, the opposite could happen with a republican president with the same situation or gun rights or abortion or any serious topic. 

Just want to read a different perspective on this and see if maybe I can change my point of view on this or not. It's been bugging me for many years whenever presidents are discussed and when I try to explain my view people just talk down to me instead of having a conversation about it."

ru pauls newest season has a promo where all the drag queens are covered head to toe in leather straps and ru paul says “super sweet sixteen” and i am getting underage (i know that the show has adults on it but the phrase sweet sixteen brings to mind underage teenage girls) and bdsm vibes from it. youtube it “ru paul season 15 promo” 

i dont understand how balenciaga is suffering because of a bdsm teddy bear and a piece of paper that you need to rotate and zoom to read, and ru paul is allowed to advertise with hypersexualized cross dressers. 16 is the age of consent but i still find it wildly inappropriate to have those things juxtaposed. 

i do not have anything against bdsm gear. i like it a lot actually. i really love the leather strap aesthetic but its purely for aesthetics and does absolutely nothing for me sexually, and that is why i dont think that balenciaga deserves any type of backlash for having those teddybears juxtaposed with those little girls. i remember seeing the ad and thinking “oooooo i like those teddy bears” and then hearing about the controversy. (please read this sentence very carefully) obviously i can see the connection and how people will find that offensive. but little girls play dress up and no one thinks that is bad but i bet the mom that wore those shoes was a kinky freak.

0,2022-12-19,CMV: At-will employment should not apply to employers,u/BONERR4EVER,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zpt8jc/cmv_atwill_employment_should_not_apply_to/,changemyview," 

As many of you may know, employment at will is the concept that either the employee or employer can terminate employment anytime for any reason; a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all.

This needs major reform, and it should not be a state-by-state basis issue. This should be universal, maybe even international, and here starts my rant:

Employers should no longer be legally permitted to terminate an employee this easily. However, an employee should still be legally allowed to quit just as easily.

The reason I say this, and I know there are many exceptions to this statement, but largely, when an employer terminates an employee, that financially ruins the employee, whereas if an employee quits, it's not a major impact on the employer.

An employee loses his job, he could lose his house and become irreparably destitute. An employer loses an employee, job posting is published same say and they're replaced in a few weeks with no loss of income.

Do not get it twisted, I am not saying ""no employee ever should ever be fired."" That's a nice pipe dream, but a nightmare. What I'm saying is, it should be tougher for an employer to let someone go.

Each termination should be reviewed by the same bureau that handles unemployment. When an employer lets an employee go, there needs to be sufficient documentation/evidence that justifies why the employee was let go.

Simply stating that ""this isn't working out"" or ""you're not a good fit"" should not be good enough. IF they weren't a good fit or working out, document it.

You want to fire someone for wearing a red shirt? Put it in your employee handbook, and then document the employee wearing a red shirt.

You want to lay someone off? Provide a P&amp;L and a projection that shows that taking jobs away is the only way to become profitable. Document that all options prior to layoffs were exhausted prior.

You want to fire someone for conduct/performance? You better have your verbal and written warnings well-documented.

Employee wants to quit? No strings attached, good luck, stay in touch.

If the state bureau deems the documentation/justification insufficient, the termination is not allowed, the employee is granted his job back, back pay and front pay.

If the termination is allowed, the employee will be allowed to collect unemployment at the following rates:

Week 1: Full wages

Week 2: 99% of full wages

Week 3: 98% of full wages

etc.

That way, when an employee sees the dwindling money coming in each week, that'll encourage him to get a job without much worry about becoming destitute."

0,2022-12-19,CMV: Youtube Spoiler free reviews are just a form of advertisement and not an actual review of the movie,u/knownunknowningly,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zpurb5/cmv_youtube_spoiler_free_reviews_are_just_a_form/,changemyview,"Spoiler free reviews are unnecessary complicated by the fact that the user is unable to actually talk about anything that happens in the movie. Because of the need to hide spoilers, reviewers, such as YouTubers, post lengthy 10+ minutes of review, without actually going through any material they just watched. This is incredibly annoying for watching reviews of older movies because these YouTubers, won’t actually talk about the movie scenes or plot. This leads to a scenario where the enduser has to either wait for the YouTuber to post a spoiler review, or just watch something else upon the realization that there reviewer isn’t going to put up the effort of posting another video on the same topic.

For example, Avengers Endgame came out in 2019. At the time of release many YouTubers posted “spoiler free” reviews of this movie. It’s been many years since that movie came out. You watch endgame and want to see your favorite YouTubers interpretation of the movie. You then find out that this YouTube reviewer has posted a “spoiler free” version and thus doesn’t actually review anything about the movie. 

Can’t review too much plot, too much scenes, sometimes can’t even review the characters because “spoilers.” Without spoilers, spoiler free reviews are just advertising. Just because it’s popular now, doesn’t mean it’s going to be popular forever. Your YouTube review is eventually going to be old and nobody is going to watch it because people actually want to watch a review of a movie, not a vibe check of  “yeah this movie was cool, I can’t tell you what I thought was cool but should definitely go watch it in theaters (posted 5 years ago)” that’s just an advertisement that’s now outdated. 

The current version of this is “spoiler free” reviews of Avatar 2. In 6 months, everyone who wanted to see avatar, would have already gotten the opportunity to do so. My current example is how YouTuber penguinz0 posted a spoiler free review of avatar 2. That cool but like, what did you actually like in the movie? What scene did you find very interesting? What did you like the most? That’s all spoiler territory so I’m stuck with either having to wait and hope he reviews this topic AGAIN but with including spoilers. Or having to deal with no second review, in which case I’m glad this YouTuber gave me his own vibe check after I’ve already seen the movie myself. It’s just advertising the movie without contributing too much to the community. 

Advertisement itself is not an issue. The problem is that spoiler free reviews are just advertisements in disguised. Evidence being that, commercials, ads, and spoiler free reviews all lose value in “time” but spoiler free reviews are “timeless.” 

Change my view, if you’re not going to talk about what’s in the movie, you should not call it a review. A spoiler free review is essentially just advertisement that gets old quick"

0,2022-12-19,"CMV: The Emoji Movie does not significantly ""rip off"" any other popular work that was released before it was conceived",u/00PT,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zpv6ak/cmv_the_emoji_movie_does_not_significantly_rip/,changemyview,"# Overview

To be clear - **I do not unironically like The Emoji Movie**. I think it has nonsensical worldbuilding when you consider that it's meant to personify your phone's functions. I also believe it doesn't do anything particularly interesting with the premise that they ended up building (even if it doesn't fit as a personification, it could still be an interesting world), instead relying on product placement and brand names far more than it should. Plus, the movie is never unironically funny to me.

I have seen several reviews for this movie on Youtube and listened to people's opinions in real life. A lot of it I agree with, but there are specific arguments that are made that I believe do not hold water, and I am never inclined to support bad ideas simply because they agree with my position.

**One such argument that I take issue with is that The Emoji Movie blatantly rips off the plots of other films, such as Wreck-it Ralph and The Lego Movie.** I do not believe Sony Pictures did this any more than other films not considered rip-offs have. My points here can be more generalized to how other films are declared derivative, but I decided to focus on The Emoji Movie because it is one of the more infamous examples.

# Common Arguments

It's easy to see how The Emoji Movie could be considered a rip-off of other films such as Wreck-it Ralph and The Lego Movie:

1. The general premise of ""The secret life of X"" can be considered overused in popular media and is present in both examples I mentioned.
2. In both The Emoji Movie and Wreck-it Ralph, the plot can be generally described as ""The main character leaves their home in an attempt to prove their value to those who can't see it and meet a new friend along the way to this goal. Meanwhile, someone else of importance runs after the main character and ends up getting development themselves along the way.""
3. In both The Emoji Movie and The Lego Movie, the plot involves visiting a series of locations on the way to the goal, resembling the episodic structure that might be present in a series of shorts or TV show.
4. The Lego Movie's ""Wildstyle"" and The Emoji Movie's ""Jailbreak"" can be considered very similar in personality and role in their respective films.

The rest of this post will address each point individually in the order that they appear in the list above.

# The Secret Life of X

""The Secret Life of X"" is a common story formula, especially when directed toward children. It usually involves personifying something that isn't traditionally seen as being human-like and building a world around them that explains how ordinary people do not notice these traits in them. Perhaps the most iconic form of this is the Pixar movie ""Toy Story,"" but it can be seen predating that work and popping up constantly afterward. ""Madagascar,"" ""Over The Hedge,"" ""The Secret Life of Pets,"" ""Monsters Incorporated,"" etc. can be analyzed to have a similar premise. Both Wreck-it Ralph and The Lego Movie show this as well.

With so many different occurrences of this template, why single out films like The Emoji Movie for ""copying"" it? I don't think any of these are copies of one another. I think they just have inspirations of similar structures. ""Rip-off"" is not the correct term.

# Plot Similarities

**Wreck-it Ralph**

In both Wreck-it Ralph and The Emoji Movie, the protagonist sets out from their home to demonstrate their worth to those who have underestimated them and meets a new companion on their journey. Meanwhile, someone else of significance pursues the main character and also undergoes personal growth during the quest.

From this information alone, the plots seem similar, but it generalizes the plot of both to the point that they are no longer immediately recognizable as descriptions of the stories. This description also leaves out parts of both films that cause them to differ. Here are some of those elements:

* In Wreck-it Ralph, the protagonist believes he should be accepted as-is and only seeks something to give him recognition. However, in The Emoji Movie, the protagonist wishes to actually change himself to better suit the stated purpose.
* In Wreck-it Ralph, the partner must take something that the main character needs in order to artificially create an incentive to help them out. In The Emoji Movie, the arrangement is more mutually beneficial. Both parties need something from the other without either having to manipulate things to get leverage.
* The lessons the side characters learn when trying to find the main character are very different across each movie.

These are still generic descriptions of both plots, but they were omitted from the initial analysis to make a point. One might argue, however, that the two movies still seem suspiciously similar. That is because we still aren't getting into the details of the plot. Many pairs of films can be shown to be similarly unoriginal if you keep the rhetoric generic enough.

Please look at the second and third Toy Story movies to show this point. I doubt many people consider them unreasonably similar, but they can get this treatment:

&gt;Through some unforseen events, (a) character(s) get(s) sent to a foreign location that they at first seem to enjoy. However, the more experienced residents of this location have ulterior motives. When this is revealed, their tune changes. The character(s) \[is/are\] prevented from escaping while \[another/others\] must rescue them from captivity.

The plurality is different across these works, but the comparable ""formula"" can clearly be seen in the same way as in the first example. Of course, both of these movies were made by the same studio as part of the same series, but does that make it better or worse? If we assume these two movies have the same plot, is it lazier to copy yourself or put in the effort of researching and copying someone else? Yet both of these movies are highly regarded because they are executed differently in detail. They feel different because they explore different themes, messages, and settings.

**The Lego Movie**

*Plot*

Both The Emoji Movie and The Lego Movie feature a plot that includes a journey to a final destination, with the characters visiting various locations along the way. This structure is similar to that of an episodic series or TV show, with each location serving as a distinct episode or segment.

However, if we look at the details around these plotlines and how they play out in the story, many differences can be seen:

* In The Lego Movie, the episodic quest is all to defeat some villain, while the Emoji Movie has its characters chasing a less dynamic goal because it is not a living thing.
* The Lego Movie touches on themes of creativity, imagination, and the importance of individuality, while The Emoji Movie explores themes of conformity, self-acceptance, and the dangers of societal pressure.
* The main characters of both The Lego Movie and The Emoji Movie experience growth. However, one of them learns to believe in their abilities, while the other takes a stance that is more related to identity.

*Characters*

While The Lego Movie's ""Wildstyle"" and The Emoji Movie's ""Jailbreak"" can be considered the same from a surface-level perspective, there are also clear differences there:

* In The Lego Movie, Wildstyle takes on a ""mentor-mentee"" relationship with the main character. This cannot be seen as clearly in The Emoji Movie, in which the two characters usually behave like strangers with common interests.
* Jailbreak's motivation is disconnected from society - She wants to explore the world herself. Wildstyle is motivated almost entirely by the potential defeat of the antagonist, which is of direct benefit to the society she lives in.
* While the arcs are similar (""embrace your true self""), they are executed differently, with one being more expanded upon and central to the plot.

**Conclusion**

It is not fair to say that two movies have the same plot or characters just because they share some general similarities. Instead, it is important to consider the details and nuances of the plot in order to fully understand the story and appreciate its originality. While it may be tempting to draw broad conclusions based on a limited amount of information, a more thorough analysis is necessary to accurately assess the unique elements of a film. This is especially true when comparing works from different studios or franchises, as the context and execution can significantly impact the overall experience of the story."

Whenever someone is criticizing someone like Elon Musk or JK Rowling (or really any rich person), I often see comments like ""you're just jealous"" or ""the jealously is palpable"" that imply that the only reason they're criticizing Elon/Rowling/whoever is due to jealously. This also applies to people criticizing countries (ie they hate us because they ain't us). I disagree with this. Criticizing someone or something doesn't mean you're jealous of it at all. 

This view is completely absurd to me, does a Jewish person criticizing Hitler mean they're jealous of Hitler? Does a gay person criticizing Dubai or Saudi Arabia mean they're jealous of those countries? No. It obviously doesn't. But when that's applied to someone like Elon, all the sudden people are just ""jealous"", instead of opposed to his actions. In my opinion the whole ""jealously"" thing is just a cope from people who can't accept that their idols/countries may have flaws. CMV."

With almost any historical discussion, there's always someone trying to make the point that so-and-so was a terrible person because of so-and-so thing that they did, and the inevitable counter point that they can't be a bad person, because it was normal at that time. The prime example to come to mind being keeping slaves: plenty of people can excuse famous characters from history for keeping slaves because it was relatively common at the time, and that they were simply a ""man of their time"". 

The obvious counterpoint to this is that the time didn't belong to those men, and that for every plantation owner there was a staunch abolitionist who (for whatever reason, be it moral or religious or self serving) opposed such an obviously evil institution. Plenty of views exist at the same time, and history is not nearly as homogeneous as many people seem to view it, so it's not like every slave owner had never considered the idea that owning slaves may be wrong, morally. At least a certain amount must have been exposed to the question of morality. 

Take, for example, isolated tribes who remove a certain female body part for the express purpose of denying pleasure. Is that acceptable, just because it's normal there? Students who bullied and attacked black students during the civil rights movement, were they acting acceptably just because everyone else was?"

6,2022-12-19,CMV: Not criminalizing the act of escaping from prison is stupid,u/EightEight16,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zpx8qv/cmv_not_criminalizing_the_act_of_escaping_from/,changemyview,"In certain countries, like Norway and Germany, it is not in itself against the law to escape from prison. People who do so will still be apprehended and made to serve their full sentence, but no additional time will be added for the escape itself. 

First, let's establish why people go to prison. They have been accused of breaking a law, which in a democratic society was put in place directly by vote or by an elected official. They have been subjected to the justice system and found guilty to the standard of evidence of that country. They are then segregated from society, either for rehabilitative or punitive purposes. In either case, society has deemed they have some debt to pay or some personal growth to make before they can be reintroduced to the world at large. These are all statements of fact, and to take issue with them is to do so with democracy itself, which is a separate conversation.

Now on escaping, I have seen a couple recurring justifications for it.

1. A person who escapes prison will very likely commit actual crimes in the commission of escape, even something like the theft of the handcuffs or prison attire they are wearing. Therefore, when they are caught, they will still have time added for those crimes.

This is nonsense. If it is impossible to escape prison without committing some other crime, then escaping prison is effectively illegal. And if the purpose of charging someone with these ticky-tack offenses is to discourage escape attempts, then make them illegal. This dodges the question of whether or not there is a moral problem with someone escaping in and of itself.

2. It's human nature to want to escape prison. It's cruel to put a person in a situation where their instincts are telling them something, and they're punished for following them.

While this one at least addresses the core of the argument, it is a classic fallacious appeal to nature, and it opens up so many terrible rabbitholes if someone truly believes it. There are many things that a human will naturally want to do that are illegal. It's natural to want to assault someone who insults you. It's natural to want to steal something you can't otherwise get. Hell, it might be natural to want to murder someone depending on what they've done to you. We still punish people who do any of these things.

At a bare minimum, someone who believes this must necessarily also be in favor of decriminalizing the act of running from police. It follows all the exact same hallmarks. And this would create a world where you're actually an idiot if you DON'T run from the cops, because either you get away, or you get caught and are given the same punishment you would have gotten if you ran or not."

They played amazing throughout the tournament.

However, the fact that they won it on Penalty Kicks makes it seem cheap.

In Soccer, especially with a championship or a gold medal on the line, Sudden Death/Golden Goal is the only way that a game should end

Being crowned a champion means winning the test of wills. What better way to show a test of wills than to outlast your opponent?

I'll extend it for hockey. Normally, in the NHL, the rules in the regular season and rules in the playoffs are two different beasts, whereas I think they should be the same beast, which is 20 minute OT periods until someone scores.

Especially considering, when a hockey game goes to OT, the average time of the winning goal is 13:02, with an overwhelming majority of winning goals scored in the first 5 minutes. That means that 2OT+ games are RARE.

That being said, regular season games should follow postseason games. Grind it out. In my opinion, the point system they have is too complicated, and a W-L and GB system to rank standings is simpler.

Between 1930 and 1970, America went from being a country where the majority of people did not have premarital sex to one with public gay pride parades. In 1930, there were still regular extrajudicial lynchings of black people with impunity. In 1970, that would have been almost unthinkable. Abortion, which was considered reprehensible in 1930, became legal in the 1970s with Roe.

Perhaps the most stark cultural change is the approval rate for interracial marriage, which went from 4% in 1958 to 94% in 2022. How often in history have cultural changes of that magnitude happened on their own?

I personally think that these changes are biological. We know from the Parasite-Stress Theory that ""socially conservative,"" collectivist, or ""authoritarian"" attitudes in an area are largely a function of the prevalence of infectious diseases in the area. Comparing [crude historical death rates from infectious diseases](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FkFOJF1WAAAybnp?format=png&amp;name=small) to [historical lynching rates](https://journals.sagepub.com/cms/10.1177/2378023119841780/asset/images/large/10.1177_2378023119841780-fig5.jpeg), you see an interesting concordance (I know that the graphs don't have the same ""x""-values, so just focus on the overlap).

Human beings are animals too, subject to various biological and epigenetic stimuli. Many of the social changes that we credit to activism may really just be epigenetic changes resulting from a cleaner environment."

That said, it is my belief that consenting adults should be able to engage in whatever the want unless it happens to be something that is unreasonably dangerous or risky.  On reddit and in the media in general, there seems to be a certain fixation on age gaps in relationships, usually with many people arguing that such a thing is gross, exploitative, creepy, etc.  

One of the most common arguments I hear against AGR is that a person's brain doesn't fully develop until they are in their mid 20s, so to have someone with a developed brain date a person with an undeveloped brain is wrong.  I would push back on this by saying that even though a person in their early 20s may not have a brain that is 100% developed, it is probably 95% there - hopefully enough for a person to have sex without accidentally destroying their life.  Otherwise, if a person is that irresponsible up until 25, why should we allow them to drive, drink, sign a lease, etc.  Additionally, I think it is telling that although many people would be disgusted with a 22 y/o dating a 50 y/o, few would take issue with a 22 y/o dating a 25 y/o even though in both cases, a person with a undeveloped brain is dating a person with a developed brain.  This line of thinking also ignores the fact that there may be some unique risks to dating younger men.  For example, most of the statistics I have read suggest that men in their 20's are far more likely to act in violent ways than older men.  

Beyond that, critics of AGR will often say that it is creepy for older men to want to have sex with younger women.  I think this is worth some level of interrogation.  Why is it creepy for older men to want sex, or to find younger adults attractive?  We as a society have this weird idea that once you hit a certain age (maybe around 40 or 50 years old) you magically never want to have sex again for the rest of your life.  This is why the ""dirty old man"" trope exists - because older people who still have some level of sexual desire are seen as aberrations.  Some people might say it is okay for older people to have sex with each other, but when you mix age groups it is different.  Again, I would urge people who say this to introspect, and to realize that saying ""unconventional sexual pairings are disgusting"" is what lead us to anti-sodomy laws and miscegenation laws."

36,2022-12-19,"CMV: As long as you do not accept any legally binding conditions, and do not mislead regarding what you will do, there is no reason not to accept donations from all parties.",u/Its-goodtobetheking,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zq3jxj/cmv_as_long_as_you_do_not_accept_any_legally/,changemyview,"I see this general idea come up that there is something inherently wrong with taking money from people you don’t agree with, specifically involving charities. I see issues with accepting stipulations on how the money is used, at least when they actively result in bad outcomes for the cause you are supporting, but I see no reason not to accept a donation from an external party purely on the basis that they disagree with you.

My reasoning on this comes down to two things:

1. That money is nothing other than a measure of economic value.
2. Moving value from the group opposing you to your own group can only be a net positive, provided there aren’t externalities that overall hinder your cause.

Regarding the first point, I don’t particularly believe money is inherently moral or immoral, the method of collection is the only thing that can be said to have any moral standing. It is not morally compromising to take money from someone who has acquired it illegally, provided you do not offer them any goods or services you wouldn’t normally offer others, as there is no morality directly attached to any measure of economic value, outside of extreme hoarding of course. Obviously this doesn’t directly take into effect the agency of the other party, and what they might do because they feel you have wronged them, but that is realistically a question of self defense rather than what is actually correct to do. I am obviously not advocating for charities to take money from the mob then ignore their demands, that would probably result in the charity losing several members. Provided the charity is clear on their intentions up front and transparent regarding the use of the funds, however, I see no reason why the act of receiving the money is wrong. Wouldn’t you like the bad guys to have less money after all?

That leads me to my second point. Assuming you accept no binding stipulations, and that you do not change your stated goal or transparency policies, there is no negative externality that I can think of to this situation. The idea that people will be less likely to donate to you in the future is silly. Anyone who was in the antagonistic camp in the first place wouldn’t have donated anyways. The group which attempted to coerce you will see that it has failed so you won’t be receiving any more funds from them but given that they disagreed with you in the first place I doubt this is a concern in the first place. The people that were previously donating to you, provided you message honestly about the donation, why you accepted it, and about where the money actually goes, will probably continue donating if they truly believe in the cause. Again this pretty solidly rests on not accepting harmful stipulations with the donation, but in the past I have seen charitable organizations appeal to a general moral good when describing their decision to not accept funds, rather than simply explaining the reasoning for why they didn’t accept the donation from a pragmatic perspective. Maybe this says something about most charities being vanity projects rather than legitimate humanitarian efforts, I am not really sure. 

I would also go as far as to say it is reasonable to accept use stipulations that don’t directly harm your cause. A specific example of this is a situation where Girl Scouts refused money from backers who specified it couldn’t be put towards trans life affirming care and such, typical transphobia really. My position is that the money could have simply been earmarked for out reach work to non trans girls, and money from other sources could simply be put towards this end instead. Providing that overall care from the Girl Scouts doesn’t decrease for trans girls, this seems to be a simple organizational challenge for the Girl Scouts to make this work. You can argue that these methods display bad faith, but to donate to a charitable cause in the hope of making life worse for a group is probably as bad faith as you can get, so I see no issue with responding in kind. 

I guess the driving ideal behind this opinion for me is that I don’t particularly care whether my actions are morally correct, just that conditions improve for as many people as possible. Someone poke a hole in that."

I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I think it's absurd. Even though I say 'kid', he was actually 19 years old when the dad signed off on the application, and 22 when he actually commit the mass shooting. It's so easy in hindsight to say one should've known this would happen but really this kid showed no more signs than the average edgy teen soundcloud rapper and at 19 years old, your parents aren't really in your business like that and you're probably not even presenting certain sides of yourself to them. But then 3 years later to charge this guy for a decision an adult made seems insane to me. I mean who knows how this kid changed in those 3 years? Should people be expected to track their adult child's every movement for the rest of their life and revoke endorsement if they sense issues? I also question what precedent this sets. If I co-sign on a car and insurance for my kid and 2 years later they get a DUI and kill someone while away at college should I be charged as well?

On the other hand, I do think when you endorse something you are putting your name on the line and taking accountability for the person actions especially with a dangerous weapon like a gun. But then by extension why shouldn't the person who approved the application to buy the gun be charged as well. I'd say they're the **true** first line in making sure guns don't get into the hands of the wrong people and they failed. What about the person who sold the gun. AFAIK gun stores are allowed to deny sales to people for any reason if they have a gun permit, clean background check or whatever.

I don't think this guy is going to get convicted tbh because it just doesn't seem to have a solid foundation. There is a multistep process to acquiring a gun, all of which had more power, resources AND i'd say responsibility than the father. If this guy is responsible for a mass shooting because he made an endorsement 3 years prior why shouldn't the people who approved and sold the gun also be held at least equally responsible?

EDIT: What would CMV is showing what form the father signed off on or some law regarding it that shows that he alone would/should be held liable

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT2: Not sure what to do when I have changed view on my own. I found the [affidavit](https://www.ispfsb.com/public/Documents/AffidavitGuardian.pdf) that says they are liable for the MINORs use of the gun. If you still want to CMV then convince me why the father should be responsible when the guy was no longer a minor"
0,2022-12-19,"CMV: Exposing children to heterosexuality qualifies as ""grooming"" just as much as exposing them to LGBTQ topics, whether that's a lot or not at all",u/OD_at_the_crab_rave,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zq85is/cmv_exposing_children_to_heterosexuality/,changemyview,"You would either have to agree with that statement or admit that you simply hate LGBTQ people. We're often told that it's ""grooming"" when children are exposed to LGBTQ through things like:

* being taught in school that LGBTQ people exist
   * being taught that some people have two dads
   * being taught that some people have two moms
   * being taught that you can love someone of your same gender
   * being taught that some people identify as men/women/nonbinary regardless of their anatomy
* being exposed to scenes of LGBTQ people showing affection to each other
   * seeing gay men kiss and hug
   * seeing lesbian women kiss and hug
   * seeing trans people kiss and hug
* encouraging them to be true to themselves and in touch with their feelings
   * telling boys it's okay if they feel attracted to boys
   * telling girls it's okay if they feel attracted to girls
   * telling boys it's okay if they'd feel more comfortable identifying as girls
   * telling girls it's okay if they'd feel more comfortable identifying as boys
   * telling boys and girls it's okay if they don't feel like being either gender and just doing their own thing

We're told that these things are bad because they're sexualizing children - that is to say, forcing the concept of sex, sexuality, sexual identity, sexual attraction, etc. on them when they're far too young to even engage in sex.

And yet, take a look at the norm for raising and educating children for the past 50-100 years:

* Teaching children that moms and dads love each other and make babies together. No matter how much you omit or euphemize, you are introducing heterosexual activities to impressionable children. Think about why that doesn't bother you.
* Exposing children to media (movies, shows, books) that depict heterosexual relationships. Cinderella and Price Charming. Shrek and Fiona. Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley. Children who aren't nearly old enough to date or get married are exposed to portrayals of male-female couples, hugging, kissing, showing affection, etc. Think about why that doesn't bother you.
* Condoning boys having crushes on girls and vice versa. Again, not old enough to have sex but nevertheless developing proto-sexual feelings they're too immature to understand or handle rationally and yet it's facilitated and seen as cute. It's also possible that their feelings aren't organic but rather a product of being groomed into heterosexuality. Think about why that doesn't bother you.
* Teaching children that boys have penises and girls have vaginas. Children are too young to have sex and yet we're telling them about body organs *designed* for sex. Not only that but telling them that a huge part of their identity is their sexual organs. Think about why that doesn't bother you.

People have been grooming children to be straight and cisgendered for a long, long time. And the argument could be made that most LGBTQ ""grooming"" is teaching children that they're free to become who they want to be and informing them of all the possibilities. Heterosexual grooming, which is far more predominant, is usually teaching children that they don't have a choice.

And for what it's worth, I'm not asserting that it's absolutely okay OR not okay to educate children on sexuality. My point is that in order to be logically consistent, anything, and I mean *anything* you say about the harm of exposing kids to non-hetero relationships and non-cis identities... you would have to also say about exposing kids to heterosexuality and cis people. Again, it's that or you have to admit that you're bigoted, as that's the only explanation for seeing one as innocuous and the other as wicked."

He wanted to promote the belief that Iraq had WMDs because he wanted Iran to think Iraq had those capabilities. 

This caused members of the Iraq military to pass on bad intelligence to the US about Iraq's WMDs because they believed that the Iraq did have WMDs. This combined with Iraq having expired caches of chemical weapons caused the US to legitimately believe that Iraq had WMDs.

I believe there is a quote from Mitch McConnell(or Harry Reid i dont remember) in which he says US intelligence asked Saddam why he made his military and people believe they had WMDs and he replied that they needed to understand that his country was next to Iran.

My understanding is that members of the Iraq military pressed saddam to use WMDs during the US invasion and then eventually realized they didnt exist. I also believe some members of the Iraqi military told the US they had WMDs because they believed thats what the US wanted to hear.


I pretty open the changing my view on this. Maybe proof that the McConnell/Reid quote is wrong or a lie or that the Iraqi military didnt believe they had WMDs will change my view. Maybe proof showing the US was certain there werent any WMDS."

Many people when asked may tell you that Fnaf is a cheap repetitive jumpscare game with very poorly written lore and bad storytelling and I strongly disagree, as someone whose been a fan of the series since 2015 I just never understood or agreed with that think the series has way more merit then people give it credit for and that it’s in fact quite good

Gameplay: The series gameplay and horror I find to genuinely be very good, while obviously not on the same level as something like silent hill Fnaf still offers its own unique yet effective experience that gives you a lot with very little, the game has a well balanced and solid gameplay loop with a good difficulty curve that doesn’t overstay its welcome and creates a series of games that are enjoyable and well designed for what they are and that I’m still able to go back and revisit. The horror is my favorite part of the game, many claim it’s morhinf more then cheap jumpscare horror but I’d actually say it’s atmospheric horror, the Fnaf games are dripping with atmosphere and are great at building tension. Everything from the look of the building, the lighting, sound design, and character designs all serve to enhance the experience and the horror and as for the jumpscares while they certainly aren’t scary in the slightest (with the debatable exception of Holstein Freddy) I don’t think it’s fair to say that it’s the core of the horror or that it all the games have to offer because in reality the jumpscare are nothing more then a death screen, something to indicate that you lost essentially, and the fact that they’re completely avoidable and there’s none your forced to experience, you can theoretically go the entire game without experiencing a jumpscare and it still remains effective and tense. While it’s an extremely minimalistic series I don’t think that means it’s bad and I think it offers a solid experience for its price  

Sequels: people often claim that the sequels are repetitive and just the same thing over and over again and to that I have to disagree, each installment in the series is able to mix things up enough to keep it fresh by offering new esthetics/atmospheres, expansions on the story, and different gameplay mechanics and the series is able to evolve when needed

Story/lore: the story is certainly very flawed in a lot of aspects it’s also a great asset and I’d argue is good overall, the series utilizes visual storytelling and I feel the way it presents its narrative is engaging. A main criticism I hear is that the story is made up as it goes along and I actually think this is 100% correct, however it’s not necessarily bad at all,I feel like each game (with the exception of 3) has a narrative/lore that functions well on its own out of context while also effectively and naturally building upon things that were previously established in part games and the series is full to the brim of unique and creative concepts and ideas 

If you choose to respond please be respectful and if you want me to elaborate on anything said I’d be happy to do so. Thanks for reading!"

Boyyyy am I gonna get cancelled for this one but oh well

Let me just say the idea of separating someone due to something like color or religion is obviously very fucked up, outdated, and I don’t agree with that.

But the easiest and best example of “segregation” or separation that I see as a good thing is drug addicts. I honestly think we need to make all drugs legal and just create certain areas where, say, a heroin addict can do his business, be around people of his kind, in an area where that kind of lifestyle is considered okay and not a disruption to the peace to be nodded out on the street. We can call this place a “drug topia” where maybe they could also find meaningful connections and help them find a good reason to get sober as well. I wouldn’t really think it’d be a good allocation of government funds but in theory we could send people to the “drug topia” where social workers can also go and try to help these people find a reason to get sober but also it’s their little town to do as they please as well.

And what’s wrong with creating each neighborhood with a purpose to fufill a common lifestyle? For example, we already do this with “college towns” and it seems like it creates less conflict between college kids throwing large parties combined with old folks and families trying to live a different lifestyle would probably create a lot of conflict so its a good thing that we have specific areas built for the “college” lifestyle, which could be considered disruptive to many

I don’t see how separating people this way could be bad for anybody. Do you want absolute quiet in your neighborhood and get angry at people walking by? There’s a neighborhood for that and your neighbors agree with you. 

And dare I say it but I think a lot of people in communities like the LGBTQ+ would have fun with this idea as well. I am NOT saying they need to be separated from anyone else but why not create supportive lgbtq neighborhoods where they know they can be accepted without having to be judged, around people that can truly them.

And no, no, no, absolutely nobody would HAVE to move to their “community” if they didn’t want to (unless MAYBE their lifestyle is very disruptive e.g. heroin addict) I’m a Libertarian and don’t believe in making anyone do anything but more so just having it as a general rule it could be best for most people.

What do you guys think? Am I a piece of shit for considering this or am I onto something?"

I don’t see anything wrong with it, ethically speaking. Every girl ive seen has spoken english, and appeared to be healthy, comfortable, and in charge of their own business. In my country human trafficking is quite rare according to statistics, so i assume i have never bought sex from a trafficked person. That’s why I’m mostly okay with what i’m doing, with some occasional, minor doubts. Im not rich and that’s why i don’t buy sex nearly as often as i would want to.

The places i don’t go to are those ”thai-massage” places. I know for a fact that i could get my dick wet in those places paying something like half of what i pay to other escorts. But i also know that the girls in those places are trafficked, more often than not. Why the police here does nothing about those places, i don’t know. Maybe it’s just legally difficult. 

Here i see where i seem to have drawn the line. Im okay with the fact that a woman is selling herself, and I’m the buyer, as long as its her decision, and the decision is not based on life and death circumstances. What then constitutes a life and death circumstance for me? Lack of security, food, shelter, basic necessities which we all need in life to survive. 

If some ice princess from Czech Republic would rather have sex with me than go to work in a factory back where she comes from, getting a salary that is indeed low but that would get her all of the basic necessities she needs, that’s fine by me. If some girl from Thailand would rather have sex with me than starve, then that’s not okay with me. I’m not saying she shouldn’t do it, i’m saying she needs to find an another customer, because i’m not touching that situation with a ten-foot pole."

The accusation has been used ever since the term came into being, but with the big divide between left and right in the US, and people feeling truly threatened by the other side grabbing power, the use of the accusation is more widespread than ever. While both sides are using the word 'fascism' wrongly, the right is using it most wrongly, since they accuse the left of being fascist, while the left cannot be fascist. I will explain why:

I'm using the 14 points drafted by Umberto Eco as definition for fascism.

Point 1, 2 and 5 basically say that fascists don't want to change things, rather they want to go back to an era where everything was better, where traditions were untarnished and the status quo upheld without question. It needs to be noted that this era fascists are striving for does not exist, because the time period they point to had other traditions being changed, traditions we don't even remember now because they were being tarnished then already. So even if a fascist would take a time machine and go back to that time period, he would quickly start to complain that older traditions were being trampled upon. The era they want to go back to also obviously was not one where the status quo was being upheld, because humans are always striving for progress and progress brings change to the status quo.

Now, the point about tradition is a very important point for fascism. The call to an earlier era where everything was good is one of the only motivators for fascists that is defined. The other points are mostly about actions they take to actually try and achieve their goal of going back to that earlier time. And herein lies my main point: The left are called progressives. They want progress, both moral and economical. The difference between them and the right is mostly that the left wants this progress for all, and thus wants to do away with current power imbalances. However, there will always be power imbalances, because a perfect 50/50 split is never achievable.

So let's take the power imbalance of black people vs white people as an example: The left is currently striving to get black people equal chances, measured in equal outcomes (in averages). Currently white people have more power, but the left is looking to equalize this. However, since a perfect 50/50 split is impossible, the left will continues to fight until we reach 50/50, but then it will obviously overshoot this 50/50 even by a small margin. This will then make the left start to fight to equalize things from the white people's perspective as the black people now hold the power.

Obviously the above example is a little unrealistic, since obviously the left isn't stupid and they realize the perfect 50/50 split is impossible, so they will be happy if we get reasonably close to it. However, if we throw in other groups, like sexual orientations, disabled people, people from a certain area within the country, etc. there is always going to be groups to which the power imbalance is at a level that the left will want to fight for them. That's just how nature works, and the left will always try to get any minority group to get equal chances. Meaning they will constantly be pushing against the current status quo and traditions.

So by definition, the left cannot be fascist. Don't get me wrong, they can be authoritarian and all kinds of bad things, but fascism is simply not an accusation we can level against the left.

tldr; the left are progressive by definition, while fascists are by definition traditionalists. This never matches, thus the left can't be fascist."

I produce and distribute billions of dollars worth of narcotics yearly. I have a relationship with several international banks who are happy to take my cash deposits and obfuscate the origins of my money in exchange for commissions and fees. The banks are happy to do business with me because regulators who catch wind to the scheme are happy to fine the banks for a tiny percentage of the profits made from laundering my money.

My nephew is trying to convince me that I should launder my money via Bitcoin. After researching the subject, I’ve come to find that what I don’t lose through volatility of the digital assets, I lose to enormous spreads from brokers, especially considering the volume of money I’m pumping through the system. Not to mention the fact that every Bitcoin is traceable through a public ledger, and there is close scrutiny from various law enforcement agencies of Bitcoin transactions. 

Change my view: utilizing accredited multinational banks to facilitate laundering the proceeds of my ~~cocaine~~ guava farming business is superior to the risks I face by laundering my money through the scrutiny of the public facing blockchain."

194,2022-12-20,CMV: The foreign policy of the United States encourages unfriendly dictators to pursue nuclear armament as fast as possible if it's feasible and to never give up nuclear weapons under any circumstances.,u/BaguetteFetish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zqpug2/cmv_the_foreign_policy_of_the_united_states/,changemyview,"The United States has a long history of invading/attempting to overthrow the governments of and meddling in the affairs of foreign countries unfriendly to them. This behavior is a consistent trend over it's history, and one that has become more prominent since it's rise as a global superpower. Due to it's desire to assert itself as a global superpower and curtail unfriendly interests, it either creates or overthrows dictators who are unfriendly to it's interests.

Consequently, any dictator who is unable to partner with the United States for geopolitical or ideological reasons is essentially forced to pursue nuclear weapons research as fast as possible, such as Iran. Any trust in the US to not engage in hostile action if not nuclear armed is completely null, given the US's history of overthrowing countries that oppose them. Consequently, if a dictator wants to remain in power he has to make the risk of a nuclear exchange a possible one if he is invaded or overthrown violently. Any expectation of honesty and not being at risk of foreign intervention once research into nuclear weaponry is ceased or limited is a bullshit paper agreement and both sides know it.

Essentially, in steps  
1) The US has a history of regime change, and overthrowing both democratic and undemocratic governments that oppose their interests.  
2) Any claims from the US to the contrary are either lies or justifications and therefore any promises they that they will not do so cannot be trusted.  
3) Dictators wish to hold onto their power, and are afraid of being overthrown, either by military intervention or backed coup.  
4) The United States has overwhelming conventional military power, and has a history of effectively destabilising other governments internally.  
5) If a dictator wishes to prevent either from happening to their regime, they must pursue nuclear weapons to either 1) Make a conflict nuclear instead of non-conventional, making the US less likely to start one 2) Increase the risk of a nuclear launch/detonation in the event their government is destabilised."

170,2022-12-20,CMV: Drag Queen story times and Drag Shows that allow children are innapropriate,u/PeaRepresentative260,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zqxumy/cmv_drag_queen_story_times_and_drag_shows_that/,changemyview,"EDIT: I am editting the post now because I think what can be gleaned has mostly been gleaned by now.

In summary: I shouldn't have double-barreled my CMV - drag shows and drag storytimes should be considered separately.

Drag Storytimes: If all the sexual content has been redacted (e.g. no sexual names, no clothing that would be considered innapropriate when worn by any person when reading to children), then this is appropriate. Many people in the thread have said that drag storytimes do not have sexual content.

Drag shows: I still think drag shows targetting children are innapropriate. If a drag show existed in an environment that was not sexual and had all sexual content removed, that would be appropriate. However examples I have seen online don't support this. I also struggle to understand the reason why great efforts would be taken to make an inherently adult drag performance appropriate for kids - that would require removing the essence of the performance and to what end?

There are two examples here of what I think is innapropriate. And yes, I would think this was innapropriate if the performer wasn't a drag queen.

EDIT AGAIN: Adding more examples because people say there are too few examples/biased. I cannot control or remove the sources of the clips, including their added commentary or opinions. View the clips on mute if you feel the voiceovers add bias. I have time stamped them where possible to avoid biased commentary. Most clips are NSFW.

1. At a drag show two young children are led around a nightclub by a drag queen who directs how they should pose. The children receive dollars and cheers from the crowd as they pose. This takes place at midnight.

2. A toddler walks hand in hand with a drag queen who is wearing a bikini bottom with dollar bills stuffed in the side, and costume breasts with nipple pasties covering the nipples. The song that accompanies their walk mentions dollar bills and shaking ass

3. A drag performer wearing a bra and panties dances and recieves a dollar from a young child in the front row. The show was advertised as all ages on facebook.

https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1573048718886305793

4. At a daytime show advertised for children specifically, a drag queen accepts dollar bills from multiple children in exchange for dance moves such as slowly dropping it low with spread knees.

5. A drag queen at an all ages show has her costume breasts exposed for the duration. She asks a child in the audience if they are ""reaching for her titties because they are hungry""

https://twitter.com/TaylerUSA/status/1603465689628610567/video/3

BEFORE YOU COMMENT, YES, I WOULD STILL CONSIDER ALL OF THESE CLIPS INNAPROPRIATE FOR CHILDREN IF THE PERFORMERS WERE NOT DRAG QUEENS. I CONSIDER THIS INNAPROPRIATE REGARDLESS OF THE GENDER/GENDER IDENTITY AND/OR SEXUALITY OF THE PERFORMER

END EDIT 2

Lastly, thank you to those of you who responded in good faith and engaged with what I wrote and gave your knowledge and experiences.

The post is mostly downvoted which isn't very productive for a discussion and doesn't work towards a changed view. A lot of commentors are replying with comments that don't make sense, are fallacious or are imagined assumptions (apparently I am homophobic now). In an argument you can't make up what you believe I think and then argue against that. You have to argue against what I actually wrote, not an imagined opponent that is easier for you to defeat.

END EDIT 1

I do not live in the US or the UK where this seems to be a hot topic, but I do follow news/channels/political media that cover these stories. I watch content from both liberal and conservative personalities, who are at odds on this issue.

Where I live this is not a thing, and the political divisions in my country don't resemble the republican vs. democrat dynamic that exists in the US. Meaning that I don't have a horse in the game here beyond educating myself.

In my experience and to my understanding, drag and drag shows are a form of expression, art and entertainment. Drag personalities are often over the top and comical. Typically a drag persona has a sexual element, for example a 'dirty' pun as a name, exaggerated body proportions for boobs and butts, and can also have 'dirty' dialogue/stand up.

Given all of the above, drag seems like the kind of 'adult' content society considers innapropriate for young children to be exposed to, because of its sexual nature, or because it is considered too graphic. This is a cultural norm - we have age restrictions on movies, series and videogames based on their content. We wouldn't and don't bring children to nightclubs or strip clubs. We also don't talk about or do certain things in front of children for the same reason (example: after a hookup you may tell a group of friends details about having sex, but you wouldn't do this with a child because it is innapropriate).

Given the adult themes and sexual nature of drag shows, why is there an effort being made to include children in this area in the first place? It seems contradictory.

If the goal is to ensure children are exposed to ideas of gender and sexual diversity, why do this specifically with drag queens who are adult entertainers and mostly operate in adult environments such as clubs? Doesn't it make more sense to have children meet or be exposed to, for example, a gay or lesbian couple? As there is nothing sexual about meeting an individual who is queer.

If the intent is specifically to make children aware of the existence of drag culture, why not have an age-appropriate conversation about it, the same way parents have age appropriate comversations about topics that children are too young to experience first hand but can still be made aware of. 

What is the explicit benefit of children interacting with drag queens that 'overrides' the usual societal norms? We wouldn't make a similar effort to make children aware of other adult occupations such as sex work or stripping."

Over 41.9% of the countries adults are obese, with obesity being a big issue in rural areas (1). While there are many reasons as to why this is, a big part of the issue can be tied with the rise of a sedentary lifestyle and an increase in car usage. I believe that a simple way to fix this issue is to introduce more movement in Americans lives and decrease the amount of parking available.

So, parking spaces are limited. This doesn't mean that parking as a concept is gone, but a good chunk of parking infrastructure can and should be reclaimed and repurposed. These spaces can be used for natural space, such as parks or small gardens (creating cooler environments and cleaner air for civilians), or expanded sidewalks to allow for increased pedestrian traffic, or lanes for alternate transportation methods, such as bike,skateboard,scooters, ect.

The one issue I see with limiting parking spaces is that disabled parking would be harder to come around, but an easy way to avoid that would be to have parking be reserved primarily for disabled peoples, with abled bodied people having restricted parking space. You can also reserve parking for ""special groups"", whether these be your firefighters or police men, or local county hero, where they can get specially designated parking.

Another issue I can see arise from this is the difficulties for those who live in more rural areas. Due to poor urban planning, rural cities are usually far too spread apart to have people live close to large shopping areas. In the short term, this shift is going to negatively impact a lot of people. However, in the long term, I see people shifting to the changes. Those who once drove will walk more often, or they'll park further from their locations meaning that they get *some* additional exercise in their day to day. Businesses will fill demand and build smaller shops closer to smaller cities, and if these businesses are locally owned, you can have a circular system where cities sustain themselves in a circular pattern.

I'm talking about outright owning the media, a subscription isn't ownership. 

Using an easy example: Nintendo. If Nintendo doesn't provide me an opportunity to buy a digital Gameboy game to use on any platform that I can get it to run on. I should be able to bootleg it for free.

1) if I buy an old Gameboy Color and a game, Nintendo will see zero of the profit. So the argument of Nintendo losing money is a weak argument for this point, especially due to some physical copies of games are selling for hundreds or more. 

2) lack of hard copies available. 1985 NES Super Mario Bros.	 sold 40,240,000 games. Ebay listed 6,900 games but included Super Mario Bros. 2 and 3 in the listing. 

3) ""you can stream the games"" streaming services requires internet. The Switch let's you play a few classic games. A handheld system that requires internet to play a classic game isn't a very useful handheld system due to not being able to go many places with it. And there's no option, from what I have read, to buy and own classic media. 

4) legal music copyrights in games.

How do royalties work for video games? They are generally based on sales numbers, i.e. how many units of the game are sold. (Google)

If this is the case for all games it would benefit the artist to want to have the producer to keep providing games.

5) effort to ""make"" classic games. Everyone has heard of ROMS. How are video game ROMs made? Usually devices called ""dumpers"" are used. These devices can read cartridges contents and write to other media (zip disks, floppy, HDD...), also they can read data from other media and transfer to the console emulating a cartridge. No extra effort on the producer would have to be used to take old games and provide them on a website to buy and play. I doubt Nintendo just threw away the files for Pokemon or Mario. They already have a store for newer games, adding old games would be a matter of adding the game file to the library. 

6) ""Everyone would wait until the media isn't sold to get it for free"" isn't a strong argument either, most gamers buy the game months in advance, to think the majority of gamers will wait 5-10+ years to get a free game is ignorant. 

7) Remakes, sold remakes are sometimes worse than the original, I'll transition and will use Rockstar, the new GTA trilogy had issues from the beginning, cut songs, edited content, and swapped controlling. The original game has been removed and the newer game is the only available copy to buy.

Hopefully this isn't too scrambled together and is understandable."

the issue: this is a pretty new trend so there's basically no research on the long-term effects.  many experts say it's actually really likely to atrophy the muscles in the long term and make the skin less elastic.  and it's relatively common now to do it as early as 18.

They have almost no knowledge about history or politics beyond whatever propaganda they get from Youtube, Twitter, or FOX/CNN. Whatever the masses think at any point in time mean nothing to me.

When you read the debates between academics even academic conservatives and liberals in books and journals you will see what a difference it makes to actually be educated in a subject. None of them are debating about the stupid things the masses are. They almost never have dumb takes. They understand all the arguments and have the information needed to make informed choices. They try to have a consistent worldview. 

Not that I'm a fan of academics I'm critical of most of them but it's just to show how dumb the masses are. For example they don't know anything about economics. They don't hold the same positions as economists do. They don't have a clue about any of it so why would I care what they think about the economy? 

As I said I dislike most academics anyways I'm just showing why the masses are uneducated and it's unnecessary to care what they think. I'm against democracy for this reason. I don't think the country should be held back by uneducated people."

People often say to support the pro choice argument (which I agree with) that one mistake shouldn't ruin the rest of her life. However if a man gets a women pregnant they don't say the same, they say that he should have ""kept it in his pants"" if he doesn't want the responsibility. I feel this is a double standard, both men and women know the risks of sex going in but I do also think that neither of them should have their life ruined for one mistake. The man should have the option  to opt out of any responsibilities including financial up to the point where an abortion is allowed. With the knowledge of his decision the women could choose to keep the baby anyway or she could decide to have an abortion.


Edit: I have changed my mind

I was thinking in terms of a women deciding she wanted a baby and using her ability to tie the man in financially to support her choice which I still think is wrong but it doesn't change the fact that once the baby is born it is entitled to support from both parents. I thought the money was to support mothers choice to have a baby but it is actually for the child. It just so happens that if the mother is also the one who is raising the child then they will be the one who is managing the money.

I also didn't consider that having an abortion isn't just an easy fix. I didn't consider that a women might feel she is not in a position to have a baby either but doesn't feel able to have an abortion for the physical or the emotional toll that the decision would take on her and possibly be traumatic for her."

I would not be working if it did not bring me money. The money I earn from my  job funds my actual passions and hobbies. The money I earn from my job enables me to interact and befriend people that share my passions and hobbies. The money from my job enables me to lead a fulfilling lifestyle.

My hobbies and passions would not be able to sustainably fund my life, if at all. At the same time I would not want my passions to become a job to me. I have been employed at several jobs now and the majority of people say to me that working for money is not how to think about your professional career.

This baffles me because almost every business in a capitalist society is profit driven. That little black lines in the ledgers will always come before 99% of the employees in the company. Unless you are an NPO or Charitable organization perhaps but I do not have experience with those.

So why when the employee states that they are working for money it is deemed taboo and undesirable."

Edit 2: getting a lot of pushback on how hard it would be to implement this idea and while those details would be relevant to actual policy, these points are detracting from the idea itself, especially since other countries already figured out how to measure and tax on net worth, institutions for taxes and fines and exemptions and legal recourse already exist, and the stock market is resilient. 

**To argue this point, please provide historical context or research studies or current policy examples to justify why any individual should be allowed limitless ownership.**

Original Post:

Net Worth = all assets (bank accounts, houses, stocks, etc.) less liabilities (debt)

Why $1B? Nice round number that will only affect 0.000001% (not real number, just making the point it's a really small %) of people.

Once someone's net worth hits a billion, they get a plaque that reads ""Congratulations! You won capitalism!"" Maybe a party.

Then they have to manage their assets to stay at or below $1B - sell stocks, donate money, take on more debt, whatever - and every tax year, if they go over they get fined $100M (again, nice round number).

There are 720 billionaires in the U.S. as of 2022. [Here's a list of the top 25 by net worth from 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_Americans_by_net_worth). If it works as intended, the policy would reduce all these net worths to $1B and the government would gain $1.7 TRILLION. From just 25 people. If we expand that to all 720, estimate would be \~3T. FYI, the current national debt is \~$31T. Estimates for the cost of medicare-for-all (aka universal healthcare) is $30T. Would this policy solve all our problems? No. Would it help? Yes.

I'm in the U.S., so I'm envisioning a U.S. policy, but ideally all nations would jump on board and implement similar wealth cutoffs, so while my numbers are U.S. based, arguments for/against are welcome from everywhere.

Pros = federal government has more money to do things, like expand social security into universal basic income, expand medicare to pregnant women and children, offer PAID FMLA, fix infrastructure, give money to local municipalities for development projects, build spaceships, cure cancer, and all those shiny baubles politicians dangle in front of us for votes but then never do.

Cons = some billionaires may get butthurt. There may even be tears.

""But what about iNfLaTiOn??"" - Wealth wouldn't get redistributed to the general public (ignore UBI for a hot minute), but spent by the government to create jobs, pay off debt, and other non-inflationary activities.

""But SoCiaLiSm!!!"" - the government isn't taking control of the means of production. It would be a fine. Like all the other fines we already have. And again, the money isn't getting distributed directly to the people, it's paying for goods and services.

""But then people won't be motivated to build businesses!"" - $1B isn't enough motivation? GTFO

""But billionaires will find a way around it, this policy would be meaningless"" - you mean like the tax code we already have? yeah, but they'll have to hire an army of accountants to do it and that will create jobs. MBB will have a field day. And some may prefer to keep their $40+ BILLION and just pay the $100M fine every year. Win-Win.

""But if the U.S. has this policy, billionaires will just move their assets to other countries!"" - you're telling me they don't already do this? WTF is a tax haven? This is why, in an ideal world, all nations would have similar policies. Or perhaps, we account for all their assets, regardless of location. You have a U.S. address, but own houses in France and Sweden, get dividends from international stocks, and have a bank account in China? Those assets are included in your net worth and you are subject to the fine.

""This would never pass, there's too much division, blah, blah, blah"" - dude, this is a reddit post, a thought experiment, not an actual policy proposal.

Points that may change my mind:

* Math/logic for why the cutoff should be different from $1B (or nonexistent)
* Math/logic for why the fine should be different from $100M (or nonexistent)
* A reason other than [trickle-down economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics) for why some people deserve more money than God (literally - the Catholic church has estimated wealth of $30B, which puts God near the bottom of the 25 billionaires list above)
* A reason to modify the policy (households instead of individuals? include religious organizations? Businesses?)

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit: lots of passionate discussion, thanks for all those commenting**

Summary of changes:

* do not implement suddenly or all at once. There should be a grace-period of a few years so markets are not flooded with massive sell-offs
* tie to inflation and net worth - cap and fines increase with inflation; fine is marginal based on net worth such that someone with $200B pays more than someone with $2B
* loophole of leveraging net worth to take out loans to pay fine needs to be closed (though this would impact the policy's effectiveness, I don't think it needs to be addressed before implementation)
* a cost/benefit analysis should be conducted to determine if administration of this policy would be worth the gain and what the official cap and fine numbers should be
* allow due process for exemptions - is the person only a billionaire because they own an indivisible item that can't be sold?
* a [net wealth tax](https://taxfoundation.org/net-wealth-tax-europe-2022) may be a better solution overall"

7,2022-12-21,"CMV: ""Schuldig hulpverzuim"" should be a crime in every (western) country",u/Finch20,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zrrr5r/cmv_schuldig_hulpverzuim_should_be_a_crime_in/,changemyview,"In Belgium it's a crime to not render aid to a person in need, this is known as ""[Schuldig hulpverzuim](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuldig_verzuim_(Belgi%C3%AB))"" (wiki article in Dutch only).  

The translated law text:

&gt; With imprisonment from eight days to one year and with fine from fifty euros to five hundred euros or with one of those punishments alone shall be punished he who neglects to render or provide assistance to a person who is in great danger, whether he himself has ascertained his condition, or that condition has been described to him by those who seek his assistance.

&gt; The offence requires that the defaulter was able to help without serious danger to himself or others. If the absentee did not personally ascertain the danger in which the person in need of help was in, he may not be punished if, on the basis of the circumstances in which he was asked to help, he could believe that the request was not serious or that danger was involved.

&gt; The punishment referred to in the first paragraph shall be increased to two years if the person in great danger is a minor 1 or is a person whose vulnerable condition as a result of age, pregnancy, illness or a physical or mental defect or unworthiness was obvious or was known to the perpetrator. (translated by deepl.com)

I think this should be a law in all (western) countries with similar conditions as the one above.  Knowing that someone requires aid and not making any attempt to render aid when a person is able to do so should, in my opinion, be a crime.  It's one's moral duty to do this and I think enough people would agree with that to make this moral duty a legal duty.  I also think that the punishments in place are reasonable, the maximums are maybe a bit on the low end.  (For those who do not use Euros: €50 = 43,84 GBP/72,27 CAD/79,04AUD/53,09 USD, €500 = 10 times 50)  And maybe community service should also be one of the possibilities.  

I'm limiting myself to western countries as I can see reasons why implementing this law in countries where certain believes are considered mental conditions isn't a good idea.  

Now how is this law applied in practice?  A number of examples:

- A police officer has someone in custody and fails to render aid when a reasonable person would see this is necessary.  Even if police department policy did not require him to call or render aid.
- Husband waits 3 days to report the death of his wife and she died under suspicious circumstances, there was insufficient evidence for a murder charge of any degree
- Youths record how their friends throw a kid they've been bullying off of a bridge over a canal into freezing water
- Drug dealer sold someone drugs and saw said person overdosing on said drugs and did not render any aid
- Boy- and girlfriend take speed together, girlfriend complains of pain in the chest and becomes unresponsive.  Boyfriend gives CPR until a heartrate is observed again and then goes to sleep, the next morning the girlfriend again has no heartrate, further CPR attempts by the boyfriend are fruitless, eventually boyfriend asks neighbour, in a calm and collected way, to call emergency services.  Girlfriend does not survive.  
- Drunk husband might have pushed wife off of stairs, no conclusive evidence of this could be found.  Husband waited 2 days to call an ambulance.  Wife presumably died a few hours after falling.
- 5 drunk football (soccer for those on the other side of the Atlantic) supporters steal the scarf of a supporter of the opposing team.  1 pushes the guy to the ground, 1 steals the scarf, 3 others watch.  The 2 pushing the guy to the ground &amp; stealing the scarf are charged with theft with violence, the 3 others with the above mentioned law.  The supporter of the opposing team was in a coma for a week and continued to have lingering effects of this a year after the incident.
- American tourist goes to friends house and accidentally drinks GBL.  Friends know what happened and know the risks involved, spend 4 hours googling before contacting emergency services.  
- School principal fails to take action after receiving credible evidence that one of the teachers at his school is sexually assaulting students.  15 students were assaulted in total (that have come forward).

For reference, the total number of convictions in Belgium for this crime average between 200 and 300 since the year 2000 [soure](https://www.stat.policefederale.be/criminaliteitsstatistieken/rapporten/).  Assault convictions range between 39 000 and 53 000 since the year 2000.

**Edit** for clarities sake: calling emergency services is a form of rendering aid and is enough to not be guilty of this crime.

Landlords who buy up and purchase properties and then passively collect the income off the labor of their tenants. These people did not build the property, they don't maintain it, they merely claim ownership of it and then have their mortgage and life sustained by the labor of others. There's no risk involved in it because housing is a necessity.

Professional Investors, shareholders, executives, stock traders, etc these people are allowed to amass ludicrous amounts of money and throw it wherever they please, they get to decide if a bad idea gets executed or if a good idea will gut buried. This myth of the self-made billionaire / millionaire is created in a board room to have the masses accept their place as the laborer's who actually create the wealth while they toy around with it.

I also don't believe working hard early in life should reward you with the ability to passively collect income from younger generations. The model of social security should be expanded upon so that when you reach a certain age everyone has a decent standard of living into their elder years and you're taken care of. These predatory retirement plans are just another scam to scare younger generations into thinking social security won't be around in the future.

My target age is more towards kids who are maybe in junior high and in high school level.  And no, I am not saying that parents should instill extreme fear by saying that the world is coming to an end via some AI apocalypse.  So I won't entertain this type of an extreme take for my CMV.  With that out of the way, let's go through some of the assumptions and duties of parents.

(1) Parents care about well being of their children and as such, it is their unwritten duty to inform and educate their children such that they are put in the best position to make good choices.

(2) As long as the method is sound, parents could exert significant influence in shaping their kids' opinions/choices especially when it comes to something like career selection. That is not to say that the parents should force their kids to take on a certain profession, but they can provide ample amount of information.

(3) The reason why parents should provide guidance is that more often than not, teenagers do no have the capability to look past beyond couple of years whereas choice in profession is something that lasts 40-60 years once you turn 18.

As people know, AI (or machine learning, ML) is making great deal of advancements and infiltrating into various different professions.  What is interesting is that while it might be true that AI/ML will replace all of the current jobs in some future time, it won't happen simultaneously.  The reason being that ML is very efficient and practical to solve certain problems but not others.  There are a lot of factors (e.g. number of available training data set, the required accuracy when it comes to certain tasks, the additional requirements (e.g. robotics or not) that are needed to interface with ML modeling, the frequency of usage of the ML modeling, cost benefit analysis between ML vs human labor) that are all vastly different across different fields and professions.  So basically, some of the current professions will be like bubbles that will pop in the next 40-60 years whereas certain professions will still remain robust and stable.

One of the biggest future regrets for kids of this generation is to pick a wrong profession that will be decimated by the AI technology.  And as such, kids need ample amount of guidance from the elders and this issue should be taken with deep concern by everyone (including the parents).  The reason why I emphasize parents is that more often than not, kids can have tunnel vision when it comes to career choices.  So while the parents cannot exert 100% control (which is another strawman position that I won't entertain), they can still try to exert some level of control to dissuade kids from certain professions that are most vulnerable to be taken over by AI.

This all requires that parents become familarize with the AI technology and the trends.  And I would argue that you don't need to be a ML expert to put yourself in a position to form sound opinions about which tasks and which professions will be most vulnerable to the AI.  Without knowing details about all these topics (e.g. neural networks, autoencoders, epochs, latent space), ML is easy to learn for all different levels of expertise because what is under the hood can be treated as a black box and you can still develop good intuitions on where the field is going.  So in essence, the parents can become educated, read up a lot, and then help their children make the best choices for the future.

The next 40-60 years will be a transition stage where certain professions become obsolete due to the AI technology.  You and your kids should take this problem very seriously and make the best decision, because going into a dying profession will be a completely waste of your talent, money, and resources."

I'm all in for gay marriage, adoption by gay couples, laws protecting LGTBQ and giving more visibility to those people. But there is one thing I just don't agree with: people wanting to change their gender in official documents according to what they identify with.

In my opinion, your biological sex is something different from what gender you identify with. The former is biologically determined by your genitals, your hormone levels, etc. The latter is a cultural construct that, though derived from the biological gender, is now very different and pretty much detached from it. There are situations where your biological sex is what matters (sports, medical services, imprisonment...), and that is the one that should figure on all official documents. If you have had surgery in order to change your genitals and your hormone levels are now in line with your new sex, then okay, but people should not be able to change it on official documents as they wish as many people defend nowadays (including the option of changing it to a third neutral one). If someone who is biologically a male wants to dress and act as a woman, I'm 100% fine with that, but that doesn't make him legally a female. (Or the other way around, obviously.)

We could discuss whether many everyday situations should be conditioned by biological gender or cultural gender, or whether the cultural one should even exist, but in my opinion the biological gender should always be on official documents and be respected. (I know there are hermaphrodite people, now called intersexual in many countries, and I agree that those should deserve a different treatment in legal documents. I'm just talking about people who are born with only one set of reproductive organs.)

I have had this view for many years and nobody has been able to change my view so far, so I want to see what other redditors think so maybe I can better understand the opposite stance.

EDIT: removed restrooms as a situation where your biological sex matters, since it was a very bad example. Sorry.

EDIT 2: though I'll continue to reply to comments as I can, I want to thank everyone for sharing their opinions. Can't say I'm yet convinced about the idea of changing your ""official"" gender at will, but there have been some really solid arguments for it. Most of the arguments that I found convincing are of the pragmatic type, so maybe I'm just too idealistic about having a system that's as hard to tamper with as possible. What we all seem to agree on is that our current system probably needs a change on how gender is managed, or even if it should be officially managed at all."

My belief is that your yield should be equivalent to the effort you exert. If you want to do nothing but sit around smoke crack and have tons of babies, you simply do not deserve to have any finances as you are a drain on society. If you cannot afford to live, that is your fault. I personally don’t feel that it is the job of the society around you to be compelled to give their money to help you.

My only exception to this part would be people that cannot work for themselves. This would include people under the age of 16, people too old to work, or people so physically or mentally disabled they cannot work.

I feel that businesses thrive the most without government interference and they should be left mostly to their own devices and should be able to keep most of their capital. Government subsides should favor large corporations simply because they employ so many people and the collapse of a business would be terrible for those people, and in most cases total collapses of corporations is not the fault of the everyday worker but the executives. I would say that if the government needs to subsidize a corporation to keep it from failing, then the executive board or whatever needs to be fired and replaced.

I don’t believe in bailouts directly to citizen. If they accrue debt, it is on them. If they do mot save up in case of medical funds, it is on them. It is not me or on anyone else to help them out. I don’t expect help so I give it out. Charity is ultimately better than stealing money from citizens to give to dumber ones. At some point we need to let natural selection take it course.

I feel that any other economic system will inevitably fail. The US is the richest country in the world because it is closest to a capitalist system based on effort. If you do not work hard or smart you do not succeed."
11,2022-12-21,CMV: Henrietta Lacks (of HeLa cell fame) doesn’t really deserve to be compensated and her family is simply trying to extort money from the medical community.,u/rheumination,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zs31ch/cmv_henrietta_lacks_of_hela_cell_fame_doesnt/,changemyview,"For those unfamiliar with the story, Henrietta Lacks was an African-American woman who presented to John Hopkins hospital with vaginal bleeding and was found to have a malignant cervical tumor. A biopsy of this tumor was taken for use in an experiment to try and grow human cells outside of the body. While this had been done previously, her cells were the first that proliferated well enough to be widely shared and have been used in medical research. She died shortly after the biopsy and was never aware I’ve they continued use of her cells and research.

Her story raises ethical issues because she was not compensated and her privacy was not protected. This has led to her descendants seeking monetary restitution from various hospitals, companies, and other entities who have benefited from research using the HeLa cell line. 

Much has been made of this case, especially since there are real and substantial healthcare disparities that negatively impact women and patients of color.

However in 1951, medical consents for research simply were not common and the practice of using patient biopsy tissue for research was relatively routine. 
 
Some people say that by proliferating her cells it’s as though she was still alive. However HeLa cells no longer look anything like human cells. For example they are hypertriploid with as many as 80 chromosomes. 

My perspective is that Henrietta Lacks didn’t do anything to further the research, at least not more than anyone else who has ever had their tissue used in research. The only difference is that her tissue happens to proliferate. The use of her tissue also didn’t significantly negatively impact her since she died shortly there after nor did it affect her legacy in such a way that she should be compensated. Even if it did, it doesn’t seem like her surviving relatives would have a claim. Overall it seems they are exploiting a healthcare system that is trying to remedy past racial injustice for their own personal gain."

0,2022-12-21,CMV: COVID vaccine mandates were a bad idea,u/ItsPronouncedTribe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zs60hj/cmv_covid_vaccine_mandates_were_a_bad_idea/,changemyview,"I would like to preface this by saying that **I am in favour of COVID vaccines, and am personally vaccinated and boosted.** I say this first because so many people immediately assume that people holding this viewpoint are anti-vaxxers. This couldn't be further from the truth for me. I believe that the consequences of vaccine mandates (for jobs, social events, travel) outweigh the benefits for the following reasons:

* **Disproportionately hurt marginalized communities**. In my country of Canada, vaccine acceptance was lower among indigenous communities. In the US, the same applied to Black Americans. One must consider the generational trauma of some marginalized communities, such as the horrific abuses of indigenous peoples by the Canadian/US governments, or the ""Tuskegee Experiment"" in which black Americans were injected with Syphilis and left untreated, causing over 100 unnecessary deaths. Historical events like these increase skepticism of authority among these communities, and mandates disproportionately affect them.
* **Violates some rights/freedoms.** In my country of Canada, we have freedom of mobility. During COVID, vaccines were required to take a plane/train within the country. Negative COVID tests were not accepted instead. Some parts of the country (especially among indigenous communities in Nunavut and northern Manitoba) require air/rail travel in order to leave. Mandates effectively trapped unvaccinated people in these areas, violating their rights of mobility. Rights and freedoms in Canada can be infringed upon in events such as war, catastrophe, insurrection, but according to surviving authors of our charter of rights and freedoms, the threshold was not met here to violate these freedoms.
* **Not a valid solution to apprehension.** The root problem here is skepticism over the effectiveness/safety of the vaccine. Mandates do not address this, but rather force people into doing something they disagree with. A bandage rather than a cure.
* **Coercion is not consent**. A single mother who sleeps with her boss in order to keep her job may have agreed to the sex, but she did not consent because the decision was made under duress. The same applies with vaccine mandates. If someone gets vaccinated not because they agree to it, but because they must in order to keep their job and feed their kids, they did not consent, and this is a violation of medical ethics. 
* **Mandates increase vaccine apprehension.** You often hear among anti-vax circles statements such as ""if the vaccine is so good they wouldn't have to force it"". We are now seeing increased vaccine skepticism against all kinds of tried and true vaccines. I worry that we will start to see more cases of formerly-controlled diseases start spreading again, and I worry what will happen in the next pandemic with all this new vaccine apprehension.
* **Mandates work on the apathetic, not on the defiant.** It is true that vaccine mandates did increase vaccine uptake, but this was mainly on people who were unvaccinated simply because they couldn't be bothered, or those who were scared of needles. For those who are opposed to getting vaccinated, mandates tend to embolden their opposition. I have seen this anecdotally amongst my unvaxxed friends, seeing how radicalized they became after mandates came around.
* **No consideration for negative tests or prior infection.** An unvaccinated person with a negative COVID test and a recent prior infection is orders of magnitude less likely to spread the virus compared to an untested vaccinated person with no prior infection. Despite this, the former is banned from social gatherings while the latter is not. 
* **Does not definitively stop spread.** If the vaccines made it so that you could not spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus, then one could make a convincing argument that the benefits of a mandate outweigh the harms. But as we know now, vaccines only slightly reduce the risk of spreading. Even a 100% vaccination rate would not end the pandemic."

Daughters who sometimes are barely old enough to hold their own head up.

Piercings are painful. They might ache for a few days after the fact. Babies aren't particularly good at being clean, so there's a significant chance of infection, especially if the piercing site bothers the baby.

I'm not even mentioning the fact that these babies are nowhere near old enough to consent to a body mod. A small hole in their lobe is no big deal, yeah, but it's still their body. They should be able to make that decision for themselves. I think waiting even a couple of years is worth it.

Why I want my view changed: I just want to know what goes through a parents mind when they decide to risk their baby's health at such a young age all to conform to.. a weird gender norm? Because we don't put earrings on infant boys. In fact, some parents ban piercings for their sons even when they're older and request them."

You can be fighting for a good cause, and still be the jerk. Being an irrational ideologue, wrongfully calling out and shaming someone, being insufferably self-righteous, and so-on.

Some examples:

1. You are a misogynist if you don't always side with a women (this comes up in the Johnny Deep/Amber Heard trial). In other words, treating the fight for gender equality as a ""team sport"", where you need to be on the side of ""team woman"".
2. You are a racist if you don't think every black person killed or shot by a cop is police brutality, even in cases where the person was actively committing a violent crime, or actively attacking a cop.
3. Manipulating other people by arguing against strawman's of their position that are much worse that what they are trying to say, as the previous two examples kind of fall under.
4. Taking the pursuit of avoiding offense to an unreasonable extreme, where terms that are well intentioned and don't have a huge history of hateful abuse are deemed immoral and offensive. In other words, being ""too politically correct""
   1. I once saw a feminist get offended at the term ""blue balled"" because some folks somewhere used it as a means to guilty trip strippers doing their job.
   2. ""Insane"" shouldn't be said because someone, somewhere, used it in an ablest way, despite how varied it is in usage.
5. Anything that has any tie too a culture of people of color shouldn't be used by white people because it's ""cultural appropriation"".
   1. Once saw someone claiming that White Jazz is appropriation, and morally suspect.

I get this may be a bit disorganized, but hopefully this gets the discussion rolling."

Why is it that the owners of the service industry expects us consumers to pay for the wage of their own employee. Many countries around the world don’t have a tipping system in their service industry, and their service industry still survives. To me, tipping sounds like an excuse for these owners to pay their employees less.

It saddens me that without tips, employees wouldn’t be able to survive. 

I’m not against tipping for exemplary service, but again, we consumers should not have to pay for something the business owners should already be giving their employees.

My middle ground solution:
Restaurants and bars should just increase everything by 15% and not accept tips. By raising prices, people no longer have to tip and employees can (hopefully) receive a livable wage."

Obviously everyone is an individual and there’s gonna be people out there with random middle ground views like myself but I think we can all agree we’ve heard both these points made before.

First one is “my body, my choice” or any alternative of that where the argument in favor of legal abortion is that it’s the mothers body, so it is 100 percent her decision and no one else’s. I think this isn’t a valid point because the argument against this is that it’s not your body it’s another living being inside of you. That’s the argument these peoples opponents are making. So to counter your opponent, how does “my body my choice” make any sense ? It does nothing to counter the counter argument. 

Second, I hear a lot of “men are trying to control women’s bodies”. But I see a ton of women who are also pro life. I’ve actually met more women in my personal life that are pro life rather than men. Obviously that’s anecdotal but I just don’t think it’s some patriarchy trying to dominate women. I think more conservative people and religious people genuinely believe it’s not right. They don’t care what you do with YOUR body, to them it’s about the unborn body. So I also don’t see this as a very valid point. Especially when people, men and women, are voting on these things. 

The third point,from the opposite view now, is religion…. Do I really have to go into detail about why we shouldn’t base laws off religion? I don’t think I do. 

Fourth point, that a lot of conservatives seem to think all abortions are murdering a sentient life is strange to me. How is something without any form of a developed brain conscious? Brain develops around 10 weeks or so but before that it’s just a mass of cells basically. So how is that any worse than taking a plan b ? Which a lot of republicans claim they aren’t against. And the idea that you can’t have medical abortions for much more serious life threatening reasons is crazy to me. That should be unconstitutional and should 100 percent be the decision of the parents. That’s just basic medical care. 

My opinion is a comprise where earlier abortions are completely legal and later term are very regulated would benefit everyone. But I wanna hear some opposing arguments"

Human beings can be incredibly shitty, we lie about others, we misinterpret people and twist the truth, and we gossip on each other’s back. None of these behaviors are new, this is how people have always been. A recent example of this was the satanic panic or the scare of DnD that happen in the second half of the past century. The key difference here is the internet and social media. Social media is such a transformative form of telecommunication that it magnifies a bunch of this common human behaviors by a thousand. You can have entire internet communities made of millions of people dedicated to bashing a particular person over the smallest of mistakes, and people in this communities acting in this way is not a new phenomenon of modern society, what is different is that the internet allows them to interact much easily and create their own bubbles of information. Attempting to deplatform someone or boycotting is also nothing new, but once again the difference is on the internet. Companies at times take a complaint from a small group of people on the internet and take that to be a much bigger part of the public than it is. Another aspect that I think is often related to the idea of cancel culture are changing social norms, which is something that is not inherently bad. And once again social norms changing is also not a new thing, nor is it a defined thing. Like for example, making a joke in your small group of friends about the death of someone is not inherently bad, but making the same joke at that person’s funeral can be incredibly bad, because context matters. The reality is that the concept of cancel culture doesn't really serve any propose other than trying to simplify a very complicated issue as just a problem of the youth being too sensitive. Telecommunication technologies like the internet are incredibly transformative, and we have barely had it for a very small amount of time and is going to take a long time before humanity can properly adapt to it. That is, if we are even capable of doing so."

0,2022-12-22,CMV: The best course for humans is to stop existing and sooner rather than later,u/encima,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zsibdg/cmv_the_best_course_for_humans_is_to_stop/,changemyview,"I have spent so many years in therapy and reading a lot of non-fiction and self-help books and the last 18 months we’re quite heavily focused on climate change. 

This might be multiple views coming together so apologies if this is not right. Currently, I find it hard to live or motivate myself or enact positive change as I come back to the core thought in the title. 

A quick summary of what led me here:

* Overall impact on the planet is net negative; any positive change we have made has been for human benefit or to undo negative actions caused by us
* It is embedded into human nature to be selfish, short sighted and repeat mistakes through doing
* Climate change damage is done. Further attempts to find renewable sources/ways to undo it will suck up limited resources. Even if we became totally neutral today, we would still experience a global warming of &gt;3 degrees and would expect to see the planet become largely uninhabitable for humans within a century
* Capitalism is still the prevailing system so societies operate for profit or within a system designed for growth
* Attempts to change are often localised or motivated for the wrong reasons and not globalised or long term 
* Continuing to exist puts other species at risk and adds unknown time onto the recovery time for the planet. 

So, to summarise, I find it hard to work on positive issues, see the “good” in humans with this mindset. Yes, I know it is partially depression and fear of uncertainty but these are points from research journals or books like, “the uninhabitable earth”. I find this harms people around me as well since I don’t see positive actions as positive because the best thing for any environmentally conscious person to do would be to stop existing. 

This is an awful view, I know, and the core of me does not agree with it. Emotional arguments don’t work, though. If anyone more qualified than me could point me to some peer reviewed positivity then I will dedicate the rest of my life to contributing to that. Or even point me to people that could discuss this with me. This is not a mindset I want to hold for my adult life.

It's been well argued that you can't have to understand and explain every different subtle variation of an idea, and it's also been presented as feeling wrong that you need to justify opposition to ideas that sound absolutely absurd.

My response to this is that I think you can establish foundational opinions, where the OP rule still applies, but that once established, can be used in the context of any argument down stream from it.

Doesn't make much sense writtten out like that, but as a practical example: if I form an opinion on how conspiracy theories are impossible to maintain at a large scale for a long period of time, and I review the counter arguments of that opinion before forming it strongly, then now if any theory/argument is presented to be that describes a large scale, long term conspiracy, then I can dismiss it without understanding it. A big caveat here is that I have to understand it well enough to know that it is claiming large scale long term conspiracy.

I need to work on how to incorporate this into a new guiding principle but putting this edit here for visibility.

# Title clarifications

* By ""reasonably explain the other side of an argument"" I mean briefly describe the opposing side's view in a way that they would broadly agree with. You don't need to fully understand the detail, and you don't need to get it 100% right, you just have to be able to explain their view in your own words of 1-3 sentences, and for them to basically go ""yeah, you've pretty much got it"".
* When I say ""you shouldn't have a strong opinion on the matter"" the emphasis is on ""strong"". You can still have an opinion on something, but that opinion should be more softly held, in recognition that you don't really know the other side of the argument and so are more likely to be wrong in some way.

# Why do I think this?

* When you actually understand somebody else's opposing opinion, a lot of the time you realise that they're not a bad person, they're just mistaken/misguided. As a society we seem to be very quick to just demonise people who disagree with us in a way that just perpetually segments society.
* When you make an effort to not hold an opinion too strongly, it makes it much easier to combat confirmation bias, and to adjust or even completely change your opinion in the face of new info/arguments.
* There should be a universal approach to forming opinions that anybody could use. It doesn't work to say ""this opinion is just correct and I don't need to justify it, but the people that oppose this opinion are wrong and do need to justify it"".

# Pre-emptive rebuttals

&gt;""I don't need to understand why a homophobe is homophobic to believe that me being gay is OK""

This is the main pushback I've got from this when discussing it IRL, and I think this is emotionally compelling but ultimately doesn't hold up to scrutiny. If you switch the positions you should immediately see the problem: ""I don't need to understand why progressives are pro-gay to believe that being gay is degenerate"". This is obviously flawed, and you need to be able to criticise this way of thinking, but you can't do that if you're engaging in or permitting the same time of thinking when it happens to align with your beliefs.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""People need an enemy to care enough to fight, and nuance/understanding robs people of that passion""

If this were true I could potentially find this slightly compelling, however I still think the cons outweigh the pros.

# Practicing what I preach

Abiding by Rule B, I do genuinely hold this opinion, however the reason I am here is because I don't think I should hold this opinion too strongly before understanding what the counter arguments are.

# How to change my mind

A variation on my proposed model is likely the easiest way to change my mind. I don't think I've established very well that this model is preferable to others e.g. ""you should be able to articulate your only opinion succinctly"" or ""all opinions should all be held with a level of uncertainty"".

You could also argue in line with my second rebuttal, that this style of thinking would lead to apathy when it came to building political movements and achieving change.

You could also argue that a certain level of dogma is acceptable in a society and that not all opinions are equal in how they should be scrutinised.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I found one other similar post in my research for this one, but that was specifically arguing that you should be ""very informed"" on both sides, whereas I'm just arguing for a basic understanding of the core argument, so I believe this is novel enough to warrant its own discussion."

Granted, it is inconvenient for the living to lose contact with their loved ones. And granted, it is natural to _fear_ death, and it is not easy for the rational mind to overcome this fear. Still, this is not enough to justify the way most people view death as something awful. 

As far as I can tell, most people who say they believe in Heaven do not really believe. They just _really hope_ there is a Heaven. Only a small minority of extremists seem to truly believe that the afterlife is better than life (including, possibly, some suicide bombers)."

10,2022-12-22,CMV: Virtue ethics promotes unfairly categorizing people into hate groups,u/nintendoeats,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zsrwq7/cmv_virtue_ethics_promotes_unfairly_categorizing/,changemyview,"EDIT: I should clarify that my use of the term hate group here was meant to refer to a group that is hated by the speaker, not a group that itself advocates hate.

For this thesis, I present the following working definition of virtue ethics:

&gt;An ethical system whereby actions and policies are judged by how closely they embody a set of 'moral virtues' and 'moral vices' identified by the holder of the system.  Anything can potentially be considered a virtue or vice (patience, non-violence, consuming tomatoes, killing martians).

I believe that ethical systems, or individual ethical arguments, based on virtue ethics should be discouraged because they inherently denigrate the people who hold partially or fully opposing views.

For example, people can reasonably disagree about what the ""default"" behavior should be when presented with an ambiguous yellow light . One virtue ethicist might argue that defaulting to the stop behavior extolls the virtue of patience, another might argue that defaulting to the power through it behavior embodies the virtue of courage.

For both cases, it is implicit that anybody who holds a different view is in a group that the arguer views to be inherently morally wrong; either impatient people or cowards. This is an inherent ad hominem.

In contrast, a consequentialist moral system (for example) does not necessarily need to cast judgement against a person who disagrees with that moral position because it only judges the action, not the person directly. Further, it does not judge the **belief system** of the person performing the action, even if that belief system differs from that of the ethicist being discussed.

In the same example, one consequentialist might argue that stopping reduces the likelihood of an accident, while another might argue that powering through reduces the overall amount of idling required, thereby helping the environment. Neither view requires any judgement of the person on the other side, they can simply acknowledge that they disagree on the overall consequential balance.

Since I believe that people in the wild sometimes behave like virtue ethicists (intentionally or not), I think it is worth subjecting this viewpoint to scrutiny."

At the very least as time goes on, wages should increase in line with inflation regardless of job performance. 

As a separate thing, I’d suggest additionally tying wages to a few key indicators such as average house price or average rental price in a given area. This may be more complicated so I’m willing to treat it as a separate thing. 

This seems like an obvious thing to do to ensure that standard of living for the population at the very least doesn’t diminish excessively. 

So my view is that this would be a good thing to do and would benefit everyone except corporate shareholders and as such is an obviously good idea. CMV"

1) It *FEELS* like we have free will. 

2) We have such little understanding of consciousness, there is no reason to say we don't have free will. We ought to act as if we do.


-Neither of these arguments actually makes a statement against deterministic principles, only offering personal feelings or inconsequential statements.

-I've also seen a couple theories hinging on the idea of Retrocausality, but i don't think they demonstrate enough concrete deduction. There are too many assumptions.

-------

**Definitions**

Free Will: The supposed power or capacity of humans to make decisions or perform actions independently of any prior event or biological status.

Determinism: the doctrine that all events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will. Some philosophers have taken determinism to imply that individual human beings have no free will and cannot be held morally responsible for their actions.

In order for you to change my mind, you'd have to demonstrate that there are reasonable arguments that our actions aren't solely determined by our previous experiences and our biology-- That we have some sort of ""self"" that acts will it's own ""free will""."

148,2022-12-22,CMV: denouncing protests based on violence or lawbreaking is a copout,u/mattl3791,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zst28p/cmv_denouncing_protests_based_on_violence_or/,changemyview,"This is something I have thought a lot about, watching the BLM protests in the USA and the Truckers anti-vaccine mandate protests in Ottawa, Canada over the past few years. There are more examples but those two are particularly interesting because one represents more leftist ideology and the other more right wing ideology, though I'm sure there is plenty of overlap. But for simplification purposes I'm going to talk about how both those opposed to the protests and those in favour of them act.

In all the coverage of these protests, the opposition is always looking to point out vandalism, resisting the police, illegal occupation of streets, looting, breaking by-laws, violence, etc. Basically any infraction of the law is held up as a reason to disregard the message of the protestors. Meanwhile the supporters are always urging 'peaceful protests' and downplaying any illegal activity as being fringe and not on message.

But let's be real here. Protests are the expression of public outrage at a system that is failing them. In both the cases I mentioned, extremely personal and important concerns were on the line. Many African Americans felt like they were fighting for not just an idea, but survival. Many, many people lost their jobs, their small businesses, and their life's work/dreams over how the governments enforced covid. I know several. Regardless of how you agree or disagree with these people, the desperation that makes them stand toe to toe with armored police and risk imprisonment, beatings, fines, etc., is very very real.

It's simply unacceptable to expect these people to hold up a sign during government approved hours in a government approved location and to obey all appropriate bylaws. The entire point of protests is to be disruptive and uncomfortable. Some people will take an incredibly pacifistic approach. But change is just as affected by those with a more extreme approach to things.

In short, I'm not encouraging people to smash store windows or throw things at the police or to block essential traffic. But I do think that A) it in no way should be used to diminish or dismiss their cause, and B) it is very naive to expect real change to not be accompanied by some level of lawlessness, because the 'law' is what is on trial in a protest."

This is the opposite result of what we'd want.

Instead, it should mandate clear labeling of ""may contain"" vs ""shared equipment"" etc, and allow bakers to be as cautious or frugal as they please so long as they accurately label their likelihood of contamination.  Companies should not be incentivized to add allergens."

i think a good place to start is a clarification of my moral framework. i don't think that lying, even if to children, is necessarily wrong. there are circumstances in which it is justified. instead, i think of morality from a consequentialist perspective, ie from the perspective of looking at the consequences of an action and deciding if it does more harm than good, or vice versa. 

now, to the meat of the issue. my main contention is that lying to children fosters a more untrustworthy and cynical society.  when a child who believes in santa discovers the truth, what does this mean to them? this figure is a beacon of hope and goodwill, a personalization of charity and kindness and all that is good in the world. when the child discovered that Santa is a fabrication, they are implicitly taught the maxim that is fundamental to the way our culture views morality: it is naive and childish to believe in the good intentions of others. i am not claiming that Santa is the sole culprit, but it is one factor among many that teaches our children to be just as toxic as their parents. 

(the fact that we teach kids that such a benevolent overlord spies on everything we do all the time, and therefore implant in the child's mind that surveillance is a benevolent act, is a noteworthy piece of nuance despite not being directly relevant.)

EDIT: I should have clarified, but i am part of the majority who was lied to until i figured out the truth for myself (probably around eight years old but my memory is imperfect)

Or the company is fined. Or some punishment is doled-out to ""the company"" while actual humans paid by the company get off scot-free. Higher level managers can simply quit their jobs and avoid responsibility for bad actions most of the time. 

I believe there should be an individual (s) legally responsible as the company's personal agent if/when something goes wrong. That person should typically be the CEO.

Another example is bankruptcy. Managers get paid bonuses to not leave while shareholders and the public deal with the problems of bankruptcy. No person is held accountable or responsible for it."

I'm open to changing my opinion, but no one has been able to reasonably change my view, so I'm here.

As stated in the title, I'm 100% anti-death penalty. It's morally problematic, and there are other ways to punish people and bring justice. Not to mention there's a chance that an innocent person will one day be executed, and we shouldn't let that happen.

Here are a bunch of arguments people have used so far, and my answers to them. Feel free to give me your own reasons if it's not listed below:

**1. The chances of an innocent person getting executed are low / we will only execute those who we are sure are guilty.**
Even a 1% chance means 1 out of 100 is dying unjustly, there's no greater good here, someone's gonna slip through the cracks and we can't let that happen, we shouldn't just sacrifice their life.

 For each guilty person, there's gonna be someone who believes they're innocent, that's why we have trials and give them the chance to defend themselves. Yes that ""someone"" might be a follower, loved one, etc and in the case of terrorists their belief is most likely wrong but the fact that they exist means this person is dying because their faith was in the hands of a random group who happened to disagree with them.

**2. What if you or one of your loved ones were a victim, wouldn't you want justice?**
I don't think the death penalty is justice, it's vengeance. Would I want vengeance? Yes, but that's emotional reasoning. Rationally speaking, if they spent the rest of their life in prison, they'd suffer more, and it'd be a better punishment. They have ruined lives, and we can't just give them the sweet release of death.

**3.they might corrupt other prisoners/guards, and we can't let that happen.**
I don't disagree with this, and this one's the most likely to change my view, but I think killing someone to prevent them from spreading their ideology is just dodging the problem, we must find an actual solution instead of choosing the easy way out.

**4.it takes a lot of money and resources to keep a horrible person alive in prison** 
Again see no.3, we must find a solution instead of choosing the easy way out. Just because we're saving money doesn't make it moral."

0,2022-12-23,"CMV: The physical disparity between men and women plays a major role in sexism and until we find a way to correct it, likely through genetic modification, men and women will never truly be equal.",u/ILikeMistborn,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ztdgir/cmv_the_physical_disparity_between_men_and_women/,changemyview,"It been pretty common knowledge for a while that men are scientifically proven be a great deal stronger than women both on average and overall. I've heard a few different explanations ranging from women being roughly 70% as strong as men to the strongest 10% of women only barely being stronger than the bottom 10% of men, regardless the result is still women being weaker than men. This has a multitude of repercussions, from the the ease with which male abusers and rapists can overpower their female victims, to the fact that the majority of athletics need to be gender segregated in order for female to have any chance of success. It's like if humans lived alongside chimpanzees, complete with all the horrific violence and psychopathic behavior that entails. All of this aids the patriarchal notion of female inferiority. 

Now there are counterarguments to this, but none of them sit right with me. It's been claimed that women excel in other areas that men don't, I've found very little to back this up. Men and Women are generally equal in intelligence to my knowledge and most, if not all, of the mental and emotional differences between the sexes can be traced in some way back to social factors instead of biological ones. It's been shown that women are more flexible than men and it's also been claimed that women have far better endurance. If the latter's true than it's not as severe of a difference given that all the major hyper-endurance sports are completely dominated by men, and the former has very little overall value outside of aesthetics. Those flips and twirls are impressive and take more time, effort, and training than I could ever imagine, but they don't have the practical value and literal power of raw physical strength. There's the fact women live longer, but I wouldn't consider an extra decade of being a frail, withered, dementia-ridden near-corpse a fair trade off for being so heavily dwarfed in strength that adult women are outpaced by teenage boys. The only unique aspect of women I've seen it be claimed is equal in value to man-strength is women's unique capability to carry and give birth to children. Not only does this devalue and dehumanize women who can't have kids for whatever reason (trans/intersex women, women who're infertile, etc.), it also reinforces patriarchal gender roles through the idea that men are strong and women are breeding stock. Ultimately this creates a disparity in terms of capability where possess a form of severe physical superiority that isn't matched by anything women are capable of. 

What this difference creates is a world where inequality is baked in. I've seen hundreds of posts from women talking about all of the precautions they have to take for even basic day to day functions like walking to their car at night because if they slip up they run the risk of a man attacking them and inflicting all manner of inhuman horrors on them because they can. That's not an existence anyone should have to experience, and that's what it's like in countries with the highest levels of gender equality. Now I've heard it said that the onus shouldn't be on victims to not be victimized and men should be taught not to be such sick freaks instead and while I largely agree I think it's naïve and honestly kind of depressing that the best we as a society can collectively hope for is for men, as violent and narcissistic as the majority of them tend to be, to begin practicing *noblesse oblige* toward women and show them basic human decency when it's been shown time and time again that they're completely unwilling to do so. It's been claimed that we shouldn't measure people's value on their physical strength but even ignoring that strength's still a metric that a person can be measured on, and one that still has a good deal of practical value at that, it's a metric that many actively work towards improving to the point of making it their entire life, including a lot of women. I won't claim to know the thoughts and feelings of female athletes/women who seek to be stronger, but it can't feel good to devote one's self to strength and athletics only to be dusted by nearly every man on the planet, no matter how much effort *they* put in. Additionally it's important to note that an individual's physical strength is what determines their ability to both commit and protect themselves from violence, which is still a key facet of life for the vast majority. 

Now obviously this isn't a problem that can't be solved by simply changing society and social norms, it's built right into our physiology, in our DNA.  Thankfully as we move ever faster and further into the future the idea of genetic modification has steadily been abandoning the realm of Sci-Fi for the realm of Scientific Plausibility. I don't know what modifications would be used or how they'd even work but Something that would allow women to be, at the very least, innately as strong as men of equivalent size, is basically a necessity in this regard. Some feel the idea of genetically altering humans is unethical or outright immoral. I'd argue hat it's more immoral to leave such a horrific injustice alone simply because that's how things were."

6,2022-12-23,CMV: Godzilla 1984 is a Cult Classic,u/pokezillaking,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ztxob6/cmv_godzilla_1984_is_a_cult_classic/,changemyview," Godzilla 1984, also known as ""The Return of Godzilla,"" is a Japanese science fiction film that was released in 1984. While it was not a major commercial success at the time of its release, it has since become a cult classic among fans of the Godzilla franchise and Japanese cinema. In this essay, I will explore some of the reasons why Godzilla 1984 has gained a cult following and why it is considered a classic within the genre.

One of the main reasons why Godzilla 1984 has become a cult classic is its nostalgicically retro aesthetic. The film is a direct sequel to the original 1954 Godzilla film, and it hearkens back to the aesthetics of the original film and the 1950s-1960s era of Japanese cinema more generally. The special effects are low-tech by today's standards, with practical effects such as miniature sets and suitmation being used to bring Godzilla and other monsters to life. This contrast with the heavily CGI-dependent special effects of more recent Godzilla films has endeared the film to fans who appreciate the classic ""rubber suit"" aesthetic and the sense of nostalgia that it evokes.

Another reason why Godzilla 1984 is a cult classic is its darker and more serious tone. While the Godzilla franchise has always had a certain level of camp and absurdity, the 1984 film takes a more dramatic and realistic approach to its subject matter. The plot revolves around the consequences of nuclear testing and the dangers of modern technology, and it presents these themes in a sober and thought-provoking manner. This departure from the more light-hearted tone of some earlier Godzilla films has resonated with fans who appreciate the film's more mature and nuanced approach to its themes.

In addition to its retro aesthetic and serious tone, Godzilla 1984 is also notable for its strong character development and storytelling. The film features a diverse and well-rounded cast of characters, each of whom is given their own arc and motivations. The plot is complex and engaging, with a number of subplots and twists that keep the viewer invested in the story. This strong character development and storytelling has helped to elevate the film above the status of a simple monster movie, and has contributed to its cult classic status.

One of the most memorable aspects of Godzilla 1984 is its titular monster, Godzilla himself. The film marks a return to the more traditional, dinosaur-like design of Godzilla that was used in the original 1954 film, as opposed to the more anthropomorphic designs used in some later films in the franchise. This classic design, combined with the practical effects used to bring Godzilla to life, gives the monster a sense of weight and presence that has contributed to its enduring popularity.

Another factor that has contributed to the cult classic status of Godzilla 1984 is the film's cultural significance. The film was released at a time when Japan was undergoing significant economic and social changes, and it reflects the anxieties and concerns of the time. The themes of nuclear testing and the dangers of modern technology resonate with the post-World War II period in Japan, and the film serves as a commentary on the social and political issues of the time. This cultural significance has helped to give the film a timeless quality, and has made it a classic within the Godzilla franchise and Japanese cinema more broadly.

In conclusion, Godzilla 1984 is a cult classic for a number of reasons. Its nostalgically retro aesthetic, darker and more serious tone, strong character development and storytelling, iconic monster design, and cultural significance have all contributed to its enduring popularity among fans of the Godzilla franchise and Japanese cinema. Despite its initially lukewarm reception, the film has gained a devoted following over the years, and it stands as a classic within the genre."

In order to ensure that there are an appropriate number of elections every two years, the terms are staggered. This creates different maps where one party is often significantly disadvantaged by the fact that they are defending a large number of incumbents and the areas where they are up for election have shifted rapidly away from them while the other party is not up for election in places that have shifted away from them.

&amp;#x200B;

The effect of this is that the legislative body is not truly democratic. Imagine we have a country that uses nationwide proportional representation and party A has control as a result of class 1 which is 15A-18B, class 2 which is 16A-17B, and class 3 which is 20A-14B and class 3 is up for election. The final result is 18A-16B. The chamber has gone from 51A-49B to 49A-51B even though A was more popular.

&amp;#x200B;

It gets worse when less the entire nation is up for election every two years. In the US Senate, in the massive blue wave year of 2018 where Democrats took a 235-199 House majority and won a large number of previously Republican governorships, Republicans gained Senate seats as Democrats were up for election in swing states and red states far more than Republicans were in danger due to great Democratic performances in 2006 and 2012."

It may upset many, but the most effective way to address both poaching and the issue of species near extinction is to legalise and regulate hunting.

Countries like South Africa take this approach to managing certain species (not big game but other animals) - by legalising hunting you create a model that incentivises market actors to create and manage game farms which oversee the protection and proliferation of these species.

Furthermore, by using this model the country has not experienced species extinction at the same pace as other countries around the world. CMV"

Non exhaustive list:

Fine structure constant: if it was higher or lower there would be no stable atomic orbitals (therefore no molecules of any sort) 

Gravitational constant: If it was higher or lower there would be no stars or galaxies (just uniformly distributed plasma and/or black holes)

Mass of electron: if they were very different there would be no stable atomic orbitals, so again no molecules

Cosmological constant: If it was significantly different the universe would be just uniformly distributed hydrogen/helium plasma or a bunch of black holes

Dark Matter: With significantly less dark matter, galaxies would not form

There are a number of other parameters that have similar structure destroying effects. Some are more sensitive than others, but even one could be changed to completely prevent the existence of structures in the universe (molecules, stars, planets, galaxies, etc) Notably, no experimentally verified theory can explain/predict why these constants have the values they do. They are ""free parameters"" and have to be measured and added in manually. Note that this is just molecular/gravitational structures, and the problem comes about before invoking the existence of life. It only gets worse once you add life to the picture. If you invoke the anthropic principle, one might guess that we just find ourselves in the part of existence that is hospitable to life. A similar argument would show that the Earth does not need to be fine tuned since there are so many planets around so many stars in so many galaxies. For the same argument to apply to constant, there would need to be a large amount of universes with different values for these constants. OR, the way the constants are selected in our universe could be in some way related to the amount of structure. Cosmological natural selection, for example, proposes that universes are born in black holes and natural selection favors those that produce the maximum amount of stellar black holes. String theory posits a vast multiverse with different constants and quantum fields in each one. Note that the many worlds interpretation likely doesn't fix this issue since all those branches have the same constants. Conformal cyclic cosmology provides another potential solution whereby the heat death of a universe serves as the big bang of a new universe. The main point here is either A. There are a vast multiverse with many combinations of these parameters, and we find ourselves in the part that is hospitable to our existence. and/or B. The selection of the constants is in some way tied to the existence/complexity of structure (not necessarily tied to the existence of life, just molecular/gravitational structures)

TLDR our universe has a lot of structure, and if it's the only universe it's extremely improbable (given the free parameters we've observed) that such a universe would exist without some selection mechanism promoting structure."

The waste of time:

* I never wanted to be a doctor, still I had to learn everything about blood types and genes.
* Every normal person just uses google maps if they need to be somewhere. Why the fuck do we have to study where cities are, and even cities on the other side of the world that we will probably never visit?
* Repeating the extremely easy stuff for more than 10 years, only because the dumbest kid in the class needs it, so it slows the education down for everyone (Example: in college they were still teaching me things that I was also taught in elemantary, like basic math 37+54 kind of stuff ..... )
* If someone likes history, cool, but why does everyone who isn't interested also have to learn what happened X amount of years ago?
* All those weird math equations... some are useful, but why do we need to know stuff like 3x+4 = y+7? What application does this have in real life?

Maybe not the best examples but I could go on and think of 100 more of these things

Besides all that, did we learn anything useful in school? Yes ofcourse, but alot of our time that school wasted away, could have been used to learn the things that really matter. So here is a list of what school didnt teach us for some mysterious reason

* Friendships, relationships, social skills
* How to stand up for yourself against bullies
* How to get money and use it efficiently (besides ""get a job and save X percent"")
* How to be succesful in life
* How to stay safe online from things like malware, hackers, scams

Seriously, why did school force us to study all those completely useless things, and never ever taught us the things we NEED?

Based on the facts stated above, my view is that 90% of school is a complete waste of time, where only 10% of school may be useful. Have I missed something?"

Many on the left that were pro Taiwan became very pro Ukraine as well. However, in my opinion the two stances are contradictory.

Two very big issues behind the Ukraine war are the Crimean and Donbass regions. These regions legally belong to Ukraine but have majority very pro Russian/anti Ukraine government populations and want to separate from Ukraine overall. However Ukraine forbid them from joining Russia which was what lead to Russia forcibly taking Crimea from Ukraine, and then Ukraine wanting to join NATO to prevent another such incident from reoccurring.

 However, in the Taiwan conflict, Taiwan legally belongs to China but has a majority pro Western/anti China population. Overall, I see that in this conflict, Ukraine is similar to China while Taiwan is similar to Crimea/Donbass . What I'm confused about, therefore is why the pro China people are pro Russia and the pro Taiwan people are pro Ukraine. I see Ukraine's motives in this war as similar to China's: Ukraine wants to prevent their territories from leaving them and teaming up with Russia, while China wants to prevent their territories from leaving them and teaming up with the US.

To be clear, I'm not trying to start any hostile arguments with this post, I am genuinely seeking to understand other people's opinion on this topic. I'm not 'extremely' knowledgeable with the history either (I did read some wikipedia articles but that's about it) so I would appreciate for anybody who comments to provide some links to evidence and historical events if they fit.

I’ve had people ghost me, and then just hang out with other people. I’ve had people cut me off because of their relationships then never speak to me again. In all of this, I have made the effort to see what’s up with these people. I have tried to ask them what I need to change and they’re always like “nothing.” I’ve tried to compromise. Personally, I don’t expect much out of people. People don’t have to hang or talk everyday, but to just ghost me? It’s like damn, can we communicate the fact that you don’t want this relationship or friendship anymore instead of me thinking we have something then you just leaving out of my life randomly? Maybe I’ve just meant a lot of bad apples but I do think it’s unfair. Cause with my busy life, I still try to communicate but I give up because if I still try to talk to this person, and they’re not talking to me then what’s the point? Then the excuse is “I’ve been busy with life.” To me, that’s just a damn cop out. If you have moved on and feel like you’ve grown away from the relationship then just communicate it with me 😐 I see it happen around me too because people in my family die then that’s when everyone wants to get together and talk. Yet, when that person was alive, “you were too busy with life.” I don’t get it :/ Cause when it happens to them, they wanna get upset. I think this might sound a little selfish though, and maybe there is something I’m missing??? I’m open to other views."

16,2022-12-24,CMV: The apartheid analogy doesn't really describe what is happening in Israel/Palestine,u/Jackolantern668,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zufmvl/cmv_the_apartheid_analogy_doesnt_really_describe/,changemyview,"It has become common in recent times for activists to compare what is going on in Israel/Palestine today to what went on in apartheid-era South Africa. According to this line of thinking, Palestinian Arabs are analogous to black South Africans and modern Israel is analogous to apartheid-era South Africa. I consider this to be flawed for reasons that I will explain below.

The first reason why the apartheid analogy is flawed is because unlike the black South African struggle which was based on fighting for equal rights, the Palestinian Arab struggle is based on ethnic nationalism. The Palestine National Charter, the official document of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), doesn't explicitly advocate for a state where equal rights for everyone are guaranteed. Rather, it is full of rhetoric alleging that Palestine is an Arab homeland that was stolen by the Zionists. 

The second reason why the apartheid analogy is flawed is because the ideology of the State of Israel is not the same as the ideology of apartheid-era South Africa. The ideology of the latter was centered around segregating people on the basis of race and ethnicity and awarding rights based on these attributes while the ideology of the former, Zionism, simply states that Jews have the right to national self-determination in what is arguably their historic homeland. It is true that Palestinian Arabs living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip don't have the same rights as Israeli Jews. This can't be likened to apartheid South Africa however because unlike black South Africans who were citizens of South Africa only to later have their citizenship revoked by the government, Palestinian Arabs living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were never Israeli citizens to begin with. The Six Day War was the only reason why they ended up being under Israeli control. 

For the reasons mentioned above, I consider the thought process likening what is happening in Israel/Palestine to what happened in apartheid-era South Africa to be flawed. I am not stating this as someone who is firmly in the Zionist camp: personally, I think that the best solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a binational state where both Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs have equal rights under the law. I just think that an analogy that is based on shaky grounds makes peace harder to achieve. If this view is flawed, I would like to have it challenged respectfully."

I believe this is the best thing for society overall and that the inequality it produces isn't even a negative.

If there was a pot of money and rather than distributing it evenly some people got to take way more than others then I would say this is unfair and a bad system. There is no pot of money though, the money doesn't exist until you make it. So the rich people haven't taken the money from anywhere, they created it while giving money to workers which was also not on offer before. Once the rich have created it they then give some of it in tax to the pot which would never have existed without them and can now be shared among everyone. If it wasn't for them the money wouldn't exist in the first place. They also have created a useful good or service at the same time which people want/need and got it into their hands. If you stopped them from doing what they have done the only difference would be that there would be less money to go round, less goods and services on offer and the supposed ""benefit"" that there isn't one person much richer everyone else.

I don't see why people care about inequality if everyone is better off? If there was a magic button you could push which would end world hunger and give everyone in poverty a living wage but also give the top 1% a 10x increase on their income would you push it? I absolutely would and I can only see benefits from it. I wouldn't say there is any downside whatsoever.

The good bootcamps can be worth the money in some cases. Doesn't sound like it works out for everyone but it's a viable option for some.  


---

I keep seeing ads for coder bootcamps with pitches like ""*complete our 6 month program and make 75k a year at your first job*"" and it annoys the shit out of me. It's a fucking scam, keep your money. There is no way someone completely unexperienced is going to land a good junior dev gig fresh out of one of those shitty bootcamps and succeed. Those bootcamps might be ok for people with some skill already looking for a quick crash course but even then, it's not worth 10k-20k. Part of being a developer is learning on the job and teaching yourself to learn. These bootcamps are a good starting point at best, until you consider the cost. If it were like $200-$500, maybe. These vultures are asking for too much, though. They know desperate people will fall for it, spend the money, and likely fail. It's honestly cheaper (and better) to spend a year or two at a community college and take random tech courses. I could be wrong through...

If anyone has taken these courses or considered enrolling in a bootcamp, what are your thoughts? Based on my experience in the industry and being self taught, learning how to ""code"" is the easiest part. Managing client expectations, being efficient in your workflow, being an effective problem solver, writing clean and maintainable code, etc are what keeps people employed and those skills take experience to develop. I don't see people fresh out of those camps staying long at their first ""75k/yr"" job. Am I too cynical? Anyone have success after completing one of these bootcamps?"

But this is no different to Call of Duty WW2 or the Battlefield series. These are based off real wars where millions of young men were forced into a brutal war where they suffered and died alone in horrific conditions.

0,2022-12-24,"CMV: in everyday settings, you shouldn't say Merry Christmas.",u/Square-Dragonfruit76,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zuj6m9/cmv_in_everyday_settings_you_shouldnt_say_merry/,changemyview,"I've heard the arguments that saying ""Merry Christmas"" is a secular phrase, because Christmas isn't a religious holiday for everyone. I've also heard that because it is not inclusive, the phrase is offensive. I do not believe either of these because they are both too extreme. Just because people who are agnostic and atheist celebrate Christmas, does not make it secular. It is not an inclusive phrase, but I want to be clear that I do _not_ mean it is necessarily offensive. When people say something is offensive, they usually mean it is intentionally harmful. That is not what I am saying. I am more saying that it is inconsiderate. It is _also_ normalizing mainstream culture, and in doing so, unconsciously whitewashing the other ones. 

Have you ever been in a language class, and you are learning about family units, and they ask you to do something like ""describe your mom's family?"" They do this because most people have one single mother and father family unit. But it's similarly annoying as saying ""Merry Christmas."" Maybe your mom died very young. Maybe you have two dads. Maybe you have a single father who adopted you. Maybe you have two moms so you don't know whom to talk about. Maybe your parents are straight but divorced and remarried so you also have two moms. The question is not intentionally offensive. But it reaffirms the stereotype that everyone has one mom. I believe the same to be true with wishing people ""Merry Christmas."" Even if not doing so consciously, unconsciously it is confirming people's biases that all those around them are Christian. And on top of that it can be annoying to the people of other religions you may say it too. That said, if you know someone is Christian, or are at a Christian event or Christmas party, then it _would_ be appropriate to say Merry Christmas.

How to change my view: prove that saying ""Merry Christmas"" in a general setting has no negatives.

How not to change my view: by saying that most people don't intend any harm. I think I've made clear that I know that. I don't take offense by people saying ""Merry Christmas,"" and don't think many people do. That is not the issue here. You also cannot change my view by saying you ""know someone Jewish who says 'Merry Christmas.' "" They may be saying it because they do not want everyone to know that they are Jewish, because they know you are Christian, or simply because they do not personally see any harm in it. But that does not mean no harm exists on a cultural level, nor does it mean that other non-Christians aren't annoyed.

Edit: when people say this, it is usually within majoritively Christian nations, but I should have specified that I am referring specifically to them. It's not an exclusive phrase if it's not the majority religion. 

Edit 2: Some people have tried to argue that Christmas is secular. Although people do celebrate it secularly, that does not make it a secular holiday. Not when more people go to church then then any other time of year, people sing carols door to door about the birth of Jesus, and depictions of his birth are placed on people's lawns. I think it is much easier to overlook these things if you are atheist than if you are a different religion. And perhaps that is why there have been multiple atheists commenting that Christmas is secular, but few people of outside religions. It has been pointed out to me, however, that a much better argument can be made for secularity in certain Asian countries.

Edit 3: I'm more ambivalent about saying it on Christmas day. If you say Merry Christmas on Christmas day, I still find it a little problematic, but I acknowledge that it is also specifying the existence of what is happening on that date less than assuming someone is also celebrating something that you are. The much bigger problem is saying it before."

I’m not saying you can’t be a feminist and wear a burqa, niqab, or hijab. This post is simply about a double standard I see often enough in life. That being, lots of men dressed in expensive, very western clothes walking around with wives dressed like we were still in the Middle Ages. Lots of religions/cultures have rules about what their followers can or can’t wear in everyday life. It exists in christianity, judaism and islam. There’s a wide swath of interpretation among those three big religions on how strictly the dress codes should or shouldn’t be enforced. I have no problem with that. 

What I do have a problem with is blatant hypocrisy. 

You want your wife or daughter to wear “appropriate” muslim clothing when out in public? Okay, I can even get behind that to an extent, (even though I find the implications about the body troubling) just make sure you’re following the same rules. 

Because there’s definitely some rules in the Quran on what “good” Muslim men should look like and I’m pretty sure there isn’t a line in there about crocs, Hollister t-shirts and acid washed jeans. If you’re letting yourself off hook for following those rules or guidelines in the holy book while having your wife, sister, or daughter wrap herself up like a lollipop, then it doesn’t have anything to do with God. It’s about the fact you feel insecure in your manhood/relationship and think any guy that actually sees what she looks like could steal her from you. It’s about possession and jealousy."

All of the Hobbits are punching above their weight class. Borimir is just a guy. Aragon basically has superpowers, but still struggles and fails. Even Gandalf, the literal Angel with the powers of Christ, struggles in fights and even dies once. 

What does Legolas do? He spends like 5 hours of screen time absolutely mogging the other races of middle earth. They play his rivalry with Gimli for laughs, but let's be honest- Legolas absolutely clowns on him the entire time. 

He's the bow guy, but when people get up close, he's suddenly playing Tony Hawk's pro skater 5 on an Uruk-Hai's shield. Lost Hobbits? He suddenly has super vision. Don't even get me started on the scene where he does parkour Kung-Fu over a giant f**king elephant. 

The dynamic between him and Gimli should have been strong-but-slow vs nimble-but-fragile. Instead, it's goofy ass beard guy vs power gaming D&amp;D character. 

Watch those movies again. Legolas' presence completely deflates any tension in fight scenes. He should have been nerfed to Gimli's level. Worst written character (once again, movies not books)."

Some years after the acquisition they released it, and made text-to-code functionality publicly available. Tesla Bot will have to communicate with real people, so it has to be trained on authentic conversations. Buying an underpriced social media company with many users and historical conversations is the best option for this. Having too much bots on a platform is also not an issue if you want to promote free speach, but it is an issue if you are looking for authentic conversations. Elon and his team have to clean not just the current userbase, but the old conversations as well, to have good data to train on. So in a nutshell, the Twitter acquisiton was not for free speach, but for a core feature, interacting with humans and profitability of Tesla Bot."

AFAIK a land manager and a landlord would be the same thing, but regardless for the purposes of this post land manager=landlord. I'll also say that I might be a bit biased as my uncle is a land manager. But I'm not so close to him or his business that I'm unable to consider opposing views, even anti-land manager ones.

First, I understand that there are some very toxic landlords who engage in shady business practices legal and illegal and I have no problem calling them landlords because they act like kings and put money over people. Everyone's heard horror stories. Apartments with asbestos and other carcinogens, apartments that are literally falling apart, loud construction projects at 3:00 in the morning to force tenants out. Whether they just don't care to fix the issues or are outright cruel, these landlords deserve scorn and scrutiny. I have no sympathy for them. And if the left was only criticizing these corrupt landlords I wouldn't take any issue with it. 

But, more and more, I see people on the far left criticizing land managers in general, especially as homelessness increases. The mentality seems to be that land managers own property they themselves don't need but other people could use and they make money off of said property so they are unnecessary and harmful. I noticed this especially when it came to the topic of evictions during the COVID pandemic and how land managers would lose money if the government didn't reimburse them- ""So what they don't make their money, why should anyone make money off of owning land.""

Competent and decent land managers maintain their properties and ensure their tenants are safe- and, if there is a safety issue, work quickly to address it. It's not like they just buy up the land, do nothing, and get rich. They have to put in time and money to make their property a place people actually want to live and if they own, say, an apartment building that's not easy or cheap. 

(I'm talking mostly about individual land managers. Companies that buy up multiple properties in the same area, essentially controlling that area, are a different beast and they can absorb the impact of lost rent much better than an individual land manager.) 

I'm open to changing my view based on new information."

I really want to change my mind on this, but as [union membership declines](https://www.cato.org/blog/americans-mainly-reject-labor-unions) and remain unpopular among Americans, I'm convinced unions in the classic sense will remain a distant memory unless implemented under a different name from the top-down. In any modern economy, especially when bargaining power is completely unequal for various reasons, unions are necessary to sustain a strong middle class and social mobility. Without them, competition among employers is not sufficient to raise wages as classical economists assert. This results in workers not responding to wage increases or decreases. That reduces quality of life and overall consumption levels. This alone is a convincing case for sustaining strong labor unions.

While some would point to countries like Sweden and Norway as examples of how to utilize trade unions for the public good, I feel the United States has completely different material and historical circumstances. Correct me if I'm wrong, but unions in Scandinavian countries had a more lax relationship in contrast with the United States and Great Britain. In the US and UK unions were seen as weapons for class warfare. So instead of Labor and Capital seeing each other as social partners, they saw each other as enemies.

This is why, after nearly a decade of a labor golden age under FDR, public opinion *turned against labor unions in the late 1940s.* Labor unions abused their striking power in critical industries, which led to the economy as a whole suffering. Going on strike every so often to demand better pay and conditions is one thing, but doing it often breeds instability. This resulted in Congress *overwhelmingly* supporting the [Taft-Hartley Act](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tafthartleyact.asp), overriding Truman's veto. And funnily enough, Truman would use the legislation himself since unions sometimes undermined his public policy objectives.

Some blame the rise of neoliberalism in the 80s on the decline in labor unions, but I think it actually started to decline in the 40s in response to excesses on the part of Labor. While the excesses of Capital are clear, clearly the democratic will of the American people, most of whom are consumers who want stability and affordable products, triumphed. You may even say ""So what if unions are constantly going on strike! That is their *moral right!""* But democracy, like all political systems, doesn't care about your personal morals. If the masses see the instability of class war, they will side with whomever makes their lives slightly more convenient.

Great Britain apparently had this same problem as well; accumulating in the rise in anti-union sentiment by the 80s. And guess what that got the Brits - Margaret Thatcher. Because again, the historical and material circumstances of the UK and US are vastly different compared to other social democratic countries. The labor union tradition is different, and without proper institutions in place policies favoring them failed.

Even if we somehow revived the labor movement tomorrow through a grassroots effort, public opinion will turn against them within a decade or two. This can be seen with the recent threat of a railroad worker's strike. The fact that such a strike would've made vast numbers of people hungry or even lose medical care via rapid inflation, ensured that the interests of consumers were aligned with those of the bourgeois railroad owners. That is why Biden with the overwhelming support of Congress stopped it, despite his otherwise good track record on unions motivated partially by Catholic social teaching.

**This is why I believe unions will never make a comeback in the private sector without some sort of authoritarian top-down approach, and possibly under a different name.** Ironically the Republicans of all people [tried this](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/2/rubio-banks-introduce-pro-worker-labor-reform-bill) by encouraging EIOs (Employee Involvement Organizations) and French-style worker-board representation (just one worker minimum); although the former is worthless if employers can dissolve them at will. (Mandating EIOs could actually work to be honest.) Expanding ESOPs (employee stock ownership firms) to include some democratic representation (making them de facto controlling shares) could also work. Wage boards have shown promise in industries difficult to unionize like fast food."

This list includes triple A hits and small cult classics, and everything in between: Fallout New Vegas, Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines, Dragon Age Origins (and Inquisition), the Witcher, Pillars of Eternity. 

All of these games, and other comparable examples I did not list (Mass Effect for one), all have something in common. Their combat is widely agreed to range from bad to “fine”. The best you’ll hear of them is decent. 

Even the best among them aren’t as good of shooters, slashers, or top down squad strategy game *when compared with non RPGs in their genre*. Every crpg pales compared to xcom. Fallout 4 is the best of the modern fps content in RPGs, and it pales to shooters that aren’t RPGs. 

Combat is undoubtably the weakest element of the game for so many RPG classics: VTMB, Planescape Torment, Fallout New Vegas. I personally like Dragon Age Origins combat enough, but the way the battles drag on in the fade, the deep roads, all really stress my patience. The fandom is in almost complete agreement there. 

People, especially the fans, love the game for its world building, dialogue, characters, etc. The combat is there to just pad it out-maybe giving you a couple of fun setpiece bosses. Any more development time and resources that can go from combat to the rest would be a positive

I’m sure some will push back on games like Mass Effect, but with most of the RPGs have combat as their weakest element. Some bring up the new Deus Ex games. Immersive sim is the more accurate label for them than RPGs 

Disco Elysium stands as a game that cut the fat off and is better for it. You have the chance to kill people on a couple occasions and thus taking a life has the weight it deserves. The amount you kill in most RPGs is immersive breaking in its absurdity. Half the commonwealth must be eradicated by the time the sole survivor retires 

Anyhow, merry Christmas and CMV!"

By the usage of it and by today's standards, it has positive connotation. However, the term by definition signals that people who are not white are not supposed to be seen as normal as someone who is white, which is problematic. 

To put it simple, a person of color, is just another way to say a colored person, which by definition considered derogatory since it was used in the past to describe someone who is not purely white caucasian and is seen as less of a human being. 

This terms encourages the thinking that, you are either born as a white person, or a non-white (which means you are a person of color), which further reinforces the idea being white is a special category and other races fall into the same category. It also reinforces this idea that society should expect someone who is white to have different human experience than someone who is not white simply because they are by calling them white, but not a person of color (since by definition here, white is also a color). So it is strange to think that being white here signals a sense of being the advantageous ""majority"" (despite the fact that most people around the world are not white) and being a person of color means one is a minority at disadvantage. And if you replace ""person of color"" with the term ""colored person"" or ""non white"", will carry out more offensive undertone.

Aside from terminology, it is the usage. Person of color is usually expected to be used when to form generalizations of something solely base off racial identity. Sometimes, it does not come off as rational since other than white, many races do not share similar experience just because of their race, or the fact that they are not white. For instance, many schools today classify asian americans as ""white adjacent"" simply because asian americans do not seem to be at disadvantage compare to white americans in terms of academic performance and admission rate. This exposes the idea that people who are not white, or people of color, are expected to be at disadvantage and have less power/influence just because of their non-white racial identity, which by itself is a bad generalization, meanwhile many would associate whiteness with power, influence and advantages.  
In conclusion, using the term ""person of color"" comes off with good intention, but it signals that a person of ""no"" color or without color, or white, is special, which does not help with the idea that we want to promote equality and we believe we should each each race as equal and not judge a person solely base on the color of their skin."

First off, the bad guy just gets away with taking what would be well over $100,000 in today's money. He faces no ramifications besides not being able to buy out George's business, which he wasn't going to be able to do without taking the money anyway.

Second, George doesn't get anything that he wants: he just avoids a catastrophe that he shouldn't have been responsible for in the first place. He didn't want to get married, and he certainly didn't want to get stuck in Bedford Falls, and yet, at the end of the movie, that's exactly the situation he's in: married and stuck. Okay, everyone came together to help him out, but would it have been a happy ending if the movie ended right before the money was lost? Because that's essentially the situation he's in at the end of the film. I mean, not going to jail for something you shouldn't go to jail for should be the standard, not something that makes you think ""everything is going to be okay now.""

It seems like the ""happy"" ending is just that George now accepts the life he never wanted and isn't bothered by the fact that he's letting his dreams die."

As a single man there the degree of people I am looking to date takes a full three standard deviation drop. The BMI mean has increased by five. No one seems to be even remotely interested in exercise and no one seems to understand what actually taking care of themselves means.

There are absolutely no food options despite attempts at restaurants. When Zahav and Laser Wolf are your top dogs versus lets just even go with Atoboy, Red Rooster, and Bahari, which aren't even close to the top dogs of New York you know your food scene has problems.

Your sports fans light the city on fire when you win OR lose.

Chopped Cheese &gt; Any cheesesteak that is produced.

Forget the ridiculous excuse of a cheesecake or bagel.

The traffic in terms of sheer numbers is better, but is made infinitely worse by the entire lack of disregard for traffic laws and a seeming pastime of fender benders and hit and runs.

The diversity of the city is just......center city and not center city. Your Chinatown is melting, There's a few vestiges of an Italian community (vs Bronx/Manhattan enclaves), a tiny Vietnamese smattering. I mean...what gives?

UPenn, Temple, Jefferson vs Columbia, NYU, Cooper Union......no contest.

Overall, I think it'd be in the best interests of the city to just bulldoze 100% and start over."

22,2022-12-26,CMV: The Witcher 3 would have been a better game without levels,u/MaralDesa,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zvkri6/cmv_the_witcher_3_would_have_been_a_better_game/,changemyview,"Warning: This post contains minor spoilers 

Witcher 3 is a game where players adopt the role of Geralt, a Witcher, on his journey to save Ciri, his adoptive daughter and ultimately the World. It's a RPG with classical RPG elements such as dialogue choices, a level mechanic, some character customisation (via skills, gear, haircuts, playstyle etc.) and an open world to explore and interact with. 

I am quite fond of this game, I have completed it twice and I am currently re-playing it because of a recent patch. 

On to the issue: I believe this game would have been better without the level mechanic. Here are my arguments:

* From a lore perspective, levels don't make much sense. Geralt is already fully trained - this is supposed to be his final adventure after which he retires. He is supposedly over 90 years old. Not saying one can't teach an old dog new tricks, but having the progression start at Level 1 seems silly. In his earlier adventures, Geralt fought a Dragon, and now a pack of rabid dogs are giving him a hard time?
* Fairly at the beginning of the game, after the player leaves the tutorial section, Geralt is given 3 leads as to where to go look for Ciri. The 3 leads refer to 3 different areas on the map, and it's suggested that it is up to the player where to go first. The 3 leads are basically circular and the order in which they are followed doesn't affect the outcome. But because there are levels, and enemies also do have levels, the order is more or less restricted, as in the player does A first, then B, then C. The restriction feels arbitrary, especially since there actually is dialogue for going to C first, yet given the level situation, no one does that. 
* Gear also has levels, as in Geralt must have reached level X before he is able to use Sword Y, and once Geralt's level surpasses the level(s) of his gear too much, the need arises to switch to some higher level gear. From a logic perspective, this doesn't make a huge lot of sense to me, especially since Geralt can find the same sword multiple times, but with different levels. It's hard to wrap my head around how 2 of the same things can be so different, Geralt simply doesn't know how to use one of them. A sword is a sword, and Geralt at that age should know where to stick the pointy end.
* One might think levels in this game are required to prevent the player from reaching certain spots on the map so to not find things they aren't supposed to find etc. But that is not the case, some late game areas are walled of behind story progression points and are impossible to reach earlier. The player can not break the game for themselves by going anywhere on the map at any point, and in many cases the game even foresees this unlikely event and has extra dialogue in place for the special case that the player has already done a thing before getting the quest for it. 
* The developers were seemingly aware of a bunch of problems the level system introduced, and tried to mitigate these problems. For example, to prevent the problem that Geralt outlevels his enemies, an optional system was introduced that scales lower level enemies up to Geralt's level so there is still a challenge. Another example refers to the gear: there are a few special Witcher armor sets the player can find, and the player then can further find schematics to upgrade said Armor so it ""grows"" with Geralt to some degree and doesn't become useless after a short while. To prevent the player from needing to grind or from being able to level up ""too quickly"", experience is mostly gained via main quests and not side missions or various optional content. 

Now to be fair, the game gives you an option to play it without levels. It's a bit convoluted - if you play on PC, you can download a save from a Mod page that allows you to start a New Game Plus at level 100, which is the maximum level. In that case, Geralt can no longer level up further, all the enemies and gear are in a reasonable level range, and all the armor sets are also scaled to level 100 and therefore remain equally good choices that come down to play style and preference only. Console players might now also be able to do that, now that save sharing is possible, or by grinding and grinding up to level 100 before starting a New Game Plus (not recommended). 

I have played New Game Plus with a level 100 save before, and it was very eye opening. It was an overall better experience - the open world truly feels open, and the frustration the level system introduced are gone. But here is the problem: for a new player, level 100 Geralt might be not a good choice because it may be overwhelming and confusing, not to mention it's a New Game Plus, so Geralt not only starts with everything specced out, but also with a heap of cash and some end-game items, taking away this kind of progression from a new player. 

Overall, my opinion is that this game would have been better without levels. This might or might not apply to other RPG's too - levels are a cheap way of giving a player a sense of progression, but in this specific case it feels so arbitrary and out of place I believe The Witcher 3 would have been a better game without it. Change my view please."

Yet I have heard people say that their whole world view and outlook has been changed by a moving piece of fiction that they read or watched, some people have had the whole world views changed by the works of AYN Rand, or have been able to more clearly empathise with the perspectives of the treatment of black people after having red to kill a Mockingbird and similar books.
So why can’t we admit, thatthis, could work in the opposite direction as well, there have been several notable examples for example the Netflix show 13 reasons why which has supposedly increased suicidal thoughts among teenagers, and Stephen King wrote a book about a mass shooter and decided to stop selling it after a very notable mass shooting had occurred.
And there are examples of teenagers being stabbed by others for recording drill videos and screenings, ofmovies, about gangs being invaded by people carrying machetes and knives.
I think it’s very clear that the messages that we take from fiction can influence us in very real and very tangible ways, and glamorisation of criminal activities such as in those Netflix shows and Books is concerning to me."

They stayed friends after super easily and he moved on. 

**Bad Example 1** 
One girl knew this guy from high school who never hid having a crush on her back in high school. He never asked her out. 5 years later, he asks her out and she just bolts. Full ghost after that question. And they were super close in this whole stereotypical glee like friend group. 

They go to the same med school and she actively avoids him like the plague and now I can't invite one without the other loathing it. And she hates how now she has to play mind games just to pick how and when she talks to her friends and she openly admits to me how she missed how close they were. 

**Okay example 2** 
Girl asks boy out and the boy says they are seeking to date a muslim. The girl gets mad, keys their car, but apologizes in a 72-hour period. They are still friends now and they are glad they at least explained it rather then throw away a 6 month friendship. 


**Bad Example 2**
2 girls had been friends for a long time, both actively joke to their friend groups about getting married. One asks another out after 2 years of friendship. The other friend promptly ghosts and disappears. 

I talk to both but when the ghoster hears the others name, they just make fun of how they chose to ask them out. 

**My Point** 
If you value someone, ghosting doesn't make sense when you could go on one date and check if you like someone. Or you could just tell them objectively why you won't give them a chance. I don't get why ghosting is the picked choice.

Many [researchers](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407518822780?casa_token=t709_U_GylIAAAAA%3AAv1qrTs1ZAXBE3QWMexSdwKTkC17AszVybbfJiO5VowALJBSa42pncxp_TostK2iQjkNHCiiLNie5Q) and [relationships experts](https://www.glamour.com/story/how-long-do-you-wait-for-the-s#:~:text=Three%20dates%20is%20a%20good%20rule%20of%20thumb.&amp;text=If%20you%27re%20not%20feeling,careful%20of%20his%20feelings%20too) have proven that attraction normally builds around the 2nd / 3rd date and anything before that is hardly indicative of long term attraction. 

Worst case scenario, you lose a friend's best case, and you build a better more honest relationship with that friend. 

But you are practically assured to lose a friend if you ghost.

Edit 1 - the OK example, is OK because they took clear transparent steps. I know dozens of examples of OK ways to turn down a date, I just chose to someone extreme examples.

I chose 2 illegal examples on purpose"

So, logically, life sucks.",u/Amoeboid_Changeling_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zvnlck/cmv_life_is_unfair_unfairness_sucks_so_logically/,changemyview,"This is a big logical fallacy I've discovered, something that the bigger part humanity seems to share. Obviously, I'm a pessimist, which seems to be more rare than optimism. It seems to me that most people generally want to have a positive attitude towards life, they want to cope somehow, they want to let in the good, keep out the bad, etc., etc. Even when they're in bad circumstances, even when so much shit happens, most people want to stay positive. 

But here's something that contradicts the positive nature of life and something everyone agrees with: life is unfair. Everyone knows. Some are lucky, others aren't, some have better lives than others, some live longer than others. People don't get what they deserve. Some people get away with bad shit. Innocents suffer. I could go on but we all know the deal. Whenever I mention something like this to someone, sometimes even using the word ""unfair"" myself, they say ""yeah, life is unfair."" So everyone admits.

And YET. Somehow it's extremely hard to find people who would agree that life is shit. When I talk about this, most people just don't take me seriously. I can even give examples to why I think that life is negative and they still refuse to consider my point (I think it's because the notion that life does suck would cause such a cognitive dissonance in people's minds that they just can't let it in). So, I claim that optimistic, positive people are mostly wrong. We all know that life is unfair. Unfairness can't be good. If something is unfair, that thing is bad. And so, just by pure logics, life is bad, or at least more bad than good. I'm really curious to how can anyone chance my mind in this matter because my logic here seem to be flawless. But, the post is posted, so feel free to try!"

What justification could that quote have to this really horrible event that happened to said person it was inflicted upon? They lost their limb, but it happened “for a reason”. No, it didn’t happen for a reason, it’s not exactly going to teach them to not take what they had for granted or whatever bs people say to sound “wise”. It’s going to make their life more difficult now that they have to learn how to function without something they’ve had for a long time. 

Or someone’s house burned down. Everything they cared for is now is ashes. You can’t just go up to a person and tell them not to be attached to the things they looked at as important just because you read a book on a prophet that said humans shouldn’t be attached to material items. 

Or say someone got cancer. There is a chance you might not die, but there’s also a chance you will die. Not only that, but you have to drop all plans you had, go through chemotherapy, lose your hair, take endless drugs. How is that an “everything happens for a reason”. You MIGHT DIE! Your relatives and friends will be sad! 

Fired from a job? Great. Now you have to put it 100+ applications. Sure, you might get a BETTER job, but in the economy today, you’re going to suffer until you find that job."

It's an argument for tabletop RPGs. It's as if someone asked you why you like your favorite book and you respond that you like reading.

This may already sound hostile, but the reason I say it upfront is simple: Every time I see someone talk about what makes D&amp;D so great, they never actually say anything about the game's actual merits. They're basically just praising TTRPGs as a medium, seemingly unaware that there are literally hundreds of alternatives out there. And let's just say, if your argument is ""the good thing about this game is that it does the same thing every other game like it does""... well, it doesn't actually make that game look super unique or interesting.

What makes D&amp;D special? Why should I play it over literally any other game? Especially since I'm not a huge fan of medieval fantasy. What am I missing here? Why are there so many people swearing on this system to the point that they'd rather mod it instead of doing the probably much less time- and effort intensive task to just learn a new system?

Addendum: Two recurring sentiments I see here are ""you can't criticize D&amp;D if you never played it"" and ""people prefer reskinning D&amp;D because it's easier than learning a new system""?

Like, do you see the irony there?"

Is that not demoralizing? Wouldn't it be best to just assume based on certain cues like we have been for thousands of years? And if you accidentally use the wrong pronoun, it's a simple correction. A very simple ""oh. actually I'm x"".  We shouldn't be agonizing over possibly misgendering maybe one out of 1000 people when it's never a big deal to begin with. it's only a problem when someone intentionally misgenders someone.

Anyway I think it may already be passing. I watch a fair amount of debate streamers and before they used to always ask the guest what their pronouns are. now they never ask.

542,2022-12-26,CMV: The life quality in the United States is significantly lower than the quality of life in similarly rich countries.,u/Cas_D,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zvyqr9/cmv_the_life_quality_in_the_united_states_is/,changemyview,"  

As of now, the United States have the highest GDP in the world. The US has the 7th highest GDP per capita in the world. The people in America also apparently have the highest disposable income in the world, as well as the highest median income.

Despite of that America very clearly has a lower standard of living for its average citizen than similarly wealthy countries. 

Life expectancy in America is 77.28 years which places it at 54th place. 

Let’s compare it to other similarly wealthy countries. Australia is 5th at 83.20 years. Canada is 19th with 81.75 years.  The UK is 28th at 80.90 years.

America is performing way worse that all three of these countries, even though on paper all of them are poorer than America.

In fact, America is more comparable to poor and middle income countries.

Colombia is at 51st place with 77.46 years. China is at 59th place with 77.10 years. Iran is at 64th place with 76.87 years. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_life\_expectancy

Now let’s look at the homicide rate 

America has 6.5 homicides per 100k people. Which puts it higher than Burundi at 6.1, Sudan at 5.1, India at 3.0 and Moldova at 2.3. It is only slightly lower than Afghanistan at 6.7 or Russia at 7.3

Compare this to other rich countries: 

Japan is at 0.3, Korea at 0.6, Australia at 0.9, the UK at 1.1, France at 1.3 or Canada at 1.9.

American homicide rate is 6 times higher than that of the UK, and over 3 times as high as that of Canada, it’s closest cultural, geographical, and economical neighbor. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_intentional\_homicide\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate)

Additionally, America has infamously bad healthcare system. 

Australia, Canada and the UK all have public healthcare programs that cover the entire population. As do pretty much all European countries. 

On the other hand, even when counting private insurances, only 91.2% of Americans have health insurance. For comparison, it’s 90.2% in Mexico and 90% in Algeria

So almost 1 in 10 Americans don’t have any health insurance.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_health\_insurance\_coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_health_insurance_coverage)

On the topic of healthcare, the obesity rate in the America is 36.2% 

Canada is at 29.4%, Australia at 29.0% the UK is at 27.8% Germany at 22.3% and Italy is at 19.9% 

And it has to be mentioned, Europe also has a big problem with obesity. Their obesity rates are significantly higher than most of the world. Despite of that, America still outclasses all other western countries, being almost 10% ahead of the UK. 

For comparison, Japan is at 4.3% , South Korea at 4.7% and China at 6.2% 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_sovereign\_states\_by\_obesity\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_by_obesity_rate)

And finally, Americans work much more than people in other wealthy countries. 

Average American works 1791 hours a year. In Australia 1694, In Canada 1685, in the UK 1497, and in Germany 1349. The only rich country ahead of America is South Korea at 1915, and Korea is known for its unhealthy work environment. 

[https://data.oecd.org/emp/hours-worked.htm](https://data.oecd.org/emp/hours-worked.htm)

So in the end, despite being the richest, Americans:

\-life shorter lives,

\-are more obese

\-have worse health insurance

\-have a significantly higher chance of being murdered

\-and worker more

Than people in other similarly wealthy countries."

The reasoning is that if you celebrate your past achievements, all your time and energy would be spent just doing that instead of making any future progress. Therefore, I believe that if you make an achievement, you can celebrate it, but then keep looking towards the future so you can make future progress.

I believe in looking toward the future instead of reliving the past. Time only moves in one direction. You cannot return to the past. But you can change the present and the future. So it's better to focus your time and energy on paving your way forward instead of looking back to the past.

Disclaimer: I am not justifying any of the occurrences that I will mention here. I am just explaining what happened.

Some examples from my life: A few years ago when I was in high school, I was experiencing my first high school crush after she invited me to her birthday party in a hotel ballroom. I didn't know how to handle it at the time so I asked friends for advice. Most of them said to just talk to her naturally, and so I did. I considered this to be the best time of my life at the time. The giddy feeling of the attraction just felt good, talking to her felt great as well, and we also saw each other in high school band a lot. I went to her party and my favorite part was dancing with her on the dance floor. She had a boyfriend at the time but we became friends after the crush. Overall, that time period was one of the best times of my left at the time and I also made a lot of personal growth during that time. I assumed that was the closest I had ever been to dating someone.

The problem was that I was so enthralled by this crush that I wanted to ""relive"" the past. I wanted to repeat the same crush again so I could once again experience these giddy feelings of attraction and personal growth, and hopefully even surpass what I experienced in the past. So I tried again, and again, and again, and again, by basically ""deciding"" who my next crush would be and then basically just ""talking to them naturally"" while spending a lot of time and energy on said feelings. None of these following crushes worked the way I was hoping them too. I didn't get the same burst of energy and confidence that I did in the past and I ended up feeling worse, rather than better, after each of those crushes. The last one of these high school crushes was one of the most damaging in my opinion, during which I seriously thought it would land me in a relationship and thus rival the past crush that I mentioned earlier, but then she blocked me on social media and my hopes quickly went down.

Here's another issue that I believed this caused. Around that time I noticed many of my peers getting jobs, learner's permits, and eventually driver's licenses and owning their own cars. Meanwhile, I got a learner's permit but didn't have a driver's license and wouldn't have one until my first year of college. And even now I still don't have a car. I was so enthralled by this crush in the months since that I blame these feelings on my lack of progress in that field. Instead of realizing that I was old enough to learn how to drive, I instead spent that energy ruminating on this past crush. I feel like the same thing could happen again in the present day if I'm not careful, this time with internships, careers, and generally life after college.

Since then I decided that it was not worth trying to relive this past crush, since this crusade has caused major damage to my friendships and mental health. So I made a new promise to look towards the future, not relive the past, so I could make an upward journey. And in a way, it worked. I entered college, got a job, met a lot of new people and formed many friendships, and had a lot of fun social moments that I wouldn't have expected. I'm now at a point in life where I actually don't want to go back to the ""good old days,"" because the present moments *are* the ""good old days.""

Another smaller example is when I liked someone about a year ago, so I asked them to hang out and we ended up eating in the university food court. That period of time was also a major period of growth for me. At the time, I was just starting to get a better idea of handling romantic attraction and my friendships were also expanding. Although I liked her, the problem was that I didn't know how to continue moving things forward and I had no concept of stating intentions, so I just didn't do anything after that. This caused a lot of anxiety and generally just unnecessary mental blocks throughout the next semester of college, and at that point, it would have been better to just let it go. I later moved on and I'm glad I did so.

Here's another example that I'm noticing, and correct me if I'm wrong on this. I also don't want this to spiral into a political discussion; this is just my own viewpoint. We celebrate America and American democracy a lot. There are holidays celebrating the country's independence, the soldiers who fought for the country's freedom, streets and days of the calendar named after a leader who pushed for greater rights for black Americans, and even entire classes teaching and celebrating the country's past. But I feel like all of these celebrations of America's past achievements are ignoring the issues that modern America is facing today. Jobs have been outsourced to developing nations and the manufacturing base is declining, America is becoming a lesser power on the world stage (at least, that's what I believe), costs of living have risen faster than wages, Northern cities that have been major population centers for decades are losing population to cities in the South, the inflation that began earlier this year, and the recent political turmoil. (Again, these are just my observations, and I may be wrong on these.) Therefore, I believe that if the country as a whole wants to improve, leaders should stop spending so much time and energy celebrating achievements in years past and focus that time and energy on addressing the issues of the present, such as the environment, costs of living, and jobs.

Here's why I'm posting this in CMV: I feel like this mindset is treating my self-improvement journey as an engine that requires coal to operate. I must keep putting in coal in the engine to keep powering it forward. And to be honest, it can get pretty exhausting trying to find this coal at times. Sometimes, my engine is just tired and just wants to rest and reflect on the journey that it has made. But I must keep it going if I want to be successful, so I must keep putting more and more coal into it. I seriously wonder how I can achieve a healthy balance of being grateful for the achievements that I have made and focusing on future progress at the same time.

Compared to other demographics of women, black women often marry later in life, are less likely to marry at all, and have much higher rates of marital instability. ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4850739/)). Black women also seem to experience about 8% higher lifetime intimate partner violence than whites women ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4302952/)) while also being overrepresented multiple times over in homicides related to IPV [source.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6628a1.htm)

On an income level six, almost all of the inter generation income gap between black and white households is due to the gap in income between black and white men [source.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html).

When it comes to education, it is pretty well known that [girls tend to have higher educational attainment overall than boys at both the high school and college level](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/10/12/boys-left-behind-education-gender-gaps-across-the-us/amp/), however, among black people, the gap is _much_ wider with [black women earning nearly double the bachelor’s degrees of black men](https://www.jbhe.com/news_views/51_gendergap_universities.html) and 70% of the master’s degrees.

In short because of these factors and many others (such as the apparent case that high earning lack men tend to not want long term relationships — not entirely sure how true this is but [source](https://sites.utexas.edu/contemporaryfamilies/2011/08/30/interracial-marriage-symposium-responses-banks-marriage-proposal/) [another source](https://sites.utexas.edu/contemporaryfamilies/2011/08/30/why-interracial-marriage-is-good-for-black-women/)) there appears to be a huge lack of marriageable black men.

Despite this, black women are the least likely demographic group to marry and black men are twice as likely to marry outside of their race. [source.](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2017/05/18/1-trends-and-patterns-in-intermarriage/)

__Interracial Marriages__

Interracial marriages tend to have higher incidents of overall IPV than mono racial coupes but the incidence for women in those relationships tended to be lower even compared to the men in those relationships ([source.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3611980/#R20)). Also, it appears that there is no emotional cost for black women who decide to marry outside of their race. [source.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2378023118814610)

By marrying outside of their race, black women can gain access to more marriageable men who likely have higher income , higher wealth, and many do the privileges that might be afforded to white people (or any other group of non black men) in a society that is still systemically racists against black people.

Happy CMVing!

EDIT: 

The idea that black women should marry who they want isn’t mutually exclusive with this CMV. You can marry for love _and_ be pragmatic and concerned with your overall well being. I am _not_ advocating that black women shouldn’t marry who they love, I’m saying that black women shouldn’t feel beholden to be stuck with black men since as a population, black men are the least marriageable demographic group.

He’s kind of terrifying lol, he has a casino/casino’s, a cam girl business and his hustlers U MLM thing. He went to Romania because the laws are not as strict (which is true most places for people with money and “mob” ties), casinos are notoriously known as fronts for gangs and mafia to clean money, porn industry is just soulless and sketchy as well. He talks about his life like it’s either illegal or borderline illegal for some reason, if he is partaking in illegal activity it wouldn’t make sense for him to become this publicly known and if he wasn’t it wouldn’t make sense for him to act like he is but isn’t. This guy is so confusing and seems so insecure it’s mad. 

It’s seems like his whole life he wanted some kind of “fame” being in different reality television shows, kickboxing etc. It’s just odd that he wants people to think he’s some kind of mafia/criminal then when he gets accused he gets super defensive, this dude needs to pick a side. Maybe he thinks the criminal lifestyle has some kind of allure to it and it’s just for image but his whole schtick is so puzzling. I also feel like the more people flex on the internet especially, the less they have physically(nothing to cite or reference here).

Edit: average casinos make 200k a year, not sure if his casino is in Romania or somewhere else, average cam business can vary so I’m not sure how much he was making there, Hustles U is unconfirmed. Something is not adding up here."

Because what those people who would benefit from these laws passing don’t share those beliefs, it should be a human right and it causes a massive amount of problems and nearly no solutions to make decisions based on antiquated ideas of faith."

35,2022-12-26,CMV: COVID-19 escaped from Wuhan Institute for Virology,u/david-song,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zw5sch/cmv_covid19_escaped_from_wuhan_institute_for/,changemyview,"Call me a conspiracy theorist if you like, but I'm looking at this realistically. I don't like this conclusion at all but from the evidence I've seen, a lab leak is the most likely cause of COVID-19.

The single most convincing piece of evidence is that this bat coronavirus emerged right next to the city that contains the world leading center for bat coronavirus research. 2000 miles away from the bats, in the 3rd closest city. Lab leaks are not unusual, they have happened before and will happen again.

The second biggest clue is the Chinese government's heavy handed response to it at the start, and their dishonesty throughout. Disinfecting the streets, blocking all mention of the word in Chinese owned online games, removing the databases of WIV from the internet claiming a hack, refusing to cooperate with the WHO. Appointing a military general to run WIV, and of course producing the first vaccine. Calling it COVID-19 rather than the city where it was found is another strong hint. IMO it's likely that they knew about it in September 2019.

The next, the fact that no intermediate species was found after 3 years even though it's ""scientific consensus"" that it was transmitted from a bat to another species before jumping to humans. The only earlier versions that have been found were bat samples collected by coronavirus researchers from WIV in 2013. 

There's a load of other reasons - the cover up, Trump flapping his mouth etc - but I think these are the strongest evidence. Can anyone change my view? Because it I find it really upsetting that people are outraged about the behaviour of celebrities and other trivial things while their family members were actually killed through neglect by virology researchers.

4 million people are dead and we're doing nothing to stop it from happening again. Please let me be wrong. I really want to be wrong about this.

0,2022-12-26,CMV: Civilians are a fair target in war,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zw6u77/cmv_civilians_are_a_fair_target_in_war/,changemyview,"I find this division between military and civilians so arbitrary and illogical. I'll try to explain my position in parts:

First

The myth the civilians can't fight back and the military can. The whole point of modern warfare is to attack the enemy when they CAN'T fight back.

A good general will never give the enemy an opportunity to mount an effective defense. So there's no real difference between bombing civilian houses vs bombing a military barracks full of sleeping soldiers.

Or logistics, the best strategy is to cut off supplies and soften the enemy. There's no real difference between shooting a civilian and shooting an starving soldier that has run out of bullets.

An even better example is modern guerilla operations. A taliban ""soldier"" carrying a rusty AK-47 can't defend himself any better than a civilian against an US airforce attack. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second

Civilian lives aren't more important than military lives. I find it disgusting that so many people think killing soldiers is ok just because they aren't civilians anymore.

People are cheering for the killing of russian soldiers in Ukraine. While i see young draftees that were civilians two months ago and were sent as cannon fodder to a war they don't believe in.

&amp;#x200B;

Third

Civilians contribute to the war as much or more than soldiers. They pay all the taxes that fund the military and work in the factories making weapons.

Plenty of them also have the knowledge to keep an industrial base going. ww2 is a great example where Russia got their factories bombed and moved thousands of engineers and technicians to rebuild them in the east. Those civilians were all high value targets."

Since many people who have kids in this day and age, look at statistics backing the above listed observations, and think ""Oh these dangers, and threats won't apply to *my* child, they'll be safe, and things will get better"", they are either lacking the ability to connect simple dots by observing basic logical cause-effect relationships, which suggests they are illogical and/or stupid, and fueled by a narcissistic urge to procreate, simply because (1) it's what their ancestors have done, (2) what ""successful people"" do,  (3) what society ""should do"" based on what is outlined in outdated social doctrines, such as the religious texts they prescribe to, or (4) what they think will validate/salvage their legal union.

No ethical person who sits and really thinks about the 13 points I listed in the first para (which isn't  an exhaustive list, just the points I could think of off the top of my head while taking a shit, lmao), will want to bring another child into this world. If they really wanted to experience parenthood, they would adopt one of the many unlucky and unwanted children brought into sentience against their consent. 

Please change my mind if you can, because based on my life experiences, I feel there is no way to justify bringing a child into *this* world, and this belief is making me misanthropic and leaving me seething when I see families who are clearly struggling to get by carrying 3 kids under 10 and another in a pram. I just don't get it.

Edit: I replied to as many counter-arguments as I could today (27/12/12), yet I still feel strongly about my view. In fact, some other redditors sub arguments defending my general argument, actually strengthened and validated my position to a degree. I will reply to the other counter arguments to my general argument when I can find more time in the days to come. Thank you for considering my view as valid enough to warrant a reply, even if you disagreed with my central premise. Happy holidays/new year 😊"
0,2022-12-27,"CMV: Modern celebrations of Christmas* (primarily in the USA) are bad, and we need to massively tone them down.",u/ballmaddie60,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zwacs8/cmv_modern_celebrations_of_christmas_primarily_in/,changemyview,"\*I would like to preface this by stating that I am not referring to religious Christmas celebrations, as most of my opinions on this are not applicable in this regard. I am however very interested in input on my opinion from any Christians and Pagans out there, as many aspects of Christmas are associated with winter solstice traditions (not all of course) and I am not particularly educated on this.

Why?

1) Modern Christmas is an ecological disaster.

The very modern practice of buying gifts for extended family (sometimes even those you only speak to on holidays) is incredibly wasteful since you more than likely will get them something they did not want or need in the first place. Christmas encourages the consumption of useless or limited-use products simply because people feel some sort of obligation to give gifts. They are made cheap because you can't spend $100 on every person to buy them something that will last. This goes without mentioning the packaging, the gift wrap, the bows, the cards, the boxes you name it. All were designed with the intent to be thrown away.

Let's talk about trees and lights. Artificial trees, for obvious reasons, are just pointless. Especially the pre-lit ones. Guaranteed to go to a landfill. Real trees have problems too, premature forest turnover and whatever. Lights? Also going to landfill after being used for maybe a couple of years doing nothing but wasting electricity. The amount of Christmas decor I see for sale every year is absolute madness. Why do we need so much stuff? Can we not reuse things?

2) Christmas has strayed so far from its original intention.

Christmas was supposed to be a little treat for kids and a gathering of close family for a good meal, not an all-out, savings-decimating event often requiring months-long preparation. I mean we are seriously talking about going from kids getting some oranges/apples/semi-expensive treats or a new pair of shoes or one (1) toy to getting iPhones, massive plastic contraptions (aka ""toys"") they are almost certainly to be disinterested in within months, and other crazy stuff within 100 years time. Having a successful Christmas means having tons of stuff under the tree nowadays. It's just strange.

Christmas decorations historically were put up primarily on Christmas eve. Why am I seeing junk out at the grocery store in OCTOBER? THE MADNESS MUST END.

3) It is unbelievably dangerous.

There are obvious risks with doing so much travel to every get-together during this time of year in a good part of the USA. The weather is terrible, and not wanting to go for this reason makes you a ""killjoy"". Christmas trees and lights are a fire hazard. So many toys are cheaply made and end up being dangerous to kids. So many fires, and so many DUIs, it's just a mess.

4) It alienates people who are poor and/or who do not have loved ones to celebrate with.

This is a self-explanatory and often overlooked part of the holiday season. It can also be a very unwelcome reminder for many of an important person's absence.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I just a boring person? Is Christmas unsalvageable? Is my POV overlooking something very important?"

I don't know if you have heard this at all in your lives, but in I've noticed that in a lot of minority families/communities, this seems to be the prevailing school of thought. I myself am black. 

It's either that or the idea that one parent should be the ""fun one"", and the other should be the disciplinarian.

And to be honest, I consider it to be little but rationalizing nonsense. 

Here's why:

It's universally accepted by people with more than two braincells to rub together that a true friend who truly cares about you, is someone who will speak to and deal with you in truth,for better or worse, regardless of whether it makes you happy or sad. They'll have your back in the face of trouble and adversity, laugh with you in moments of pure joy and happiness, and encourage you to achieve your goals in the healthiest ways possible. 

A true friend also cares about you enough to warn you when you set down the wrong path or fall in with the wrong crowd, and lay into you if you refuse to listen. They will have zero qualms hurting your feelings if there is no alternative to get your head on straight.

Bearing those aforementioned qualities mind, is that not what a parent is supposed to do? Based on those qualities, is a proper parent not supposed to be your first friend, as well as the guide and leader that keeps you on track?

From what I've seen, too many parents claim to ""love"" their kids, but barely *like* their kids. They'll cry if their ""baby"" gets hurt or gets in trouble, but every other day of the week, they're ill tempered around their child, simply for being a child and asking seemingly nonsensical, curious questions and wanting to play with them. And from conversations I have had with parents in the past, there are an astonishing amount that see their kids as little more than obligatory taxes on that bomb dick/pussy they tore up x amount of years ago, solely motivated by romance and lust, instead of the desire to build a family. Thus, they subsequently view their presence in their children's lives as little more than them accepting the consequences of having unprotected sex, and living up to the responsibilities entailed therein. They see no reason to be kind or to try to foster a positive relationship with their kid that will have them still wanting to visit after they turn 18.

Granted, for a quantitative statement like the above, citations would be ideal, but all I have are anecdotes.

Parenthood *is* hard, yes. It's a monumentally massive commitment for at least 18 years. But in my opinion, you can't pick and choose what part of it you fulfill your duties for. It's a whole package deal. If you can't handle that , then you are unfit to handle the task of raising a child.

Obviously, single/widowed parents are excused from this. But if you can't handle a child and do that which is necessary to rear them up, do them and yourself a favor, and put them up for adoption.

You can change my view by proving to me why it is less important, or rather completely unnecessary to earn your child's respect and love, and more important to simply feed, clothe and house them, and provide for their education.

TL;DR : A parent is their child's first friend, as well as a guide/leading hand. The responsibility to be someone they can trust, love, and enjoy being around is just as important as keeping them safe, educating them, teaching them responsibility/accountability, and providing for their basic human needs."

414,2022-12-27,CMV: The biggest reason why people find math so hard is because it is being taught wrong and we need to revise the way we teach it.,u/Drillix08,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zwltv6/cmv_the_biggest_reason_why_people_find_math_so/,changemyview,"Of all the subjects in school, math is often considered the hardest and most hated one by students, and to be honest I can't blame them. It's not the most intuitive subject for everyone to understand and people end up getting confused by it causing them a lot of stress. When that's the only experience you ever have with math, it makes sense as to why you'd end up hating it. This, in my opinion, has led to people believing that math is either something that you're either smart enough to understand or you aren't. But I believe this largely is due to the subject being taught in a way that doesn't consider things enough from the perspective of the student.

The first problem I have with the way math is being taught is that it throws too many random symbols at people without explaining what they are. Let's say that you're trying to explain how a derivative works. The general concept isn't all that complicated, if the equation is a variable raised to a power for example 2x\^3, you simply multiply the base number by the power and subtract 1 from the exponent afterwards, so the derivative of 2x\^3 would be (2 \* 3)x\^(3-1) = 6x\^2. The problem is that these concepts are often explained by using all these crazy math symbols so instead you instead may see it written like this: f(x) = 2x\^3, d/dx(f(x)) = 6x\^2. What I just wrote was the exact same thing but using math symbols.

While you're trying to explain how a derivative works, students are now confused as to what d/dx means, and having other symbols like f(x) mixed in doesn't help with that. You a took a very simple concept and overcomplicated it by putting in symbols without explaining what they meant. If you want to make it easier to understand you need to explain it using layman's terms, because unnecessary use of math symbols like that will just confuse people and distract them from the point you're trying to get across. To best explain a mathematical concept you should explain it as much as possible using words, metaphors, or other math concepts they already understand, and if you have to use a math symbol, first explain as clearly as possible what the symbol is and what it represents. Maybe explain the concept before introducing the symbol used to represent it, because being able to understand and solve problems that use symbols can sometimes be a separate skill that requires extra practice on top of understanding the concept they represent.

The second problem I have with the way math is being taught is that it encourages people to just memorize stuff as opposed getting them to really understand the material. A lot of times math is taught by throwing a concept at people, and making them memorize how to do it, or they may end up choosing to memorize it due to not understanding it. Math should not be something that you just ""memorize"" how to do, or at least not to the extent that it's done.

How often have you had to memorize all these step by step rules on how to solve some kind of problem while having zero clue on what it is you're trying to solve and why the stuff you're doing works? When teaching the material, you can't just explain the steps on how to do a problem, you also need to explain at least within reason, the question the problem is asking and why the steps you're doing solves whatever question you are trying to answer. Sure It's a lot easier and faster to just tell people the rules and formulas and make them memorize them, but if they don't know why they're doing them it'll be a lot easier for them to forget them. If they understand some kind of logic behind the rules, then they can always refer back to it in their heads if to make sure they are doing things correctly. I'll admit it will be a bit harder and take longer for them to understand things at first but once they do understand it, they will retain the info for much longer.

What also doesn't help is that the tests are designed in a way in which memorization is always a valid strategy. Since I believe that understanding the material should also involve knowing the logic behind the methods, tests should also have questions in which you have to briefly explain to some degree why the methods work, whether in words or with math symbols, as long as the logic behind it is simple enough for students to understand.

While I do believe there are some people who have more analytical minds that naturally give them an advantage over other people, to say that math itself something that is something that you either are able to understand or not is very much not true. I'm not here to blame teachers as it's not the easiest job and most of them do actually care about trying to teach kids stuff in a way that's interesting and understandable. I think we just need a change in the standards for how math should be taught because right now it's very flawed and unfriendly to those who aren't the best at intuitively grasping it. If the standards were revised to fit some of things I've mentioned, then I believe there'd be a lot of kids who will realize that they can in fact do math."
0,2022-12-27,CMV: Majority of the « High Functioning Autists » diagnosed nowadays do not have autism,u/Impossible_Active271,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zwm4y5/cmv_majority_of_the_high_functioning_autists/,changemyview,"Even though today autism is considered a spectrum, most autists can be identified as having one of the three main following types of ASD:

\- The classic autists, formerly called « low functioning autists » who have very important cognitive and social impairments. They are usually in facilities or taken care of at home because those impairments make it impossible for them to be autonomous.

\- The formerly called « Asperger’s » or « autistic savants ». They are people with savant syndrome (incredible abilities in at least one task/domain) who have a social impairment that can be important to moderate, but will still be recognized by non-autists as being clearly atypical (speech intonation or prosody for example).

\- The formerly called « high functioning autists » who have a high IQ without savant syndrome but still with a clearly atypical cognitive functioning, and some social impairment from moderate to barely noticeable - although it remains difficult to completely hide it from non-autists.

The people this post is about always fall into the third type, since it is the mildest form of ASD. Let me explain further: I have seen a lot of people in the past 20 years who started seeking diagnosis for ASD. Majority of them have a high IQ but without any sort of atypical cognitive functioning, no savant ability and sometimes not even a single field in which they excel or are particularly interested in, no obsession, no sensory processing disturbances, no social impairment whatsoever that you couldn’t find in neurotypical people (yes it’s normal to not understand relationships, in fact it’s a core problem of humanity as a whole). My point being the following: these people mistake the social dimension of autism with what are simply personality traits (being introverted, not liking change, having niche interests and non-mainstream tastes), and mistake high intellectual capabilities (high IQ) with a radically different cognitive functioning. There are also a lot of socio-cultural biases to take into consideration in regards to the diagnosis: many people have, in fact, very restricted interests. We just don’t see it because it is accepted in our culture: many overly-gendered people will have as only interests football and cars (for men), fashion &amp; domestics (for women). But we tend to discard those as symptomatic much more than for someone with video games &amp; computers as their restricted interests. Difficulties with interpersonal relationships are also vastly cultural (toxic workplace/school, rejection from a community because of a gender identity or sexual orientation, the incel phenomenon, etc) and/or can be the result of many disorders, such as personality disorders (borderline, antisocial, avoidant, narcissistic, etc), or simply the result of personality (some people are non-pathological jerks nobody wants to be around unless it is necessary).

What I mean, in regard to this socio-cultural dimension and the superficial traits of ASD sold by mainstream media, is that if these are the only traits we look for to diagnose ASD, then there are entire fields and sociocultural groups for which everybody ends up on the spectrum. I work with a lot of people who graduated from Ivy League-like schools (not American), people with PhDs, and also people working in STEM fields. I can tell you that 99% of them, including myself, fall into the third type of ASD if you take out the specific cognitive aspect of ASD and the noticeability of the social impairment. To give you examples that you can understand without knowing the people in my close circle, you can make that same observation with some celebrities and their armchair diagnosis of ASD such as Elon Musk and Tim Burton (absolutely no aversion to change - quite the opposite, no verbal communication issue - quite the opposite, no savant ability, etc). In fact, we know from a number of studies that instead of ASD, there is a tendency for successful business-people to have a high IQ with antisocial and narcissistic personality disorder traits ; and for successful artists to have a high IQ with borderline and narcissistic personality disorder traits and/or mood disorders (of course, this tendency just means « more than the average person »).

To me, this problem goes way beyond cringe teenagers who fake stimming on TikTok for views. At the core of this shift in the recognition of the mildest possible form of autism, or plain misdiagnosing, ASD itself loses its meaning as a defined syndrome with specific etiologies, treatments and prognosis. In other words, it makes ASD completely irrelevant to both clinicians and researchers.

EDIT: since people ask for studies

At the same time, they take continued military exercises conducted by the US and South Korea as threats as well and threaten more launches each time.

As these threats continue and are used to fund their ever depleting economy, I believe the best way to combat these threats of aggression is to become more committed to protecting South Korea and isolating North Korea along with increased communication with China that it would be in their best interest to discontinuing their funding and protection if possible and work with the US on this.

North Korea has no incentive to attack anybody unless they are physically attacked first, since any effort to attack another sovereign country would effectively end the Kim dictatorship. The US also has no reason to attack North Korea over their threats, but should beef up their presence in the region to show they are not kow-towing to North Koreas continued missile launches.

We have tried the diplomacy effort under the Trump admin to no avail and North Korea also acknowledges that giving up their nuclear capabilities essentially ends their ability to be taken seriously as a threat. Since those two options are non-negotiable, the US should continue to become more of a thorn in the North Koreas side in order to show that there is no hope for the North Korean regime by continuing these missile launches"

However, this technology is very new, easily accessible to all, and there hasn't been any research on the potential repercussions. Here are a few examples:

Early Education: Learning how to convert your thoughts and opinions into written language is one of the key parts of developing a young brain. ChatGPT has the potential to negate that need from hundreds of millions of students virtually overnight. 

Artistic writing (songs, scripts, poems): The market for writers is already very competitive due to globalization. For a current example, an English speaking writer in any country can compete with those in the US for the same script work, while being able to charge a fraction of the cost. ChatGPT could cause catastrophic damage to this market and these people's livelihoods.

Machine language: If even a small % of  normal human communication becomes powered by AI tech such as ChatGPT, humanity will begin to lose it's ""human touch"". We could potentially be starting down a road that ends like many sci-fi dystopian stories. 

ChatGPT seems like progress for the sake of progress. What does society gain from releasing this potentially dangerous technology? I am far from an expert, but it's seem like no one has the answer to this question.

Update: after reading (and responding to) many of your comments I have a better understanding of the core issue here. Regulation and safeguards exist with virtually every technology: social media, banking and asset management, web searching, etc. However, those technologies were, for the most part, A. regulated during the development stage or B. regulated as the access to them and popularity of them grew. ChatGPT /AI has been around for a few years, but is in the very early stages of development. Collectively people understand a miniscule portion of what we will come to understand 10, 15 years from now. However, about 6.5 billion people currently have access to this very powerful technology. I don't understand why people are so concerned with slowing down the rollout of this technology so that some safeguards can be put in place to avoid unnecessary consequences. Unfortunately, if this comment thread is a proxy for our society, it seems this freight train will continue to run away regardless."
3,2022-12-27,"CMV: Regarding the Malice at the Palace (2004), Ben Wallace, not Ron Artest, should have been suspended for the rest of the season.",u/BONERR4EVER,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zwoq3w/cmv_regarding_the_malice_at_the_palace_2004_ben/,changemyview," I watched the footage of the infamous Malice at the Palace in 2004.

It  all started when Ron Artest fouled Ben Wallace as he was going for a  layup. Ben Wallace responds by shoving Ron Artest as hard as he can.

THIS  is what gets the crowd riled up. Tempers are still hot, and because a  lot of tempers are hot, mob mentality comes into play.

This  is the same mob mentality, MAYBE mixed with improper serving of  alcohol, that resulted in a fan (John Green) throwing a Diet Coke at Ron Artest, when all he was trying to do was calm down amidst all of the unnecessary chaos.

Then another fan (Charlie Haddad) decides to make his way onto the court, only to get  punched by Ron Artest and possibly another unnamed court-stormer to  almost die at the hands of Jermaine O'Neal.

While Ron should not have ran into the stands to attack a spectator, this all stems from Ben Wallace acting disproportionately to a simple foul. If  ANYONE should have been suspended 86 games, it should have been Ben Wallace."

44,2022-12-27,CMV: Affirmative Action in publicly-funded colleges is discriminatory,u/lost_in_waynard,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zwrx0t/cmv_affirmative_action_in_publiclyfunded_colleges/,changemyview,"Affirmative action allows universities to sometimes admit students with lesser scores than other students with higher scores by focusing on the race of the applicants. I have seen a lot of discussion to justify this kind of racial selection of applications but I don’t agree with any of them and find that regardless of the reasoning, the practice is discriminatory and should be illegal. Here are some arguments I can present to support my view:
1. Some view AA as correcting historical injustice. If indeed that is the case, then it should not favor Hispanics as disproportionately as it does and should also focus on when the applicant families landed in the country before attempting a brushstroke correction of a historical wrong.
2. Some view it as making the case for fairness — a black kid for example might have struggled more than a white kid. If fairness is the intent, then it should factor socioeconomic status before race, as a disadvantaged white kid born to a very poor family may have struggled more than a wealthy black kid who received private education. 
3. The trickiest argument I see is the case for promoting diversity. The intent is to promote a more richly diverse college experience for everyone who is admitted, a diverse community being sometimes viewed as more important than merit-based (where merit is measured using universally standard tools of test scores and GPA) for a variety of reasons. Promoting diversity over merit to me seems like a subjective argument. There is research to back both schools of thought. Some people argue then that it is the university’s choice to exercise one over the other, like selecting a less skilled drummer as a band member over a better guitarist based on their individual needs. 
The challenge I have with this view is that the band is often a private entity and is allowed to place its own selfish interests first. The same shouldn’t be applied to publicly-funded institutes that rely on tax money to operate. When an institute chooses to accept public money for its operations, they also have a need to uphold the public interests. Just as other public institutions like Health agencies or firefighters are not allowed to discriminate between two races for disbursement of public services, then same argument should thus also apply to these universities which are funded by public money. Yet they continue to turn meritorious members of the public away by relying on flimsy arguments for diversity. 

Imagine that one city only has one fire truck and a call came in for the truck for an emergency in a fancy penthouse apartment. Just as the truck is enroute to service the fire emergency, another call comes in from a more diverse and disadvantaged apartment within the neighborhood, would the fire station be justified to reroute the truck to service this other building (whose call came in later) in the interest of maintaining neighborhood diversity or fairness?"
93,2022-12-27,CMV: The drug currently used in lethal injection is cruel and unusual punishment. Death by K-hole from a ketamine overdose is already established as a humane form of euthanasia and should be used instead.,u/altinit,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zwsk1y/cmv_the_drug_currently_used_in_lethal_injection/,changemyview,"Personally I'm opposed to the death penalty altogether, but if we're going to have it at all... can we at least refrain from having the method of execution be a horrifically brutal punishment in itself? Are we not already serving a just punishment by giving these prisoners a decade of appeals to reflect on their actions before subjecting them to their execution?

For those who believe the process of lethal injection is humane and a relatively peaceful way to go, I suggest you look into the process. It's a death often so awful it belongs in horror fiction. [Last Week Tonight with James Oliver did an episode on it](https://youtu.be/0lTczPEG8iI) that really opened up my eyes. Most people aren't going to be willing to watch a 20 minute video on the subject, [so here is an article providing some insight](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/committees/death_penalty_representation/publications/project_blog/oklahoma-federal-judge-declares-lethal-injection-drug-constitutional/#:~:text=According%20to%20Dr.,%2C%20drowning%2C%20and%20asphyxiation.%E2%80%9D)

It's a 3 drug process. The first drug, in theory, should be an anesthetic that knocks the inmate unconscious to go painlessly and simply never wake up. In reality, however, the first drug (midazolam) does not prevent consciousness and provides no form of pain relief. The second drug (Pavulon) causes complete paralysis without affecting the inmates cognition, so they can be in unfathomable distress with immeasurable pain with no possible way to express it. The third drug, potassium chloride, allegedly feels like fire injected into the veins causing immense agony and excruciating pain. It is not an immediate death, and due to it being illegal for medical professionals to be involved in the process, botched injections are an incredibly common occurrence.

A ketamine overdose, AKA how we commonly put our beloved pets to sleep, will send a human into cardiac arrest no differently than it would another animal. A death sentence via lethal injection intends to execute the inmate with cardiac arrest being the cause of death. The condemned inmate is already facing the punishment of death, so I see no reason to not offer them the same hospitality we do a dog who has killed a child and must be euthanized. A ketamine overdose seems like a much more interesting and humane way to go."

As stated above I feel like I have no reason to be vegan. For some reason veganism is intriguing to me, and I can’t figure out why. I’m going to split my argument into two
Why I don’t want to be vegan: 
The social stigma for vegans is immense, there is often very limited vegan options, I enjoy meat and animal products, and I am very picky.
Why I don’t need to be vegan:
Veganism is supposedly rooted in ethics. But how is it unethical to use a resource. Animals are just that a resource. Some are emotional support (how cats are basically stuffed animals on steroids), some are cool to watch (birds and penguins for instance) and some are tasty/useful. I don’t find pleasure in hurting animals but I also see no reason to be opposed to animals being harmed. It seems tantamount to saying not to trample a floor because your hurting the floor. Just because animals have a physiological reaction to being “hurt” doesn’t mean it’s wrong to exploit/kill them. 

In conclusion, there is nothing wrong with the choice to eat animals or not. I have nothing against vegans for their choice to not use animals/animal products anymore than I have against people who choose to not eat certain foods because they taste bad. However, a reasonable courtesy would be to not harass/argue with people for eating meat unless they broach the subject. 
Additional context: I was vegetarian for like a month and realised how moronic my choice was at least for me.

0,2022-12-28,CMV: Aether/Lumine from Genshin Impact has higher chance of joining Smash than Master Chief,u/Lionfranky,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zx3ahl/cmv_aetherlumine_from_genshin_impact_has_higher/,changemyview,"I've played both Genshin Impact and Halo series extensively to understand both candidates although I stopped playing Genshin after finishing Inazuma storyline.

Even though I prefer Master Chief to Genshin Travelers as a potential figther, here are reasons why the duo have better chance at joining Smash, be it potential DLC for Ultimate or Deluxe edition or next Smash.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Genshin is popular world wide. It's become massive hit even in Japan. [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/business/genshin-impact-china-japan.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/16/business/genshin-impact-china-japan.html)  
While Halo does have some cult following there with certain fans going far as protesting against Japanese Master Chief's voice actor change, it pales in comparison to Genshin there. Nintendo is a Japanese company, so it prefers series that have strong footing in its homeland. 
2. Genshin Impact is not showing any sign of decline. At this rate, it will have aged fine by the time Nintendo announces next Smash. On the other hand, Halo has major issues and shakedown within its studio. While Halo Infinite still manages to be at top 20 of Xbox chart, that's still not enough to compare to Genshin. 
3. Both Genshin Impact and Halo are not on Nintendo system, but Switch version of Genshin Impact was announced a while ago. That's another incentive for Nintendo promote Genshin via Smash. On the other hand, all the smoke and gun regarding Game Pass Switch have been for nothing."

0,2022-12-28,CMV: Representation in media is not important,u/HojaLateralus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zx7xn6/cmv_representation_in_media_is_not_important/,changemyview,"So obviously I'm going to be flogged for this as a white European dude, but I don't buy into the idea of representation (especially racial one) in fictional media being important, especially when it's in detriment to the end product. I believe creative vision of the authors and consistency of the world is more important and authors should have the freedom to create the world they want. I want to avoid specific examples because it would move the discussion to that particular show. But for example, I don't see a reason to see a white person in a show that takes place in Japan, especially if existence of such white person would be immersion breaking and unbelievable. That same way I don't think there should be Japanese people put into European or European-inspired worlds.  
I'm not AGAINST the idea of representation in general. I think it's cool that we have shows about black people, latino people, white people and so on. Also many video games have option to create your own character and that's fine too (as long as it fits the world). I just don't like the idea of token characters that don't fit the world put there for reasons not entirely known for me (financial? propaganda?).  
I'll adress the common counter-arguments:  
1. But this show has dragons and magic, why do you care about black people lol?  
Just because show has supernatural elements doesn't mean it shouldn't be logically consistent and immersive. If the show is inspired by European folklore and there's no particular plot reason to have characters of other races there, there shouldn't be any as it breaks immersion. Because when your best mode of transport was a horse or a cart (if you had money!) or on foot people didn't really travel far, 90% of people stayed within few miles of their home and others travelled mostly for trade or diplomacy and not that far.  
2. You're just a racist and hate black/latino/asian people!  
If you do think that there's nothing I can say to convince you, but I'm truly not. It's a matter of immersion and believability and I don't want to see obvious pandering. That goes for my race too, I wouldn't like to see an out-of-place white dude in a show about 1200's Ethiopia or Greenland or heavily asian-inspired fictional realm. That being said I think the more visually striking the difference the more problem I have. So for example I can see myself having more problem seeing a black woman playing in japanese show than a white woman (because the difference is not as striking, especially when you're smart with makeup and lighting, say Scarlett Johanson in Ghost in the Shell reboot), the same way I think I wouldn't mind if middle-eastern person would play in an African show but blazingly pale white person would feel out of place.  
3. You only feel that way because you're wh\*te and all culture panders to you  
I'll agree that it may be a factor, obviously, but I never complained or felt the need to complain about ""lack of white people in X"" which sometimes happen with other people. I can play games with female main character and it's still fun. Also many people enjoy other cultures, like white people enjoying anime. I can enjoy a piece of media without any white people in it and not feel bad about it, while I think some people feel insulted about some all-white media or non-minorities media."

0,2022-12-28,CMV: We have to build in the Greenbelt (Ontario) if we want affordable housing in Ontario.,u/EatMyBalcony,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zx9s32/cmv_we_have_to_build_in_the_greenbelt_ontario_if/,changemyview,"Housing in Toronto is unaffordable. I agree with a lot of the conventional arguments about how we need to be building denser, less car-dependent, missing middle, better zoning, down with strodes, and think a lot of progress can be made on those fronts from an infrastructure point of view. This can all help and while different people have different ideas on what type of housing should be built, I rarely see the arguments that building less housing or restricting supply in some way will help with the affordability problem. **I am trying to focus on the “increasing housing has to go somewhere” part of this instead of the “is this actually affordable/predatory real estate, economic etc.” issues because that’s a whole other thing.**

If you can't afford to live in Toronto and the [Golden Horseshoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horseshoe) and you previously or currently live(d) here and want to maintain friendships, family visits, or have traditions and favourite places, you likely want to be within a reasonable distance, and if you drew some sort of belt around this area “a reasonable distance” from it, and coloured it green, we arrive at our problem.
Many of the small towns in Ontario you have never heard of [have 15-30% or higher population growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_population_centres_in_Ontario) from 2016-2021, and the places you have heard of like King City, Nobleton, Caledon, Stouffville, Orangeville, Bradford, etc. surrounding Toronto are all in the middle of the Greenbelt. If you look at the housing they are building in many of these towns and “cities” they are now getting low-mid rise apartment buildings, town-house developments, and even the semi-detached and detached houses are tightly packed into new ""developments"" close to town because installing things like sewers and power is expensive. Many of us would agree that housing in those communities is either already unaffordable, or on its way to becoming so, increasing the can’t afford to stay, so I have to move away problem, fueling the expansion of smaller communities in “less developed” AKA wild, natural, and often environmentally significant places.

If you drove up there over the holidays, many of the roads are one lane in either direction through countryside and farmland, and there are significantly more people using them than there was even 5 years ago. I understand the increased-supply increases-demand traffic problem, but when you put 100 houses in a development down a farm road, all over the place, eventually you need to improve the infrastructure accessing all of those homes. 
I grew up on the edge of one of those small towns, and a significant number of the memories I have being a kid/teenager were with friends “exploring wild land” that was close enough to our homes that we could get there by walking/biking. Almost all of those places are housing developments now, because our town has grown by 1-3 thousand people, if you consider the developments technically not inside town boundaries. It makes me sad that my memories have been paved over, but how do you add that many people to a town if you don’t build housing for them?
I agree we need to be protecting land/wetlands/watersheds/and wild areas, and a significant amount of that land is agricultural land that is also very significant, (food shortage tangent?) but how do we build more homes and the roads to access them in more affordable Greenbelt places without you know, building/developing in the Greenbelt? 

""Build up not out"" is what's happening in a lot of these places, but they still need land for that building to happen on and if there wasn't a building there before, it had to be ""green"" land of some form or another like farm land, forest, or just ""wild"". If you build houses for people, then you need to build things like roads and the highways people are concerned about destroying the natural land up there, but we can't have it both ways.

We have to build in the Greenbelt to increase availability of affordable housing. If we don't, where else is it going to go? CMV"

0,2022-12-28,CMV:Feminism is a poorly chosen word for the movement it represents in the modern world,u/retardedlobster,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zxe4my/cmvfeminism_is_a_poorly_chosen_word_for_the/,changemyview,"First I want to get one thing out the way: men are privileged relative to women, and women are generally speaking subject to more discrimination, and experience more negatives as a result of their gender, than men. I consider myself a feminist. I am a white man, and I acknowledge my privilege.

That being said, it should also be acknowledged that in certain areas men are disadvantaged due to their gender: generally doing more dangerous jobs, risk for conscription, lack of acknowledgement of their emotions from an early age.

Modern feminism (as I have gathered from speaking to friends more familiar with the literature and theory than me) acknowledges that, and not only fights for womens rights but also mens rights by addressing issues such as the ones i raised above.

In that case, feminism is a poorly chosen name as I believe that many men who should benefit from modern feminism (as it directly influences their lives too in a positive way through attempting to resolve the issues i raised previously) will be put off by a name which they feel does not represent them. I understand the historical context of why the name exists, but believe that to be a separate one from whether the name is useful or well chosen in 2022. I believe that a movement like ""equalitarinism"" would allow for more people to associate with the movement than now. Ideally, it would have another name."
0,2022-12-28,CMV: Right-wing ideologies are more intellectually diverse than left-wing ideologies,u/NectarineSome5400,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zxea53/cmv_rightwing_ideologies_are_more_intellectually/,changemyview,"Thought I might make a little political post here, but a more fun + friendly one than might typically be seen. My argument is that there is a greater variance in righ-wing ideologies than in left-wing ones. This is not to say that there are ""more"" ideologies on the right, merely that said ideologies are more differentiated. Full disclosure, I am pretty far to the right (I most closely identify with the Traditionalist school), so I'm fully aware that my understanding of leftist thought might be a bit limited. 

On the left, most ideologies are united by the abolishment of hierarchies and of class warfare.  From what I understand, pretty much every leftist ideology can trace its roots back to Marx in one way or another. A notable exception would be progressive liberalism, though while it is not ""leftist"" in the traditional sense, it is still highly influenced by leftist thought (namely the Frankfurt school and its ideological descendants). From my perspective, leftist and left-leaning ideologies are generally guided by the same, or similar, starting principles: materialism (I suppose one could see the hippie movement and its derivatives as an exception to this), ""history as progression"", and egalitarianism, to give some of the major examples. As you go further left, it tends to be the means of applying those principles that become more extreme, rather than the principles themselves changing.

Contrast this with right-wing thought. There is some cases where there is a similar type of ""progression"" with respect to the right. For example, one could look at conservatism, libertariamism, and anarcho-capitalism, as a sort of ""progression"" along the same principles. And, admittedly, those are fairly popular ideologies amongst the right. However, unlike the left, there are many ideological schools of thought which have altogether different principles. Some examples:

- **Fascism/National Socialism and its derivatives:** Right-wing collectivist ideology, unlike ""typical"" conservatives. Influenced by the likes of Nietzche, Schmitt, and Sorel to name a few. Very much a ""forward-thinking"" and ""revolutionary"" form of rightist thought.

- **Monarchists:** fairly diverse group in and of itself. Ranges from constitutional monarchists (who I would argue are generally conservatives with a twist- though one of my closest IRL friends is a constitutional monarchist who is extremely progressive) to more hard-line authoritarian monarchists. A lot of overlap here with other ideologies.

- **NRx/Dark Enlightenment:** the likes of Nick Land and Curtis Yarvin. Similar to fascism in the sense that it is a ""forward-thinking"" form of rightist thought. Aside from the ""accelerationist"" aspect (which one can see in leftists as well), they generally advocate for some form of populist authoritarianism, such as corporatism.

- **Christian Nationalists:** Also fairly diverse, but united in that their principles come from Christianity. Surprisingly popular amongst young people, probably due to the likes of Nick Fuentes and that whole group. 

- **Perennial Traditionalists:** Schizoids like me. Starting principle is that there is a primordial tradition from which all religions are derived to some extent. Believes we are in an age of collective spiritual decline (Kali Yuga is a Hindu term often thrown around). Influenced primarily by figures such as Spengler, Guenon, and Evola. Strong emphasis on mysticism and comparative religion. 

And then you have a whole bunch of right-wingers who mix and match some of these ideologies, or care about a sufficient issue so much that they are, by default, on the right (for example, ethnocentirsm). 

There are a few reasons why I think it is the case that the right is more intellectually diverse than the left. For example, the dynamic of ""egalitarianism vs hierarchy"" could provide some insight. Egalitarianism is a fairly monolithic overall goal, with most disagreements on the left seeming to stem from the means or practicality of achieving this goal. Even the most authoritarian of leftists are only authoritarian as a means to eventually abolish hierarchies altogether. The right, in contrast, is generally pro-hierarchy. Hierarchies can take many forms, guided by widely divergent principles. As an analogy, the lack of quantity is always 0, but the presence of quantity can be manifested by an infinite array of potential numbers. 

Anyways, looking forward for some fun discussion. Plus its a potential opportunity for me to learn about where various leftist ideologies differ from eachother. Hopefully things can be kept civil, even if there are a bunch of people who hate each other participating :)"

Their government sets a tone of brutality which carries down to the behavior of its people. Today I have a story to reinforce this.

My girlfriend of almost 2 years was born in Ukraine. Over this span of dating, I have listened to her and her parents first hand accounts of the injustices committed by Russians. My girlfriend speaks both Ukrainian and Russian and has been on the receiving end of extremely rude behavior by Russians in the past. I understand there is never a reason to group people as inherently good/bad, however there has been a consistent reinforcement of a negative stereotype.

Today, my girlfriend and I were shopping. We overheard a younger couple speaking Russian and loudly making rude comments about the staff at this store. My girlfriend translated their comments and it honestly made me mad. We made it back to my car and noticed the couple walking to theirs. The Russian boyfriend unloads his cart and aggressively pushes it away, almost hitting my car, leaving it in the middle of the lot. After everything I have seen from Russians, I snapped. I unrolled my window and yelled out what translates to “Russian Bitch”. I should not have said this and it was unwarranted, however the reaction I received next was batshit crazy.

I drove away not thinking anything of it. Soon enough, a car behind me is going twice my speed, laying on its horn. It's the Russian guy, who pulls in front of me, making me slam on my brakes. He gets out of his car and walks towards mine, ready to fight. I reverse quickly and after some time, eventually gets back in his car and drives away. I couldn’t believe what had happened, and that he escalated to that level.

Again, I admit what I did was cowardly and wrong, yet I can't think of any other culture/group of people that would escalate to that level of aggression.

Russian culture sucks, CMV."

Femcels?  Liberals?  Conservatives?  I think you should be able to block entire swaths of redditors by the subreddits they subscribe to.  The only way to escape these blocks would be to disassociate your account with any blocked subreddit.

Potential pros:

* Mental health
* It's more convenient than blocking hundreds of people one-by-one.
* I would guess most people wouldn't want to block the r/aww community, but the same wouldn't be true of the more controversial and socially volatile subreddits.  This could discourage redditors from participating in the more toxic subcommunities here.  A byproduct could be social pressure on entire communities to reduce overall toxicity.
* Toxic redditors could also block everyone they hate more easily, effectively doing the work for you.

Possible cons:

* Are there any?
* It may be a technical challenge, but as a software developer I believe it is possible.

Edit: to clarify to posters who may be confused, if you think that I am saying that I don't want to hear others' opinions, this is incorrect.  Please read this again and try to understand that the emphasis is on mental health and against toxicity.

Edit2: the arguments attempting to assert that this is in support of echo chambers are false and will be ignored.  Such assertions are far too loose.  Pick one: users who want to limit their exposure should get off the internet, or they want to live in an echo chamber.  You're arguing for both.  It's inconsistent, and obviously people who want to limit their exposure by getting off the internet are not necessarily doing so in support of echo chambers.

Edit3:  I wish someone could have applied reasoning here to actually change my view about how exactly social media should,  at least in theory, combat the detrimental effects of echo chambers.   Consensus was the best argument I encountered and this is unfortunately not sufficient for me. 

For anyone interested,  my argument to the contrary can be summarized as the following:  echo chambers are intellectual &amp; psychological phenomena, much more than concrete.  You are not creating an echo chamber every time you're alone.   To seek solitude or to get off the internet for mental health is not the same as creating an echo chamber.   An echo chamber is more of a collective state of mind that leads people to be closed off to new information, and that can be encouraged by belief systems.   It isn't always explicit beliefs that are responsible.  People can develop their own belief systems through repeated experience, and as I've been arguing, repeated interactions of a toxic nature can encourage people to be closed off to new information,  to be unreasonable and siloed.

That said, the repeated experience of being forced to hear unwanted views can yield the opposite of the intended effect if you're assuming that communication always combats toxic unreasonableness.  To me it's obvious.  To effectively combat echo chambers in my opinion, there's a balance to be reached somewhere between being closed off from communication, and being open to all communication and that balance cannot be forced without the opposite effect. It must be the product of self-regulation.  If social media doesn't reduce toxicity then it creates echo chambers through communication where users lack adequate control over their interactions online, and my idea, being an emulation of features of the real world that allow persons control over their surroundings, is designed to combat the furtherance of the state of mind that encourages the formation of siloed echo chambers.

Closing thoughts: freedom of speech does not refer to free speech.   Freedom applies to persons, and anything detracting from your freedom to choose, whether to speak, to listen, or to refuse, is counter to your freedoms."

It serves no purpose.

This came about after interacting with my family over the holidays. Now my family is highly educated. Both my parents have doctorate degrees, my siblings all went to Oxbridge or American Ivy League schools. They are, for all their faults, very capable of proper reasoning. Yet on any political issue they show zero willingness to engage in reasoned debate.

This is a trend I've seen amongst other conservatives online and in person. Transgender athletes? ""Ban them. They have an advantage. Testosterone advantage. Biological males!"" Even though no data agrees with their position. [Sabine Hossenfelder does a very good job at breaking down the topic](https://youtu.be/cZ9YAFYIBOU) but even with Thomas, who compared to the prior years winners was relatively average (and actually performed fairly average for a competitive swimmer in the event as a whole).

Healthcare? ""Privatise it!"" But why? It only sucks because the Tories have underfunded it. Privatisation has failed in America. It's a bad, expensive idea that will cost us more money than the NHS. ""But I don't want to pay for other people."" Then leave society. That's the only way you accomplish that goal.

It truly feels like they only care about how politics affects them and their predetermined biases/feelings, even if it is an objectively bad idea.

Now, I do admit my bias. I don't think any conservative has ever provided a convincing reason for their policy positions, only an explanation for why they hold said position (this isn't the same thing.... saying ""I believe this because"" is not an argument for my belief, it does not attempt to explain why *others* should agree with me). I also do believe conservatism is a net negative on society based on their positions."

First, it helps ease the burden of third, fourth, etc parties by keeping them competitive with the larger more established parties. 

Second, it's more representative of how the electorate wants to be governed. No candidate can win without a majority of support from their district/state/town.

Third, it ends the need for multiple voting sessions in places where run off elections are either possible or commonplace.

Fourth, it allows for an expansion of the overton window and an influx of new ideas when previously held positions of popular parties start to fail.

Fifth, it helps prevent ""gaming"" the system by strategically voting for a candidate you THINK will win instead of whom you desire.

Sixth, it eliminates the need for primary elections.

&amp;#x200B;

I find that the 4.0 scale leaves a lot of the students' academic work on the cutting room floor and presents them in a weird manner. 

A student can have a consistent  score of 89%, which equates to a B+, thus a 3.3 GPA.

*But* a student can have a consistent score of 90%, which equates to a A-, thus a 3.7 GPA. 

1% ( to \~5%) of a score in-class has the weight of about 10% on a 4.0 scale. 

And conversely, 88% has the same GPA value as a 89%.

90%= 3.7

1+/-

89%= 3.3

1+/-

88%= 3.3

This quantification is inconsistent, a student can increase their score by 1% and receive either a 0, 0.3, or 0.4 increase but decrease their score by 1% and receive a potentially different value change.  

 A subject that worsens this metric is when students request their professor to round up their grade (typically 89 to 90), as not everyone can benefit from a 1% boost no less have a professor who is willing to do so.

I simply think its inappropriate for a student to not be properly represented by the percentage they earned in-class. Students with a 3.7 aren't that different from those with a 3.3, but yet the scale appears to magnify their difference."

1) Can they do the job well

2) Can they get elected

3) Do they have our interests at heart

Celebrities obviously could get elected because they already have a reputation. And it really depends on the celebrity whether they have our interests at heart, but the benefit of being a celebrity is that a lot of their views and history are already public knowledge. So they do come from a privileged position,. but in my mind having so much knowledge available about them is a benefit that cancels that out. Now sure, some of the information about ther might be wrong, but people spread disinformation about all major politicians, so I'm not sure that that should be a factor.

Now, as far as whether they can do the job well, politicians can have a number of different roles including diplomacy, legislation and regulation, military, and inspirational. As public faces, many celebrities have some unique qualifications for diplomacy and inspirational attributes of the job. But let's be honest, no one person is qualified all on their own to do everything that the country has to do. So for military and legislative purposes, _the most important thing is to simply be smart enough to hire good advisors and to listen to them_. That is the most important thing a politician can do. And I believe that many people are smart enough to do that. 

How to CMV: prove that the cons outweigh the pros when a celebrity runs for major office.

How not to CMV: by saying that most celebrities don't have enough knowledge to be a good politician. As I already said, the most important part in making the law is having advisors who know what they are doing and to listen to them. Also saying that _some_  celebrities would be terrible politicians is not a good argument, because that is discounting d fact that there are many who could be good politicians, or the fact that there are many non-celebrity politicians who are terrible at the jobs.

Note: I am talking about major offices here, not small local offices. In local elections, celebrities can be an annoying juggernaut."

I'm also on the autism spectrum. I've gotten better in these fields over the years but I admit I still have work to do on them.

Some advice I received is to be upfront and honest with these issues, such as saying ""Hey, I struggle with boundaries/social cues, so please tell me if I'm going too far."" For a long time, I have disagreed with this advice and have never done that, for two main reasons:

1. I'm worried that it would be a turn-off for many people. I see this a lot on dating sites and elsewhere where people get turned off by trivial things such as height. So what if the same thing translates to real life, but with something less trivial than height? I worry that I would come off as some creep who has no respect for boundaries and actively refuses to address that issue, rather than someone who struggles in that area and genuinely wishes to become better at it. So I feel the need to try to hide these issues out of fear that my closest friends and other people would feel like they're becoming too close to a bad person.

2. Because of the advice that *no one owes you anything.* I first learned this advice when I was in middle school/high school when people blocked me on social media all the time due to incidents that were my fault. At the time I wondered why people wouldn't just tell me why they blocked me, and I soon discovered the advice ""no one owes you anything."" Since no one owes me anything, this means it would be useless to tell people ""Hey, tell me if I'm doing something that is making you uncomfortable"" because, again, no one owes me anything, and therefore they don't have to tell me if I'm making them uncomfortable. I'm left to fend for myself.

I would like to ask: Why is it acceptable to ask for answers/be honest in some situations (""Hey, I struggle with boundaries and social cues, so please tell me if I'm making you uncomfortable"") and not in others (""Why did you block me on Snapchat?!"")

13,2022-12-28,CMV: Natural talent is an important factor in one's success because talented people are more likely to end up spending more time working on their skills.,u/PNKRTN,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zxlqmi/cmv_natural_talent_is_an_important_factor_in_ones/,changemyview,"I don't think this opinion is too controversial, but I haven't really talked to people about it before, so it would be good to see how well it stands up to scrutiny.

There are three classes of statements that are often used as contradictions to/arguments against each other:

1. \[some measure of (natural) talent\] is strongly correlated with \[some measure of success\].
2. \[some measure of talent\] does not actually measure the skills directly needed for \[some measure of success\]
3. Hard work is more important than talent for \[some measure of success\].

I believe that in most cases all of these statements are *simultaneously* true, the reason being that talent and how much time someone has spent on their skills (i.e. ""hard work"") are strongly correlated.

\----------------

*Why this particular explanation?* I acknowledge there are other ways for all three statements to be true. Most people would just say that it requires *both* hard work and talent to be successful. But that effect does not seem strong enough, we need something that can explain just how strong the correlation in statement (1) usually is, given how unrelated the skills are (2), and how strong the effect in (3) also is. I think the best possible explanation of why all three of these statements are true is that ""hard work"" is correlated with talent.

*Why would people with talent also work on their skills more in the first place?* Having talent usually makes it easier and more enjoyable to work on a skill. At any one point in their lives a person has to make a choice between doing a number of tasks. With talent, a smaller amount of effort towards learning something can lead to a greater reward, and hence learning about/practicing one's skills would be a more attractive decision to make at any time. So people with talent would naturally have more of an incentive to spend more time on their skills.

(Note: I find the idea that ""smart people spend more time on their skills because it's smart to prepare for the future"" somewhat silly. It is another argument for this, though definitely not *my* choice of argument. If anything, please do not mistake my argument for this.)

\--------------

How to CMV:

1. Showing evidence/argument that work ethic isn't correlated with talent would CMV.
2. Finding plausible alternate explanations for why all three of the statements mentioned above would CMV.
3. I believe that while it's not *always* correct, this arguments means that it is reasonable to (in the absence of any evidence to the contrary) assume that someone has a better work ethic if they have natural talent. Explaining why this assumption would be *factually* wrong, maybe in some specific but common context/situation would CMV.
4. Perhaps weaker, but if the *language* I use to describe something is not the best way to convey the intended idea, pointing that out would CMV.

I believe that the [smiley killer conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley_face_murder_theory) is just that, a conspiracy.

The FBI, local police, county police, and prosecutors all say it's a bogus idea that spreads misinformation.

But still, the conspiracy is alive and well. (Especially on Facebook, and the subreddit[. Smiley face killer](https://www.reddit.com/r/SmileyFaceKiller/))

The fact that smiley face graffiti is super common does not mean a person who died there was murdered and the smiley face is a calling card.

The other issue I have with it is how no one has been caught yet. If it were a group of serial killers, as claimed, someone would have spilled the beans by now.

Also, people do crazy things when drunk. Most of these college students who drowned had a crazily high BAC count.

Change my view on why the smiley face killer conspiracy is real and that is why young college students are not accidentally drowning and were indeed murdered.

Edit 29 December 2022 at 0310.  My view is now mostly changed. Right now, I think there are some drownings that most likely were murdered while others were accidental drownings. "

So there are three levels of scrutiny a government action typically faces.

On the bottom you have rational basis, just any rational reason, its a low bar. The government must have some legitimate reason, and there has to be some reason behind the policy and goal, and some reason to believe the connection between the policy furthers that furthers the goal. It doesm't even have to be proven. 

On top you have strict scrutiny which is all the no, like don't even try, strict scrutiny is strict in name, impossible in practice. Strict scrutiny has 2/3 elements. First is that a compelling government interest, second is narrowly tailored, third is least restrictive means. As to the first element it must be of utmost importance. Like dying. This is typically not the issue. Second is that whatever policy proposed that is infringing on the right or discriminating on the suspect class, it must be narrowly tailored, setup to have the minimum burden and negative impact, such that, third, its the least restrictive means, that there is no other way to accomplish the goal, and if such other means exists, the government must show why it doesn't work and arguably try it out first. SCOTUS treats it as 3 different elements, but typically 2 and 3 collapse into one in practice.


In the middle you have intermediate scrutiny. All governmental actions at minimum must pass rational basis. To discriminate on the basis of race is theoretically possible, just really, really difficult, since it must pass strict scrutiny. I won't go into what constitutes strict scrutiny because its not really important to this. Discrimination on sex however, is much easier to do because its under intermediate scrutiny.

For context: I will ignore the existence of gender, because sex and gender line up for the overwhelming majority of people, gender doesn't really legally exist in as much as its not recognized as a distinct, protected class on a federal level, the law seems to use sex and gender synonymously for the most part. Ex Bostock v Clayton County. I'm aware State laws do exist, but supremacy clause renders that an unimportant detail. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ERA would raise protected class of sex from intermediate scrutiny to strict scrutiny, based on the identical language of the ERA to the 14th Amendment.  

&amp;#x200B;

And then this is where all hell breaks loose.

&amp;#x200B;

Because now its illegal for the government to discriminate on the basis of sex at all, and this also extends to things funded by the government or sponsored by the government. 

So, women only shelters are out. Women's scholarships are out. Sex based affirmative action is (probably) out\* (see the pending results of Students for Fair Admissions v Harvard). 

And just in case this needs to be pointed out, having sex separated restrooms is permissible because it does follow Equal Protection. Equal Protection doesn't mean no discrimination is allowed, it just means you have to treat all A's like A's and all B's like B's. If the basis to distinguish between A's and B's are not really a genuine, substantial, relevant difference (such as a pretextual reason), then that discrimination is illegal. In that case, both A's and B's are just really A's, and the law cares about what it is, not what you call it.


Edit:1
Now to finish with the sex stuff, moving on the political stuff.

The left tends to believe in general that our society is unequal and that people can face advantages or disadvantages based on how society treats them based on certain characteristics.

One such group would be women, and therefore there are certain policies that to do discriminate on sex, but are supposed to ameliorate inequality.

The ERA would strike down these policies, and therefore, from the left's perspective, would be a bad thing.

Edit2: added paragraphs, explained a bit more on the levels of scrutiny (fun fact which Rudy Guliani forgot about, which is like day 1 of law school).

Edit3: I'd also like to point out in race, separate but equal is not tolerated, so that would also suggest seperate but equal shouldn't be tolerated for sex.

Perhaps an argument can genuinely be made that sex is different from race. I don't think so since both are immutable characteristics one is born with. But perhaps in the domestic violence shelter context, the domestic violence part makes it factually different enough, such that seperate but equal domestic violence shelters would be permissible.

Y'all downvoters don't realize I have a point. I see no one is defending separate but equal...."

You're honestly not missing much. Anyway, I've never really understood the social appeal for teens and young adults to crash parties and get high/drunk/wasted af throughout college... or even high school. Like, it's not legal.

[It might be tempting,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOMO), but from personal experience I can tell you it's not worth it. If you're feeling tempted, reach out to your school's counseling department (and honestly, there are many big party schools you might want to avoid, like Lehigh, Penn State, or Arizona State). Already a party animal? Just don't be one anymore. Tell your ""friends"" sorry, I can't come, I have a lot of homework... and maybe reevaluate if they should still be your friends. It's not the end of the world if you've screwed up in the past, just remember that only you can make more positive decisions going forward.

In the end, you'll consider yourself lucky that you didn't end up like your less fortunate peers who end up in jail, the hospital, or the graveyard/cremation urn down the road. There are so many other ways you can have fun as a college student: clubs, religious groups, going to the gym... heck, even just studying is fun for many people. Why ruin the entire rest of your life over peer pressure?

Now, I understand that some may argue that parties are a normal and even necessary part of the college experience, and that cracking down on them would be overbearing and unrealistic. Well, how about you decide? You can make all the not-so-smart decisions you want, and in the end, the law is the law.

But that’s also part of the point.  

When I lived in Germany, they used speed cameras. Cops could still pull you over but it was rare. Some cameras were in fixed locations so if you lived there, you always knew where they were. They’d also set up temporary cameras in random spots so it was impossible to predict. The camera was of course equipped with a speed radar and would snap a picture of you if you were speeding past it. You’d even see the bright camera flash and think “fuck, they got me”. They’d look up the address associated with your plates and you’d get a ticket in the mail with your picture on it, how fast you were clocked, where, and what the speed limit was. Then you just pay it by mail or phone or online or whatever.  

Benefits:  
- Easier to catch speeders. More tickets, more revenue for the community. That or it’s better at encouraging the community to mind their speed more often, not just when they see cops.
- Doesn’t interrupt your day at all. Doesn’t make you late to work and sure as hell won’t get in the way of someone rushing a woman in labor to the hospital.  
- Less speeding stops by cops means less police interaction, therefore less incidents of police violence. It’s also one less way they can use racial profiling.  
- If multiple people are street racing, or speeding as a group for some other reason, *everyone* gets caught, not just whoever gets pulled over by the one police car on scene."

It’s a rather mechanical process by which a computer program translates a string of text and some random noise into an image.  It kind of seems like the program has a mind, because we have never seen something besides a human mind interpret text into an image in this way, but as we get used to it we will recognize that this is more of a parlor trick than an expression of artistic creativity and intent.  A very fancy parlor trick, but a trick none the less.  


Further evidence which I believe to support my view:


1. Compelling images are not necessary art, if they do not evoke an emotional response.  For instance, we would not classify a company’s logo as art, because it is lacking artistic intent.  

2. Things which are beautiful and evoke emotion are not art if they lack artistic intent.  For instance, a sunset, or a rock formation, or a plant which grows in a fractal pattern may be beautiful and affect the mind in an art-like way, but we don’t call it art because it’s essentially just a result of math and physics and not human expression. AI images are actually a lot like that. 


It could be the case that AI image generation is a tool artists can use to create art, but then it still doesn’t make sense to call the program an “AI art generator”, because that would be like attributing a painting to the brush rather than the painter.  


“AI image generator” is more precise and doesn’t lose anything except unjustified hype."

I believe this is a offensive term towards people who are insecure about their size, and  people who defend insults like ""small dick energy"" are full aware that they cannot justify its use by logic. Its absolutely offensive and ridicules people with small dicks. To say something else is ridiculous. Just accept that you are making fun of small dicks and move on.

We all know what would happen if Tate said something like ""loose p energy"" or some such garbage. It's not okay to make fun of someone for something they can't change.

Another argument for it is, you never usually hear this insult being used toward women. 

The phrase is literally associating a body part that people have no control over with something negative. You wouldn't defend ""loose pussy energy"" or ""saggy tit energy"", so why is small dick energy okay? Oh, because it only affects men with a trait people despise, that's right."

0,2022-12-29,"CMV: The ubiquity of the phrase ""Ignorance is bliss"" is dangerous, and should only be used as a sort of ""Situational mindset""",u/Ok_Th1sisthe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zy109h/cmv_the_ubiquity_of_the_phrase_ignorance_is_bliss/,changemyview,"I have noticed that the phrase has been used as a buzzword whenever people highlight or discuss about any uncomfortable topics, and I think that this way of using the phrase, especially in such magnitude, is dangerous because of several things:

1. It corrodes the value of intelligence and knowledge.
2. It corrodes the importance of a topic.
3. It contributes to the mistrust that people have within any topic due to the first two reasons and the ubiquity of the phrase, and this lack of trust would cause hate between people.
4. The toxicity and hate that would result because of the third reason would also make people ignore many topics, even important ones.

The dangers of the phrase is also exacerbated in many popular websites such as YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter, because those websites allow its users to become anonymous, which further contributes to the mistrust problem, because you cannot verify whether someone is trustworthy or not.

So I propose that the phrase ""Ignorance is bliss"" should instead be used as a sort of ""Situational mindset"" meaning that it is helpful in some situations, and harmful is other situations. I will demonstrate with examples.

1. Example 1: Timmy is the 7 year old son of his mother Jenny and his father Billy. At this point, Timmy hasn't learned basic arithmetic yet, so should Timmy be taught basic arithmetic, or should he not? The answer is he should learn, because the phrase ""Ignorance is bliss"" would be doing more harm to Timmy than good if it was applied, because even the most basic form of math is incredibly useful, because math applies in basically everywhere, so refusing to teach Timmy math is refusing to give Timmy the ability to solve many problems.
2. Example 2: William just finished watching a video that was recently uploaded by his favorite YouTuber on YouTube. Still hungry for content, William decides to go to the suggested tab when he noticed a video called ""Woman gets executed by terrorists with a Simitar."" Should William watch the video, or not? The answer is no, he should not, because the video isn't really important to William, and frankly for most people, because the video's title doesn't suggest any important information that could be learned in the footage or in the description of the footage, and also the fact that the content of the video would be gruesome, and maybe even traumatizing while still not offering anything important that could be learned.

What these two examples teach us is that you should use your knowledge and intelligence to the best of your abilities to determine whether or not something is worth learning. It's also important to know that not every situation where it is applicable would be obvious to determine whether it's worth learning or not. Learning is also not the only factor in whether or not something is worth learning; there's also time, resources, will, etc. I would also like to add that there will be a situation wherein you are not sure whether or not you should learn something, so in that situation, just go learn about it if you have the time, because many regrets in my life have been the result of not taking the initiative of something, and I don't want others to experience the same thing.

I would also say that the things I have written about how to utilize the mindset are more of ""Guidelines"" than ""Rules"" because I want this mindset to be flexible and applicable to everybody since this mindset would apply in many situations, and also because what is ""worth learning"" to some people would not be acceptable to other people, which is why I declare them guidelines."

But i dont think we currently have any idea how life started on Earth? And therefore no possible way to even theorise how likley it is for life to start on a planet. It could have been 1 in 200 trillion, in which case the chance of life on other planets would be looking pretty low.

Then there are inevitable planet wide extinction events over time and the chance of life just dying out and not working, so the chance of life CURRENTLY existing on other planets is even less than the chance of it having existed at some point in the last X million years.


Edit:

A) IF Panspermia is true, then the above is invalid and life on other planets would be highly probable.

B) IF there is an infinite amount of planets, then probability is meaningless, so the above is invalid, and life would be a certainty on other planets.

C) We can create self-replicating molecules, which, although they are not life, they are the beginning of the Abiogenesis creation of life theory. So, although I don't know the % chance of it occurring naturally, if we can do it then it can't be astronomically hard."

My axiomas (not the part I think my mind is going to be changed on):

* The goal of a society is to be the best version it can be of itself, so that it can survive and thrive as a society;
* The main threat to a society is the competition from other societies, which could overtake a society in a military, economic or other sense.

My opinions (the part I think may be flawed and my mind can be changed on):

1. We see increased polarisation in the west in all levels of society (politicians, elite, 'common' people);
2. We see increased difficulty to come to compromises, instead we see more battles won by one party or another and stalemates, because of this polarisation;
3. This is weakening our societies in all ways: military, economy, health, productivity, technology, wellbeing in a broader sense;
4. Other parties (ie China) are becoming increasingly more powerfull relatively to the collective power of western democracies;
5. If that trend continues, we may end up in second place (which we currently are not), which will cost us many privileges;
6. We should not want that to happen, given my axiomas. In fact it should be our collective top priority not to let this happen. This is more important than, for instance, health or human rights."

As I’ve angered many people in my life with my attitude against fat people let’s seriously try and change my view.

I really dislike fat people so much, they’re lazy, have no commitment to long term goals, carry themselves without discipline through life and are the worst members of society. I get there are health issues that could happen and or medication but those are rare exceptions and don’t count if we’re honest. 

Most of the time it’s because people don’t want to go hungry and instead want to mindlessly snack on 1k calories of snacks. 

what I hate the most about fat people is the lies they tell themselves, and by extension me. Like I just have good genetics, No I got to the gym 3-5 times a week and if I can’t manage during reasonable hours I go either late sometimes between 22:00-00:00 or early 04:00-06:00. I also diet I am creative about it and try different things, so it’s not too strict but I do diet. For example I did the constantly eating very small healthy meals and no big meals at all, I tried the paleo diet, and so many more all with different affects and benefits.

0,2022-12-29,CMV: Immigration into Europe is a threat to European culture,u/frustrated_burner,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zy3o5l/cmv_immigration_into_europe_is_a_threat_to/,changemyview,"I would like to first mention that I am not European and have been living here as an immigrant for 5 years in various different countries.

The reasoning behind my view is that when there is continued immigration of non-Europeans into Europe, there is also a need for integration. This integration process I believe degrades European culture, as it requires Europeans to compromise in order to achieve integration, otherwise they would need to force their views and customs on immigrants (which I do also happens unofficially in certain circumstance).

An example of how an immigrant group would degrade a European culture would the Turkish in Germany. 99% of Turkish people are Muslim, and the Muslim faith is directly opposed to many core elements of German culture. This includes things such as alcohol consumption, pork and Christianity along with the inability for the immigrants to speak a native level of German. This means that German people are in a position where they need to compromise on their language, food, drink and religion in order to help these people feel integrated. Compromising in itself is an amazing achievement for people with strong traditions and something to be proud of, but nevertheless I feel it threatens their culture.

Again I want to stress that I am not European and find the Turkish culture itself is deeply intertwined with European culture due to its incredible history, but I would not consider Turkey European relative to the core cultural aspects I've mentioned. I also want to note that I know  Bosnia and Herzegovina is also Muslim and a European country, but due to its small population, I don't think it's ever been an existential threat to elements of European culture. I also want to mention that I feel this way towards any group of people that have deeply conflicting cultural ideologies, this isn't intended to be anti-Muslim, they were just an example group.

Potentials I have thought about against my point would be that the immigration strengthens Europe economically, which in turn protects the culture. I also thought about the Moors in Spain and Portugal for hundreds of years who were Muslim and how Spain and Portugal are today still bastions of European culture. Can you help me better understand how European culture is not threatened by immigration? "

Compared to what actually happened, I'd be surprised if we know 1% of it.  Yet when classes our taught on the subject, and people talk about these ancient times, it seems everyone talks as if what we know is fact, and/or that it is comprehensive.  Here are my issues with this:

**Sample Size**

This is my biggest issue with our understanding of the past.  How many people actually left something behind for us to learn something about them?  And of those things, how many survived the decay of time?  It takes very special conditions for ancient artifacts to survive.  With what we are left with I feel like its a tiny window into everything that happened.  The vast majority, I'd guess 90% or more of everything made by ancient humans, has decomposed and is lost to time.

**Questionable Methodology**

Take Flinder Petrie's dating method where he assumes the more complex the pottery is, the later the period it comes from.  That seems patently false to me!  Fashion is in constant fluxation, sometimes rising in complexity but just as often dipping in complexity.  There are tribes in mesoamerica that made their pottery less complex at times.  In the modern day people like smaller, sleeker, designs just as much as people like the more extravagant.

Carbon-dating I think is better, but the problem is it is often used to date objects found near the carbon sample.  Like, we just assume something found near it is the same age and pretend that over the thousands of years it wasn't moved there?  A common example is finding a wooden beam in some ruins.  How do we know it wasn't replacing an older beam?

Then there is written records.  Historians try to account for bias, but it feels like just guess work.  ""So and so was probably exagerating because these numbers don't make sense."" - Seems unscientific and certainly is nothing concrete.

I think there is *some* truth to our understanding of ancient history.  I just think it is so small and inconsequential to what really was going on that we should take it with a grain of salt.

**Deltas**: 

* The guesswork for historians can be based off multiple documents, which makes dismissing ""odd one out"" claims more reliable.

* I was overestimating the failure rate of guesswork.  If it looks like a spoon it was probably a spoon more often than not.

* Petrie's method was looking at ""complexity"" not just as fashion, but what crafting methods had advanced to.  Also looking at the depth the items were buried at.

* Astronomical dating: when someone mentions celestial bodies we can calculate when that was."

Because a lot of people think it was a good deal. Am I not seeing what they are seeing? I am stuck with these thoughts below. 

When you enter a country as a non-national, you therefore agree and consent to be judged by their law. If you don't think you can abide by their rules, then don't visit that country. It is complete arrogance to break another country's law because the crime you have committed is not a crime in your home country and only Westerners have the courage to do these things because they think they are privileged nationals of the world.

E.g. in some countries, men can legally have 4 wives. However, in the US, polygamy is ""punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both, according to the law of the individual state and the circumstances of the offense."" [(says Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_polygamy_in_the_United_States)[)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_polygamy_in_the_United_States). So, if a foreign man breaks the US law and gets punished because of this and the people and the government of his country would demand that the man's punishment should be reversed OR ELSE! That would be an unreasonable request. Of course, the crime would not be reversed. *Because our laws are better than theirs. /s*

That's exactly how the US is perceived in the world, a bully. You may not like Russia. I am also a harsh critic of their government for invading Ukraine, that's a different case. Demanding Griner back was disrespectful to every single country in the world. It was a message to the world: *""Our nationals do not have to respect your laws if it's not like ours. But you can't do the same thing to us. We can do this because we are strong.""* In conclusion, I reject the general thought suggesting that ""people who have a problem with the Griner case have problems with Joe Biden and/or with black women"". I think this is a straw man fallacy. 

Also, in the future, if an unpopular US citizen is arrested because of the same reason in a foreign country and the government does nothing about it, that would not just be hypocritical, it would mean that means that popular individuals are more important than other citizens. Isn't that concerning?"
9,2022-12-29,"CMV: In the UK, jury service should not select from the electoral register",u/Finchyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zycxtm/cmv_in_the_uk_jury_service_should_not_select_from/,changemyview,"Good evening, all. I've been thinking about this for some time and thought it time to get my feet wet on this sub.

# Background

In the UK, you can be called to jury service at any given moment. While some exemptions apply, the average person will be compelled to attend a court hearing for ""usually up to 10 working days"", but potentially longer, and refusal [is a criminal offence](https://www.law.ac.uk/resources/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-jury-service). The pool of candidates for jury service is drawn [from the electoral register](https://www.gov.uk/jury-service), which everyone must register to in order to take part in votes.

# Argument

My opinion is that all people should have the right to vote without fear of any consequence.

Because one must be on the electoral register to vote, and because jury service is a compulsory, freedom-restricting order from the government that draws its names from the electoral register, then jury service must cease drawing its names from the electoral register **in order to give people the right to vote without any consequence**.

# Clarification

I am not suggesting that jury service is a bad thing or that the compulsion of citizens to do anything by a government is moral (yet), but rather that the selection of individuals from the electoral register is immoral due to its negation of a right to a free vote without consequences.

# Caveats

So far, I can think of only one ""workaround"" to this issue, although it isn't really a hole in my argument: one can sign onto the electoral register, vote, and then sign off again until the next election one wants to take part in.

# Suggested Start

I suspect the following trains of thought would be a good place to start to change my mind:

* Perhaps not everyone deserves the right to a free vote
* Perhaps ""civic duty"" supersedes one's right to freedom
* There is no better place to draw a list of all adults' names

Hoping to have a civil and fruitful discussion!

An AI can target a trending subject and create semi-relevant content for a company and submit hundreds of pieces of content in the same amount of time that an human could do their own research, identify a trend, and create the media. This makes it impossible for any upcoming producer of any sort of media to escape the trenches of tier 0 content.

2) It decreases the value of surrounding media.

AI will increase the volume of media that it is generating by crazy amounts. Compare this to the people who work editing videos or writing papers hours on end. The average cost of making that content will be dragged down until it is eventually un-reasonable to create to make money.

3) It creates a frustrating experience for consumers.

I think people desire authentic creations that reflect the creator and similarities with themselves, but AI will learn to mimic human seeming media and fail.. a lot. It also tends to confuse facts and available opinions that will piss off any educated consumer.

4) It misunderstands the fundamental difference between popular quality work and inflammatory content.

I don't think it'll ever be able to distinguish the two, unless we spell out an impossible moral code that even we don't understand.

5) It cannot produce counter-popular media. 

It is important for society to constantly be able to evolve and improve itself, however for a culture to move forward it has to be exposed by counter-thinking citizens. If the media of a culture is self-perpetuating it's own culture in mass, it will not be able to expose itself of it's own flaws and improve."

557,2022-12-29,CMV: You need gender dysphoria to be transgender.,u/valkeryl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zyi1zc/cmv_you_need_gender_dysphoria_to_be_transgender/,changemyview,"If you check my account, you will see that I am quite active in a few communities that align with the title. I have tried discussing this in mainstream LGBT subs, but to no avail, as I  am typically met with hostility or little evidence supporting the claims that anyone can identify as trans without experiencing dysphoria. I really do want to understand both sides though, because I partly feel like my beliefs are ""growing out"" or are seen as discriminatory. I don't want to be discriminatory at all. I just want to understand.

To those who don't understand, allow me to briefly explain what gender dysphoria is and why I believe it is a requirement to be transgender: Google defines gender dysphoria as the ""psychological distress that results from an incongruence between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity."" Essentially, gender dysphoria occurs when your biological sex is not the same as the gender you identify with or relate to.

I believe that you need gender dysphoria to be transgender because of the lack of reason to transition otherwise. Why would you want to switch sexes when you felt no discomfort/unease in your body in the first place? Most doctors recognize gender dysphoria as a legitimate medical condition because of the effects that it holds on the people who suffer from it. It is also medically proven that those who are transgender and experience dysphoria have brain waves that align with the gender they identify as rather than their gender at birth.

A lot of modern day ""mainstream"" beliefs argue that you don't need gender dysphoria to be trans because of the concept of gender euphoria — feeling neutral in the body of your AGAB (assigned gender at birth) but feeling ecstatic in the body they transition to. I believe this is a pretty good claim, however I disagree with it because of this philosophical belief: in order to know that something is good, you must recognize when something is bad.

What I mean is that, while good *can* exist without bad, we won't know something is good until we know something opposite is bad. For example, men can walk around at night typically without problems or external fears. It is a neutral thing (as being able to do this is seen as freedom), and is something men take for granted, while women suffer from the fear of sexual assault at night. It is good that men can walk freely, but they don't think of it as good. Instead, they think of it as something expected, or don't even think about it at all, whereas many women can only think about it. When men typically realize this, they are often thankful for not having to fear walking like women do, because women fearing for their lives is bad.

I believe that trans people who feel neutral at first in their AGAB are hiding under layers of internal transphobia, and only are able to celebrate gender euphoria because they now realize that what they felt before was gender dysphoria that they pushed down to mend well into society.

Another stance is that gender identity can be linked to social &amp; gender expression. I think this is a stance I've seen most frequently. I disagree though, because I believe that someone can be GNC without being transgender. Clothes do not define gender. A man can wear feminine clothes and still be a man and vice versa — why, suddenly, is expression being linked to being trans?

I do believe that expression can cause gender euphoria in certain circumstances. For example, getting gendered correctly as a trans man because you wore ""masculine"" clothes after being misgendered and belittled for so long.

I hope all of these points are coherent and make sense. I have not read everything twice, so there may be some mistakes or I might not have explained things as clear as I would hope.

With all of this said, I do believe that my belief has some flaws; I know that it can cause a lot of internalized transphobia and fears that people aren't ""trans enough"". I also do recognize that my opinion could be skewed because I am a transgender man who has experienced dysphoria, and can therefore not imagine what it is like to identify as transgender without feeling this way. So, can someone CMV?

ETA: everyone in the comments jumped on the argument of a post-everything trans person no longer feeling dysphoric. I will explain my stance on that here: if someone is ill and they receive continuous medication to block out/alleviate side effects of that illness, are they no longer ill? The answer is no. People who transition and no longer feel dysphoria are still transgender because transitioning blocks that side effect (dysphoria). Dysphoria is a side effect of being trans that can be cured through medical help (but you don't need to transition to be trans; many people choose not to due to outside reasons.) I hope I explained that properly because I feel like I rushed it lmao

Edit 2: I am no longer replying to comments, but it has been interesting hearing other sides. Someone linked me to a bunch of research articles from varying sources that explain the science behind trans-ness and GD, and I am very thankful for them because it helped me put it into a scientific lens and I can better understand why people who are not experiencing gender dysphoria identify as transgender. With that said, this has caused some spark of debate so feel free to debate among yourselves."

Everyone’s life is a journey even the parents, I think at one point we all should be compassionate enough to realize that your parents can do mistakes that will traumatize you but you will have to learn to heal and also see the good in them. 

I do realize some parents are bad to the core but this is an exception, I am talking generally.

Edit: 
As everyone pointed out, my logic is flawed. 
What I am trying to convey is that I am excluding people with abusive parents that didn’t even love their kids just viewed them as something to be controlled from this argument, they aren’t being dramatic when they cut off all ties. 
I am more talking about the majority who had loving parents, but those parents never healed from their own trauma so had some bad parenting moments and traumatized their kids."
0,2022-12-29,CMV: Domestic violence report in western countries has unintentional gender bias/inaccuracies,u/CarsAndSpeeds,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zyj5xs/cmv_domestic_violence_report_in_western_countries/,changemyview,"First of all, no I’m not a anti-feminist, I strongly support the feminist movement in third world countries and authoritarian/traditionalist state like Saudi Arabia, Iran, China and Russia.

However I believe that in western developed countries such as US and ESPECIALLY Western European countries (Such as France, Germany Sweden and Spain), domestic violence against women is being over-reported and domestic violence against men is being underreported.

Here is a few reason for me to draw such conclusions:

1: Women are usually feels more safe and less or not at all ashamed to report that they are being abused while men usually feels ashamed to do that because of the fear that it will ruin their muscularity - which ties to the bad part of traditionalist ideas and NOT feminist/progressive ideas.

2: Women are a lot more engaged in verbal/psychological abuse and toxic controlling behavior compare to men, which is often dismissed as a form of domestic violence unlike physical abuse in which police officers will take it more seriously and have a lot higher rate of conviction due to the fact that it is a lot easier to prove physical abuse compared to verbal abuse.

3: Society stigma, men will often regard minor (means small, not the age minor) abuse as acceptable while women will not accept minor abuse and is more likely to report it to police compare to men.

What do you all think on this issue?"
11,2022-12-29,CMV: Anyone who believes that a Russian victory over Ukraine is a foregone conclusion is ignoring the challenges Russia is facing,u/Krenztor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zyj6gl/cmv_anyone_who_believes_that_a_russian_victory/,changemyview,"I'll start out by admitting that I sort of live in a pro-Ukrainian bubble and haven't been engaging with the pro-Russia crowd.  Just by chance, I watched a debate video that pulled me out of this bubble and let me see what life is like on the other side.  The group in this video held the stance that Russia has already essentially won and all that is left is the questions of how big their win will be and how long Ukraine will stubbornly fight a lost war.

I figured I'd take this discussion to CMV because if I am just being blind in my beliefs, I'd rather know about it now than painfully see it fall apart over a period of months of defeat.

My belief is that Russia does not have a clear and obvious path to victory based on the following.

1. Their rate of advance in December is about 100 km\^2.  At that rate it would take them about 10 years just to regain the land lost in the Kharkiv offensive.  So for all the chest beating Russia is doing over their advances in Bakhmut, they're not simply running over the Ukrainian military.
2. Ural crude oil (the oil Russia sells) is going for $55/barrel.  This is down from the peak of around $111 and even down from the pre-war price of $77.  Natural gas is around the pre-war price.  With about 1/5th of the Russian economy depending on these products and the general sanctions hitting all other industries, Russia is going to have to dip into their war chest as their revenues fall sharply while military costs spike.
3. The West has already seized half of Russia's war chest.  When sanctions were put into place, $350 billion was frozen by western banks.  Clearly Putin had not planned on this happening nor did he anticipate the sanctions or embargo of Russian fossil fuels.

Feel free to correct me if I'm overstating the importance of these three things because they are what led me to my conclusion.  With Russia far from military victory, their economy being strangled, fossil fuel prices (specifically Russian fossil fuel prices) falling, and with their initial funds for the war cut in half immediately when the war started, Russia economically is bound to collapse.  If it weren't for these economic factors, I do think Russia could be pigheaded enough to be able to eventually wear Ukraine out and bring about favorable peace negotiations, but with the economic clock ticking down and everyone being fully aware that time will eventually run out for Russia, all Ukraine and the west have to do is wait them out.

Of course, I don't think Ukraine and the west are simply planning on waiting them out.  They have their own plans for helping to militarily press Russia, but I feel like that is a bit of an unknown.  Maybe Ukraine can achieve more victories or maybe they can't.  That's why I don't hinge much of my convictions on how military fortunes go in the coming year.

Lastly, to be clear, I'm not saying Ukraine's victory is a foregone conclusion either.  I don't want people getting the wrong idea and trying to make me defend just how easily I think Ukraine will win, because I don't think it is that easy.  Even if Russia goes bankrupt, that doesn't necessarily mean the fighting is over.  It just means Russia's chances of winning are over.  They can still throw millions of people armed with bows and arrows to their death over a period of years and maybe even go as far as the use of nuclear weapons.  Russia's defeat doesn't automatically mean Ukraine's victory as odd as that sounds.  Russia's defeat could mean everyone loses.  The point of my argument is that I believe Russia is on a trajectory to lose and anyone who thinks Russia is on the cusp of victory, I'm really interested to see how that perspective is supported."

Here's the issue: pain is a really complex set of processes that are intrinsically linked to the *structure* of an organism's nervous system. Feeling empathy for an abused dog only makes sense insofar as the dog has neurological structural similarities to you. The further away we get on the evolutionary tree, the less empathy makes sense. Empathy for a spider? An octopus? A crow? 

If you claim to care about animals you should drop any pretense to understand what they're feeling and get a basic understanding of the variety of nervous systems in the animal kingdom and how those systems respond to stimuli.

For clarification: I'm not saying that empathy is useless or even that empathy is a poor tool for convincing others to change their lifestyle. My claim is that empathy is a poor tool for *thinking* about these complex issues. Here I'm more concerned with philosophy than I am praxis."

(1) One spouse has a history of compulsive spending or gambling, so the spouses - by mutual agreement - decide the way to firewall marital / family resources is to allow the spendy spouse to have accounts with limited fundsfunds (eg allowances), but not have access to the main funds that determine the couple's financial health.

(2) Although a couple functionally pools their resources and jointly manage their finances, they each maintain a separate checking or small line of credit for petty, discretionary spending (that is accounted for in their joint budget but handled separately).

Other than those exceptions ^ my view is that it is intrinsically unhealthy for a marriage and family if the spouses maintain separate finances. Because

(a) they're failing to fully commit to a comprehensive, lifelong bond - so their prioritization of individuality is intrinsically at odds with the mindsets and strategies that are conducive to a healthy and fulfilling marriage.

(b) they're making it easier to divorce, which creates a psychological propensity and self-fulfilling prophecy that they actually will divorce.

TLDR: For these reasons, and for the limited exceptions above, my view is that a married couple should never maintain separate finances; but, rather, should pool all resources and administer them jointly for the good of the spouses, their children, and any other members of their household.

I think that it’s disrespectful for tombs to be opened just to find artifacts. At the end of the day that was still a person who wanted to be buried in a way they could feel at peace.  

Everyone sees ancient Egyptian art and offerings in museums that have been stolen from their burial site. Those objects were considered vital to their passing and religious ceremonies (from what I understand).


I say CMV because maybe there is more educational value (beyond historical) than I’m seeing, and I’m not very educated on the topic. But the concept is just gross. Mummies etc. should be left to rest not put on display in a museum.

I just don’t see how it’s worth it. Sure, ancient civilizations are fascinating. But I don’t think that should outweigh humanity. 

People should be able to rest peacefully without being dug up and dissected."

I want to visit Iceland and Norway for the spectacular views, pristine nature and mystique vibes.

As someone who has never experienced seasons, been in forests, swam in lakes, or been ""out there in the wilderness"" (literally, my hometown is just 100F weather, potholes and shrubs. Yes I live in Texas!) my main goal in this trip is to be wowed.

Norway and Iceland are obvious choices (NZ too but I'll do that in a later trip). I once saw a comment of a person who cried by the beauty in Iceland, and I want to experience that too!

However, Canada/Alaska are closer and more affordable to me. I might switch it instead (since they're kinda similar) if there's something really worth it that'll blow my mind away over what Iceland/Norway have."

For example, back in the 70s and 80s many films - including mainstream ones - had nude scenes, something you don't really see anymore in big blockbusters such as *Thor: Love and Thunder*.

Anime, which is ironically more and more sexualized nowadays on the outside, is more censored than the past when it comes to the ""details"". 70s and 80s anime had lots of shower scenes and bare-naked female bodies, but recently UY was redone for broadcast television and [the main character's nipples](https://twitter.com/switchpoint/status/1581402317316050944), which were shown in the original anime, were instead censored by covering them with strands of her hair. [This article](https://www.cbr.com/anime-too-old-reboot-urusei-yatsura/) also discusses this in more detail and explains how TV standards have tightened in Japan. In my country, in the 1970s and 1980s, a lot of ultra-violent and rather sexual anime were broadcast on TV without censorship at lunchtime; try that today and you will have angry parents yelling at you.

Now, I think there needs to be SOME sort of regulation on what you can broadcast or not, and I can't exactly pinpoint the cause for these growing restrictions despite the liberalization and secularization of our societies. But I think that in some ways, we are more restricted than decades ago.

Basically, my view is that holidays that are typically only observed as a three day weekend (e.g. MLK Day, President's Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day), and without any additional fanfare/obligations, are perfectly valid days to have a wedding, as they are generally not associated with major family gatherings (e.g. Thanksgiving) or are religiously important *for most people* - I'm aware that perhaps a few people take the above example holidays more seriously for the actual meaning. My view does not cover these people. 

The point that people I've discussed this with have stated is that ""3 day weekend holidays"" are assumed travel/vacation holidays and it is rude to ask people to devote that time for your wedding. In my view, this perceived inconvenience is offset by people having to take one fewer day off of their jobs. If i had a wedding the weekend after memorial day, you'd get memorial day back but you'd also most likely have to take an extra day off work (most weddings that I have to travel to require me taking either Friday, monday, or sometimes both days off). In my view, the convivence of not having a wedding on a 3 day weekend is offset by having to take days off work you wouldn't have had to."

If you train your dog correctly you should be able to send them to their bed, so if they’re ever begging when you’re cooking or it’s dangerous for them to be around you, you can just send them to their bed.

If they’re snatching food from the side, that IS a problem, but that’s not the same as begging. 

The way I see it, you get a cute dog looking at you and wanting to be around you and you can stroke them or talk to them.

Edit: not a single person has actually given a reason as to why a dog begging is a bad thing, beyond a more meta view that dog begging is bad because it’s bad.

To preface:  I'm not against taxing billionaires.  My personal opinion is that billionaires are actively harmful to society.  In either case, that has nothing to do with this, just to inform that I'm not coming at it with a hyper-capitalist viewpoint.

Let's begin at the biggest hurdle.  Gotham has been run by a secret organization of the ultra-wealthy called the Court of Owls for over a hundred years.  They were so secretive they escaped even Batman's notice for a long time.  These are the worst of the worst, those who engineered many of the miserable conditions in Gotham.  They are the puppetmasters of the city council, the mayor, etc.

Then, you have the city officials, who are almost entirely all corrupt.  If Wayne was paying all of that extra in taxes, it would be no help to anyone because those who control the distribution of those funds would engage in cronyism and all sorts of other nefarious stuff.  We've seen this several times.  Even in the most recent Batman, the Thomas Wayne fund was being directed into folks' pockets rather than helping the people it was intended for.

Another thing, not all of Gotham's criminals/Batman's Rogue's gallery were created by poverty.  It could be said that ""a lack of mental health resources"" is the reason, but that's also not so cut and dry.  Harley Quinn is a great example of this, she was a psychologist working in the mental health field when she up and fell in love with a maniac then lost her damn mind too.

So, Gotham City still needs Batman even if Wayne is taxed at a higher rate.  Gotham is full of madness and corruption from top to bottom.  You're still gonna need a smart, well-trained ninja when Riddler has a room of people surrounded by explosives ready to go if his riddle isn't solved.  You still need Batman when Killer Croc or Clayface get up to mayhem and SWAT is useless.  When Penguin is selling stolen organs on the black market and the cops are on his payroll.  Etc.

Can you convince me that Gotham City, as written, would be better if Wayne quit being Batman and put most of his money into the city?"

116,2022-12-31,CMV: USA is not that bad of a place to live,u/Loko-te,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zzt8jd/cmv_usa_is_not_that_bad_of_a_place_to_live/,changemyview,"I’ll preface this by sharing my background. I was born and raised in Germany to sub saharan African immigrant parents. I’ve only lived in Europe my whole life.

As such, I am wholly aware of my privileges compared to the US and how it may affect my bias. We have far better worker protection laws, far less income/wealth disparity, generally better govt support, cheaper education and healthcare, etc. And I’m not saying EU isn’t a better place to live in than the US.

I would say that in the “first world” as we know it, the US is one of the worse places to live. However, I think it is still one of the better places to live from a worldwide perspective.

I feel like a ton of Americans exaggerate how bad the country is sometimes, and as someone who’s heard countless experiences retold by my African parent, I know for a fact that it can get far far worse in the world. Is the US bad compared to other countries with similar amounts of money? Probably. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t a far better place to live than a large portion of the world.

There’s countries where women often don’t even get the right to basic needs such as education, or are oppressed heavily in other ways. There’s countries where being gay or trans will have you locked in a prison or killed. There’s countries where your life isn’t even certain every day due to war and violence. (to a more severe degree than in the US) There’s places where clean water or food isn’t guaranteed for many. Just look at the average age in most of Africa compared to the US. Child death is immense over there and it’s tragic.

I feel like the amount of freedom of speech you have in the US is also massively underrated. The fact that so many Americans can even complain about their life is amazing and also a privilege. We’ve seen countries where that isn’t the case and people get jailed for criticising their governments.

The takeaway here is not “dont complain bcuz ppl have it worse” it’s moreso “be aware and somewhat thankful of the privileges you have in life over a lot of other people.” I often see Americans make large encompassing statements about how the US is one of the worst places to live ever, and.. that’s just insensitive to me. Many people would kill to live in the US, despite its many shortcomings, it can get a lot worse in the world.

EDIT: Okay, I think I ended up being convinced. I believe there still remains a small amount of Americans that do make their life out to be harder than it is; but I don't think that is exclusive to the USA. Largely though, I've reached a middle ground on this where I do start to slowly understand where many are coming from. The USA is not an amazing place to live, and it's not a terrible place to live either. However; the flaws that the USA suffers from are largely unique to the US, despite it technically being a rich country. I can see why that would be frustrating to many. The issues can be changed right now, but they're not. I feel like the conversation won't get much farther like this because we'd be going in circles, but I appreciate everyone who responded."

These people include top biologists. After thinking about it, it does make sense - since life evolved from non-living elements, at which point does it start having a consciousness which makes its own decisions? 

Now there maybe other arguments supporting the existence of free-will, but for the sake of this discussion let's disregard that. Assume that there is no free-will. This means you don't really make decisions, the decision is already made and its just presented to you, giving you an illusion of choice.

 If this is true, then - you are not responsible for procrastination, for being lazy, for not contributing to society, being unkind, and everything else. Its not in your control anyways. Since there is a good chance that free will doesn't exist, should we really worry about anything?"

27,2022-12-31,CMV: A young child cannot be “turned trans” due to early exposure to information regarding transgenderism,u/physioworld,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/zzx3tf/cmv_a_young_child_cannot_be_turned_trans_due_to/,changemyview,"So my SIL has recently passionately defended her preference for trans issues not to be discussed around her children (both under 5) either at home or at school. She wasn’t explicit about her reasons for this, but my assumption is that it’s because she’s afraid they won’t understand and will be more likely to think that they themselves are trans. She said the topic is too complex for them at that age and is not appropriate to discuss it with them. 

My view is that there are ways to discuss essentially any complex topic with a child so long as it’s delivered in a way they can understand, and as they age you can layer in more and more nuance. I also don’t believe cis children can be turned trans. They may be more likely to experiment with or question their gender identity but ultimately if they’re cis they won’t want to transition and no amount of early education on the topic will change that (indoctrination/brainwashing are, I think separate from education). 

To be clear my SIL is NOT a bigot, she actively affirmed that she would love and support her kids if they were trans, she’s simply (imo irrationally) afraid that exposure to these issues will make them become trans and their lives will be as a result be harder than they would otherwise be, which I don’t think is controversial since trans youth are known to have more mental health problems than their cis counterparts"

But I sometimes worry that if immigration could be done freely without limitations, we would find countries with all their people leaving, that could worsen their economy even more, especially if they don't send remittance or go back home and develop their own country. And obviously more prosperous countries would collapse due to overpopulation (a big overstatement, considering the lower birth rates for the natives.)

But I totally understand why people want to move away from their countries. Fleeing wars, lack of opportunities etc, but it might not be sustainable long-term.

I liked it the first time I saw it despite being oddly disappointed, however having rewatched it dozens of times, it actually gets worse with every viewing. The dialogue is laughable and chocked full of exposition, the plot is painfully contrived and entire story feels forced. Heath Ledgers performance was ok at best. Definitely not worthy of a best supporting actor Oscar. The characters concept is the true success story. The design, the costume, everything. The performance was subpar. It somehow feels like someone doing an impression of the Joker. 

Heath Ledgers untimely death lent this film a huge publicity boost, it added a dark mystique, a morbid curiosity that drew audience in droves. It had nothing to do with Heath Ledgers performance, nothing to do with his box office draw because honestly, he wasn’t a huge star by any means. 

The first movie in the Dark Knight Trilogy - Batman Begins - was in no way a blockbuster success grossing less than $400m worldwide yet following Ledgers tragic passing, The Dark Knight went on to gross $1b plus 

The Dark Knight doesn’t even succeed as a superhero blockbuster due to its self aware seriousness and grey and miserable Nolanism. Without Ledgers unintended publicity boost, this film wouldn’t have scraped $800m.

I was a left leaning centrist when I registered to vote in 2008 as a Democrat and voted for Obama in that election. 

By 2012, I was a staunch libertarian and identified a lot with that party platform (that being said, I never agreed with the ""taxation is theft"" mantra. I knew the importance, just hated how taxation was applied and what it went to pay for) In 2015, I started shifting left with the rise of Bernie Sanders, and my 2016 mantra of No Clinton/No Trump. Over the pandemic, I re-evaluated some of my beliefs and now I believe in:

* Civil Rights for All
* Systematic racism is real and a problem in America
* Medicare for all
* Abortion should be legal and is a private decision between women and their doctors
* I dislike a lot about modern capitalism
* The military budget should be cut and America should stay out of foreign affairs
* I believe we need severe police/judicial/prison reform

I know this sounds like I'm on the left, however, I don't feel like I belong on the left either because:

* I still believe in gun rights (You should have to pass a bg check and comprehensive safety course first obviously)
* I loathe Identity Politics/Culture War and think both are pointless distractions created by the ruling class to sew discord amongst the working class
* I am skeptical of unions (Workers should have every right to unionize if they want, but I want no part of them)
* I believe hate speech is free speech (you have every right to say hateful things, you also have every right to face backlash/ostracization for having backward beliefs)
* I believe that while yes, systematic racism/classism is real, it shouldn't absolve anyone of personal responsibility
* I still think capitalism has a place in society. It should just be for things like ""what brand of peanut butter/car/art supplies should I buy?"" rather than for things like healthcare

I post this to change my view, as I'd like to be proven wrong as to where I belong politically, and  learn something new from other people's perspective.

Just without the federal government. I truly do not think a country with such ethnic and socioeconomic diversity can ever be made to actually accomplish any net positives. Let them all go their separate ways amicably.

Except, what do we do about the ghettos? Clearly vitriolically racist individuals governing districts filled with African Americans/other minorities?

In fact, I have really only seen the opposite.

The only free-speech related legislation I have seen in the past several years were laws *restricting* speech by conservative politicians. Many states have passed anti-BDS laws or executive orders that prevent the state from doing any business with corporations who engage in a Boycott against Israel, despite the fact that economic boycotts and the promotion thereof is a SCOTUS recognized aspect of free speech. [Texas even required teachers to sign anti-BDS oaths](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20181218-texas-teacher-fired-for-refusing-to-sign-anti-bds-oath/), and fired those who refused.

Most stunningly, in Florida, [Ron DeSantis passed an anti-""Critical Race Theory"" law which prohibited the teaching of any curriculum that would make a student feel ""discomfort""](https://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-doubles-anti-critical-race-theory-legislation/story?id=82348795) (this is literally what the law said) or guilt on the basis of their race, even in *universities*. Banning speech that might make people feel discomfort sure doesn't feel free-speechy to me, and it was actually struck down by the courts because it violated the First Amendment. The Don't-Say-Gay bill also removed any books that even mention sexual orientation or gender identity, which you might agree with, but is still limiting speech.

Ron DeSantis also wants to make it a crime to bring a minor to a Drag Show. Again, you might agree, but free speech. I think it's more abusive to take your kids to church and teach them that they'll burn in a lake of fire for eternity if they don't follow your religion, but I don't prohibit parents from taking their children to church because I \*actually\* believe in free speech and familial autonomy, which the Republicans are clearly more comfortable limiting. (Also, there's no congruent effort to ban kids from Hooters and other titty bars. Seems like they are selectively choosing what free expression to limit based on their political feelings).

While all these anti-speech bills are being passed by Republicans, I don't see any laws being passed by Republicans to protect speech, nor do I see any Democrats passing laws which would restrict it. The only ""free speech"" point I can give Republicans is that they are supporting a wedding planner who doesn't want to do sell a website template to a gay couple on the basis of her free expression, but that's about it.

It seems to me that Republicans aren't really concerned with free speech, but just want to be able to say slurs without being sent to HR, or denied payment/platforming from a private corporation whose money or services they are not entitled to.

The right screams ""*Free Speech!*"" when Ben Shapiro gets shouted down from a college campus, seemingly forgetting the fact that those protestors *also* have a Constitutional right to free speech, which they are exercising. **If your definition of free speech is simply ""other people shouldn't be allowed to call me a bigot"", while you're simultaneously passing laws saying that you'll be fired for opposing Israel in your private life, or that you'll be fined for teaching anything that makes people feel ""discomfort"", how free is your speech really**?"
