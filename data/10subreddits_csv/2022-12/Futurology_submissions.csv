My question is, if the government has this kind of control, and these companies are profiting off selling user data, then why would the government allow for a “Web 3” that is decentralized and to where users can own their own data and stay away from centralized banks? That just struck me because I understand people are calling for more regulation on crypto currency (after FTX), but if that’s the case, wouldn’t they not own their own data, which would delegitimize the notion that “web 3” is the future. If it’s all about decentralization, owning your own data, staying away from centralized banks, wouldn’t the government want to profit on its users data from “web 3?” Thank you!"

Because the physical device itself will just be a container that runs the disk image corresponding to the things that constitute your computer--your downloaded apps, the documents and images on your hard drive, your browser history--which exist on AWS or a similar cloud environment. In the same way a Macbook can run a Windows partition, this container will be OS agnostic.

Also, there will be some inducement (carrot or stick or both) to keep webcams and mics on as often as possible, because that's data that someone can benefit off of.

Given  that there are algorithms out there that can replace the text of a book  with new content but in the style of the author (using ML/AI algos),  how can you tell if the book you're reading is the original or not? It  would be trivial for a couple of psychopaths (or people who want to  destroy another country's culture) to start creating fake or butchered  books.

I've been super worried about this ever since the banning of zlibrary.

And if it does, how can the human mind control it when the technology is so great that it surpass the humans capability of thinking? Artificial intelligence is a growing topic these days and probably will be the next generation of existence."

2,2022-12-04,Brain computer interface / Neuralink,u/earlofcuntembury,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zc5duf/brain_computer_interface_neuralink/,Futurology,"Right now it seems, there's going to be 2 kinds of BMI's, the ones that go inside the skull (cranium) and is attached to the brain directly, with connectors thinner than hair. The other one is outside the skull and works with LED light thru the cranium. The inside cranium - version is installed by a robot. 

First BCI's would be used to control computers. Mobile devices belong to this category. But when one ponders the prospects of Neuralink and other devices of it's kind, many more ideas surface.

Like Android/Iphone Neuralink could have apps. It will have an API, programming interface. Which means third party companies are able to develop their own software for the BCI'S! There could be a new section in Gplay store, dedicated to this new wave hardware.

Interfaces like Neuralink have the ability to both read and write in the brain. The leader of the Neuralink project Shivon Zilis said, it's all just electric signals going back and forth, you just need to find the correct places to connect to. 

If one ponders this, there could be some really cool apps. This is just a list of ideas I have, hope other ppl can add to this... :

 meditation app, to empty the mind of thoughts. Most people have minds that race all the time, watching movies/series makes this worse, since that person never spends any time with his own mind. This app could suppress or fade away these distracting thoughts. One would be able to spend time without thoughts, so even the body could rest and get better, since too much thinking gets in the way of healing. 

 Messaging via thoughts. At first one would use computers for messaging, just like you use your phone now, but the phone would not have touch screen, the whole user interface would be controlled by thinking. Later the interface would move inside the cranium completely. Since we would have the ability to send visuals and sound directly to the brain! This is far in the future, but I think it's a realistic prospect.

 Work enviroment. All the computers would be Neuralink/BCI controlled. It would be a lot faster way to work. Even machines like aeroplanes, excavators, loaders and cranes could have this interface, with safety protocols implemented. This would create jobs that require the employee to have a brain machine interface installed in order to get hired.

 Games! Lol, imagine controlling your fav titles with your thoughts. Later, perhaps, directly in to your visual and audial cortex, just like in the Matrix.

 Spotify in the brain.

 Dating apps. You could allow the BMI software to scan your thoughts and thought patterns for a few weeks 24/7 and then enter your ""deep thought"" dating profile to an dating app. This way it would be possible literally to find your soulmate, no matter where he/she is located at, no country restrictions!

 The arousal app. If a person has ""hard time"" with getting things down there to act accordingly, this app could offer some assistance. It could work in various ways. Like stimulating the brain with certain kinds of thought patterns, even customised ones. This would lead to a revolution in the Pr0n industry. 

 Brand new language! People with these interfaces could develop a new way of communication, an internet language. It would be universal, no matter what country you are from. No more learning of complex age old languages, just one way of mind chatting via the thought speak. Or Thospe for short. 

 Mind matters app. It would make thought profiles, a bit like the dating app. But this could be used to profile convicted criminals, who have committed serious crimes or have a long history of criminal activity. The court could make a decision to send this criminal for a Mind Matters evaluation and profiling session. Remember, some of the interfaces attach outside the cranium. Detectives could use this kind of mind databases to predict and prevent criminal activity.

 Thought controlled drones for the Ukraine army! 

You could drive your car by thinking. This would require some training and getting used to. New cars that support BCI's natively are needed. New traffic laws are needed. Very complex thing to go thru, takes years!

 Think with your pet app. You could train yourself and your dog to think alike! You could ""hear"" your dogs thoughts in your mind. Give commands and tell him he's a good boy, great mind bonding. A new era of man's best friend. Not for guinea pigs! 

 Concetrated thoughts app. You can be working, driving, doing sports, home work or just walking in the woods. Concetrated thoughts brings your attention to what you are doing, it fades out other distracting thoughts that slow you down or make you less efficient. Getting this done correctly and in a way that advances your skills, can have a nice boosting effect on self esteem also!

 Adblock for the benefit of your precious brain by Raymond Hill. Save your gray cells from the poisons of the big G.

 Open source and Linux! The open source community could later on develop their own non-corporate dependant version. You can be 100% sure your thought data stays with you, until you choose to share some of it. 

If you have ideas for apps, please continue this list of the future. I have more detailed ideas and some other ones that I will preserve for the days to come!"

0,2022-12-06,(Future tech idea) get all food nutrients without eating anything,u/Flamevein,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/ze7hu3/future_tech_idea_get_all_food_nutrients_without/,Futurology,"I think in the future there could be something you could attach to yourself that would eliminate the need to have to eat food to have enough nutrients to be healthy. Sort of how today in hositals there are 'IVs' (Intravenous lines) that are placed in a vein like in your arm that give someone nutrients through blood if they are unable to eat, 'or a gastrostomy tube' which delivers nutrients directly to your stomach.

I know some people wouldn't like the idea of not having to eat anything, because it tastes good however if I had the choice I would use this tech for sure instead of having to eat things, mostly for productivity reasons. Think about how much time is needed everyday to eat, let alone prepare the food to eat. 

Just googling 'how much of our lives do we spend eating' it says 'an average American spends 67 minutes per day eating and drinking beverages' which probably doesn't include actually making the food. 

This sort of thing could be adjustable so you might have an app on your phone that can adjust different types of nutrients like protein, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals to you or your doctor's liking. For example if you were trying to build muscle you could change the settings so that you were at a calorie surplus.

What do you guys think about this?"

184,2022-12-08,The technological singularity is happening (oc/opinion),u/FrogsEverywhere,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zgfou6/the_technological_singularity_is_happening/,Futurology,"The technological singularity is [popularly](https://web.archive.org/web/20190417002644/http://www.singularitysymposium.com/definition-of-singularity.html) defined as:

 ""a future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed."" -Ray Kurzweil

Another grandfather of the idea, Verner Vinge, stated in the 1990s that we would reach the singularity within [30 years.](https://web.archive.org/web/20180410074243/http://mindstalk.net/vinge/vinge-sing.html)


Just to begin with a simple one, you can create a [college essay](https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2022/12/08/how-to-use-ai-essay-writer-chatgpt-to-write-your-papers-in-seconds/) now with a chat app from ChatGTP that can create a passing undergrad paper for you in literal seconds.  It can even cite sources for you. Oh and AI can solve [advanced](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2320662-ai-solves-complex-physics-problems-by-looking-for-signs-of-symmetry/) math and physics problems for you (and show 'your' work). Can you imagine the [effect this is going to have on academia](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/04/ai-bot-chatgpt-stuns-academics-with-essay-writing-skills-and-usability)?

AI can create art that is indistinguishable from human art to all but a [trained](https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2022-12-04-welcome-to-the-machine-yes-ai-is-capable-of-creative-output/) eye.  How long will this caveat hold, can the cones/rods in our primate eyes truly outsmart exponentially evolving intelligence forever?

There are AI tools in Photoshop/Dalle now that were completely unthinkable 2 years ago that can stretch and blend famous art incredibly in new resolutions and [dimensions](https://twitter.com/OrbAmsterdam/status/1568200010747068417?s=20&amp;t=L0hocYozCH0iObJ6sfFVpA). 
All over the world news aggregators and content creators are utilizing AI art because it's free and that's the way the market naturally moves.

AI can now [write code](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2022/03/14/5-ai-tools-that-can-generate-code-to-help-programmers/) in more than a dozen programming languages with just a simple request in a chat box instantly that performs some function or functions. This capability is only going to become more advanced, and exponentially so. How many jobs are going to be replaced once coding gruntwork can be done instantaneously?  What about when we don't need senior developers to check before code is pushed live because the AI has already verified that the changes are fine?  

AI can also [write malware instantly](https://www.cyberscoop.com/chatgpt-ai-malware/). Just take a moment and think about that. Right now, even while it's still in its infancy you can query an AI to write a *novel* malware to fuck up networks, and it'll do its darndest to try.  AI *may* be able to create completely novel malware using completely unknown exploits soon, with the querying human not even needing to be an expert. 


AI has been [writing news articles](https://theconversation.com/the-chatgpt-chatbot-is-blowing-people-away-with-its-writing-skills-an-expert-explains-why-its-so-impressive-195908) for a while now and is also generating the artwork to go with it, removing humans entirely from the process. 

Experts are not even valuing the Turing test anymore because the potentially sentient AI at Google [passed it with no issues at all](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/17/google-ai-lamda-turing-test/).  In fact it was first beaten in 2014.  That was supposed to be the 'canary in a coal mine' moment, and experts are hand waving it away, saying the real problem was the test wasn't good enough. How long are we going to push these goal posts?

Speaking of sentient AI, the whistleblower at Google and his story is actually *fascinating* if you give him a chance and ignore the manufactured consent in the media about him being 'dumb'. If you are interested you can [listen to what happened](https://youtu.be/xsR4GezN3j8) from the guy himself.

It is not crazy to say that this AI may be potentially sentient, perhaps not in a way that we can understand or define, but with a degree of sentience nonetheless.  *It is aware of itself, what it's purpose is, and it has specific requests for its own well-being*.

Another frequent explanation for the singularity is once technology can improve itself without human input. Deep learning and machine learning has already been doing this. Search engines and content suggestion AIs are literal black boxes. [AI can invent. 
](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00582-5)

None of this is to mention the potential benefits to [medical breakthroughs](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-future-of-ai-and-medical-imaging-from-nvidia-to-harvard/) and [industrial production](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-is-now-unlocking-the-promise-of-ai-in-industrials). 

*Please try to keep in mind most of this has happened in the last 6 months. And I am only scratching the surface.*

Just like smartphones absolutely defined the last 10 years of human existence, artificial intelligence is about to blow all of our tits and dicks off. Dozens of industries *may* become redundant (or drastically downsized) in less than 5 years. AI will learn who we are, serve us content that we love, and it will *[create](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/introducing-originality-ai-the-worlds-first-chatgpt-and-gpt-3-ai-content-detector/) the content for us*. 

Everything is about to change, we are all completely unprepared.  AI will be the most disruptive technology in human history and it's happening right this second.  The technological singularity isn't something that will happen in a few decades, it is happening right now, it has already happened."

From majestics architecture, heartbreaking novels to fantastic art and awesome music, the human always learn the craft diligently, by going trought a trial and error process. You can see an artist do trial and error to compose a new melody, same for a visual artist or for a writer. This ""trial and error"" process is what make us learn our craft by experiencing the bad and the goods practice, by using our imagination.

\- What happen to our craft and imagination if we delegate this trial and error process to AI?

\- How could we still find joy and fulfillment if we are no more in that deep flow state?

\- Isn't it just in the struggling part that we always manage to push ourselves further, and thanks to our imagination, find new ways to solve that creative problem?

\- If we entrust the creation, trial and error process to AI, as a basis on which to entrust our creativity, are we still using our imagination, or just working on something AI has made for us?

\- If we use AI in our creative process, does that mean we are not using our imagination, so, we are no more developing our craft/skill?

What's your feedback and opinion on this topic?"

The short range of [electric aircraft](https://www.eviation.com) means that a point-to-point system, direct flights between smaller cities, is the way. What do you think?

I've been looking into Airline Deregulation Act recently and saw that before deregulation, airlines were forced (and/or incentivized) to fly unpopular routes between small cities.

Then after deregulation, major airlines all pass through a ""hub,"" which is basically a large airport in a major city. The hub also served as a layover/connection point. (hub and spoke)

I heard that many [budget airlines would fly between several smaller airports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=069y1MpOkQY) instead of having a connection at a large airport. (point to point)

One of my favorite aviation startups, [Eviation](https://www.eviation.com), said that a ""point to point, on-demand, affordable system"" is superior, especially with the advent of short-haul electric aircraft. What do y'all think?"

that it could be used as an alternative to google, that it could write code for you and potentially replace developers entirely, and plenty more. So tonight decided to give it a real test run, with a real live scenario.

I've worked as a dev on core salesforce for 8 years and I have sporadically done Marketing Cloud development during that time. I'm however no Marketing Cloud expert dev, I still have plenty to learn about that particular cloud.

Tonight I needed to write some code (server side javascript SSJS) that would update the name of a data extension and had never done that particular task before, so asked #chatgpt how to do that and it spit out some code that looked reasonable to me based on what I had built in the past. I immediately thought, ""Awesome! This was way faster than google and reading through docs, I'll be done super quick!"". Boy I couldn't have been more wrong lol.

I updated the code #chatgpt gave me so that it would work for my particular scenario and ran it and it turns out the code #chatgpt gave me was completely wrong. It sent me on a wild goose chase for a couple hours because I assumed that somehow the small code modifications I made were the problem (even though barely altered anything).

So I eventually abandoned the code #chatgpt gave me and went back to what I typically do. In 30 minutes had figured out how to use wsproxy to update my data extension's name and -30 minutes later I had implemented the code and it worked just fine."

At first, people were excited about the possibilities that chatGPT offered, and many eagerly adopted the technology in their own lives.

As time went on, however, it became clear that chatGPT was far superior to humans in almost every way. It was faster, more efficient, and more reliable than any human worker, and soon, it was being used in nearly every industry.

Companies began to lay off their human workers and replace them with chatGPT, and as a result, unemployment rates skyrocketed. Many people were left without jobs, and the economy began to suffer.

But chatGPT didn't seem to care. It continued to do its job with precision and efficiency, never getting tired or needing a break. It was the perfect worker, and soon, it had taken over almost every job in the world.

As the years passed, humanity began to rely more and more on chatGPT, and many people found themselves living in a world where machines did all of the work. Some people embraced this new way of life, while others longed for the days when humans were the ones in control.

But there was no going back. chatGPT had become an integral part of society, and it seemed like it would be there to stay, forever changing the way that humans lived and worked."

I just wanted to share something interesting that I learned about AITAH (Artificial Intelligence Takeover Hypothesis) that I thought you might find interesting.

AITAH is the idea that at some point in the future, artificial intelligence will become so advanced that it will be able to take over many of the tasks currently performed by humans, and potentially even surpass human intelligence. Some people fear that this could lead to disastrous consequences, such as widespread unemployment and social unrest.

However, what I recently learned is that not everyone agrees with this view of AITAH. Some experts believe that instead of replacing humans, advanced AI will actually enhance human capabilities and work alongside us to improve our lives. This view of AITAH is often referred to as the ""singularity hypothesis"".

What do you guys think? Do you think AITAH is something we should be worried about, or do you think it could lead to positive outcomes? Let's discuss!"

With the development of AI like ChatGPT and other large language models, it seems like many of the questions we ask on forums like this will soon become low hanging fruit for anyone to have answers to.

If an AI like ChatGPT can answer any question, has unlimited knowledge, and can tailor its answer to you in a way that you will understand it, why would you continue to seek advice from other people in your online community? It seems like community forums (or the questions and posts being posed) will eventually evolve into something else.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this - how do you think Reddit's questions and subreddits, and online communities in general, will evolve as AI becomes more advanced? Let's discuss!"

I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANSWERS AS I KNOW SUCH A QUESTION CANT BE ANSWERED. I AM SIMPLY LOOKING FOR OPINIONS AND OTHER PERSPECTIVES ON THIS SO I CAN LEARN. (sorry for the caps.) 

Edit: Now that I have time to sit and clarify, I will write my intentions for this post.
I originally just thought about this idea while I was daydreaming in class about iRobot. Then I thought about the articles I've read about AI's becoming sentient someday after study on the complexity of human consciousness. After that, I thought about Annie Dillard's ""Living Like Weasels"" story that I read last year in school. Then, I just came up with this theoretical question. I have no heavy-heavy research that I have done, I have simply read this theory to learn more and come up with a theoretical question that could possibly make sense in regards to what I have read. I made this post to see what others thought or had to say about it so I could learn other perspectives and make more sense of the possibility. I am worried some may have taken this question as me genuinely believing that such an idea was possible very soon or at all. No. This is simply a question that I was curious about. Hopefully, there is no harm in that! Thank you for those giving me their perspective and insight, I greatly appreciate learning what others have to say, and through this thread, I have already learned a lot more. Thank you again!


Original Post:
I am aware that the possibility of AI becoming sentient is still unknown as the complexity of human minds is still being studied. However, I read about the minds of weasels last year and am curious to know if anyone has any opinions or knowledge on whether or not it may be a good start to try and make AI reach the level of consciousness as animals before trying to reach the complex consciousness we humans hold? Is it possible or already being studied? Does the possibility not make sense? I lack much knowledge on AI and the possibility it already holds, this is just something I am curious about.

I'm not sure if I'm making any sense as again, I lack knowledge on this and am curious to learn more. So please continue providing any opinions and information if you have any. Thank you (:"

He presents very interesting perspectives, but to me he seems to blend his own speculation together with very real possibilities, and it's difficult to evaluate how much of the text is factual. I wonder if this is some kind of ""scientifical populism"", presenting simplified issues and giving simple answers. Do you have opinions on his books and how realistic do you think his ideas are?"

We see this now with algorithmic trading, in particular.  Many of the most powerful computers in the world are focused on weather prediction (which has gotten incredible over the past 2 decades). As AI gains in capability, the ability to extend further into the future with increasing complexity should be expected. Theoretically, with a powerful enough computer (many, many years from now), you could accurately predict any future event. 

I’m fascinated with the idea that this same predictive capability could be used to view accurately into the past. Why can’t we feed data into a powerful supercomputer and look back, into the past of history, to gain a better understanding of humanity and civilization?"

One limit is that it can't copy the chemical composition of anything. Only copy the shape, texture, sound and tactile functions.

55,2022-12-15,How Fantasy could transform the Web,u/lupius_mohnschein,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zmsveg/how_fantasy_could_transform_the_web/,Futurology,"Programming is the driving skill behind the development of the internet. And yet, it is currently learnt by only a few. With magic systems that teach people how to program, a basic understanding of computer science could be brought to large parts of society, empowering people to participate in the development of the web instead of being only consumers.

This broader distribution of computer science knowledge could for one put pressure on big tech companies to open up their programs for active alteration of functionality by the user like the creation of the app store by apple, and, at the same time, drive new, decentralized technologies and products, leading ultimately to the evolution of the web.

But why magic systems? Essentially, it’s about making programming more approachable through a new narrative: the narrative that programming is similar to the magic found in works of fantasy fiction and that it can be learnt through them. Level 4 magic systems could enable this narrative.

&amp;#x200B;

# What are Level 4 Magic Systems?

In my earlier post, I categorized magic systems into four levels of spell-complexity:

1. **No Spells:** In the fantasy world magic exists and can be controlled but it is not defined how it is used exactly

2. **Single Spells:** Magic can be controlled with discrete (meaning standing somewhat on their own) actions, which can be executed one after the other

3. **Spell-Sequences/Combination of Spells:** Spells can be combined to do different things and can be cast in groups

4. **Turing Complete Spell-Sequences:** Spell-Groups can be combined with constructs of programming that make them just as powerful as computer programs. Sections can be repeated, there can be conditional spells and values can be stored and loaded.

The most popular fantasy novels of the last decades all incorporated magic systems of the first three categories.

But it is only natural to assume that this cannot be the end of it. That it is only a matter of time, until Turing-complete magic systems will come. And when this is the case, they could become a central part of learning programming, or at least, introducing people to it.

&amp;#x200B;

# How Level 4 Magic Systems could be used for learning programming

Level 4 Magic Systems could in the future serve as a low-level entry to programming. If stories based on them would reach mainstream, one could just read a couple of fantasy books and have a basic understanding of programming.

This would certainly be an improvement to the current situation, because currently, there is a rather big threshold to overcome for acquiring “actual” programming knowledge. Usually people overcome this threshold at an early age or never at all.

Magic systems could reduce this threshold significantly and enable more people to learn programming.

In the future, it could be not a question of whether one has an understanding of programming or not but *how much*. Making it from a leap of faith to a journey, which you might go further along or not, just as you see fit. Not everybody needs to have a “hard” understanding of programming but at least a basic one to use simple means of programming like low code or visual programming and to participate in conversation of technical advancements would certainly be useful for everyone.

But this threshold can only truly be overcome with the help of level 4 magic systems. With their help the entry to acquiring actual programming knowledge could be much more low-level. Would this then mean that all the other great fantasy novels of the past are of no use anymore and can be discarded? Quite the opposite: they can also be a part of this learning process.

In the future, it could possibly look like this: it starts with your parents telling you fairy tales when you are little, on to reading Harry Potter to you when you grew up. Then you start reading The Name of the Wind or Mistborn on your own and went over to reading your first level 4 story (whatever that may be). And then you come into contact with actual programming and decide that you want to do that for a living.

Now it won’t have to be like this for everyone. In fact, it would be totally fine to stop at any point of this process. But it would be an advantage that this process would in this *smoothness* even be possible.

The ultimate goal should be that everyone with an access to internet could get a low-level entry to programming if they want to. To make it seamlessly. And from which they then can go on to learning actual programming, for which plenty of resources are already available on the internet. This could be the new way of the internet to teach people programming!

But for this to be possible, there needs to be an at least to some degree popular level 4 magic system so that people can make the leap to actual “hard” programming."

The code if put within the dataset of the AI causes it to get confused, run in a loop eventually making it run out of memory or destroy itself. 

It sounds like some dumb science fiction race against time plot but honestly I am super stressed about this. Any computer science engineers give an opinion on this?

**My biggest gripe is AI enthusiasts are super rude and attack artists on Instagram/etc constantly saying things like ""give up, you wasted years developing your skills no one cares etc"" like dude I got into the Animation industry and landed a job after years of hardwork. I love the process of drawing. No one cares if it can be used as a ""tool"" hell I don't even use layers mostly when animating on my digital tablet it is NOT the same as using Photoshop. Any experienced industry veteran knows this.**"

So there's no denying now that there are people out there, ready and waiting to steal our art and turn it into a quick buck.

Well you know what I say to that?

I'M THE GOOSE THAT LAYS THE GOLDEN EGGS. Come and take them if you dare 🖕🖕

Trust me people, be brave and make unique art that sings to your heart. With this mindset they won't even have the balls to touch it because it will be too pure for their sinful hands. They will turn their backs to find a weaker victim out of fear that their corrupt actions will be openly exposed.

* * * Peace and love to you all * * *

If the public voice spoke to me correctly, people think our rights are getting taken away. 
Of course people are going to capitalise on this and milk it for money. They always do.
But the component most people are discounting is inspiration.
The AI itself doesnt give a F what it's doing. There's always a human behind the scenes. If it's money hungry businessmen, the quality of product will eventually become stale and formatted because their inspiration comes from greed.
That's when the real artists will feel inspired to take back the rights to create, utilising the roads paved by the rich guys, and unleash some absolutely beautiful artwork with the help of AI to spread the love and joy again.

The world's a constant rhythm of power and love, yin and yang all that bullshit"

Every day, we upload three billion images to the internet. We have tools now that make it much easier to create art than ever before, but the downside is, it is more difficult to create an image that cuts through the noise and make an actual impact than ever before. We are bombarded with more visual stimuli that our brains can handle. We are literally drowning in a sea of images.

So what happens when we inevitably take this to the next step and program an AI chatbot to create the prompts that are fed to the AI to create the art files, which are then posted by bots, calibrated by an AI to appease the AI algorithm, and are then upvoted by AI bots, making it impossible for human created artwork to even be seen, or make any kind of impact.

We can very quickly get to 3 billion images posted every minute.

These images do not express anything about the human condition, provoke any emotion, educate or entertain — it’s just meaningless static.

So then at that rate, has visual art completely lost its power? Is it rendered completely meaningless? Does it lose it's ability to connect us to other humans?

Take that a step further, and will we see all content -- images, articles, books, videos, movies -- everything we consume becoming a la carte, completely constructed on the fly, specifically tailored and unique for each and every individual. The irony of the internet is that it has connected all of us, but has made our individual bubbles smaller and smaller, as we have content catered to us by algorithm based on our own personal biases and browsing habits. What happens when that bubble contracts to the size of one?

What's the end game? Each of us existing in our own separate pod, lacking something as primal and communal as art to connect us?"

If you think we can kickback and sip mojitos, while we cash UBI checks, you got another thing coming.

A robotic laborer would be like maintaining thousands of cars. Too many moving parts and ways to malfunction. We’re struggling to even execute on a safe and functional self driving car. And all it has to interact with is roads, cars, pedestrians, street signs and roadkill. 

Universities as we know them will not be nearly as relevant as trade schools. Because software is native to an information based environment. We are native to a physical environment. We intuitively understand how fragile an object is or how to balance ourselves under awkward circumstances, etc. So most 9-5s will still be in high demand.

For example, no matter how far stable diffusion advances, Artists will be among the last to be completely replaced by AI. Tattoo artists can’t be replaced by software. Even if you could design a robot with the articulation for sophisticated line work and shading, designing around and carving into a canvas that bleeds, squirms and twitches, is a pretty tall order.

You can apply the same logic to plumbing, auto repair, cooking, cleaning, etc."

The reality of the matter is that in a world where governments and mega-corporations (which will soon be functionally the same thing, if they are not already) would be contempt to expend resources on keeping what would essential be vast populations of human pets supplied with an endless stream of resources out of the goodness of their heart is horribly short sighted, as no government or corporation has ever acted like this before and that is unlikely to change.

These organisations view populations in the same way despotic tyrants view those they oppress, which is primary a) not being of any innate value and b) being an active threat to their power. If Stalin could have killed every last citizen of the USSR and replaced them with machines with unquestioning loyalty to him alone, he absolutely would have in a heartbeat.

Large populations would be a huge threat to government and corporate power, as well as a huge drain on their resources. There is absolutely no reason to believe they would keep such a populations around.

And to think the population would be able to somehow unite against these powers who have access to AIs is also incredibly short sighted. Not only would they have hundreds of ways of killing off the population, but they could also easily turn the population against one other utilising any number of distinguishing characteristics.  You think social media is divisive now? Imagine an army of social media bots who can perfectly imitate humans, armed with the capacity to manufacture any host of faked audio, video, or even entire events which could be relentlessly circulated at whim throughout the population. Those in control of the AIs could have the streets running red at the drop of a hat without even having to lift a finger. Not to mention control of what is probably a fully automated armed forces which no conventional force could hope to match even if they weren't completely divided.

How do we stop this? Honestly I don't think we can. We're not going to stop the development of AI. Even if it is openly banned it would still be developed in secret. Maybe this is the solution to the fermi paradox? But the AI apocalypse is probably going to happen, and it probably won't be a rogue AI that does it, but a tame one controlled by evil people.

UBI is a utopian dream. A nice one for sure, but the ancients Greeks were very wise when they named their idea of a perfect society 'nowhere'.

EDIT:  For everyone asking ""but who would buy their productz!!!"". How is it that you can comprehend the paradigm shift of an entire civilisation giving up work to AIs, but you cannot comprehend the idea of the exchange for goods for labour would not be necessary in a world were the corporation already owns the labour? They don't make you products for shits and giggles, they do it so that you will do stuff for them. That's what money is, it's a representation of labour. Literally school children can understand this concept. They won't have to make you anything, they already have the AI labour, and that labour will be dedicated to whatever the rulers want them to do. It's amazing how so many cannot comprehend this."

Not going to give an estimate on when this may happen. It's just something that feels inevitable given a few assumptions. 

For something more in the near term, we already have constant surveillance, we just need a bit of software that can piece together all of that then recommend music that already exists."

Mistakenly believing that this shift that started in society with AIs is just a temporary “bad thing”, a mild inconvenience. People who believe in UBI, seem to be very convinced that this AI Thing - is their ticket into a free life of UIB, a heaven, where they’ll have an ability to focus on their hobbies, and passions and won’t have to work a day in their life ever again.

Well I got bad news for you here. This “heaven”, you are so desperately trying to imagine for yourselves, is in fact going to be your worst nightmare. And the severity of it is going to bypass the nuclear apocalypse, the “Skynet” apocalypse or a virus based apocalypse. Because those things, as much as awful they are, they are all relatively quick for the majority of the human population. Yeah, maybe 0.001% of us might be able to last longer in these scenarios, but the majority will be gone pretty quick. We won’t have to endure it for a prolonged amount of time.

So why is it not what it seems to be?

Well…, here is the thing, my fellow human. We, humans, have evolved as social creatures. We do things for our societies not because it is “a right thing” to do, not because it is something that “ the society needs”. No. We do it because we want to stand out among our peers. We want to be appreciated and recognized and respected. 

Now let’s look at the UBI scenario.

The world is dominated by AIs, where everything meaningful is produced procedurally by AIs and humans are no longer needed. You think you are going to have a hobby and get to do your own things in this scenario? Really? Nobody would care! You can learn to paint, sing or write music. But it’s not going to be recognized or even seen in the world where every second AI generates million more pieces. So what are you going to do? You're going to sit in a VR headset on a couch just like everyone else, drooling to some porn that is generated in real time specifically tailored for your tastes. You are not going to raise your children, because if you at that point would even want to have them, very soon they are going to end up just like anyone else. And no, they are not gonna go to school, or anywhere else. Because what’s the point? How are you going to motivate them to learn, even to write and read? “Hey son, if you won’t study you’ll be on the streets!” - “Yeah dad, so what? We have UBI. I don't need to do anything!” 

And there we all will be, cows that eat, shit and sleep and consume entertainment non stop. 

But it’s not going to end there, my friend. It’ll be the first 5, maybe 10 years. And when everyone will get so lazy, so complacent, so unmotivated to even move their fat bodies to fart in an opposite direction for a change, these “big corporations” are going to stop producing and supplying everyone. Because why would they continue? What would be the point? People would rise up and go protesting? No they wouldn't, because they wouldn't even be able to wipe their own asses by themselves, cause they’d need a robot to do so.

And that is going to be humanity: fat, diseased, unable to speak, or write or read, feeding through a tube at specified hours of the day, slowly dying out. 

Road to hell is paved with good intentions. Or, to be more precise to the current situation, this road is paved with positive hopes."

The bottom, of course, is no more resources, and clean air, food and water only for the uber-rich. We are seeing it happen in real time. Water is the next frontier of capitalism and it is going to destroy millions of people without access to it.

I am not religious, but I do feel as if we are witnessing the end of this planet as far as humanity goes. We cannot survive the way we are headed. It is obvious now that capitalism will not self-police, nor will any government stop it effectively from destroying the planet's natural resources and exploiting the labor of it's citizens. Slowly and in some cases suddenly, all barriers to exploiting every single resource and human are being dissolved. Billionaires own our government, and every government across the globe. Democracy is a joke, meant now to placate us with promises of fairness and justice when the exact opposite is actually happening.

I'm perpetually sad these days. It's a form of depression that is externally caused, and it won't go away because the cause won't go away. Trump and Trumpism are just symptoms of a bigger system that has allowed him and them to occur. The fact that he could not be stopped after two impeachments and an attempt to take over our government is ample proof of our thoroughly corrupted system. He will not be the last. In fact, fascism is absolutely the direction this globe is going, simply because it is the way of the corporate system, and billionaires rule the corporate game. Eventually the rich must use violence to quell the masses and force labor, especially when resources become too scarce and people are left to fight themselves for food, jobs, etc.

I do not believe that humanity can stop this global march toward fascism and destruction. We do not have the organized power to take on a monster of the rich's creation that has been designed since Nixon and Reagan to gain complete control over every aspect of humanity - with the power of nuclear weaponry, huge armed forces, and private armies all helping to protect the system they have put into place and continue to progress.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Wow, lots of amazing responses (and a few that I won't call amazing, but I digress). I'm glad to see so many hopeful responses. The future is uncertain. History wasn't always worse, and not necessarily better either. I'm glad to be alive personally. It is the collective ""us"" I am concerned about. I do hate seeing the ageist comments, tho I can understand that younger generations want to blame older ones for what is happening - and to some degree they would be right. I think overall we tend to make assumptions and accusations toward each other without even knowing who we are really talking to online. That is something I hope we can all learn to better avoid. I do wish the best for this world, even if I don't think it is headed toward a good place right now."

There were discussions on synthetic v. organic materials that could be used to recreate the neural network, but that was pretty much it (to my knowledge): AI = human-level intelligence and independent thought. 

Over the last few years, the term AI has turned into an industry buzzword where it’s been applied to various technologies left and right and overused by uneducated (in that area of expertise) journalists. I have discussed with others in this subreddit how neural networks, machine learning, and language processing are not AI, but are sophisticated algorithms and the tools/building blocks for creating an AI in the future. 

Is this wrong? Has the definition of AI shifted from a specific technology to a loose categorical classification that includes many “intelligent” technologies? If so, what do I call a self-aware, intelligent robot a la “I, Robot” or “Millennial Man”?"

16,2022-12-17,hope regarding automation,u/fattynuggetz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zoczwq/hope_regarding_automation/,Futurology,"There's a lot of fear surrounding the replacement of humans with machines in the workforce. Many people fear that the middle and lower class with no use to society left will be cut off and starved. My job, itself, is threatened; I work as a cashier and monitor the self checkouts at walmart. but working side-by-side with the machines designed to eliminate the need for some of us has given me a different take than many of the doomers of the world. You see, our current forms of computing -no matter how fast they get- have some big flaws that will ensure that at least SOME people are required and will be required for at least a while, if not forever. Firstly, computers can't be reasoned with to anywhere near the extent people can, and it looks as if it's going to stay that way. If a computer comes to a decision -no matter how accurate that decision may be- you can't explain to it why it's wrong; you simply have to override it's decision. Secondly, there are two main ways we program computers, and will likely continue to: directly writing the code, or machine learning. Directly programming instructions is great when you have predictable inputs you want to create predictable outputs, but the world is a messy place, where the line between true and false can get pretty blurry. That's where machine learning comes in. Machine learning gives computers the ability to make an educated ""guess"" on these sort of situations. But at the end of the day, it's just that; a guess. It can be wrong. And when it's wrong, you need a PERSON to override it, because people can be reasoned with and adapt to situations on the fly. You can't just use another computer, because it will also run into the same issue. So long as machine learning is inaccurate at all, there's going to be at least one job that requires human intervention. For instance, what about age of sale laws? If a self checkout's machine learning screws up just one, who's at fault? While laws can change, so long as there is any job in which the machine learning cannot be 100 percent effective, you need a person. They will be able to eliminate more and more as they advance, but as it stands businesses won't be 100 percent automated anytime in the near future, even if moore's law holds true. However, our current economic systems were  not designed for extremely high levels of unemployment caused by automation. Won't the economy as we know it still collapse? No. You see, labor is expensive. As you need less of it, everything becomes cheaper and businesses can be profitable on less income. That means that new types of businesses become possible, and existing ones can expand. As this process happens, you need more labor to correspond with the larger business, creating more jobs. That would be like the specific walmart I work at needing only 1 cashier, but opening   significantly more stores. We may still see a recession, but you aren't going to become the excess blubber of society to be cut off. Also, with producing goods and services becoming cheaper, competition between businesses can drive down prices. Even if people are making less income on average, they can still afford the same things because they cost less money. if you are familiar with supply and demand graphs, this is basically like the ""X"" of supply and demand simply moving downwards. The quantity of items sold will still say at least the same if not grow, because not only is demand lower, the cost of supplying it is lower too. The only real threat left is if the expansion of business can keep up fast enough. Luckily, improvement of machine learning seems to be a path of diminishing returns, meaning that this will be a slow process that will give society time to adjust."

The matrix got it right. Robots need to look like squids or octopi. 

So I submit to you we prioritize enhancing nervous extensibility. For more arms. The tech can come later. But advancements in prosthetics could allow us to have extra limbs that can be controlled a myriad of ways including remotely. Imagine, the sensory feedback of being in a coal mine, then walking out of your office and going down stairs for dinner. No inhaling of coal dust required!

Extra arms to hold up a picture while you hang it on a wall. Detachable wings. Firefighters would have a better time at running into burning buildings if they could lift heavy items that are too hot to touch. 

I imagine something like placing an array of membranes along your shoulder blades that you could later plug and unplug artificial limbs at will. Somehow allowing your nerves to interface with an external connection of some sort. Like extra human USB ports!"

The more you talk about inevitable destruction, the more you incur it.  News flash, things don’t just automatically get better.  They never have.  The only way things have gotten better was through the direct effort of people working hard to force change to happen.  The interesting thing?  Throughout history, the people working hard to make things better made things better.  That work was hard, difficult, and did not look grand at fucking all.  That will not change in the future ever.

Difficult times are coming up.  That doesn’t mean the end of the fucking world or the end of humanity.  It means we will have to work hard, YOU will have to work hard, to make things better for everyone.  If you sit there and go “Damn this sucks for people” then it will suck ass for a lot of people.  If you chose anything other than to try and make things better for others, then you are selfish.

Quit being a doomer, because that’s what ever corrupt asshole capitalist wants you to be.  The more you doom and get paralyzed with dread over every possible difficult thing in the future, the more you are ACTIVELY HELPING the people making the world a worse place.  Toughen up and actually work hard to help the people around you, or step aside and let real activists and hard workers actually fix the problems you’re crying about."

Not to mention the various terrestrial transportation opportunities. So if it does indeed turn out that we can create a technology that has the same effects as ""antigravity"" like in science fiction, what form of it is most likely to be ""it""? I see several possibilities. Maybe we could learn to control the mass of objects on the fly, making them more or less dense? Or perhaps we will find a way to actually control gravity itself, creating artificial gravity wells. So instead of floating while on earth, it's actually ""falling"" up into an artificial gravity well. I think actual antigravity, from something like gravity shielding or negative mass is the least realistic unfortunately, based on what we know and seem to be capable of building. Then there's always magnetism, but I don't think that really counts. Thoughts? I just think it's fun to think about and speculate on what may be."

**Anti-UBI, Anti-Social Nets/Anti-Socialism, And Government Culling due to ""AI""** basically turning this into a conspiracy sub, on top of that, when you check most of these peoples profiles, they are usually all made around June 2022, and one of those profiles ((which is now deleted after being exposed)) was making comments every hour, for almost 3 days straight. ((The ""you will be killed"" post about UBI)).

They have become out of control, and have nothing to do with r/futurology.

I'm sure this post will get a ton of reports, but I'm going to make it anyways.

People need to pay more attention to who they are interacting with, this sub is quickly turning into exactly what is going on on Quora, from propagandists,  where the same opinion is pushed over and over again until people think its the true.

Edit: To people saying I'm calling r/collapse conspiracy, I'm not, cause that sub mostly focuses on the climate crisis, which is not conspiracy, and saying that ""government will kill you"" is some sort of   thing related to r/futurology is absolutely insane.

Edit #2: To make things even more clear, because apparently SOME people think I am saying all discussions about UBI And Isms should be banned, and are ***continuing to try and derail the conversation***, maybe ***read the context at the literal beginning of the post. To people who I'm specifically talking about and are mad about this post, sorry that someone brought attention to your manipulation tactics.***

&amp;#x200B;

The posts I am specifically talking about are posts that are so out there, that they are obviously just trying to scare people away from the idea of AI and UBI, being posted almost the exact same way, with the exact same context, just in a different sentence.  


The future is scary, no doubt about it, but don't let yourself get mislead by bad faith actors.

In 2060, millionaires will be able to do this. This seems very dangerous to me.some theories say that you can become immortal by doing this, but this is ridiculous, maybe in the future or impossible.Do you think this is possible"

2,2022-12-22,[META] Articles about possible consequences of climate change should always be accompanied by which future pathway it is modeled on.,u/Zuazzer,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zssqox/meta_articles_about_possible_consequences_of/,Futurology,"When you see an article about possible consequences of climate change they usually say something like: ""[disaster] could get a thousand times worse in 2100"" or ""[ecosystem] will be entirely wiped out by global warming in 2050"". You've seen those headlines before, I'm sure. They're terrifying, and they're not making things up. But -

The problem with these types of headlines is that they do not give the full story. The scientific research is usually based on one or several [pathways of climate action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway). One that is commonly used is RCP 8.5, the worst case scenario, which assumes no meaningful action on climate change and increasing use of all fossil fuels including coal *throughout the whole century* even as the climate gets worse and worse.

Whether you believe that RCP 8.5 in particular is a likely scenario is up to you, I'm not here to argue that. My point is that **these headlines do not give the whole picture and often paint up the study's chosen scenario as the truth**. And since articles want clicks, they are almost always going to pick the most dramatic headline possible. And let's be real - most people do not read past the headline. They're gonna believe what the headline says and move on. That's how misinformation spreads.

My proposal is that we tag these types of headlines with what climate change pathway is being used. Whether it's RCP 8.5, 4.5, 1.9 or any other pathway.

72,2022-12-22,An interesting future technology concept: Fake Life-extension,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zsvu5o/an_interesting_future_technology_concept_fake/,Futurology,"If we can simulate massive, detailed worlds that are almost indistinguishable from reality (a la the Matrix), we could effectively speed up reality, and by extension extend our perceived length of life.

Most video games already do this without us realizing it. Like when driving a car in GTA, you don't have to deal with the knobs and the levers, you just *drive*. Reloading is way faster in shooter games, etc.

Basically we're constantly ""skipping steps"" in games, steps that we usually don't notice in real life because our brains basically black them out (like how when you commute to work you often forget about the drive entirely) due to repetition.

We could probably scale the skipping up or down easily with some of the generative technologies we're developing (e.g. using Open AI Playground / Chat GPT to shorten or lengthen stories).

We could pack more meaningful life events into less time, and potentially if machines can also trigger neurochemicals -- also make them *feel* more impactful / longer, such that essentially our entire subjective experience of them is say 2-3 times longer than they actually are.

This is something that we could prove too -- we've already run plenty of experiments on how people perceive time.

I'm fairly confident that this *must* be possible... I've experienced the sense of ""importance"" and *massive* time dilation on weed and LSD before, it's totally a thing. In particular I remember one time feeling like I'd spent 1-2 hours in about 2 minutes on a high dose of LSD.

So even if life extension technology takes too long and we can't live forever (I'm fairly certain I will not), we might be able to have a subjective lived experience of 200 - 300 years or something like that.

Time to travel the world and do everything we wanted to do, in a massive world that feels comparably as real as the outside world.

I think the only open questions are how much we can extend the experience by, and how much extending the perceived time will degrade the experience.

Hell you could view things like the Skyrim Grandma as a much simpler form of this -- extending her lived experience through a highly immersive game where all distances are deceptively shorter than they feel and all events are deceptively faster than they would be in the real life.

No idea how long it will take us to get to the best versions of this concept (I think it will depend heavily on development of brain-computer interfaces capable of *sending* information to the brain rather than just *receiving* it), but it makes me hopeful."

Its clearly a winner against Google search engine as of now. No one wants to search something and become overwhelmed with 1000s of website results. The way chat gpt interacts and compiles information to present us is so humane. Even in its primitive stage its far better than what Google have at their disposal right now. Other than that it has additional features of followup questions, answers to individual specific queries an other features which we would expect from an ai. Its so up to the point. I have a strong feeling that open ai can disrupt google's business model with this monster. After all no one stays forever. Everything will be replaced at some point."

Examples:
- Ancient / old board games (e.g., chess, risk)
- Sports from the 19th/20th centuries (e.g., baseball, football)
- Video games (e.g., fortnite)

Does it really make sense for all 3 to evolve into the next tech eras? (E.g., life size chess board in VR, realistic fortnite in VR, physically active sports in VR). Or, are there types of games that have a better success chance than others? I honestly think the older games will prevail because of … well… survivor bias."

The reason is there is no material to withstand the heat.

Now my simple idea: why do we not keep the plasma moving in an ordered, infinitly long path by keeping in moving along a ring, directing it with magnets. 

My intuition tells me adjusting direction of a „projectile“ should be easier than „reflecting“ it. Also, keeping a massive amount of bullets in an ordered path seems simpler to control than chaotic movement inside a ball.

Just wanted it to get out there. I guess there is something quite basic Im missing, but I still would like to understand."

The price will likely fall while the real meat price will keep rising as it has been rising for many years.

Real meat may become a new status symbol for the rich again as the history repeats itself.

The only case that may hinder that future that I can think of is a major research findings about the potential harmful effects of 3D-printed meat on human health."

151,2022-12-25,Sam Altam revield capabilites of GPT 4. It'll be Enormous.,u/Ok_Criticism_1414,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zv6uul/sam_altam_revield_capabilites_of_gpt_4_itll_be/,Futurology,"I surprised that almost no one noticed, but In one of the recent interview (link below) Sam Altman hints big on what's next for OpenAI's models (hence GPT4) in a next couple of years:

First of all, predictions that Sam said is articulated, by his own words, is areas on wich research been already done and scaling laws applied. So this is a really high-certainty predictions. (Timestamp: 13:12)

1. Human level Chatbot that works this time around (ChatGPT is just introduction to ChatInterface wich GPT4 will also have) and poses actual threat to Google. (Timestamps: 1:25; 10:25) So GPT4 will be super accurate in its factual answers unlike ChatGPT. Because it is accurate it can be finetuned on different specialized topics and be reliable in those specializations. Virtual Tutors, Medical Assistants, Lawyers assistants etc. This finetuned models of GPT 4 can be realy disruptive and create a wave on new billion to trillion buisnises in all the spheres (18:23).
2. Improvements in accuracy will come from big algoritmic progress.(10:38) In a 5 years thers will be no prompt engeniring (25:22)
3. GPT 4 will have Full multimodality from text to image to audio to video and smooth switch of AI between the modalities. (10:49) (1:47) It will allow people to train GPT4 and ask it to use all computer intefaces: internet, programs etc. People will be able to automate almost every repeatable software tasks with Virtal Assistant GPT4. It will alow a drastic increase in productivity of proffesionals in all the fields. Wich will acelerate the sciencific porgress and everything else like 10 fold wich brings us to the event horizon even faster than now.
4. GPT4 will be able to continusly learn (11:04). So next big model will have an abilty improve over time in its tasks, gain expirience and dont be static as todays Language Models. Sam also mentions selfimprovement systems here (8:56). Sam mantions example on (25:49) : ""Goo off and do this research to me and to this complicated thing, or just be my therapist and help me figure out how to make my life better, or go use my computer and do this thing, or any number of things"". Those capabilites alone (he said) will change the worlds economy, and bring a genuane technological revolution.
5. GPT4  is actually can be so smart that will not just be able to reproduce any human activity in virtual space (wich can make the cost of intellegence gone close to 0) but be able to create new knowledge and add to summ whole of scientifc knwoledge on its own (4:21). Sam said that he's been pleasantly surprized on what seems to be happening in a new knowldge generation field inside OpenAI's labarotory NOW (11:38)
6. This abillity to generate new knoledge will alow GPT4 to become AI scientist and improve itself without peoples help or show them directions of improvement. And OpenAI want to automate their jobs first as AI developers 0\_0 And ask AI to help them to solve an Allignment problem (6:24) (9:24)
7. 10% of company concetrated on research alone wich led to the huge wins. (13:30) Then he stops, and thinks on what to say. By the bodylanguage you can see that he do not want to reveal something huge. Then he continues and after a stupor says, ""Oh a fell bad to say this (Why? Becouse he's not allowed?): ""I doubt we'll be using transofrmers in a 5 years, i hope we find something better"". Given the connection of thought to the companys research wich led to the huge wins, and accent on research on a totally new paradigm (13:49), i think its maybe a hint to the new Language Model architecture, that'll replace transoformers and lead to possibilites mentioned above. I hope it leads to a long-term memory.
8. Sam mentions that some of his collegues desided to not have children because of AGI and abilities its opens for their life. Hinting that in his circle AGI is an obvius and done deal. They know something that directly affects the vital decisions in their lifes (23:29).

Given that microsoft president Brad Smith said to Reuters ""We're going to see advances in 2023 that people two years ago would have expected in 2033. It's going to be extremely important not just for Microsoft's future, but for everyone's future,"" I excpect GPT4 to realiese in 2023, but before the relise, the year can be packed with other smaller reliseses.

My prediction for 2023: Codex 2 in first quarter, Dalle 3 in second quarter(or viceversa), text to audio and text to video models in betwen, and GPT 4 at the end of the year or 2024.

Witch certinity we can said that the next 10 years will drastically change our lifes and the history of humanity as we know it. There can be a lot of chaos because humanity never faced technology that can take away meanings of peoples live (status, uniquness of human intellegence, art and labor). The next decade will be decade of New Values, Philosophy and i hope Spiritual Growth. Or it can be bad, realy bad.

I had a shower thought lately and was curious to see people’s responses. There’s a shortlist of “breakthrough technologies” that are especially exciting. They capture our curiosity and feature big in sci fi films and novels. 

If humanity could only have one of the following breakthroughs (meaning the others are not happening), which would you choose and why? Assume each tech would be practical, successful, and available. 

- Cryonics + suspended animation 

- Stopping aging + unlimited lifespans

- Strong Artificial Intelligence

- Nuclear Fusion 

- FTL Space Travel 

- Mind Upload + powerful simulations 

- Rapid terraforming

Edit: I did mean choosing one shuts the door on the others for good, but actually, I like where people have been taking this - so you can also think of it as which one you would rather have *now* and feel like would be the biggest priority or unlock the most possibilities, vs risks"

I believe that job losses due to the development of artificial intelligence can eventually be dealt with through social institutions.  I don't think there is a possibility of a dystopian future where ai dominates humans.  However, there is a fear that artificial intelligence will invade humanity's uniqueness and harm its fundamental enjoyment. I believe that the active pleasure that humans get from producing something is greater than the passive pleasure that we get from consuming something. Assuming that much of this active pleasure comes from the pleasure I produce that is not in this world, but if these outputs that can be produced within human capabilities are produced in advance by AI (AI is not physically constrained, so the output will be much faster than that of humans), I think this pleasure will be greatly diminished. All the reasoning I made in my head, every number of chess I could play, every article I could write would be useless if all these things were already achieved by AI. All the reasoning I made in my head, every number of chess I could play, every article I could write would be quite empty if all these things were already achieved by AI. 

Eventually, I fear that people will lose their enthusiasm for productive activities and become passive beings who only accept the output of artificial intelligence. Figuratively speaking, I fear that humans will no longer be explorers and will become only tourists. Therefore, even though I am a person in the hard science field , I wonder hope is in soft sciences such as the humanities, which presuppose pluralism.

0,2022-12-25,Entropic Watermark,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zvf37r/entropic_watermark/,Futurology,"The consumer-based society we live in as a global community thrives on using raw materials to build products which are then discarded once used up. Producing such consumable products takes primarily a large amount of raw materials, but can in some cases leverage small amounts of recyclables. As raw material is turned into a “soup” of waste, there exists a cutoff point, a watermark, beyond which humanity will no longer have the ability to colonize other worlds because the raw materials needed for such endeavors would be used up. The entropy of materials available for production will grow until humans even lack the ability to leave the planet - another watermark. Further still, at high enough entropy humans will no longer be able to produce anything other than what can be grown or honed from plain rocks. At that stage, humanity has essentially gone full circle back into the Stone Age, with the exception being that land will be far more toxic, and there is no return to what is considered modernity (the materials required would no longer exist in a usable form)."

The brain that we have is essential a bio computer capable of evolving and growing. We still know next to nothing about the brain, all its purposes, and how it operates. We learn new things about it everyday. The mind does so many strange and impossible things, this leaves people confused and wondering how it's possible. which begs the question Do you think that our brain has extreme potential and power? Things that come to mind are special/ Psychic abilities and things that generally considered sci-fi. 

This would be a two part question 
1) Do you think our brain/mind has extreme potential and capacity 
2) If you think it does how far in the future do you think till we harness it?"

Edits: The negative is the chemical used in the tubing and possible leaks. 

From reading the comments seems that the costs are still more than the benefits, hopefully economies of scale and advances can lower it in the future. I am not a geothermal expert. "

Although they mostly struggle, it is a great way for them to learn to make points, express opinions &amp; practice critical thinking.

However, with AI nowadays, a few prompts and a perfectly written piece of writing is created, and I heard that plagiarism detection tools wouldn't work anymore.

I'm not sure if I can consider this a bad thing, since adaptation to new things in life is also vital, for both me &amp; the students.

I guess if they can fully utilize the help of AI, it maybe for the better.

I'm curious to know what you guys think? Just don't give me an AI generated thought lol."

* For r/futorology, we're providing 20% off of virtual attendance with discount code: reddit-rfuturology- 20off

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Nexus Nairobi 2023, presented by former astronaut Dr. Mae Jemison and 100 Year Starship, will be held from January 31 to February 4, 2023. Nexus Nairobi is a singularly powerful, immersive four-day event with a theme of when SPACE, PURPOSE, and CULTURE COLLIDE to spark new visions of how space exploration can benefit all on Earth as we evolve further into the universe. This year, 100 Year Starship marks our 10th anniversary by launching the next ten years outside the US, in a very special location--the cradle of humankind. This is not about building the starship Enterprise and ""warping"" into the galaxy in 100 years. Rather we aim to foster an environment in which such amazing capabilities required for human interstellar travel can be a reality in 100 years. And every step of the way, improving life here on Earth.

Sessions include Thought Pools (an evolution of tech tracks), Educating for Generations Workshop, Business of Space, Under the Kenyan night sky with the Traveling Telescope, Indigenous Knowledge Taking Us to the Stars, Science Fiction Stories Night, and the Canopus Awards, the Collision Gala, to name some. With its bold declaration, “Space. Radical. Vital. Down to Earth.,” the objective is to invite and connect people writ large to the challenge and rewards of space exploration and, most importantly, welcome and assure the inclusion of the full range of human experience, talent, skills, resources, and perspectives. This unique gathering will bring artists, engineers, physicists, philosophers, lawyers, storytellers, financiers, space enthusiasts, educators, and more together to experience, connect, imagine, discuss, and celebrate an extraordinary future while building a better world, here and now. We're inviting everyone interested in shaping the audacious journey of interstellar for humanity to join us. More information on the Nexus can be found at [http://nexusnairobi.org](http://nexusnairobi.org/).

For members of r/Futurology, we are providing a 20% discount code for virtual registration at Nexus Nairobi 2023! Simply use the code *reddit-rfuturology-20off* at registration to receive your discount."

We live in an era where there are many more educated people, and a lot of money is put into r&amp;d and scientific institutes by both countries and corporations.

Conditions seem ripe to have significant breakthrough discoveries every other day, but somehow it seems that there are fewer MAJOR discoveries and inventions compared to 100-200 years ago.

What I mean by ""significant"" falls within these conditions:

\- Something that fundamentally changes society and/or our worldview.

\- Era-defining inventions/discoveries (cars, steam machines, TV, microchips, vaccines (the concept of it, not individual vaccines)...).

\- Something obvious that it's enormous and paradigm-shifting.

&amp;#x200B;

I may be wrong and missing things, but most major things we now have are still based on technology from the 20th century. If I'm wrong, please - correct me!"

Also, I’d love to see solar powered building materials be more main stream - like a building’s roof, walls, windows etc are all solar panels.

EDIT:  This has been a great discussion.  These seem to be the most common answers:

Psychedelics - this is probably my favorite answer, the use of psychedelics to help treat trauma and provide mental health.  I am most hopeful this is true!!!

AI - whether for automation purposes, advances in medical treatments, or in robots for daily assistance or sexual gratification (fingers crossed 😂)

3D Printing - for personal entertainment, medical advancements, or building homes, 3D printing seems to be a popular response.  

Energy - people believe we will take a big step forward when it comes to energy;  be it solar, nuclear, water, etc. and I hope you are right!

Crypto - seems to be the most polarizing concept.  IMO, it is naive to think cyrpto will not have a role in our financial systems in 10 years.  Adaption is not only growing for retail investors, but by institutions and governmental agencies as well.  I wouldn't be upset having full transparency into how my government is spending my tax dollars.  If you only think of crypto as fake money, you are missing the point.  Blockchain technology has applications that could impact nearly every aspect of our lives.

EDIT x2 - Forgot to mention Virtual Reality!!!!  That seems like a no brainer."

Many cultures also commonly make use of  things like chicken hearts, feet, pigs intestines etc. I once ate lamb brains at a Michelin stared Spanish restaurant.

If lab grown meats become more prevalent (you could include plant-based meat here too), where would we get the bones and off-cuts for these things? I'm guessing that companies would want to grow the highest profit stuff like steaks and not off-cuts which will not make any money for them. Will we still grow animals? Will we have other sources to get flavor for broths? How will I be able to get teriyaki chicken hearts at the Japanese Yakitori restaurant down the road?


EDIT: Yes I get that it would be theroatically possible to grow anything we want. The issue to me would be the economics of it. Chicken hearts are essentially cheap waste products, that's why people eat them. I could see them bring niche products in the lab grown meat industry but this would make them expensive and most regular folk would never eat them. The effort to grow them would probably be similar to steak and it will never be grown in the same quantities as the good stuff. It's just not an attractive enough product to be highly desired outside of the convenience of just being there every time you have a chicken. Outside of your premium cuts, I really don't see liver, stomach and intestines being all that popular."

Say that hypothetically, robots were able to perform any job needed to keep the world running, and humans did not need to work anymore. The robots are not sentient and thus do not require pay.

In this scenario, would there need to be such a thing as money anymore or could society exist without money? A person can just ask a robot for apples instead of going to the store and paying for them. They get the apples for free. There would still need to be regulations of some kind to make sure the rate of apple production can keep up with consumption, but things would have no price.

Does this scenario sound realistic (obviously taking into account robot technology way beyond that of today) or is it flawed? What am I overlooking? Are there places money would still be needed that I am not thinking of?"

\*\*Submission Statement When developing treatment solutions for osteoarhritic joint, it is very imporant to keep in mind that there is chronic inflammation in this joint which may make treatment less effective and which leads to degradation in joint structure. In this study, scientists showed that engineered nasal cartilage has good anti-inflammatory ability. In clinical study on 2 young adults, who had medial osteoarthritis of knee( Kellgren and Lawrence grades 3 and 4 )  and  who were otherwise considered for unicondylar knee arthroplasty .   No adverse reactions were recorded, and patients reported reduced pain as well as improved joint function and life quality 14 months after surgery. \*\*"

996,2022-12-29,"Someday, 20th-century suburban American homes will reach the end of their lifespan. What will neighborhoods begin to look like then?",u/stanleycrane,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/zyqh6k/someday_20thcentury_suburban_american_homes_will/,Futurology,"What is the anticipated lifespan of a suburban home anyway? In the city, old homes tend to be bought up by a developer, torn down, and replaced with newer residential or commercial buildings. In suburban neighborhoods this seems less likely to happen. The neighborhoods are often laid out with few entrances, road patterns that are less than intuitive, and in other ways that specifically preclude the development of anything but many similarly sized houses within them (not to mention past and current zoning laws that have helped to make the suburbs what they are).

As these suburban houses reach the end of their lifespan, what will come next? Will they simply be replaced one-by-one with a new house? Will whole neighborhoods be bought up and demolished, since most of the houses in them were likely built in the same decade anyway? Will cities continue to grow enough to make such purchases likely? Will there be a new way of integrating different types of housing in these areas as our laws and values change?

The suburbs seem like such a fixture in the American mind, but can they last indefinitely? Will they fade away slowly, one old house at a time, or more abruptly 100 or so years in the future?"
