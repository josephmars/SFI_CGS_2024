1,2023-07-31,CMV: Standardized testing is a great way to measure student achievement,u/Jackolantern668,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15ex6ey/cmv_standardized_testing_is_a_great_way_to/,changemyview,"   Just last year, I became a math teacher. As you all know, standardized testing is an important part of the teaching profession. Entire weeks are set aside for students to take these state and district assessments. While it can be inconvenient, I think that ultimately, standardized testing is a blessing. There are two main reasons why I think it is a great way to measure student achievement. 

 The first reason is that it measures whether students can accurately apply state or district standards within a limited time frame. The reality is that people don't have an unlimited amount of time for everything. In the real world, you have to be able to accomplish major goals in a specific period of time. Those who can't do so generally have a tough time in the workplace. What use is it that a student knows, for instance, how to multiply or divide, if he or she can't efficiently use this skill to solve real problems that have an actual time limit? Of course, classroom tests can do the same. But they aren't always based on clear standards so their usefulness in determining student achievement is comparatively limited. 

  The second reason is that it ensures it helps reduce the distortion caused by inaccurate grading. From what I have read and experienced myself, grade inflation is a significant problem. Depending on the teacher, students can get points just for good behavior (i.e. showing up to class on time). My first year of teaching, I was basically guilty of this since I put in plenty of participation grades to help me utilize all grading categories and meet the ""x amount of grades per week"" requirement. This can give the wrong impression of where the students actually are. Standardized tests mitigate this problem because they give us an idea of whether students truly mastered the criteria set by government. 

   I am open to changing my view if I can be persuaded that standardized testing is either doesn't really measure what it sets out to measure or if it is fundamentally flawed in other ways. I know that there are educators who are very critical of standardized testing, a former teacher of mine being one of them. Hopefully, I can better understand where they are coming from."

Some people don't want to work hard, invest in themselves, go outside their comfort zone or do whatever it takes to improve their life. 

This generation seems to be worse than others due a number of reasons.

You have 24 hours in a day, spend a couple of those learning, practising, investing in yourself then maybe you'll see an improvement.

There's bound to be lots of arguments I am open to a discussion and discussing views."
1,2023-07-31,"CMV: Poorer people who ignore all the easier ways to make more money in favor of the ""big prize"" option of being a famous rich person are more bound by ideology than practicality",u/ExitingTheDonut,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15ey6l1/cmv_poorer_people_who_ignore_all_the_easier_ways/,changemyview,"They're not being true to themselves. Let's assume we're applying only to single people with no kids. They seem stuck in dead-end loop but don't have other dependents as financial burdens sucking up their money and time. No big responsibilities other than keeping a job and a roof over their head.

They have a dream of a millionaire job where they are a famous performer in acting or music. There are many easier ways to increase your income without having to live paycheck to paycheck. Don't they know them or are they just avoiding them on purpose? And a lot of these big chains have accelerator opportunities for their service workers. Work at Starbucks for example, they offer monetary aid to further your education. They should take advantage of this while they're still child-free. But I see people including one of my relatives, in their 30s still with the idea that it's big time celebrity or nothing. It gets more embarrassing when they've already past the young adult years and still thinking like this.

If the idea is that they prefer a career path that takes them away from anything ""corporate bootlicker"" then maybe they have trouble be honest about themselves. If they were honest, they would say, ""I hates poverty but I hate being a corporate drone more"" Is that the real reason you'd ignore the options that are more statistically likely to increase your pay? Ironically, they're already probably working a low paying job where, they're prolonging their time as a bootlicker.

For these people their biggest financial burden is seeing if they can make rent the next month. The next big thing holding them back is discipline to venture out in things they might not find pleasant but, in the long run, will make them more relieved financially.

Even the goal to make big money in less conventional ways, because the higher up you go up the ladder, the bigger a star/celebrity you become the more you're going to deal with corporate and legal red tape anyways. That is inevitable when you make a lot of money, whether you go into a common career, or whether you're a famous musician/actor."
1,2023-07-31,CMV: Cheating should be a serious crime on the same level as domestic abuse.,u/dejamintwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15eyjqu/cmv_cheating_should_be_a_serious_crime_on_the/,changemyview,I believe so because cheating is completely optional and will almost always hurt the other partner seriously mentally. Someone who is cheating is pretty much intentionally hurting their partner since if you did not love them anymore you could just break up or get a divorce. Its not that hard. So i believe it should be treated on the same level as domestic abuse. Since it is intentionally hurting your partner seriously mentally. So it should be treated on the same level as getting physically or mentally abused by your partner.
1,2023-07-31,CMV: deepfake porn is not bad,u/Deathman35,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15eymuz/cmv_deepfake_porn_is_not_bad/,changemyview,"Okay, so I’ve read tons of opinions about deepfake porn out there, however none of them have ever convinced me that it’s bad. I really want my view changed as people keep trying to tell me it’s bad and that I’m wrong. 

People will often say “well what if someone makes a deepfake of you?” All I’ll say to that is, I don’t care, if someone makes a deepfake and maybe shows friends and stuff  to scam me I could just say that it’s fake. I think this will blows up so much, it becomes a solution.

Also no I don’t see it as weird for someone to make a deepfake of me. There has probably been loads of men and women out there that have fantasised about me jacking off or whatever. They can “imagine me having sex with someone” in their head. All deepfake porn will do is make it more clearer. If someones weird enough to make a deep fake of my mum then go ahead. The video isn’t real just as much as the thoughts in their head aren’t. If it got leaked, then my mum could just pass it off as fake as well.

this is what I'm thinking: if deep fakes become so easy to make that they are everywhere, then no one will think anything of it. This way, victims of actual non consensual recordings of them can pass them off as fakes. Also, it will be impossible to blackmail ANYONE with pornographic videos. It can solve a huge problem with non consensual recordings."

1,2023-07-31,"CMV: Ghosting is a real asshole move and ""no one is owed an explanation"" is a cop out excuse normalizing cruelness",u/TheMedsPeds,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15ez7ul/cmv_ghosting_is_a_real_asshole_move_and_no_one_is/,changemyview,"Let's be clear. If you had a convo or two over a dating app, or even one to two face to face dates. Fine whatever, it's somewhat expected that ghosting happens. I still think you should say ""Honestly I'd rather not talk anymore"" block but I can see maybe giving that a pass.

But someone, whether it be someone you are seeing romantically, a friend, a family member does deserve some closure. If you just cease contact with no explanation that is an extremely fucked up thing to do. You are leaving people in limbo. There could be a period of days where they are questioning if you are just mad, busy or perhaps hurt. It takes a whole 5 seconds to type ""I don't want to be in your life anymore"" and if they say something mean or start to argue, block them.

What pisses me off is the super individualized, pop psychology excuses people use to defend this dogshit behavior. ""I don't owe anyone my time. No one is entitled to a response. Telling someone I want to cease contact may be unsafe. I have anxiety around confrontation, how dare you question me abliest!"" It's all such bullshit and you dancing around the fact that you are selfish, careless asshole for doing this. As for the safety thing, a person that is aggressive and unhinged actually may go more nuts if you ghost them then if you just sternly end things. And if they may be dangerous? End things over text and then block. What are they going to do? I know I'd be more pissed than if someone just ended things.

We should be striving to be more loving and caring people. Especially in this digital age where relationships are becoming more commodified. We are all sad, lonely, and a lot of us are inside more than out. Thinking you struck a connection with someone only to have that ripped away without an explanation is extremely cruel. I don't care if they aren't ""entitled"" to it.

One more thing I would like to add is some clarification on what ghosting is. I have heard people defend it in the past by saying ""I have had talks with this person and tried to establish boundaries. But they wouldn't listen."" That's not my definition of ghosting. To me ghosting is when one party suddenly ceases all contact when all was well the last time they talked. The ghostee had NO IDEA that the ghoster wanted to end things. It comes completely out of left field. Giving up on trying to talk to someone who you've repeatedly warned does not fit the definition IMO. If I am wrong there, let me know. But that is my understanding.

But yeah, ghosting makes you a cruel, selfish POS."

Each ant alone can accomplish quite a bit, but not normally enough to keep itself alone sustained.  
Each of you sentient beings right now know this as a fact, alone an ant dies, but a functioning colony works.  
So lets look at the condition each of you sentients right now are viewing this. Is this environment, our own personal micro biomes worthwhile? Take an extra step, what about your neighbors? The ants next door. Is their environment better or worse?  


I think we as a collective F'd the bed during lockdown. We shouldnt have come out. We should have adapted a new idea to focus on no more extended travel, and each of us focus on our micro biomes with the help of the other ants.  


If we as a collective intellect put aside our hubris and culture, the things that divide and define us, and take a simple page from the ants again. I believe we can as a collective petition to do what the greats of our ancestors wanted.

What I cannot stand are neopronouns like xe/xem/xyr, ze/hir/hirs, and ey/em/eir. You can't just make up all of these little words and expect people to remember and use them. I get that some people are non-binary, and that's fine by me! But I feel like using they/them is sufficient because it indicates that you don't feel like a male or a female, and it's still an actual English word.

Like, what is a xyr? I refuse to believe that anyone could feel like a word they just made up. It sounds like some kind of creature from Lord of the Rings.

That’s not to say that living is a bad thing - it’s in fact a very good thing - but it’s not really something the general population has to work hard to do, it’s quite literally the bare minimum for most.

It’s definitely an achievement for some people, but the general population isn’t extremely elderly/physically ill, pregnant or suffering from severe mental health illnesses that result in or include suicidal ideation/actions.

While there are some birthdays that result in important change, such as becoming an adult or your actual D.O.B., parties/celebrations for other birthdays are unnecessary as celebrations for those particular birthdays would be celebrating what happens at that age, rather than the age itself.

For example, someone’s 18th birthday is important in many countries because it is the legal age of adulthood. Therefore you are celebrating this person going from a child to a young adult, not this person simply having lived for 18 years. Like how a bar/bat mitzvah is not a birthday party for the boy/girl turning 12, it marks and celebrates their coming of age."

Whether a country has them or not. I think this is based on decades-old outdated thinking. I really don't see how, practically, nukes make any difference: the ONLY time it makes a difference is that it will protect a nuclear country from being fully attacked by a non-nuclear country. But if both countries have nukes, then it would cancel out and make no difference. We keep hearing how ""if Libya or Iraq had nukes the US would never have been able to attack them"" or ""the reason the US does not attack North Korea is because they have nukes"". This makes no sense to me. Do you really think if Libya had nukes they would have launched nukes at Washington in response to a no fly zone or even a conventional attack? That would just get themselves wiped out. Same with North Korea. One could make the case that if the leader of a country like that knows they will be killed or jailed if their country falls, then they would have nothing to lose and use the nukes anyways. But this is silly, because this would also kill themselves, and so why would they want to randomly make 10s of millions of people die for no reason as well? Also, they would likely be stopped by their generals in such a case. Also, the invading country would likely give some sort of reassurance that if they don't use nukes then the life of the leader would be spared.  

Look at the current war between Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine doesn't even have nuclear weapons, and Moscow is now being attacked by drones. Does this mean Russia would nuke Ukraine? This is silly. So even in a case of a non nuclear country attacking a nuclear country, unless it is a massive attack aimed at fully toppling the government, and the country with nuclear weapons is losing/knows they will lose the war, they won't use their nukes.

The only time a nuclear weapon has been used has been a rabidly rare and extreme example, it was literally a world war, literally after years of fighting, and stubborn refusal of Japan to accept that the war is over. Even then, the US response was highly disproportional (they could have achieved the same goal with a much smaller nuke), and is unlikely to ever happen again, at least at such proportions.

Something making you nervous, sad, or on edge is not real anxiety/depression and even if you have the real thing then figure out a way to fix it. What I think is that people just don't appreciate anything these days and if they don't get their way all the time they cant just move on so get all moppy and call it depression or anxiety. It's funny when you go to other countries especially 3rd world countries it's no where near as common to have anxiety or depression. It has to do with perception and a lot of people's perception in 1st world countries is complete shit. Cry and whine about everything. I had to wait 20 mins for my Starbucks, my boss asked me to do something I don't like doing, and the store ran out of something I needed so had to go to another store, my anxiety is so high right now, my phone is cracked and don't have the money to fix it.... Get over yourself, people would love to switch places with you. 

I'm tired of hearing that they have to live with it for their whole life and just manage it. Fix it, it is very fixable for most people. When I even bring up that it's possible to cure it they automatically dismiss it like it's not possible. Do you not want to put in the work? Are you just pessimistic? Do you enjoy the victim mentality?

It's also funny to me when there is one person who claims to have anxiety or depression and someone says me too. They get visibly upset and question that person to make sure theirs is real and then battle each other for mins on how theirs is worse. People with ""anxiety"" or ""depression"" almost always think they are the only ones dealing with it and dislike when someone says ""me too"" which nowadays is probably going to happen like 8/10 times."

As the title says, I'm gay and I hate the LGBT community. I do not associate with them nor do I like them and before you say it. No I'm not apart of the community by proxy of being gay. I ain't a member of the community nor do I want to be apart of it.

The community are a bunch of control freaks. If you go against the grain of any popular opinions within the LGBT community, you're automatically labelled as a traitor.

You're not allowed to be critical of Xenogenders, Pansexuals or whatever made-up sexuality/gender identity that Gen Z has pulled out of their asses.

Teenagers and self-entitled uni students are literally running the community at this point and are probably the reason behind most of this bullshit.

They also abuse terms like ""internally homophobic"" a term originally used to mean someone with internalized hatred of themselves for being gay and ""Straight-acting"" a term originally meaning someone who was still in the closet who was dating the opposite sex and essentially lying about their sexuality.

Now these things are used to just villainize Gay men who god forbid, aren't some sort of stereotype.

Like god forbid I ain't into glitter, nightclubs, twerking or Beyonce. I must totally hate myself for being gay because I'd rather listen to 2Pac instead of Cardi B. (/s)

Hell, the community judges you if pride parades ain't your thing. 

They also dictate who you're allowed to not want to date. 

Ain't into twinks?

Problematic

You don't find darker skin tones attractive but still respect them as people regardless?

Racist

Ain't into femboys?

Internally homophobic

The community doesn't do it's original job anymore.

There's gays being fucked off the top of buildings in Saudi Arabia but yet the community obsesses over trivial shit like how many gay characters there are in whatever shitty sitcom Netflix is churning out or some shitty tweet that Kevin Hart made back in 2009.

They're pretty fucking useless in that regard.

To be honest, as much as they love calling Gays who don't like kissing their ass internally homophobic.

For me personally they're actually making it come true. 

Because of the aforementioned reasons why I hate the community, I've actually started to hate myself for being gay because I'm associated with these assholes by proxy.

Sure, this would cut off representation for the marginalized groups, but I think it would prevent partisan politics from causing trouble in passing laws.

It just shows that they care about their health and don’t want the worst thing to happen. But what’s more importantly in my opinion is that there’s nothing wrong with someone thinking about the worst case scenario.

They may go to a doctor to get checked for that “worst case scenario”. The worst thing that can happen is that the doctor finds nothing wrong with them and they go home happy and relieved.

The issue is that sometimes things can be wrong. I’ve heard more than 1 case both in real life and on Reddit where a doctor or a loved one shrugs off a symptom because they’re too young and then later that person several months down the line gets diagnosed with a deadly illness.

The thing about a lot of illnesses is that they’re often treatable or maybe even curable if caught EARLY. Perfect example is cancer. If you have stage 1, maybe one or a few surgeries later and you’re fine. Stage 4 and you might just die. So it makes sense if someone might be hypochondriac about that because if it’s detected early then it can be treated.

If loved ones or even doctors just push it off “oh you’re fine. You’re too young” for all we know that person may not be fine and by the time actual bad symptoms are detected, the disease is already far along.

Another perfect example is the brain eating amoeba found in some lakes in the south of US. The reason it’s so deadly is because of how quickly it kills. Often times doctors don’t even know it’s the amoeba until the person is already dead.

So imagine if someone was in a lake in the south, gets water in the nose and then instantly get it checked out hours later, they might find it and save them. But if the doctors say “ehhh you’re fine”, they might be dead by the end of the week."
1,2023-08-01,CMV: There is no point in reconciling my Christian faith with science and progressive politics. I should just become an atheist or Deist.,u/Prudent-Reporter-400,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15fjm60/cmv_there_is_no_point_in_reconciling_my_christian/,changemyview,"So this is a personal CMV since this relates to my personal life rather than an abstract topic. Currently I consider myself a Protestant Christian (Episcopalian). I am pro-life, am affirming of the LGBTQ+ community, accept evolution, ""billions of years"", etc. I know some more conservative Christians would consider me to be a heretic or even ""never *truly* accept Jesus"". Overall, I have resentment in being a Christian. I live in the United States and currently most conservative Christians are figuratively in bed with the Republican Party. Don't believe me, search Google for ""Evangelicals and Donald Trump"".

This resentment runs deep. In high school, almost every Christian friend I knew registered Republican. I was the sole Christian Democrat. Anywho, before I continue, let me clarify what my stance is on religion.

1. Just because I found a faith that is ""right for me"" does not necessarily mean people of other faiths are wrong.
2. Just because someone else found a faith that works for them, doesn't necessarily mean I am wrong.
3. Religion is a deeply personal topic.
4. Nobody should be judged or coerced into practicing a religion.
5. Religion should **never** be used as an excuse to marginalize and oppress people.
6. I have no religious convictions or conscientious objections to getting a vaccine, serving LGBTQ+ people, etc.

I consider myself a ""progressive Christian"". I get annoyed when some Christians choose not to vaccinate their children due to their sincere religious beliefs, putting their kids at risk of serious illness over what is a personal matter. I also get annoyed when Christians use their faith as an excuse to decline service to LGBTQ+ people (I myself am bisexual). I also hate it when Christians use their literal interpretation of The Book of Genesis as an excuse to oppose evolution, ""billions of years"", and climate change.

There is so much problematic things and people in Christianity today that I do not want to be a part of. Unfortunately, I get *guilt by association* and even thought about leaving my religion to become an atheist or Deist. However, after debating some atheists on a debate subreddit, that did not pan out well.

The main thing is that I do not have any friends to talk to, I am far away from my family, and the only thing that I have to save me from loneliness is God, but I have been so detached and distant from God that even prayer is not working. Personally, I think I would have less baggage if I was a deist, or someone who merely believes in God, but my worldview or what I believe in hinges in certain things from Christianity like the divinity of Jesus and God creating the Earth."
1,2023-08-01,CMV: Humans are fundamentally and naturally corrupt in general.,u/BlackHoleEra_123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15fjpga/cmv_humans_are_fundamentally_and_naturally/,changemyview,"Original post on my profile.

After observing for some time, I have come up with a philosophical theory concerning human action.

Called ""The Foundations of Corruption,"" I listed five things that confirm that humans can never be ""morally pure,"" and can always and will always be ""corrupted.""

I: Any human or humanly conscious being can corrupt and be corrupt.

This is rather simple, encompassing things such as (but not limited to), bribery, lying, coercion, manipulation, and hedonism.

Of course, the suspect in each of those actions are corrupt. But in most cases, the victims can be corrupted to the corruptor, such as accepting a bribe, believing a lie, being pressured to do morally negative actions.

II: Anything that can corrupt or be corrupt will be corrupt.

This is where it gets a little funky. But think about it. Including the previous examples, people in power were known to promise ""good"" things when they were NOT in power. Think of communism in practice. The ideology was built to support the working class, but instead caused oppression on said class once carried out. Another example would tend to more free things, such as anarchism.
More freedom = peace, right? Not quite. Hell, the reason why it's fucking difficult to implement is because of human affinity for power. You have no leader, but someone else will climb to the top, and that leader most of the time is a dictatorship, left or right.

So obviously, corrupt people are already corrupt. But people that are not corrupt, despite their actions, good or bad, their cause and influence will eventually corrupt them.

III: Corruption takes no sides, for ego is its driving force and morality being its ever-changing face.

First off, lemme make some bold statements.

YOU. YOU want money. YOU want power. Don't deny it. Even I want these forces. There are so many things I could wish to do with it right now. Donate to charity, buy a car for myself, discard people I hate, stop whatever's screwing me over...

If it's all self, it's corrupt. If these statements or actions are morally directed, then it may or may not be corrupt, most often the former. See, corruption often deals with self. Selfish. Narcissistic. Egotistical. We do these things to feel better about ourselves. Science even proves it. Donating to charity makes you feel better, but what kind of better? That you're helping? Or that you see yourself as good and everyone else the opposite when you donate?

Also, don't back your corrupt actions with moral statements. Tell the truth. Last time someone did that in history, society collapsed or got overthrown. Instead of doing moral charming, just say outright that you want to oppress this group, that you want to exploit workers, something along those lines. Because that's what your motives are—morally corrupt.

These people in history are the reason why morals change over time, so there's that. New laws of morality count as well, brainwash people with that, and you're corrupt.

IV: Corruption exists because of human nature, without corruption, human nature isn't.

Since a lot of humanists, ethicists, and Nobel Prize winners affirm that actions like greed and violence are what makes humans human, I'm just gonna throw in this claim and say that humans are not human when they're not corrupt.

V: To achieve true purity requires extinction or utopia, one of which is within reality.

This claim is built on the previous four foundations stating corruption. It's become so evident by now. Hard to escape, hard to remove, and hard to resist. It's integrated so well into human nature that humans dying out is seen as a solution to corruption. There's a perfect society, sure, but perfect isn't such thing in the universe.

In conclusion, corruption is inevitable, indestructible, and irresistible. No human could ever be pure of moral from start to finish!"
1,2023-08-01,CMV: Police get what they want by bullying communities,u/Gold_Biscotti4870,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15fjwc0/cmv_police_get_what_they_want_by_bullying/,changemyview,"Just about every police department that had funds reallocated claims that because THEY did not receive those funds crime has gone up. Well, what is the excuse for high crime before? It was not under control and this is just an excuse for being ineffective with the resources available to them, by historically endorsing poor-performing enforcers, and the ability to use the media to spread this tale of woe.  
  
This ciity has increased police spending, but the department is still down nearly 600 officers and only has 75% of the officers needed to meet workload demands which means they have a problem with recruitment. That problem is solely due to the curtain opening on criminal acts by enforcers all over the country who have been endorsed by their associations instead of those associations weeding them out. They have created their own problem and it is not about the money but the poor image they have participated in creating.  
  
The end result, they will pay enforcers who graduated from the academy $100,000.00 per year to entice recruitment with absolutely no guarantee crime will go down with the increase in pay. Proof that a bully can get their way if they push hard enough 

That city found money for more police while they have homeless on the streets who don't have proper sanitation.     "
1,2023-08-01,CMV: America Dropped Both Bombs On Japan Because The War Was About To End,u/thinkforever,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15fl5fj/cmv_america_dropped_both_bombs_on_japan_because/,changemyview,"They had spent billions of dollars and over 3 years developing these things and time was running out to drop them on a city. The totality of the evidence points to this conclusion.

Japan was as good as defeated and on the verge of surrender.

US intercepted cables from Japanese ministers seeking peace negotiations.

US Air force was obliterating Japanese cities day and night with virtually no resistance. The firebombing of Tokyo alone resulted in many more casualties than the atomic bombs did.

Many of the American military leaders, Admirals, and Chiefs of Staff went on record to admit that the bombs were of no military value in ending the war with Japan.

The prevailing ""last resort"" myth to avert a land invasion that wasn't at all ""inevitable"" like some would like to believe, is nothing more than a weak attempt at justification to assauge the collective guilt of the nation.

Even the U.S. Navy's  own monument in Washington states that it was the USSR's invasion of Manchuria that was the decisive factor in ending the war, and not the bombs."
1,2023-08-01,CMV: The theory that certain racial or ethnic groups excel in certain sports shouldn't be considered offensive at all.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15fljmb/cmv_the_theory_that_certain_racial_or_ethnic/,changemyview,"It's been a long-standing theory or observation that certain positions in sports - such as the wide receiver or cornerback positions in football (which are heavily based off of speed and agility) - are predominantly black.

In fact, the NFL hasn't had a regularly-starting white player at cornerback since Jason Sehorn in the early 2000s. Nearly every single cornerback since then has been black. The best CBs - Deion Sanders, Darrelle Revis, Richard Sherman, etc. are black.

The NBA is 70% black, the most elite wide receivers such as Jerry Rice, Randy Moss, Calvin Johnson, Larry Fitzgerald, are all black. Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the world, is black, and most Olympic sprinters are black. 

Now, I don't mean this to become a scientific discussion - if we were to make scientific studies about this, it would take all day. Rather, I mean this as a **political** discussion. 

I've known many progressives - interestingly enough, usually *white* progressives - who would get irate at the idea that black people had some sort of genetic advantage in certain sports. I've never understood why. Being good at a particular sport or skill is a **positive** attribute. It's not a bad thing.

The fact that black athletes predominate at certain positions in sports has become an elephant in the room, or the emperor's new clothes - something that everyone sees but somehow we're supposed to pretend doesn't exist, or is just purely coincidental. And nobody's given a good reason why it's a bad thing. Why **shouldn't** one observe, and theorize, that black players excel at speed and agility and that that's why black athletes so heavily predominate at positions that require speed and agility, such as CB and WR?

If the idea is that we're *dismissing* black achievements by saying, ""Aw shucks, you're black, of *course* you'd be fast,"" then I can understand the anger; it would be downgrading the achievement. But I haven't seen the theory used that way at all.

To get a few things out of the way: I'm 23/M, a college student from Massachusetts, with family in the United States and no possibilities for citizenship by descent. With all that said, here are the reasons I feel like I *should* leave the US from a moral standpoint.

\*\*Gun Violence:\*\* Unless the US passes gun control (which it won't, and even if we did, it wouldn't work), I refuse to have children in a country where they might be gunned down at school any day. I don't want to pay taxes to a country that allows this to keep happening. I refuse to have children in this country.

\*\*Abortion Rights:\*\* Now, I am a man, so this doesn't affect me as directly. However, if I were ever to enter a relationship with a woman (I'm ace hetero), I would run the risk of getting her pregnant when neither of us want that. With Republicans likely to pass a national abortion ban if they get a trifecta in 2024 (which I predict they will), blue states won't save us. 

\*\*Health Care:\*\* It's expensive. Enough said. 

\*\*Foreign Policy:\*\* Not only did the US invade Iraq, but Trump invited Russia to invade Ukraine and create all the devastation that has occurred as a result. The fact that Biden is supporting Ukraine now doesn't make me feel better about this - if the US hadn't elected Trump, the war mighit not be happening in the first place.

\*\*Send A Message:\*\* By emigrating from the US, I would no longer be paying taxes to this disgusting regime. I would no longer have to say I'm from here. And I could let out more rage against this horribly depraved country that claims to stand for freedom. I want to make a statement, and my best way to do so is to vote with my feet.

\*\*What Would Change My View:\*\* Demonstrating either that things aren't so bad in the United States as I say they are, or that emigrating wouldn't be a good political statement.

\*\*What Would Not Change My View:\*\* Telling me that I have to ""stay and fight"", or any right-wing framing of the issues listed above.

That's about all I have to say.

They want to win, want to dominate. This is probably their natural instinct to survive.  All animals have it. A lion hunts a deer. To survive not to dominate but to survive. Similarly while human conflicts are started with the idea of survival and prosperity, in they are destructive in nature (just like lion hunting a deer). 

The difference is the scale. Lion hunts a deer for food. When it's full it stops. Humans kill for greed. And they don't differentiate betweenwho they kill.  Humans don't mind killing thousands of humans if it helps them
 
All wars are just survival of the fittest playing out on a grand scale. It's human psychology to fight since being the strongest country, the most powerful group will often mean you have the highest chances of survival. The issue with this is that eventually humans will destroy themselves. 

As they build more powerful weapons, the costs of having a war would grow. While any sane person would not start such a war, not all men in power our sane. Given enough time some crazy person will come into power. Someone out of pure hatred might light a match burning the world

There's so much division in this world. Based on race, gender, beliefs, religion. People disagreeing on fundamental ideas. this belief disagreement causes resentment which further fuels hatred. With such hatred humanity will certainly go on to destroy each other. 

I feel like sooner or later humanity will reach a tipping point, a point of no return where it will destroy itself out of greed, and hatred. Kind of like the apocalyptic future movies. I would like to change this view though."

They don't give a damn. Why? Because they know that with a fixed hourly wage of, let's say, $20 an hour, they would earn less than they do now.  
  
They've cracked the system. They know how to glare at customers until they feel guilty, and in the end, fork over 20-30% in tips. Just look at subreddits like Serverlife, where all hell breaks loose if someone gives less.  
  
Most servers don't even want change. They're thriving on the current situation and exploiting it to their advantage. And we're supposed to back that up and feel sympathy?  
  
In my opinion, they should receive the same hatred as the Tipping Culture as a whole. If you want to change my mind, give it a try.   
But all I see here is hypocrisy and the exploitation of a broken system.

Let me begin by saying I'm not American. I make this post because judging by the impression I get from reddit, conservatives just straight up ""oppose"" anyone who is not a straight white male. Every time I hear about conservatives it's between opposing abortion (unless it helps them), passing transphobic laws, or being racist. Is that just what conservatism is about?

Is there nothing more than that? Are the conservatives just hateful, religious Americans who cannot accept anyone different from them? What are the opinions and world views of non radical conservatives? Or are the MAGA crowd considered normal conservatives?

I mean in my country there are many instances where I can understand the arguments of both sides of the problem, but it seems like in America it's always like ""Why should we give a woman control over her own body?"", ""What if we just didn't allow trans people to exist?"", ""If climate change is real, why is it cold in the winter?"" And legitimately the only issue that can have actual debate (at least from my view) is gun control (and it's not strictly a right/left issue). I refuse to believe that pretty much all of their views are just based around hate, ignorance and religion so PLEASE change my view."

2. An City in Gitmo will lead to an increase in investments in Cuba, so while Cuba is lacking in investments City Gitmo will alievate this as thousands come flowing in bringing interests

From what I’ve noticed, bisexual people tend to be utterly oblivious to the privilege they have in queer communities and often act as the most oppressed, which I find completely to be untrue. I’ve been dumbfounded by how it seems all bisexual people act so oppressed, and I’ve even heard some say they are the most oppressed within the queer community. I really do not like the narrative from what it seems like all bisexual people I’ve seen that it’s exclusively or predominately gay (wo)men “bullying” them for their bisexuality, all the while having absolutely no smoke for the people who are the ones who give them the real world consequences for being bisexual, which are straight people. I personally do not see almost all bisexual people I come across as having real world issues they face that need to be taken seriously because they’re bisexual.

I’d like to start off with some definitions I’m going to reference later in my talking points:

There are three variants of bisexuality relevant to my argument, but I want to preface this by saying I think bisexuality is a spectrum and that there is a difference between people who are technically bisexual (but don’t identify as such) versus people who self identify as bisexual.

* **Self-identified bisexuals (SIBs):** This is a huge distinction to me because there is a trend I’ve noticed amongst people who are technically bisexual versus people who readily self identify as bisexual. SIBs tend to be in heterosexual relationships at almost the same rate as heterosexual people (88% compared to 100%, or almost  9 out of 10 versus 10 out of 10) despite almost 50% admitting they’re equally attracted to both sexes. This is to say there is an obvious trend of SIBs being heteronormative in how they go about relationships even if they have an indiscriminate preference in attraction to men or women.
* **Technical bisexual (Tbs):** Many self-identified gay (wo)men such as myself are technically bisexual in some capacity where we feel a relevant enough attraction to both sexes in regards to sexual attraction and/or romantic attraction to where it makes us bisexual, but we do not identify that way for a number of reasons. People in this category normally are what I would call “functionally” gay, and the inverse is also true which is, according to statistics, the overwhelming majority of SIBs ([source](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/06/18/bisexual-adults-are-far-less-likely-than-gay-men-and-lesbians-to-be-out-to-the-people-in-their-lives/))
* **Pragmatically homosexual or heterosexual:** As explained above, there are people who are technically bisexual but don’t identify as such, mostly out of function. A homosexual biromantic man is more likely to end up in a relationship with another man and therefore be basically indistinguishable from another gay man in regards to sexual interests. The inverse of course is also true, and funnily enough is what most SIBs tend to be, so it seems.

Whenever I hear and read about biphobia it’s normally the same hackneyed points: 1) constantly coming out, 2) specifically other queer people not wanting to date you because you’re bi, 3) “both sides” telling you that you’re confused (and especially as a bi man, people saying you’re just a closeted gay man), and so on. All of these are really mild annoyances rather than material violence someone faces for being specifically bisexual, and though obviously bisexuality is an intersection of homosexuality and heterosexuality and the intersection with homosexuality makes bisexual people susceptible to homophobia, that does not mean bisexuality does not come with massive privileges, in and out of the queer community.

1) Getting to choose when you want to present your queerness is at worst a mild annoyance, not a real world issue that needs to be taken seriously, and it’s not something exclusive to bisexual people either. “Straight passing” (wo)men also experience this, but do not have the option omit their homosexuality like bisexual people do and don’t have the option to have the privileges that come attached with being in a heterosexual relationship, which is what 9 out of 10 SIBs tend to be in anyways, with the minority being the ones who are pragmatically homosexual.

There is also something else that needs to be said, but hypervisibility is not a privilege. The people who are affected by homophobia the most are the ones who have the least ability (if any ability) to mask their queerness, such as genderqueer gay people who can’t pass as straight and are excluded from the possibility of having the protections of being in a heterosexual relationship and subsequently being able to pass as straight as a virtue of that, something that other gay people (straight passing or not) also do not have access to.

2) This is technical biphobia to a degree, although I think it is heavily misunderstood in online bisexual communities. As studies have shown, SIBs tend to be overwhelmingly heterosexual at basically the same rate as straight people and tend to only interact with queer people for sexual interests only rather than long-term relationships. It’s an perpetual pattern to see bisexual people only interact in homosexual relationships for sex but virtually exclusively give the tender love, care, and attention to opposite sex partners. This is one reason why many gay people do not like to bother with bisexual people as the pattern inevitably unfolds despite there being a higher saturation of people being more accepting of bisexuality in queer communities (including amongst gay people) compared to straight people. 

3) Now this is a problem, but again is more of a mild annoyance and somewhat on par with 1) with simply having to correct people in regards to your sexual orientation. I personally kind of experience this myself but in the opposite direction sometimes; I’ve always identified as gay simply because I’m homoromantic and bisexual (preference for men) and some of my friends have questioned my self identification if I’m gay and say I’m bi instead, but it’s a mild annoyance at worst and has no real world consequences.

Another issue I see is that bisexual people are substantially more critical of other queer people (specifically gay (wo)men) but do not have even an tenth of that same passion for criticising heterosexual people who are almost always the main perpetrators of the homophobia they experience or witness, which is where the real-world consequences of being bisexual come from, not from other queer people. This is especially true since most bisexual people are pretty progressive and are more likely than not to follow the typical liberal definition of racism that states only people in power can oppress you, but yet bisexual people almost entirely point fingers at other gay men and women for biphobia, not straight people. I find this very funny considering the trend SIBs tend to have for heavily preferring heterosexual relationships but also being hyper critical of queer people. The biphobia you receive from other queer people is not your enemy, the homophobia you receive from straight people is, but yet it seems like bisexual people are way more complacent receiving homophobia from straight people which has serious consequences to it but want to have their foots on the necks of other queer people who they probably see as being low hanging fruit.

Bisexual erasure is very comparable to “reverse racism”. My personal school of thought in regards to racism is that all racial oppression is racism, but not all racism is racial oppression, and that you can be racist towards the majority of a given country such as in the US where I’m from white americans, but you can’t oppress them. Similarly, in other places like Singapore, you can be racist towards Chinese Singaporeans, but Malay and Indians can’t oppress them as they hold the power. In the case of bisexual people, you can be biphobic towards in technicality but it’s not nearly as much of an issue because they are in the position to receive the most privileges from their proximity to heterosexuality and the statistic probability of there being a 90% chance they end up in heterosexual relationships, foregoing the vast majority of issues you receive from being gay (which is, having gay relationships).

The only time bisexual people experience real-world consequences that actually affect their lives in dramatic ways is from systems of oppression from homophobia such as violence and discrimination towards queer people, but the main privilege from bisexual people (particularly SIBs) is that they get to co-opt into bisexual spaces with the statistical probability of foregoing basically all of the dangers of being a visibly queer person by having a 90% chance of being in a heterosexual relationship, which is a safe haven and a privilege no gay (wo)men has access to."

It went away without us doing much.  Sea leveles rose.  Temperatures climbed.  Human spread about.

Treated linearly, over that time period, the ice is pretty much all gone.  Sea levels have pretty much mostly risen.  I expect trmperatures have mostly risen.

I think we will need to write off the tropical and semi tropic regions.  No human habitat there.  Deserts will continue to expand.  Anything south of Salem Oregon is iffy.  Well, between the 45° latitudes.

We have to set the error bars pretty wide to have made the climate science predictive.  I here claim  that that often the bars are so.wide that simply exiting an ice age maximum fits the data.

We have known about ice ages for centuries.  It  is hardly a climate crisis that we are going to do a major depopulation that was going to happen and we knew and did not care.  Well, until it started to affect our military allocations.

TL;DR:  Our current climate ""crisis"" is explainable by the current ice age maximum winding down.  Your stupid is not a crisis"

Whether if it's at the demands to make things more marketable or they need more representation, this often tends to result in writing issues such as elements being recognizably shoved into a show or comic that you can tell are a result of meddling such as the former example of executive meddling for marketing/merchandise demands such as the Marvel Transformers comics (the fact that the writers handled it well speaks to their skill).  
  
In my view, executive meddling must be kept to a minimum as much as possible with few demands made as much as possible and the writers being allowed to work with elements and topics that they are comfortable in at their own pace. Executive meddling should only be needed in case of budget issue or writer/ actor/actress availability as these tend to jeopardize the production of shows and comics and need to be addressed before they cause further problems.

I am aware there are other, reformist communists, but I am not speaking about them now. Essentially, the view that the US government needs to be violently overthrown and this message preached is an encouragement of treason. I won’t also get into how these same folks often justify enemies of USA like the failed sh*those that was USSR. 

Now for those of you irritated with this view, think of the following scenario: a Muslim migrant is welcomed into the country from Afghanistan and immediately tells us openly that he will become politically active to overthrow our government and reign in his version of Utopia: a misogynistic caliphate that bans anything fun. Wouldn’t we all ask whether a refugee who loves our country might have been a better fit? Why is this not the same case with Communists? 

Thanks and looking forward."

For one, he's bi-polar and pretty much said all the crazy stuff during a manic episode, and was probably even experiencing psychosis. Nothing that someone says in that state of mind can be taken seriously. 

Two, people misunderstood what he was saying and took it out of context. He was not saying that he actually supports the ideology of the nazis, he was basically saying that we should love everyone. He was just saying it in the most controversial out of pocket way possible, but the actual meaning of it is literally just the most basic ""we should love everyone."" Obviously it was a stupid thing to say the way he did, but honestly he was pretty much just a manic dude being edgy. 

Three, all he's really guilty of is being edgy and controversial. It's not like he shot someone, people need to chill. So many people freaked out over him wearing a MAGA hat, saying that he loves Hitler, plus a lot of his general narcissism and egomaniac tendencies he shows in interviews. Look I get it, he's extremely unhinged so I can see why people don't like him, but to be honest I don't think he's actually done anything that bad.

Four, he's also one of the greatest musical artists of the 21st century, even of all time. Like honestly if you make that great of music then you can get away with saying stuff that other people would be canceled for. As long as he isn't committing any actual serious crimes, then why should I make a big deal about him saying unhinged stuff when he's manic?"

A minor artist in her own right. The woman who poisoned her husband’s soul. People say that Kurt wrote her better songs, and that she destroyed Nirvana.

This is wrong. 

Courtney Love is a poet, an artist with tremendous integrity who made great music and who inspired and protected her husband in life, and celebrated him after his death. She was an imperfect partner, but she was young.
 
She was a prescient feminist voice in music when that was still rare. Kurt loved her because she was a genius. Then he made her her a widow, forcing her to endure enormous pressures and public scrutiny in the wake of his suicide. She was a young mother and a rockstar.

Hole is one of the greatest bands of all time, although their output was even less prolific than Nirvana’s.

“Live Through This” is a stronger and sadder album than Nirvana’s “Nevermind”. It is inarguably one of the greatest rock n’ roll albums ever; a graceful and courageous work made under extraordinary circumstances. 

Songs like “Violet”, “Rock Star”, and “Doll Parts” are achingly beautiful songs which deal with themes like grief, loss, anger, and desire. 

“Jennifer’s Body” is a powerful anthem about femininity; a song for the ME TOO age. 

Listen to her voice, a tender roar. Isn’t she a remarkable talent?"

For those who are unaware, basically there is an entire genre of YouTube video and Twitch streamer which is devoted to people reacting to someone else's content. 

For example, if I make a video about the ""top 10 craziest events which happened in 1874,"" a ""reaction"" channel may come along and decide to make a video of them giving their reaction to my content for people to watch.

The argument from people who say these reaction videos are harming content creators is basically that they are detracting from the viewership of the original creator by instead funneling people to \*their\* channel. 

This argument seems massively flawed, but first I think we need to divide people who are watching the content in question into two categories: those who are watching for the information itself, and those who are watching for the person presenting/reacting to the formation. 

For those in the former category, I don't see how you could argue that they're being funneled away from the original content, since they're watching the video \*for the person who is reacting\*. If the person who is reacting to it had never watched the video, then neither would they, since their interest in the content is secondary to their interest in the reactor. 

For those in the second category, it doesn't make logical sense to suggest that someone who wants to watch my video about 1874 would do so by watching someone else - who is likely pausing the video repeatedly or talking over the top of it - watch the video, when they could just watch the OC in the first place. 

In order to suggest that this person is being dragged away from the OC, you'd have to argue that they were both willing to wait for the reaction video to come out hours or days after the OC, then also watch the video while being interrupted by some random person they don't care about. 

The only scenario I could see is if the person happens to overlap into both categories, and so gets to kill two birds with one stone, but to that I would say that could just as easily be offset by the number of people who discover the content creator through the reaction video and go on to watch the OC along with other videos made by the content creator.

It makes sense that artists in other genres ""see their day"" then take their back seat or evolve into ever-acknowledged royalty in their style, but country by it's very nature should be immortal.  The industry strategically manipulates this special trait of the genre.  They gear the publicized artists (or straight up manufacture them boyband style) to deliver certain messages (currently the glorification of social alcoholism as nostalgia comes to mind) and follow popish structure (lots of repetition, shallow predictable themes) whole throwing in electronica, auto tune, etc ...

Someone being your friend or significant other does not give you the right to know everything about them. Knowing everything about them isn’t what makes a healthy relationship or vice versa.

There are many things that people don’t want to share because it could be used against them (you never know what might happen in the future - romantic and platonic relationships often end, and sometimes messily - some things might ruin your reputation or even put you in danger if it got out) or is incredibly personal and something they don’t want to tell anyone ever. There are things they don’t need/want to know and/or that you don’t need/want them to know.

I came out to one person a long time ago, because of the idea that they were my best friend and should know everything about me (I only had one person I would describe as a friend). They outed me to several people, who thankfully had the decency not to do the same. I will not come out to anyone else again unless it is relevant - which it is not when it comes to friendships.

But when I was outed, one of my other friends told me that I was a bad friend for not telling them earlier and that as we’re friends and “friends aren’t supposed to keep things from each other” I needed to have told them as soon as I knew.

Them being my friend doesn’t suddenly give them access to that information.

I have seen my sister being broken up with because she wouldn’t let her SO read her diary, when they had an entire child together. He said it made him feel like she had something to hide. That’s not the only example of this sort of thing I have seen - a lot of the time instead of a diary it’s a mobile phone.

Him being her SO does not give him access to her diary or mobile phone. Especially the former - a mobile phone is sometimes fine, not everyone thinks of it as holding personal or private information.

“Keeping secrets” or “hiding things” is viewed not as having privacy, but as a sign that you are up to something nefarious or as it itself being something nefarious.

People have different boundaries, but I feel that the boundary of ‘don’t force me to confess things simply because of the title of our relationship’ should always be there."

Well, guess it's all because gaming is expensive hobby in this region.

So, most of them would orefer to play indies and old PC games they played in teenagehood. And of course, other CIS countries have weaker currencies and many of them doesn't have regional prices in gaming stores.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but generally liberals like to fight for the rights of groups that have little representation in society. This includes ethnic minorities, women, religious groups, LGBTQ+ and other groups that have little power.  
  
Well... unborn babies have the least say. They have no way of communicating to us or fighting for their own rights and depend entirely on living people. So I would imagine that antiabortionist policies supporting the rights of unborn babies are in support of an extremely underprivileged minority groups. By that train of thought, I think antiabortionism is liberal. For some reason I don't understand, conservatives are instead the ones advocating for antiabortionist policies."

Saw a video of a man confessing to rape when he said he was unable to pull out of a women because he was already in there. The comments were bombarded with men talking about how they were were able to pull out even though it they didn't want to and women were praising them for it. My thoughts were ""damn, is it really that hard for ya'll not to rape someone?"" and ""has society really regressed so much that people are getting praised for not raping someone?"".  
People seem to forget that sex is not essential like food and water are. No one regardless of appearance or income is entitled to having this desire satisfied. A person being able to control their horniness should never be labeled as a good or strong willed person just because of this. If there was a box full of men who aren't rapists but think exclusively with their private parts then guys like Tristan Thompson and T.J. Holmes would be placed in there and the identical behaviors of other men in that box with them are a big reason why sexual discipline is praised to begin with.  
It's also funny to me seeing people saying it requires ""sheer willpower"" for most people to control their sexual desire. Sheer willpower sounds dramatic to me because all you're doing is keeping it in your pants. It's not like you're climbing Mount Everest or something lol. No need to overexaggerate such a simple task.  
I don't care about how high a sexually disciplined random person's sex drive is nor will I automatically respect them for being able to complete the otherwise easy task of keeping it in their pants which has unfortunately been blown way out of proportion by certain people neither should you."

Regarding the POTUS speech, give us a recap at the next news hour.  
And I hate how (at least in Philly anyway) whenever there was a cop killed in the line of duty, the news felt that it was right to pre-empt the whole day to cover the funeral. Let the officer's family mourn privately, and stop exploiting his death for ratings. I support the police, but I also know that getting killed is an inherent risk of that job. It'd be more newsworthy if I was killed in action while at my office job.

1,2023-08-02,CMV: No amount of mass shootings is going to persuade gun supporters to give up their guns.,u/SteadfastEnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15gdyf8/cmv_no_amount_of_mass_shootings_is_going_to/,changemyview,"Every time there is a mass shooting in the United States, the attitude of many gun opponents seems to be one of bated breath: *""Surely* ***this*** *one will be The One - the one that will finally mark a watershed moment and convince gun supporters that enough is enough, and that it's time to give up guns.""*

......and it doesn't happen.

If there were to be a critical-mass moment, it would have happened by now. The sheer volume of awful mass shootings - Columbine, Parkland, Sandy Hook, Pulse, Vegas, Uvalde, Aurora, El Paso, Sutherland Springs, Virginia Tech, etc. - would have done it by this point. And yet most gun supporters are no nearer to abandoning their stance than before. Gun opponents are waiting for a ""straw that breaks the camel's back"" moment that may never come.

Granted, it's hard to see what argument *would* work to persuade gun supporters to give up guns - if any such argument even exists. But it can be clearly seen, from the last 20 years, that ""hoping that the next mass shooting will finally be the one that changes their mind"" isn't it.  

And when America gets its next mass shooting that kills dozens of people - which, for all we know, might come as soon as next week or something like that - the argument of most gun supporters will most likely be the same again: ""2nd Amendment, my guns didn't cause the shooting, the self-defense benefits of guns outweigh the drawbacks of mass shootings, we need guns to resist governmental tyranny, the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,"" etc.

1,2023-08-02,CMV: Not all men were meant to reproduce,u/WhitePillBlackman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15ge3xo/cmv_not_all_men_were_meant_to_reproduce/,changemyview,"CMV: Not all men were meant to reproduce

Monogamy was a gift to genetically inferior men that allowed them to reproduce by acquiring resources despite being genetically unfit. This in turn “watered down” the human race as a whole and is leading to the growing disparity in sexual success between the top and bottom tier men. Ask yourselves, what percentage of men today have the genetic potential (tall, broad shoulders, ability to put on muscle…etc.) to be good hunters/soldiers? 10%? 20%? 

Well back in the pre-civil action era nearly all men (Neanderthals) were expected to do so. Hell there are more recent examples of this if you look at American Indian tribes that were conquered by Europeans in North America. Most of these openly practiced non-monogamy, so generally speaking, the best fighters and hunters would be the most sexually successful because of their genetic fitness:

https://daily.jstor.org/polygamy-native-societies-and-spanish-colonists/#:~:text=Having%20more%20than%20one%20wife,tried%20to%20end%20the%20practice.

My point is that prior to monogamy not all men got to reproduce because nature didn’t allow them to. Once humans started to meddle with the natural order of things, genetically unfit men started to be created in droves and to punish humans for their hubris the incel was created. In a way the incel is an abomination of nature, something that was never supposed to exist in the first place. 

Most of these complain about not being able to get laid, but the truth is that their fathers should have never been able to find a wife in the first place. Dating apps like tinder that are making dating more competitive are actually just returning society back to its original competitive state. 

Instead of being frustrated that they can’t/won’t reproduce, these men should be grateful that they were born at all."

1,2023-08-02,Cmv: the language of therapy is turning us all into introspective buzzkills,u/didebadedopals,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15ghxm6/cmv_the_language_of_therapy_is_turning_us_all/,changemyview,"I’m going to start by saying my view very clearly. We have adopted the language of therapy as a society and this is an overall bad thing. I think that therapy is a useful tool for people and I think the recognition of the concepts that these terms carry with them are good. I think that the over use of therapy logic in day to day life is not healthy. You can also disagree with any part of what I said or you can disagree with the premise but not with my reasoning. 

Therapy isn’t the answer to all your problems. It just isn’t. Stop recommending it on Reddit for every little problem someone has. Sure, there’re going to be people that really need help but it isn’t healthy to see everything through the lens of therapy. It isn’t respectful to dilute those terms, having serious medical issues doesn’t make you more interesting, and the normal human experience contains a lot of pain that we could be talking about in less clinical terms. 

You know, maybe people are capable of working things our for themselves without a weekly session. Maybe its a little bit of learned helplessness to rely on a paid professional to tell you how to think about your life. Maybe we built this world to be safe and secure quicker than our brains learned not to be afraid of snakes in the grass or lions in the bushes. Maybe we’re built to be afraid and angry and hopeless more than we’d like to admit. 

Your clinical terms come across as reductive. Half the time they’re misapplied, half the time its just a lazy shorthand. It doesn’t make you sound nearly as smart as you think it does. It does, however, turn normal human experience into a pathology, a problem that cannot possibly be fixed. What a great result that everyone feels broken. 

Maybe those terms should be reserved for certain contexts. Neurologist can explain the structures in our brains that lead to certain behaviours, a biochemist can explain the interaction of hormones and synapses that influence certain behaviours, and a therapist can explain the cognitive patterns and experiences that lead to certain behaviours. We don’t exist in those realms when we’re actually living our lives. It doesn’t do anyone any good to understand yourself as balls of neurones, a bag of chemicals, or the logical effect of being forced to do ballet as a kid when you’re just walking around and eating an apple. 

What good does it do to primarily experience your existence from arms length? It’s insulation. Do you really think its better to interpret every emotion to the extent that you learn to experience of the world AS an interpretation? Its not even really emotion at that point, its all intellectual. You’re too “interested” in yourselves. 

Where will that leave you? Instead of “I feel afraid, I feel brave, I feel confident, I feel shy, I feel angry, I feel calm, I feel sad, I feel happy” its “I’m having a very interesting emotion right now the story of which dates back to…” Everything bad you feel or do is because of this, everything good you feel is because of this. Its exhausting. 

Its just trading the rawness of your life for a sense of order. Everything makes sense, everything comes from somewhere else, everything is okay in the blandest sort of way. Does this  understanding really give you any meaning? Its like learning a language but having nothing to say. Its a hollow explanation. Maybe its a useful one but it stands in the way. We’re all going to be stilted dull characters from Star Trek: The Next Generation, all enlightened as they paint hotel art. 

You know, I’m REALLY not against therapy or medication. I think its great that we have these tools to fight illnesses. It reminds me of when someone suggested to Churchill (bad guy) that he should cut the budget for culture to aid the war effort, he replied “then what would we be fighting for?” What is the point in fighting if you’re never able to experience life first hand? 

One of the worst symptoms of depression is the absence of joy. Its a numbness you experience in the face of almost everything. Its why there’s an over representation of people with depression amongst addicts. There’s a craving to just feel something. Isn’t this constant grinding overanalyse similar? Being so wrapped up in interpreting, categorising, fixing that you actually forget to feel much of anything? 

Well here’s a quote from Killing Eve when the protagonist sneaks into a drug addicts anonymous meeting. I think about a lot:

“Most of the time, most days, I feel nothing. I don't feel anything. It is so boring. I wake up and I think, again, really? I have to do this again? And what I really don't understand is how come everyone else isn't screaming with, with boredom, too, and I try to find ways to make myself feel something. More, and more, and more, but it doesn't make any difference. No matter what I do, I don't feel anything. I hurt myself; it doesn't hurt. I buy what I want; I don't want it. I do what I like; I don't like it. I'm just so bored.”"

This is misinterpreted.  
  
When a man has sex - or ""lies"" - with a woman, he puts his penis in her vagina.  
  
If a gay man had sex with a gay man as if he were a woman, their penises would break when trying to enter each other.  
  
Conversely, the male anus was constructed to be penetrated. It even has a 'g' spot in it.

I'm curious: Do people who claim to truly hate him say that just to appear pretentious, or have they actually taken the time to watch one of his speeches? While I don't agree with everything he says, I do resonate with his emphasis on traditional values and the idea that the modern world lacks a sense of brotherhood and family.

Firstly, some of you may recognise the title. I wrote a rant for myself and posted it to CMV. Not many people understood what I was trying to say because I didn’t initially write it for anyone else (and didn’t think to edit) and then my internet went down so I couldn’t explain or make an edit. I took it down and decided to try from scratch.

****

My opinion is that we’ve become strangely obsessed with psychotherapy culturally and we’re letting it bleed out into ordinary life in an uncontrolled way. It would be better if we respected it as a tool that we use with professionals and not try to apply the language to ever facet of our lives. 

Its a kind of medical care. It helps people with mental illnesses. People study to be for years to qualify to work in a very regulated industry. Its a great thing to exist, a great tool for those who need it. I considered going into that profession at one point and have used it at another. This isn’t a post about therapy. 

My problem is that people have started adopting the language of therapy in every day life. This is normal and has always happened. “Hysteria” is an old medical word, for example. People want stronger and clearer language to express themselves because old words become unfashionable or become pejorative. Its something called the euphemism treadmill. That isn’t a bad thing in and of itself but I feel that there’s an air of clinical thinking that goes along with it.

An example of this is Jonah Hill’s recent abuse scandal. He went to a therapist (I don’t know which kind) and used the language of therapy as a weapon against his then girlfriend. It put her in a position in which she couldn’t say much back because we’re now trained to give those words special weighting. Words like “invalidating”, “abusive”, “gaslighting”. I see this all the time online and meet people in real life that talk like this not as uncommonly as I’d like. 

What Hill did was wrong and I’m not for a second saying that any professional would condone that. I am saying, it shouldn’t be normal to use words like that in daily life. If either he didn’t use those words or if his partner didn’t feel like she had to take them inherently more seriously or if they spoke like normal human beings, maybe the problem would have resolved quicker or not been masked. 

These words give a sense of a structure to them. Condition, symptom, behaviour. Its all very clear and simple on the surface. Using these words in ever say life encourages people to start recognising these structures/patterns everywhere they look, including in themselves. It essentially sets up a situation in which unqualified people start pathologising normal human emotion. Everything becomes “problematic”.

I think its clear with examples like Jonah Hill how this can be abused when used in interpersonal relationships. I’ve met people who genuinely believe that refusing to walk ten minutes to water plants for their grandma during her vacation is okay because its “too much responsibility and it triggers them.” They were in therapy… just saying it doesn’t always work out.

Why did it go wrong for this person and for Hill? I’m assuming that therapy allowed them to accept their emotions but whatever should come after that never happened and so they became stuck in a very open and selfish place. Acting as if their emotions are something external to themselves and something that they have a responsibility to cater to.

Therapy going badly is one thing, like anything else in life, it wont always be successful. What about all of those people that have just learned the words and absorbed a few concepts from the sopranos? They didn’t even have the benefit of having a professional there so what chance do they have to get this right the first time? This is exactly how you end up with people calling themselves OCD because they like folding laundry. 

I think it must have a bad impact on the way that people perceive their own experience of the world. I really think therapy is something you should do and then you should leave and not constantly be in a constant state of self analysis. 

Its something I see around, and in myself sometimes, that people are so consciously trying to be better that the analysis comes simultaneously with the emotion. That its somehow harder to let go and really have a good time or really have a bad day because its a bad day. Everything needs to have a reason and everything needs to be neatly categorised and understood. Its the emotional equivalent of watching a firework display on your phone because you’re way too into filming things instead of experiencing them in the moment. I find it exhausting and its something I wish I didn’t do. I find it exhausting when I talk to people that do it too. I actually have had the benefit of haven spoken to a therapist a few times in my life and the problem is that this analysis is much more like “Reddit psychology” than anything professional I’ve come across.

I genuinely find myself thinking about books or movies I like and doing this weak sort of Reddit therapising on them. It turns art into this bland mess of buzzwords. It takes the fun out of it. I’ve spoken other people irl who have had this problem too. 

I also find myself having bad days and finding myself searching deep in my soul for a reason to justify to my partner why I want to stay in my apartment and not talk to anyone.

Viewing yourself and the world through this kind of therapy lens doesn’t really add anything. Its kind of reductive and bland. it means your always analysing yourself others instead of really being able to experience the thing in its own right. Its a language to explain things in a very narrow sense. It doesn’t contain its meaning. 

So what does this language do for us? It enables bad behaviour, it turns untrained people into pattern finding machines finding problems everywhere we look, and it kind of gets in the way of experiencing life on its own terms. 

Of course, everyone has problems and we want to talk about them. Sometimes thats some form of therapy and thats fine, sometimes its your friends. 

My solution would be to not bring that clinical language out of that context. 

Have confidence in yourself normal human advice to people instead of jumping to recommend therapy to every heart broken teenager on r/relationshipadvice. Use ordinary language to explain yourself, use ordinary language to give advice to other people, and try to stop thinking so much about yourself all the time."

Due to some (in my opinion, extremely flawed) studies in the late 1970's, most states gradually began lifting their drinking ages to 19 and 20 in the late 70's and early 80's. In 1984, the federal government stepped in and further required all states to have a drinking age of 21 as a condition of receiving federal highway funds. This law sidestepped the 21st amendment which clearly designates regulation of alcohol as a state level issue. In my opinion, it's ill-advised, but at least there is a logical rationale behind it. Raising the drinking age to 21 would help public safety (hint, it didn't actually, but for the sake of the argument, forget it for now).  
  
The smoking age stayed at 18, however. Makes sense right? Nicotine doesn't impair motor functions. Public safety isn't endangered by underage smoking. For decades, this wasn't even controversial. However, in the late 2010's, states began moving to raise the smoking age to 21. The rationale this time? Young adults shouldn't have access to tobacco because of health risks. In 2019, the federal government made Tobacco 21 the law of the land nationwide, with no grandfather clause. That meant if you were a 19 year old who simply enjoyed cigars, you suddenly were banned for an entire two years.  
  
Now for why I think this rationale is so wrong. I believe the government's job is to protect public safety. The government is not there to protect the individual from oneself. And Tobacco 21 has done just that. Does anyone seriously believe that 18 year olds don't know that smoking and vaping is bad for you? So much so that the government must take away freedom from adults? With the drinking age, at least it CAN BE ARGUED that there was a public safety interest. But with smoking? Nearly impossible to make that case. Individual safety? Sure. But youth smoking does not endanger the public at large. It only negatively affects the individuals who know full well it's harmful but choose to partake anyways.  
  
If we're going to make adults wait until 21 to have the right to do anything, we might as well raise the age of majority back up. Why is someone at age 18 deemed old enough to fight in the military, face the death penalty, vote, and serve on a jury, but the government must be their nanny and prevent them from smoking?

It's pandering, and audience members regardless of their political leanings see through that shit. It gets people who need representation to feel that their representation is cheapened, and it gets racists to be well...racist. Literally NO ONE likes it. I think new content with representation WORKS. Encanto, Turning Red, Coco, and Everything Everywhere All At Once are proof of that. People aren't mad at woke films. People are mad at lazy writing. Storytelling seems to have taken a backseat. This is just corporate laziness because they're so afraid of creative risks, but they also don't want to get shit from minorities.

I didn't even care back then, my mind was so fixated on technological progress.

Fast forward to C. 2022, and now we're here. GenAI is used to replace artists and animators, scam innocent commissioners, its supporters radically defending it flaming, screwing over artists and saying the phrase ""Adapt or Die!"" to them, and don't get me started on the copyright violations and privacy breaches it does, due to how its algorithm gathers data.

The art world has never been in more turmoil because of this technology. Not only that, corpos are trying to lobby politicians to ensure that they can continue using their dangerous tech.

Because of the way GenAI advocates, or techbros as we call them, and artists just expressing their concerns, it will be very hard for me to listen to the side where GenAI is supported. Every day, same old phrase. Some artists thought of the S word once this tech encroached onto creative industries. Some artists quit, which is really sad. It's also causing artists and writers to turn to GenAI simply because they saw its ""potential"", and so they start using it, actively defending it the same way techbros do.

Oh, if this is only about visual art, you're wrong. While StableDiff, NovelAI, and ChatGPT being one of the current dominant algorithms focusing on text2image and text2text generation, there's plans on making similar generation algorithms for music and animation.

If you're thinking of this: ""Oh, it's supposed to be a tool."" No it isn't. It never was actually. The tech was made by corpos without knowledge of the art world and made for profit. Why else would they lobby politicians other than wanting to continue using their generators without ethical vibe checks? Its purpose is to be a replacement, to replace artists.

Some people even refuse to pick up a pencil and whatever paper they have and draw, instead paying $40 for a monthly sub service to GenAI. That's enough to buy you what you NEED to make stuff. Instead you choose to blow it over an over-anthropomorphized algorithm with the intention of automating art, which is the antithesis of art itself. But of course, you don't care, because ""you can't draw."" Not hard to man. There's YT tutorials, which are very helpful. There's even FREE hour-long courses you can watch and take, but no, you'd rather pay an algo and type what you want to get a soulless image you'd stroke your ballsack to.

And I thought automation was supposed to help, not to harm? Here it's doing the exact opposite. Automation is the antithesis of art itself. Art is what makes things complicated, colorful, and awestriking (not sure if that's a real word), and GenAI screws that principle over a fundamental scale.

Thank God for the EU enforcing laws on this immoral creation of a tech.

In short, GenAI is theft, a Peeping Tom, and built because corpos want more paper in their suitcases, without regard for the art world.

Such development led me to cognitive dissonance—for some time, I'm forced to either embrace tradition or progress. My hope for the future is tainted with this technology, and I realized how many ancient, nostalgic, and sometimes important things rendered obsolete because of progress. But progress tells me that we could make our lives easier without harming anyone, BUT—

Note: I am a layperson, and this CMV constitutes my recently acquired lay knowledge of the subject. I am writing this CMV because I appear to be at odds with most educated minds on the subject, and that usually means I have some learning to do.

By ""ambient superconductor,"" I mean ""superconductive material near room temperature, near 1atm of pressure."" My very first reason for doubting if the effects of discovering such a material would cause instant technological upheaval would be if such a material were expensive to produce or extremely finnicky, but I'll let answerers assume it's cheap and stable, too.

By ""era-defining event,"" I mean something that is guaranteed to have profound and novel effects on the layperson's life in the short- to medium-term future.

My reasoning:

1. Energy efficiency improvements sound nice, but underwhelming. If we assume [10% of all energy in the grid is lost due to leakage in transmission](https://chintglobal.com/blog/how-much-power-loss-in-transmission-lines/), this appears to indicate that an upper limit for how much savings superconductive materials could provide in this domain. To put this into perspective, global energy consumption continues to rise [2-3%](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption) per year. To me, this indicates that an immediate and zero cost remodeling of the entire electrical grid transmission system would merely net us \~4 years of buffer before we would be forced to continue on our same trajectory of endlessly rising energy demands. Sure, 10% more free electricity is great, amazing even, but would it fundamentally alter our relationship with energy?
2. I've heard of improvements to be made to battery technologies. I cannot make much heads or tails of what would be the improvements there, and if they would be strictly substantial. I hear of building a superconductor solenoid magnet in order to [store magnetic potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconducting_magnetic_energy_storage), but the energy density appears to be an order of magnitude lower than even for alkaline batteries, and due to the powerful magnetic fields would be impractical for machinery with sensitive electrical components. Separately there are things called ""supercapacitors,"" but I can figure even less about them.
3. I've heard that cheaper superconductive wire would enable niche technologies like MRI scanners and Japan's superconductive maglev trains to become more widespread. However, I've not heard enough about what *novel* technologies would become available or newly implementable in day-to-day life. As far as concerns maglev trains, I can think of many great public transportation projects that have fallen flat on their face due to reasons other than technological feasibility."

I don’t and can’t understand people who strongly identify with their gender, cis or trans. I even instinctively look down on them, though I am working to correct this.

I feel like splitting the human species into seperate ‘genders’ does more harm than good- it has negative impacts like stereotyping (different expectations based on gender), sexism (both ways), and limiting human connection (having friends of another gender is considered unusual). 

I’ve seen how the socialization of boys encourages them to be violently aggressive, arrogant, never showing any emotion. If you’re not traditionally masculine, you’re shunned and bullied. Girls are expected to flawlessly balance gentleness and strength, femininity and toughness, purity and sexuality. Like a tightrope. Other genders haven’t really taken root in society yet so they don’t have as much associated baggage, but nonbinary people are expected to be ‘female-lite’ and completely androgynous.

Surely gender has a benefit to society that I can’t see, right? I know that being agender gives me a strong negativity bias against the concept of gender. Help me out here, why is it a good thing?"

Plenty of studies correlate processed foods to cancer, but it’s hard to point fingers at junk food when you can’t isolate it from other cancer-inducing factors of life (pollution, stress, drugs, etc.).

I’m pretty sure we’d all rather have a grilled Alaskan salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus over a Filet O’Fish with fries and a cola and a any day of the week, but it’s just not realistic for us working class folk.

But yogurt, as well as fruits and vegetables- the ones that are cheap and easy to prep- are also part of my everyday diet. I make sure that I don’t eat over my caloric needs, and that my vitamin needs are met.

Some examples that come to mind:

On debate on homosexuality => *Gay sex exists in the animal kingdom*.  
 Who cares? gay sex should be accepted because we are an intelligent animal that realized a person sexuality is a personal matter, the fact that some other species have gay sex doesn't add anything

On debates on gender roles => *Humans have progressed thanks to men carring society forwards since the dawn of time*. So what, nowadays we have education for all and we well know that male/female can equally contribute.

On meat/no meat => *As animals we always eat meat*. It could be but, again, who cares? Our life is so much different, there's so much more of us that is reasonable to look at those issue. 

You get the point.

I personally think 95% of the times is total nonsense and mainly for a couple of reasons: 

1- we are quite smart animal, we have been capable to understand our reality to an astonishing degree, whatever we had been during our evolution is quite irrelevant.

2- strickly connected to the previous point, no animal can come even slightly close to us, we may be closely related to monkey (for example) but we might as well be from another planet if we take into consideration how much more ""advanced"" we are.

You can't just draw something with little effort and say 'its all about the feelings or meaning' because we as humans can make out meanings from literally nothing, its actually the easiest thing we can do and also this makes it sound as if a traditional drawing isn't as meaningful or expressive.

1,2023-08-03,CMV: Rule by educated citizens selected by lottery would be preferable to a democratic republic.,u/itstooslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15h7x79/cmv_rule_by_educated_citizens_selected_by_lottery/,changemyview,"***This is gonna be pretty long; TLDR below.***

Before I say anything else, I want to clarify that **this is NOT a post in defense of fascism or any other form of despotism.** The very inspiration for my belief is the threat reactionary ideologies pose to nations around the world. However, I do have several other reasons, which I will elaborate here.

I also understand that all of my criticisms of uninformed voters, confirmation bias, etc. extend to myself as well. I learned many new things just researching for this post.

To put a finer point on it, ""rule by educated citizens selected by lottery"" means pretty much what it sounds like: citizens interested in public office must pass a test covering the basics of the country's political system, and those who pass are selected at random every four/five years to serve in the legislature. (In my version, those selected would serve only a single term.)

The titular name for this system is obviously quite long, so going forward I will call it *lottocratic epistocracy* or *LE*.

Why I think this:

1. A lottocratic legislature would be **more likely to implement policies which actually benefit everyday people,** since it would be *composed* of everyday people.

2. Such a legislature would also have no need for campaign contributions — there would be no elections, after all — and would therefore be **less susceptible to corruption or bribes** and more likely to pass regulations against itself.

(A quick footnote: I don't believe that, say, the President of the United States should not be selected randomly. I would only suggest sortition for large multi-member bodies. Perhaps the President could still be popularly elected, or instead be elected indirectly by the lottocratic Congress.)

3. Democracy is sometimes defended on the grounds that all persons should have a say in how they are governed. I can sympathize with this view. **However, I would argue that democracy is much more about exercising power over how** ***others*** **are governed.**

4. **Huge numbers of voters are uninformed/misinformed.** The results of elections and referenda have real, measurable consequences, and not just anyone should be given the power to influence those consequences.

> 72% of Leave voters and 50% of Remain voters endorsed the statement that “More than ten per cent of British government spending goes to the EU.” [...] According to the Europa.eu website, the correct figure [in 2019 was] 0.28%.  So the majority of people think that we [sent] the EU at least 36 times more money than [was] the case.

Fast forward to the present day, and inflation in the UK is the worst of any G7 country, thanks in part to the economic barriers imposed by Brexit. ([source A](https://www.statista.com/chart/30398/inflation-rates-in-g7-countries/)/[source B](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/22/brexit-is-making-cost-of-living-crisis-worse-new-study-claims))

5. **Uninformed voters are everywhere.** For example, [much of the EU remains hostile to immigrants](https://news.gallup.com/poll/320678/world-grows-less-accepting-migrants.aspx) when multiple studies have shown that no reliable connection exists between European immigration and violent crime or unemployment. ([source A](https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/20635-eu-research-disproves-link-between-immigration-and-increased-crime)/[source B](https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/library-document/crime-and-immigration-evidence-large-immigrant-waves_en))

6. **Uninformed/misinformed people actively resist correct information.** Some may argue that expansion of access to information and education would help to combat voter ignorance. I agree that it would and it does, some. But the grim reality is that we *all* suffer from some level of confirmation bias — though this is especially true for the most divisive issues *and of the most misinformed people,* the latter of which are often [unwilling to even consider viewpoints which conflict with what they already believe](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/study-finds-political-bias-skews-perceptions-of-verifiable-fact/). Reliable information is more easily accessible now than at any other time in human history, yet we still have to have debates with people over verifiable facts such as [vaccine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02185-4) [efficacy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/09/heres-how-many-americans-are-actually-anti-vaxxers/) and [evolution](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/02/11/darwin-day/).

**""But how would you design a fair test?""**

This is the most common argument against requiring a test to vote that I have personally encountered. It's a fair question.

In the same way that most citizens of democratic republics trust the state to administer tests and licenses for people to drive or own firearms (in most places), I think we could broadly trust a lottocratic state to administer a fair test on politics.

For example, imagine the first lottocratic US Congress were mostly belligerent racists, and sought to design a Jim Crow style literacy test with the aim of disenfranchising Black people. Even so, it would probably have little or no effect on the demographic composition of Congress, since representatives are otherwise selected at random; you're therefore basically guaranteed 14% or so of them will be Black (especially if [stratified sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling) is used). Under this system, such a biased test would probably be quickly undone by later sessions of Congress.

Ideally, the test would be designed in collaboration with people formally educated in political science and/or on the politics of their specific country.

**TLDR:**

**We tend to think of a vote as an expression of self, rather than the exercise of power over others. The elections those votes are cast in often give power to demagogues who ignore the public good and seek only to line their own pockets. This is made all too easy by our electorate(s), wrought with people who are not only misinformed but actively resist information which would help them understand things as they actually are.**

***I would like to believe that democracy isn't beyond saving.*** **But for now, my view is this: political power should be exercised with careful thought, and democratic systems encourage anything but. We would therefore be better off ruled by educated citizens selected by lottery.**

Thanks to everyone and anyone who read all this. I look forward to your responses."
1,2023-08-03,CMV: Criticizing celebrities for eco-unfriendly luxuries is hypocritical unless you've made significant environmental lifestyle compromises,u/srs96,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15h8wlw/cmv_criticizing_celebrities_for_ecounfriendly/,changemyview,"My argument is the perceived hypocrisy when criticizing affluent individuals, like Taylor Swift, for their environmentally unfriendly indulgences, such as using private jets. I suggest that it is hypocritical for most people to do so, barring certain exceptions that I will discuss below. 

I frame my argument by posing two questions:

1. Have you made any significant lifestyle compromises solely (or at least primarily) for the sake of the environment?
2. If you haven't made any significant lifestyle adjustments, can you confidently say that you wouldn't indulge in the same luxuries you are criticizing if given the chance?

In discussing these questions, it's crucial to distinguish between significant compromises and insignificant or irrelevant comprises. For example opting for a Tesla instead of a Toyota is an environmentally conscious choice, but hardly a lifestyle compromise, so it's deemed insignificant. More examples given below.

Depending on your answers, I propose three categories of critics:

1. Those who have made substantial lifestyle changes for environmental reasons are justified in criticizing celebrities. 
2. Those who haven't made substantial lifestyle changes but wouldn't indulge in the criticized luxuries if given the chance, still hold some ground.
3. Those who haven't made any lifestyle adjustments and would partake in these luxuries if possible, including me, have little standing to criticize.

For example, I haven't made significant lifestyle compromises for environmental reasons, and I have no doubts that I would prefer private jets over public carriers, if I could afford it. In what ways then, am I different or better than Taylor Swift?

Here are examples of lifestyle changes that I deem insignificant or inapplicable:

1. Making slightly costlier, but greener choices, such as:
   - Purchasing a Tesla over a fuel car
   - Installing LED lights instead of incandescent bulbs
   - Switching to a solar energy provider
   - Buying more expensive, but eco-friendly meat.

    These actions, despite being more eco-friendly, are not deemed significant as their cost isn't likely to cause substantial inconvenience or require other lifestyle sacrifices. 
2. Adopting a vegan or vegetarian diet primarily to reduce animal cruelty.
3. Opting not to use AC or heating to save money.
4. Opting for public transport because it's faster or cheaper, not for its lower carbon emissions.
5. Choosing to cycle or walk to work for fitness reasons.

Here are examples of lifestyle changes that I consider significant:

1. Adopting a vegan or vegetarian diet mainly due to its lower environmental impact.
2. Reduction in AC or heating usage primarily to reduce carbon footprint.
3. Choosing less convenient modes of transportation primarily to reduce carbon footprint.
4. Selecting closer holiday destinations primarily to reduce carbon footprint.
5. Spending a significant extra amount of money to reduce carbon footprint, to the extent that it requires other significant and clear sacrifices in your life.




1) Do you agree with my interpretation of what actions qualify as significant lifestyle compromises for environmental purposes?

2) Given that, do you concur with the three categories of critics that I've delineated based on these environmental compromises?

3) If you agree with the above points, would you then accept that most people belong to the third category?

4) Given that the majority may belong to the third category, would you concur that criticisms by most people aimed at affluent individuals for their environmentally unfriendly indulgences might be characterized as hypocritical?"

I go on a gaming website for example... their giving games with less features than previous ones better scores. The person is young, so in their opinion it is better. But the ones in the 30s and older know this isn't the case. So what im saying is giving a young person this responsibility might not be wise.

Get Polynesian Tattoos? Go for it. 

Wear Cowboy Hats? Why not. 

Wear Tribal Native American Feather Headdresses? Suit yourself. 

Use R&B to make Rock and Roll? Excellent. 

Participate in El Dia de Los Muertos? Fine by me. 

Just don’t do these things in a way that aims to criticize or insult the cultures that place significance on them. I’m sure there are a plethora of other examples, the main point is - we get it, some things are important to an individual culture, but don’t gatekeep it for the sake of keeping the outsiders out. 

As an example, I don’t have any issue with a Chinese person with Polynesian Tattoos, having dreads under his Cowboy hat or a White person remastering old R&B songs to make new Rock riffs while adorning a feather headdress  and setting up an Ofrenda.

I see things that are discomforting and beyond ridiculous on social media, maybe disgusting. But, what I find worse… poverty within the West and all across the globe. The growing number of unaffordable housing and accelerating income inequality combined with the explosion in the cost of “not only” higher education and but general education were many schools seem I’ll-equipped to fill teaching and staffing positions to the point that less and less competitive college students and tenured teachers are completely “ditching teaching, altogether.   Yet, also fear the possibilities of physical violence, gun violence, wear five hats, and a chance of being in a school with a mass-shooting with an elected official suggesting and asserting you should be able to carry a weapon as well🙄.  
Rent is exponentially higher, as home prices are across the nation from metropolises to unincorporated areas of the country are almost logistically unaffordable to the point, people are abandoning their homes and spaces completely dropping off the map, altogether.   
Don’t get me started, on the healthcare system, if you’re in the States, let’s hope you have a great job, employer, plan, or a state “that might actually partially care.” You could literally lose everything with one illness, injury, or loss of job or reduced pay.  Mental illness or health issues, good luck, and hope you be able to keep working or in your place of residence.  
If you become homeless or transient, “May the Force.” Your only real hope is too continue working or generate an income to not fall into the system. Just as long as you can avoid prison or jail.  
But, you can still hope for self-made billionaires from a wealthy families to cheer for and fight on your personal behalf.  
Don’t be from a country with even higher rates of poverty. Lower life expectancy, possibly more blight and decay. Exceptionally high unemployment, more corrupt regimes partial oligarchs or religious fundamentalists.  
Yes, the age of social media is the bane of some people’s existence and the status of modern pop culture could be depressing, but I prefer it to living through the Dark Ages, the Inquisition, the height of the Black Plague, being drafted to fight in a large scale war, being a part of one of the lucky groups of people being sent to an internment or detention camp, or being a chattel slave in a free country, where a great size of it was willing to and did die to keep “said system” in place

I am an atheist who lacks greater meaning. I am not willing to create my own values, but at the same time I have zero interested in religion or following religions like Buddhism without the spiritualism. I also have no interested in worshiping aesthetics, art and literature because I consider it just a intelligent version of hedonism and humans being mostly use art to deal with reality or avoid nihilism, a kind of ignorance but portrayed as more sophisticated. Even worse than this is ""optimistic nihilism"".

I used to want to further progressive beliefs like mental health awareness, LGBT rights and feminism, but I do not consider that meaningful if cultural relativism/moral relativism is true. If moral and cultural relativism is true I have no right to criticize sexism or homophobia in other cultures or nations.

Other atheists tend to worship ""facts and logic"" but I think if truth does not have inherent, objective value it is pointless to care about truth, so I don't get along with them either.

Because of these things I have been looking for some kind of role model that can recommend a system or some kind of structure. Andrew Tate is really terrible and should be in jail people say Jordan Peterson is terrible so I have not given him a chance. I can't think of any other good ""mentors"".

I do not have any good roles models in my family. I also don't think I would accept a fictional role model since I want to read about something actually following their own system or values in real life.

Again - Do NOT respond with ""create your own values"" or ""just worship art and literature"". Those two things do not interest me.

Note that I consider Stoicism to be toxic in a manner. It just remind me of being told to deal with stuff like a man, and I also think stoicism is bad for progress because it can encourage you to just deal with stuff rather than trying to change the world, so it is bad on a mass-society scale - imagine slaves being stoics rather than trying to cast of their chains.

I personally do not feel that we are headed towards any open warfare but something more akin to a cold civil ware and I do not know if anybody can actually fix it. 

What a Cold Civil War looks like 

1- Geographic sorting - Areas are becoming more conservative or more liberal and people are now seriously prioritizing political leanings in their moving decisions. I feel that this was not a major factor for most people moving over the course of the last 100 years (except for Blacks fleeing racially intolerant areas). I am not saying that ""nobody"" moved because of political views but, rather that the primary factors moving historically were more economic in nature (jobs). As each area sorts each area will become more committed to its worldview. 

2- Two Company Society - This has always been a threat that is only starting to materialize. As a right leaning conservative, it is understood on the right side of the aisle that corporations in particular are moving to the left, especially culturally. This has led to the rise of ""right-wing"" companies. This will become a bigger and bigger issue as more conservatives choose to shop at ""right-wing"" target (Walmart?) and liberals shop at ""left-wing"" places (Target?). I understand these are broad strokes but the basic idea is increasingly obvious. This will beget even more division as right leaning people watch different media, different social media, different products etc. All of this will increasingly create more polarization ratcheting up tensions. Bud light is an example of this. I do not think we want to live in a country where liberals drink ""Blue"" beer and conservatives drink ""Red"" beer. 

3- Lack of Faith in Institutions - With the increasingly scandalous usage of government and universities, many people will simply lack faith in any truth. We are very nearly at a point where conservatives will not acknowledge lawful government action simply due to the political leanings of the alternative. This attitude cuts both ways. Both sides do not fundamentally trust the others motivations and aims so neither side will respect anything the other does. Whether is is Biden Corruption, Trump indictments, FBI corruption, FDA corruption, Fauci, IRS, Military failures, Obama IRS scandals, Jan 6th, policing, libraries, public schools. Both sides disagree about effectively all of these topics and more. Most sides are increasingly ignoring any institution or authority simply because of their political views. 

I believe we are too interconnected to have a ""hot civil war"" because all of our standards are simply too high. Unless an economic calamity occurs - nobody has any real reason to ""burn it down"" because we have too much to lose. We will, however, have a ""cold civil war"" where our society fundamentally lives like a divorced couple who has not separated yet. 

I do not believe either side of the aisle is ""more right"" than the other generally and I feel most Americans feel this way. Conservatives are not going to simply stop being conservative and liberals are not going to stop being liberal. As those two positions are increasingly widening - I do not see how there is any real ""fix"" to this problem. We face a Trump v Biden election in which every reasonable person knows these are the two worst possible candidates we could find. Both claim they will ""unify"" the country and most Americans say they want ""unity"" except for the fact that neither side has any real plan for that except for ""hoping"" the other side basically goes away and simply changes their views."

However, I think it isn’t a worthy superpower due to the fact that it has such poor social values.

The USA has extremely poor healthcare that is extremely expensive. Many Americans go to a poorer country run by drug cartels like Mexico in order to get better and cheaper healthcare. 

The USA also has extremely poor public transport. Its cities are bulldozed for cars and only cars can get you around. There are few metro stations that carry people around (with the exception being that of New York). Other than the fact that the cities have poor planning, American high-speed trains linking cities are extremely slow and limited. This forces people to use cars and planes which are more expensive and less environmentally friendly. China, which I deem not good worthy of being a superpower, has vastly better public infrastructure than the USA. 

The USA also has a culture of eating unhealthy cuisine. There are many food items in American culture that are healthy but the unhealthy ones are promoted. Such as the food pyramid (done so farmers could sell more grains) and cereals (made by an Evangelical Christian for the purpose of preventing sexual desires). Meanwhile, many nations like Japan and Vietnam have much healthier diets than the USA. And despite not being healthy, American food is also not as tasty as Indian or Chinese cuisine. 

The American education has regressed into being standardized testing and nothing else. Their education system was designed that way because schools want more funding from the government. Meanwhile, Scandinavian and Baltic education is based upon training a generation for skills and building startups. Their schools doesn’t requiring much testing or studying in order to be successful.

The American prison system is also awful. Instead of  being focused on rehabilitation justice, they focus on punitive justice, which doesn’t help prisoners get back into lives. They end up committing crimes for more money because prisons don’t address the root causes. Prisoners are fed substandard foods because the prison wants to save money.

I view the Nordic countries as worthy superpowers, just that they aren’t big enough to be one. The Nordic countries have low crime, a great welfare system, a great education system, a high GDP per capita, a lot of freedom, etc. This is because they invested in their population by reducing poverty (and inequality), giving high-quality education by paying teachers high wages, purposefully creating an entrepeneurial middle-class, and funding innovations. I think it is the USA’s duty to copy the Nordic model and it is in their best interests to do it. If they were to do it, they wouldn’t have to worry about being surpassed by either China or India."

1 and 2. disinformation/misinformation is pretty rampant when it comes to weight loss, it’s much much more confusing, rigid and complicated than it needs to be. That’s why I put disinformation, I can’t prove it’s intentionally complicated to have people fail but at times it does feel that way. The misinformation/disinformation goes hand in hand with the over complicating thing, most people get these ideas from the diet industry and influencers. Either it be very rigid diets that no normal person will have long term success with, substituting the things you enjoy with things you DONT enjoy, feeling the need to workout endlessly to get these goals, telling you if you drink this or that it will BURN FAT FAST, putting too much focus on things that don’t matter when it comes to weight loss, hyperfocusing so much on the scale, telling you ONLY this diet will work and just weird gimmicky crash diets that will never work. All this confusion, stress, complication will just make most people fail, it’s unfortunate and I was definitely victim of that in the past. Realistically all you need to do for most people is just track your calories and be at a caloric deficit. Ideally do some light movement like walking or whatever and reduce/cut alcohol/sodas. That’s really it for most people. 

2. Mindset is a difficult one to say but some people do struggle with discipline, I get it though it’s especially hard in the first couple days but after that your body starts to adjust.  Either just giving up on the first few days because how difficult it is, having difficultly saying NO to other people, having difficulty saying NO to small snacks since they think they don’t matter, being incredibly inconsistent, falling into bad mindsets like overeating one day then start binging, getting too impatient when it comes to the scale, unhealthily comparing yourself to others, etc. These things take time to get use to but once you get the confidence it gets pretty easy. 

I have lost over 100 pounds and have kept it off for over 5 years and I’ve definitely been victim of these things in the long past."

So the middle class pays capital gains while the rich are often able to avoid it altogether. It's complete horseshit and there's no economic logic to it. They wrote the law so of course it benefits them immensely.

As a business student, I think it's stupid but whatever. But one worry I have is something that apparently happened in this article: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/14/melanie-rose-nipper-cincinnati-professor-olivia-krolczyk-assignment/70322020007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/14/melanie-rose-nipper-cincinnati-professor-olivia-krolczyk-assignment/70322020007/)

Basically the girl used the phrase 'biological woman', and for this the teacher completely failed her. I think this was actually a retaliatory action against the girls prompt for having the 'wrong opinion'. The teacher herself said that paper itself was good but that her use of this phrase is 'harmful'. Even if I was to agree that this was the case, (which I don't) a single 'mistake' in a paper doesn't justify a failing grade. To me this is nothing more than a teacher asserting their power over a student not for academic purposes but to correct what they deem to be the wrong stance.

Colleges are meant to be places where people of different backgrounds come to learn while also exploring different ideas and teachers should be open to that even if it's contrary to their own personal beliefs. All assignments should be graded on the objective quality of the work, not the subjective opinion of the teacher.

This means that even if I came up with a ridiculous writing prompt like ""Why hitler was actually a mole person"" if my paper meets all the criteria met, I should pass."

I think it's the result of poor morality on their part. And they choose to drug it up and live that way. So they deserve to be reviled, avoided and told how gross they are. And if anything happens to them on the streets they call home, they deserve that too.

I had a childhood friend many years ago. We were so very close and many times the subject of a future together had even arisen in our youth. He was abused by his mum which of course is horrible and I do pity that. However, when he grew up and moved away he turned to heroin. Now he has a rap sheet a mile long. He asked me for help a few years ago before I found all of this out. He told me he needed money for an emergency dental procedure and feeling how I had felt about him for all those years, I gave him a hand. Well I'd found out he lied to me and blew it all on his filthy habit. My illusion and any dream of a future with this person were blown to pieces. Needless to say I haven't spoken to that in years and absolutely never will again. How dare he! His own remaining family refuses to help him anymore too. I used to feel nothing in my heart but care and concern for him. Now I just have no compassion for druggies whatsoever and think they should be just dumped somewhere and forgotten about

No ""help"" because they are beyond that. Only prison time with extra cruel CO's screaming at them and mocking their hurt.

Am I too harsh on my views?"

1,2023-08-03,CMV: The Importance of Space Exploration for Humanity's Future,u/Elegant_Technology_1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15hp09y/cmv_the_importance_of_space_exploration_for/,changemyview,"Space exploration is often criticized as an unnecessary expense, but I believe it is crucial for humanity's future progress and development.

&#x200B;

I understand that some people view space exploration as an extravagant endeavor that diverts resources away from pressing issues on Earth. However, I argue that space exploration is not only essential but can also contribute significantly to addressing our planet's challenges. In this post, I will present my arguments for why space exploration holds vital importance and invite counterarguments to challenge my perspective.

&#x200B;

Space exploration has historically been a catalyst for scientific discoveries and technological advancements. Many technologies we now take for granted, like GPS, satellite communications, and advancements in medical imaging, were originally developed for space missions. The knowledge gained from exploring space expands our understanding of the universe and often has practical applications back on Earth, making it a worthwhile investment in advancing our civilization.

&#x200B;

Astronomical events, such as asteroid impacts, pose a significant threat to life on Earth. By investing in space exploration, we can better monitor near-Earth objects and develop technologies to mitigate potential impacts. It is essential to prepare and safeguard our planet against such catastrophic events, and space exploration plays a vital role in that preparation.

&#x200B;

As Earth's resources become increasingly strained, space exploration offers the potential for our species to expand beyond our home planet. Establishing colonies on other celestial bodies, such as the Moon or Mars, could serve as a safeguard against extinction events and ensure the survival and continuation of humanity in the long run. It provides us with the opportunity to diversify our habitats and become an interplanetary species, ensuring our species' resilience and continuity.

&#x200B;

Space missions have a unique ability to inspire and unite people from all walks of life. The Apollo program, for example, captured the imagination of an entire generation and fostered collaboration among scientists, engineers, and nations. Space exploration can serve as a common goal that transcends borders and encourages cooperation in tackling global challenges. This sense of shared purpose can have positive ripple effects on addressing issues on Earth, promoting international collaboration, and fostering technological progress.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, while space exploration is sometimes criticized as an unnecessary expense, I firmly believe that it is crucial for humanity's future progress and development. The scientific discoveries, technological advancements, planetary defense capabilities, and potential for future colonization make it a strategic investment for our species. I am, however, open to having my views challenged and engaging in respectful discussions to consider alternative perspectives on the matter."

1,2023-08-04,CMV: Not giving your kid privacy during puberty is child abuse,u/Gyropi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15hpzyn/cmv_not_giving_your_kid_privacy_during_puberty_is/,changemyview,"When I was younger, I used to have my door taken off the hinges. This was also around the time I was starting to grow into the body discovery stage of puberty. I had no privacy, even though the things I got grounded for were not for lying/doing a bad thing in private. The bad thing I did most as a kid was bad grades or stay up past my bedtime playing video games. That was about it. 

Not giving your child privacy, especially during the middle school/early high-school age of their lives is cruel and unusual punishment. Without privacy, they won't learn about themselves in an intimate way. 

I know some people who grew up having their door taken off too during those stages, and one of them has issues with intimacy with other people because they had their door taken off most of that age. It can also cause people who were/are AFAB to get anxious about their periods, which is what I will talk about next.

Taking the door off the bathroom is downright disturbing as much as it is invading.  No one should have to feel like they can't take a piss in peace. Menstruators may also have a hard time with their periods and managing stress because of it, especially if they live with brothers or dads. It's already enough to go out into public on your period, but then you add not being able to change your diva cup or whatever with the possibility that someone might walk by. 

Phones. This one is somewhat controversial. My thoughts? Do not go through your child's phone unless you suspect they are in danger at the hands of someone else or they are doing something that is illegal. I can understand going through your 11 year old's iPad or tablet because they are young an impressionable and might be getting themselves into more danger than your average teen would as again, they are young. 

Monitor your kid's content from afar. See what they're watching once in awhile, ask what they're doing, ask who they're talking too, and if they're in danger, I feel it is okay to go through their phone unprecedented.

Let your kid(s) make mistakes online, let them say stupid shit because they could learn if given time. If they aren't learning, take it a step further and ask them to stop texting someone or take down a post. educate them about the effects of online harassment and dangers of using the web for illegal stuff. 

Tell them facts about the internet and teach them how to use it for good (oh god, just don't let them use reddit or 4chan). Be blunt, honest. Get TRUE statistics. And if they're at or over the age of 15 treat them like adults (with a few exceptions of course). Keep calm and collected, because as a former teen, it feel so good to be seen as someone who can make their own decisions. Bottom line is treat your kid(s) with respect and understanding, because believe it or not they might actually love you more and respect you more.

1,2023-08-04,CMV: It is wrong to buy new items with the intention of reselling the item for a higher price,u/PieNo342,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15hqoli/cmv_it_is_wrong_to_buy_new_items_with_the/,changemyview,"TLDR: skip to the section that says “arguments” the first sentence of every point there gives the argument, followed by me defending it. 

Disclaimer: I’m specifically talking about reselling new items. I understand that there is also a lot of discussion around the ethics of reselling used items you find in thrift stores. While I don’t agree with doing that either, I do accept it has one decent argument: that the clothes they buy might have ended up in a landfill. This post is about resellers who go after new items, because that’s what I’m currently annoyed about and I don’t see any valid arguments to justify it.

Every time there is a cute item trending on Tiktok the resellers will have cleared their city out of that item within a couple days. Every time I have seen a cute, trending item on tiktok, the resellers had already gotten all the ones in my city. These resellers then upcharge the hell out of these items.

I live in a large city, that has 6 home good stores in and surrounding the city. There is an item that I’ve been looking for for a couple of weeks. I’ve been to every store in the city, and check the store near my house every day. Today, I was told the store got 8 more in but that someone bought all 8. Now, I don’t know for certain this was a reseller. But I don’t know why any normal person would want 8 of the same item.

The item in question is $24.99, I notice that the most common price resellers charge for it online is $80-$85. That’s over 3 times the original price. I saw one listing for $135, although I understand this is an outlier. 

My arguments:

1. It’s messed up they always do this. This isn’t a one time incident. Every time something trends online they buy out the item within a couple of days.

2. It isn’t a fair fight when competing with them. First, there are so many of them always checking these stores. Second, they keep up with all the trends so they have already bought all the items before you even know the item exists. Third, if this is their only job then they can check during the day when most people are at work. Also there are a couple of resellers who post a lot about reselling, so a lot more people are getting into reselling. This will further make it more difficult to compete with them.

3. They aren’t contributing anything good to the world. Most jobs have a purpose that benefits society (or is meant to benefit society). Their job is to just make it where people must pay more money to buy any trending item.

4. They upcharge the items by so much. I’ll admit that I wouldn’t like them even if they barely upcharged. But it seems like, on average, they upcharge 3 times the amount. That’s insane.

5. Their job not only doesn’t contribute anything good to society, their job just makes others sad. Other jobs that ruin someone’s day include things like tow trucks. Yet tow trucks are techinally helping the people who own the parking spot. They’re providing a service that helps someone."

1. I will put the parameters of what could change my view at the bottom of the post. It won't be impossible outside of that, but that would be the best way to convince me.
2. I do believe that free speech at the Government level is needed to maintain freedom. This does not disable private entities from moderating their platforms. More on this one in the main part.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have been seeing all over the internet in the last couple of years a lot of people who plop a piece of evidence, and make a claim based on that piece of evidence, that said evidence directly disprove. It could be a video that shows a factual crime being perpetrated, it could be a memo or a letter from person A to person B that shows an actual criminal intent, or it could be a full photoshoot that shows two people met in an alley, and made an exchange that didn't go on anyone's record.

A recent example would be the letter in which then Vice-President Joe Biden clearly stating he apologizes for not being able to meet someone who is/was a business partner to Hunter Biden, being paired with a statement of fact that this ""proves"" that Joe Biden met with that person.

***It is important to understand that my statement about how the evidence does not confirm the claim being made, does not mean that the event didn't happen.*** I merely mean this statement to mean exactly what it says on the box: It does not prove the claim. It in fact disproves it, if you want to accept it as evidence. The claim can still be correct and factual, but this evidence plays against it.

The issue arises in the downwards spiral nature of this misinterpretation of evidence. It takes only one person who has a large enough following, and suddenly, the argument moves from ""*does this evidence actually prove the claim?*"" to ""*that person with a following said it, this has to mean it's true.*"" and the entire conversation becomes whether or not the platformed person of influence is credible enough, and it becomes a conversation about the person, rather than about the claim and its evidence, and then it devolves instantly into a game of identity politics.

This would, ***OBVIOUSLY,*** have to be only when the person making the claim, and the person providing the evidence, can be shown to be one and the same. If person A makes a claim, and person L brings an evidence that contradicts the claim, person A should not be penalized for the actions of person L.

Here is a few rebukes I already expect, but feel free to add your own in the comments:

1. ***""But how do you determine what's true, what's fact, and what's fake?!""***: The neat part with how I phrased this, is that it does NOT rely on the evidence being credible, and it does NOT rely on the statement having been accepted as fact in a court of law. It merely asks ""is the claim X actually disproven by presented evidence A?"", and if the answer is ""Yes"", delete the post, and apply the penalty.
2. ***""That's not really going to happen, because this would reduce traffic for those forums.******""***: Any platform refusing to apply this standard should then be penalized in some way. Either by the internet creating a detailed and searchable database of all untrustworthy sources of ""facts"", or by the implementation of heavy fines and , up to and including disallowing the forum from operating in countries that apply these. Ah, government stepping in... I think it suddenly is time to address my second disclaimer.
   1. The Government should not be able to hit you for speaking an opinion against it or other citizens. ***There is, however, a strong difference between silencing an opinion, and penalizing active and repeated libel, slander, or other actions that could harm someone's life in a permanent fashion.*** I want to ideally have people be careful of the statements they are comfortable to claim is ""fact"".
3. ***""This is an attack on my freedom of speech!!!""***: No, it isn't. You can still make statements of opinion. ""I believe X did Y."" You can still bring up the evidence, and discuss the opinions you have about it. ""I believe this is fake, because I think it's too convenient."" You can give an in-depth analysis of all that fun stuff, and give your opinion at the end, so long as the opinion is appropriately marked as an opinion, and not a fact, so that anyone referring to your direct content cannot say ""this is a fact, because he said so"".
   1. To add to this: I'm not even stopping you from fabricating your own evidence. Just don't point at a picture of a murder victim that was visibly shot to death, and claim that this person died from a plane crash.
4. ***""Okay, but how do you police all that?""***: Reporting. A lot of it. And force the person doing the reporting to explain how evidence exhibit X directly disproves claim A, made by the same person in the same conversation. Make allowances for when the evidence is brought in a way that shows they have found new evidence that makes them reconsider.
   1. For the forums that do not have active moderation, like private websites/domains, initiate a lawsuit over misleading the public/slander/libel.

I can't think of any other obvious rebukes I can add to that list, so I'll come to address my first disclaimer... The parameters to change my mind, because I know that won't be obvious from the text of the post itself. To change my view, you must explain to me in a way that I cannot rebuke with ease, one of the following things:

* ***That relevant forums are already being held to a high enough standard that it doesn't affect public discourse.*** I mean, just looking at twitter and political subreddits, this is clearly not a fact, but maybe you have insights, exhibits and evidence to prove me wrong.
* ***How evidence contradicting a claim can actually prove a claim, without relying on another claim being proven initially.*** Ideally something else than ""media suppression"", because that's a cop out excuse that does not even address the internal contradiction of your claim/evidence set.
* ***How claims based on evidence that contradicts it, actually fosters healthy conversation, instead of toxic division.*** Healthy conversation, here, being one that does not devolve into an Ad-Hominem Fu tournament of insults in lieu of actual arguments. ""The fact that this evidence was fabricated to contradict this statement shows that \[blah blah blah\]."" can lead to a discussion on whether or not it's fabricated, why, why not... But that doesn't often happen without devolving, now does it?
* ***Any other fact or demonstration that shows that my method would stifle healthy conversation along with defamatory statements.*** This might just be the easiest way to get me to change my view, if you can make the case.

Happy Discussing!"

Even without good sewing skills you can make a pair of jodhpurs to cover your legs and what nots by stitching some hessian together roughly, it will still work, it wont look like what the young bucks wear but isn't that what clothes are for, just covering your body? Doing this will encourage others to dress this way which frees up more time and money for less frivolous pursuits, the rougher twine also protects your body far bether than the 'attractive' viscoses, cottons and polyesters, polycottons and satins, to the nylons and the denims not to mention the wools. I believe we shouldn't be focusing on the appearance of clothes and acquiring more whenever our whimsy tells us to but on creating simple body coverings and protectors made from the things around us. This also 'earns green bucks' for the planet.  
Change my view. I know it's not the norm which makes me wonder if I am the one who is wrong, it may be harmless to wear those fashionable pieces... so why do I have such strong feelings? I need your input

* One of the biggest reasons OJ was acquitted was because Mark Furman, a man who said under oath, that he has never used the n-word, was proven to use the n-word 33 times in a recording. His use of the n-word has nothing to do with the subject at hand. Race had nothing to do with this trial whatsoever. It was about one man who murdered two others.  

* The jury of 12 had 6 black people on it, who were not going to find OJ guilty whatsoever, even though there WAS evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. Why are there no checks and balances to make sure that the jury isn't just acquitting people to acquit people?  

*  ""If it don't fit you must acquit."" Of course the glove was not going to fit. It was saturated in blood and was taken in and out of a freezer, so the glove is going to shrink and not fit on OJ's gargantuan hands.  

* The Bronco chase. If OJ didn't do it, why was he leading the police on a chase? That SCREAMS Mens Rea to me!  

* If you really went into the nitty gritty of the murder, Nicole and Ron's necks weren't just slashed. They were deep cuts, all the way to the spinal cord. NOT very many people have the strength to cut that deeply.  

* Ito ignored OJ's previous DV charges, which are absolutely related to the matter at hand. A man with a violent history, especially when Nicole is calling 911 frantically and saying that OJ was ""going to beat the shit out of me."" A tiger doesn't change his stripes."

The western part of the panhandle is much closer politically, culturally, and economically to Alabama than to South Florida. Pensacola is much closer to Mobile than any major city in Florida. It shares a time zone with Alabama, different than the rest of Florida.

In addition, the northern border of Florida is not a natural border. It just follows a line of latitude. That's fine if there's a reason, but it lumps very disparate areas under one state government. The Apalachicola River forms the border between Alabama and Georgia, there's no logical reason for it not to extend down to the Gulf. 

This would give Alabama more coastline, and opportunity for tourism dollars. Florida has no shortage of either of those."

But the way women be talking about men just shows that women might be better off without men than vice versa. 

First if there hasn't been any media that has specifically targeted for straight women like how porn is directed at men. There isn't porn for women that involves men. 

According to pornhub and statistics, the vast majority of women including straight women watch lesbian porn. Everything a woman enjoys is often related to lesbians.

Women simply don't seem to find men sexually attractive. If they were there would tons of millions of media would make men seem desirable, that isn't present on mainstream.

 If anything men are seen more sexually threatening than desirable. The biggest sexual threat to a man is another man. Even female rapists are seen as desirable by men. Obviously the reverse dosen’t apply to women

Also the tweets from bisexual women claiming they they only find a select few of women attractive but find almost every women attractive. 

There is simply nothing that women find attractive about men, the only thing they are interested in is friendship ( not that it's a bad thing but it's really nothing special,  it is simply societal basics in forming connections with other humans) there is no sexual or romantic interest. 

Also women far too often claim that they wish they were lesbians. I have yet to come across a man who wishes to be gay. The many attributes associated with men and masculine people are only found attractive and desirable on lesbian and women by women but not on men. 

And probably the best and most concrete evidence of this is how research shows that women who are single are far more happier than women who are married compared to men who are happier married than single. 

This might show that women are far less attracted to men than men are attracted to women.

I would like you to give me opinions on this view so I can know more about this phenomenon and maybe change my view"

At first I thought that is quite accurate since I'm also a GenZ and something praising me feels good obviously. However, as I observe my peers and watch more contents, i realize that this generation could possibly be one of the worst parents.
For starter, most of us are dumb as shit, doing life-threatening trends or challenges for a 15 second video on a daily basis to beg for popularity. These people whom supposedly ""the best parents"" consume tide pods and call it a day.  Furthermore, intrinsic moral values are decomposing everyday, a prime example is loyalty. Why the f... is the standard so f...ing low, that loyalty is worshipped as a virtuous quality instead of the norm along with various other qualities that a half decent person should already have. 
Sure, GenZ might be more conscious about mental health and care about the children well-being more than the previous generations, but their unbalanced attitude to nurturing kids is as harmful as it is of the former generations. Enrolling your kids in an abundance of social classes can be as stressful as attending academic classes. In addition, the ""chill"" type of way to treat your kid is a double bladed knife and I doubt anyone of them would think of it. Leaving the child to a computer or exposing them to it too early on is undoubtedly the worst way to kill a child's brain. Our parents may be obnoxious and annoying and unrespecting of our privacy, yet any adults here can name a thing or two that they are grateful for being scolded by their parents even though at that time, they didn't understand it.

1,2023-08-05,CMV: I don’t think it’s possible to “glow up” unless you weren’t ugly in the first place. There is very little physical self improvement you can do if you are ugly.,u/BonusBrotherz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15iu4cw/cmv_i_dont_think_its_possible_to_glow_up_unless/,changemyview,"As a genetically ugly dude who’s like a 3 on his best day, I’ve seen this idea that one can just “glow up” and become more physically attractive if they are just willing to put in the work. I don’t think this is true. 

I think that typically peoples level of physical attractiveness is set in stone and 90% due to genetics. This gives them a hard upper limit that they can’t surpass unless they get some extensive plastic surgery to fix the flaws in their facial bone structure or height, etc.

I do however think it’s easy to drop below this. Mainly due to weight gain, poor hygiene, and not taking care of yourself. Once they allow these things to overcome their basic level of attractiveness, they shoot down. A natural 7 could easily become a 3 if they get fat, have shitty hygiene or take other actions that make them uglier. 

When people “glow up”, all they’re doing is undoing those actions. This is why glowing up typically happens into early adulthood, as your body exits puberty and hormones stop fluctuating like crazy, you get a chance to undo things like baby fat, adopt a skincare regimen that isn’t impeded by hormonal skin blemishes, you’re producing normal levels of testosterone and estrogen enough to combat weight gain, you’re on your own and able to develop healthy eating habits and go workout if you so please, it’s much easier to hit that window.

I think when you are genetically destined to be ugly, your lows are just lower. When I was in high school I was a 2. I was fat, terrible skin, and I had terrible bone structure, a huge forehead huge lips and a huge nose, Afrocentric features, very dark skin, a negative canthil tilt, but lots of other people around me were in just as bad situations.

When I got to college I started going to the gym regularly, I got more physically active, had more control over my diet, I developed a skincare routine that helped me out, I had my own money so I could get haircuts I wanted, get manicures, get my eyebrows threaded, do all of the things that people do when they’re trying to improve the way they look. 

None of I worked. Hell, I’ve been lifting for now 2.5 years and have fluctuated massively in weight and I still look the exact same I did in high school with just a slightly more defined jawline. That’s because none of the thing that actually make me genetically ugly have changed because unless I get surgery (which I do plan on getting) to fix my problem areas it can’t. No amount of attempted self improvement will fix that.

I think this is the case for any case of “glowing up” for there to be a significant difference you have to already be genetically gifted. If you’re not it’s just putting lipstick on a pig."
1,2023-08-05,"CMV: If you think animals are conscious, can feel pain, and love cats with all your heart yet continue to eat pork, you are a hypocrite.",u/PR1ZE0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15iua7f/cmv_if_you_think_animals_are_conscious_can_feel/,changemyview,"I'll start by saying I don't believe animals are conscious.

From the National Library of Medicine:

* An ongoing challenge in laboratory animal research is to determine whether responses that could merely be nociceptive are also indicative of pain, and, conversely, whether the abolition of nociceptive responses indicates the successful abolition of pain. Thus, in the intact animal (e.g., under light anesthesia that removes some but not all responses to noxious stimuli), the distinction between nociception and pain is not always clear.

&#x200B;

* Other behavioral and physiological responses include withdrawal reflexes, increases in heart rate and blood pressure, and other parameters. Many of these responses can also occur in organisms that do not experience pain (e.g., anesthetized animals, or those with spinal lesions that prevent nociceptive information from reaching higher central nervous system structures). Thus pain and nociception are distinct concepts, and some nociceptive responses (e.g., withdrawal reflexes in spinal cord-transected animals) do not necessarily indicate pain.

&#x200B;

>Nerve impulses from nociceptors may reach the brain, where information about the stimulus (e.g. quality, location, and intensity), and effect (unpleasantness) are registered. Though the brain activity involved has been studied, the brain processes underlying conscious awareness are not well known.

&#x200B;

It is not a proven fact that animals are consciously aware, and can feel pain.

&#x200B;

* &#x200B;

Upon encountering a mirror for the first time, a number of the pigs in the study made repetitive movements while apparently watching themselves in the mirror. These behaviors are interesting because they are similar to the contingency-checking behaviors displayed by other animals e.g., elephants, dolphins and chimpanzees, who pass the definitive mark test, suggesting the pigs could have been monitoring their own movements in the mirror.

* From a comparative perspective, similar unclear results are found in dogs. Howell and Bennett (2011) found that when placed in front of a mirror with their human guardian standing behind them, only two out of 40 dogs were able to understand the actual location of the human.

&#x200B;

Pigs are cognitively complex and share many traits with animals whom we consider intelligent.

We can conclude that pigs are more intelligent than dogs from this.

So why freak out at the sight of a dog being cooked, when you're perfectly fine eating bacon?

No, you can not say "" It was painless. "" You could say the pig didn't feel pain, so it doesn't matter, but only *that* specific pig.

&#x200B;

* Pigs are sensitive to the emotions of other pigs even when the other pigs are responding to a learned cue about a positive or negative outcome.
* Pigs display consistent behavioral and emotional characteristics that have been described variously as personality. e.g., coping styles, response types, temperament, and behavioral tendencies.

Pigs have the ability to seemingly feel stressed at the sight of other pigs in distress, which means they may too possess the capacity to mourn for their dead kin.

Following that train of thought, a pig may feel pain when seeing their loved ones dead, or gone.

You are causing pain to a pig either way, indirectly or not.

1,2023-08-05,"CMV: If you eat bacon, yet think eating a dog is wrong based on the grounds that you shouldn't cause harm to a conscious being, you are a hypocrite.",u/PR1ZE0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15ium9g/cmv_if_you_eat_bacon_yet_think_eating_a_dog_is/,changemyview,"I'll start by saying I don't believe animals are conscious.

&#x200B;

From the National Library of Medicine:

&#x200B;

* An ongoing challenge in laboratory animal research is to determine whether responses that could merely be nociceptive are also indicative of pain, and, conversely, whether the abolition of nociceptive responses indicates the successful abolition of pain. Thus, in the intact animal (e.g., under light anesthesia that removes some but not all responses to noxious stimuli), the distinction between nociception and pain is not always clear.

&#x200B;

* Other behavioral and physiological responses include withdrawal reflexes, increases in heart rate and blood pressure, and other parameters. Many of these responses can also occur in organisms that do not experience pain (e.g., anesthetized animals, or those with spinal lesions that prevent nociceptive information from reaching higher central nervous system structures). Thus pain and nociception are distinct concepts, and some nociceptive responses (e.g., withdrawal reflexes in spinal cord-transected animals) do not necessarily indicate pain.

&#x200B;

>Nerve impulses from nociceptors may reach the brain, where information about the stimulus (e.g. quality, location, and intensity), and effect (unpleasantness) are registered. Though the brain activity involved has been studied, the brain processes underlying conscious awareness are not well known.

&#x200B;

It is not a proven fact that animals are consciously aware, and can feel pain.

&#x200B;

* Upon encountering a mirror for the first time, a number of the pigs in the study made repetitive movements while apparently watching themselves in the mirror. These behaviors are interesting because they are similar to the contingency-checking behaviors displayed by other animals e.g., elephants, dolphins and chimpanzees, who pass the definitive mark test, suggesting the pigs could have been monitoring their own movements in the mirror.

&#x200B;

* From a comparative perspective, similar unclear results are found in dogs. Howell and Bennett (2011) found that when placed in front of a mirror with their human guardian standing behind them, only two out of 40 dogs were able to understand the actual location of the human.

&#x200B;

>Pigs are cognitively complex and share many traits with animals whom we consider intelligent.

&#x200B;

We can conclude that pigs are more intelligent than dogs from this.

&#x200B;

So why freak out at the sight of a dog being cooked, when you're perfectly fine eating bacon?

No, you can not say "" It was painless. "" You could say the pig didn't feel pain, so it doesn't matter, but only that specific pig.

&#x200B;

* Pigs are sensitive to the emotions of other pigs even when the other pigs are responding to a learned cue about a positive or negative outcome.
* Pigs display consistent behavioral and emotional characteristics that have been described variously as personality. e.g., coping styles, response types, temperament, and behavioral tendencies.

&#x200B;

Pigs have the ability to seemingly feel stressed at the sight of other pigs in distress, which means they may too possess the capacity to mourn for their dead kin.

Following that train of thought, a pig may feel pain when seeing their loved ones dead, or gone.

&#x200B;

You are causing pain to a pig either way, indirectly or not.

With that in mind, you can not justify treating a pig differently from a cat based on ethical grounds, without being a hypocrite."

   I think killing any person is objectively and morally wrong no matter how we look at it. The only time I believe it is acceptable to kill is 1 in self defense, 2 in defense of our homes, 3 and in defense of our nations and only in this order.

   In the world we live in we are supposed to be moral civilized individuals and killing is not. Our court and judicial system should be held with a higher standard. Eye for an eye or in this case life for a life is no longer acceptable.

   I understand that if someone is convicted for heinous crimes like murder, rape, and spree killing you would want to remove them from this earth and just forget about them. however for us to be better moral civilized people we cannot just kill our criminals. We have to be better than them. We have to hold people accountable for their actions and not just execute them like animals. Let them die alone with their own thoughts 

  Once a person commits a horrible crime they revoke their rights to be apart of our society. However In the end they are still human beings no matter how evil, vicious, or disgusting there actions may be. I believe a mandatory 24 hour social isolation life sentence is much more acceptable than death."

Mainly because we want to have some type of false equivalence, or absolve or pass blame.

 1) Africans only provided captives to the whites like the whites wanted them to,and their role ended there. It was the whites who dragged the victims across the ocean killing half of them, then putting them into ""seasoning camps"" then decided what to do with the victims and their descendants for the next few hundred years. The first Africans brought to what became the United States in 1619 were indentured servants, not lifelong slaves. So were they ""sold by other Africans into indentured servitude?"" Come on. 

   2) So many people want to act like whites were just out on an ocean cruise, and out of nowhere Africans came and forced themselves onto the whites. It was the white traders who went around to different tribes on the Atlantic Coast of Africa and trapped the tribes in an arms race for their guns in order to get the tribes to capture people for them. And it was also those whites who showed the tribes how to use guns, so when they attacked other tribes those tribes couldn't defend themselves. The tribes didn't have one another in refrigerators on the coast just waiting to ""sell"" to the first ships that came over the horizon. If you were in their place, you most likely would have done the same thing. Which brings me to the next point....... 

   3) Whites did this very same thing to other races of people, including Native Americans in what became the United States. "" The increased rise of the gun-slave trade forced the other tribes to participate or their refusal to engage in enslaving meant they would become targets of slavers "" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery\_among\_Native\_Americans\_in\_the\_United\_States Whites also did this with Indonesians, and even Japanese people, whom no one ever says ""sold their own people"" despite the fact that they were all the same ethnicity and culture. So why all this shit is talked about with Africans, who were different ethnic groups, and that they wanted to protect their own asses with the weaponry that whites had? Curiously, EVERYTIME I tell someone this when they throw around the ""Africans sold their own people"" or ""Africans sold other Africans"" crap, they always get silent because they have no rebuttal for it. Oh, and of course nobody ever says anything about how Holocaust victims were murdered and victimized by ""their own people"" or ""fellow Europeans"" FOR NO REASON, IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 

   4) No one said white people ""invented slavery"" but what whites involved in American slavery sure as hell did invent was permanent hereditary chattel plantation slavery based on race, once white plantation owners reached the conclusion that blacks provided the best results for plantation labor. That really hadn't existed quite to the same degree elsewhere.  
5) The reason why American slavery is more well known that Arab slavery or Roman Empire slavery was because it was AMERICAN slavery. It was more recent and it lasting effects that are still around today with things like segregation.  
6) We're always told ""whites ended slavery"" out of the goodness of their hearts, ignoring the real reason it was abolished https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery  
7) we are told of these so-called ""black"" planters in America, as if to call blacks in America hypocrites, while again ignoring context. https://www.straightdope.com/21343919/were-some-u-s-slave-owners-black

All of these items cost effort and/or money to various degrees, but people have no great excuse not to be attractive in the modern day and age, and any difficulty in dating they face due to lack of attractiveness is their own fault.

I myself used to be quite ugly, being fat and having a receding chin. I lost weight and got a sliding genioplasty surgery (paid all by myself) to make my chin look better. I am currently making effort to lose fat a bit more to get a chiseled look. None of this came easy (specifically the weight part. Surgery was easier since all I had to do on my part was to just obey the surgeon's orders and endure some pain), but I did it.

I do sympathize with people on journeys to make themselves look better, as long as they do it within reason. However, I have a hard time sympathizing with those who complain online that everything is lost for them because they are genetically unlucky or something, when it is apparent that they put forth no effort into even the more accessible stuff like fitness.

It was implying he didn't fight back possibly because something was psychologically wrong with him for always having had so much wealth. It makes sense to me to say wealthy people have something psychologically wrong with them. But it doesn't make sense to me to imply that they could be manipulated easier because of it. What would you use to manipulate them? Money is what most people want to obtain. Him having a mental breakdown due to his creation of the atomic bomb makes sense to me. I know Hitler was awful, a terrible threat. But the idea that there was no other way to stop him than with the bomb just doesn't fly with me. I think Oppenheimer's subsequent mental breakdown is evidence he understood that too. And he was aware of he gravity of his actions. I don't know all the details of what happened. I haven't seen the movie or read the book. But being a galaxy brain and having known some galaxy brains I've seen and experienced the special flavor of abuse we are forced to endure.

Don’t get me wrong. I agree with avoiding the big guns in far right spaces like Fox News and Tucker Carlson. I agree with avoiding giving money to people like JK Rowling, who know what they are doing is contributing to bigotry and don’t care.

A humble, accepting, loving moderate Catholic is absolutely a part of the same group as a Neo-Evangelist who uses their platform to disenfranchise minorities and spread hate and fear.

Either you obey me now and there's no trouble, or I'll have to force you to comply and it'll be a lot harder for everyone involved.""*

I spent 30 years in a religious-conservative upbringing, much of it in the Bible Belt. In the mindset of many religious conservatives, they see themselves as the rule-setters for America. And they're getting exasperated because the rest of America, the ""children"", aren't listening to them, the ""parents.""

Religious conservatives think they've spent decades offering America the ""easy"" way: Just listen to them, comply, obey, turn from their wicked ways, and all would be fine. Instead, decade after decade, secular America rejected their extended olive branch. Religious conservatives tried appeals, talking, debates, books - and all of it fell on deaf ears, in their view. So since secular America refused to listen to them the ""easy way,"" religious conservatives now have no choice but to go the ""hard way"": Force things on America via theocracy.

That's why you see people like Ron DeSantis and his theocracy approach in Florida, why someone like Trump is popular, why you see the Lance Wallnau ""Seven Mountains Mandate"" and Charlie Shamp/Kat Kerr/Mario Murillo false prophets becoming so popular - because they embody this mentality. They embody the mindset of ""America refused to obey us the easy way, so now we have to do things the hard way and force America to get in line."" Religious conservatives are embracing a theocratic approach because they see no other choice.

I've even known Christian conservatives who said, *""You don't let a child choose whether he or she wants to go to school or not - you force them to go because you know it's good for them. So why should church attendance be any different?""*

This sort of approach is even more popular because it's precisely what the Bible praised certain ""righteous kings"" for, such as Josiah and Hezekiah - they were kings who smashed the idols by force, imposed God's religion on the populace by force, and didn't care what people had to say about it - they did what was right and refused to listen to any naysayers. So in the eyes of many American Christian conservatives, that's what America needs - presidents and governors who will impose Godliness on America by force, whether America likes it or not. They want a President Josiah, a Governor Hezekiah, etc.

I wanted simply to pose this question to the community, but I’m trying to work around the requirements of the format and submit it in CMV form.  
All things being equal, I’d rather not associate or be associated with or support the self-gratification activities of wealthy narcissists. Given the recent behavior of the owners and management of Reddit I’ve wondered if there are alternatives to this and other subs outside of the platform.   
To be clear: I’m not opposed to profit or the creation/accumulation of wealth. But the arc of institutions like this seems to be   
\~ The creation of a popular, vibrant, useful framework for attracting communities of people   
\~ Which communities of people create the very value of the institution  
\~ Which value presents the opportunity to expand profit but only at the expense of parts of the community and/or the people working to facilitate that community  
At some point it seems unhealthy to shrug one’s shoulders and accept that healthy communities will always be crippled by those who would profit from them.   
And especially today, with so many examples of evil, stupid, self-destructive CEO’s making fools of themselves while crippling their service (Elon Musk), ripping off their clients (Sam Bankman-Fried) and sometimes killing their customers (Stockton Rush) I’m finding the association more and more distasteful.   
Modern life is full of odious compromises. AT&T backs right-wing propaganda merchants, but I can’t find a better cell phone provider. Amazon sells nazi paraphernalia and mistreats their employees and Jeff Bezos is the biggest welfare queen on the planet, but who can get along without Amazon now that they’ve put so many other retailers out of business?  
There may not be a functional equivalent to Reddit but I’d like to explore the possibilities.   
Otherwise, can someone change my mind, gentle my conscience and make a case that visiting Reddit isn’t becoming an unpalatable activity?"

1. Unlike Prigozhin, the average Russian oligarch does not have a private army at their disposal. It is obviously quite difficult to seize power without the means to back it up via force. Also warranting consideration is the heavily depleted state of Russia's armed forces and thus the lack of equipment (both activated and stored) and troops available to any wannabe general.
2. A civil war or internal conflict requires popular support of at least two factions with opposing goals, and the average Russian citizen is apolitical. During the Wagner rebellion, civilians in Russian cities occupied by the mercenaries could be seen going about their business just like any normal day.
3. Finally, China has a keen interest in keeping Russia stable for the purposes of advancing its own geopolitical goals. They will do whatever they believe is nessecary in order to keep the metaphorical peace.

1,2023-08-05,CMV: Humanity has not been visited by “non-human intelligence”,u/JFKme,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15j96fq/cmv_humanity_has_not_been_visited_by_nonhuman/,changemyview,"David Grusch recently testified before the US congress that the United States is in possession of air/spacecraft operated by non-human intelligence. He has also mentioned in an interview that the United States is in possession of bodies of pilots flying these craft and they were non-human in origin. He goes on to elaborate that they have had these craft and bodies for decades and have even involved other foreign entities, specifically the Vatican, who have helped them recover these craft.

I think this is ridiculous. It would require a multi-national effort with airtight secrecy lasting decades. It would require multiple nations and government officials to stay silent on this topic and have no photographic evidence or other objective evidence of these craft fall into public hands. 

The non-human intelligence would need to constantly operate in a covert manner and avoid large populations of humanity to avoid having indisputable proof of their existence documented. Despite multiple private and public entities attempting to search for intelligent life on other planets, the only entities who have supposedly found proof of intelligent life are shadowy classified government entities. 

I think the far more likely answer is that David Grusch is either mistaken, mislead, or intentionally misleading people"

Furthermore, in modern times men are still held accountable to their traditional gender roles such as: protecting the women in case of some physical threat, paying for the first date(i have heard women say that they will not go on a second date if the man did not pay for the first date or even if he asks to split the check), initiating conversation, planning the date, initiating sex, doing all of the work during sex(if the women does not have an orgasm she will blame it on the man for not doing enough)men don't blame women for them not having an orgasm, paying alimony(even though most women today are not housewives and have their own jobs), i have even heard single mothers say that if a man wants to take her out on a date he has to pay for her child's babysitter, they also expect the man to pay for her child's other expenses  that she had with her previous partner(i have not heard men saying they wnat their next women to pay for their previous child)

Also(This is just a rant):from my personal observation the people who use the term fatphobic in order to gaslight other people into finding them attractive are disproportionately women, telling men they are insecure if they have any standards(i have even heard women say that men are insecure if they don't want to marry a women who is a prostitute, stripper, porn actress, onlyfans model etc.)"

I see a lot of people calling her hateful and transphobic but couldn't actually find evidence that convinced me it was true.

For example I found this Vox article:
https://www.vox.com/culture/23622610/jk-rowling-transphobic-statements-timeline-history-controversy

and I didn't read the whole thing because every point they brought up, once I systematically looked into each point just seemed like an exaggerated nothing burger and it got exhausting halfway through. It seems the author is grasping at straws.

Accidentally liking and then un-liking a tweet instead of saving it for research for a book she was writing is not transphobic. Supporting someone who was unlawfully fired (as ruled later on) is not transphobic. If those things are transphobic than the brush is so wide that transphobia becomes meaningless, and trivializes the real hateful comments that hurt people.

I even read through a post she wrote on her own website in 2020 that people say is hateful and nothing in it seemed hateful to me.

So CMV: I'd like to see some real evidence from the horses mouth that she hates trans people."

I'm all for private debates but public debates create a unhealthy environment precisely because there is an audience. Debaters have a high pressure to 'win' the debate so they resort to sophistry and jokes. You might think that is unethical but they are not to blame, it is the behavior that is rewarded by the system.

Think about it, when is the last time you saw someone change their opinion midway the debate? I never saw this except in a sarcastic way and I saw dozens of debates (while I was into them).

Another limiting factor is the audience. You have to stay on the level of the audience to win them over so that limits the quality of the debate.

Attacking your opponent is more effective than defemding and responding to arguments. Especially if you can sprinkle some assumptions into your attack that your opponent will have to elaborate on and uncover. If he responds to your criticism he won't have a time to attack you especially if you bombard him with 5 carefully crafted attacks. If he doesn't respond you can claim he is dodging your question and is unable to answer it. This is why some debates go into an absolute chaos where most arguments are not addressed and the wittiest and most charismatic person wins.

Of course, nothing of this happens in private debates with good faith because there is no need to. There is no punishment for losing debate and changing your mind, you won't be humiliated in front of the crowd. And even if you deal with arrogant person you can just tell him you are not interested in continuing. You usually debate with curious honest people and friends, you can avoid people who are dishonest without staining your career."

It perplexes and disgusts me that so many people continue to subsidize a figure that has always been a problematic human being and performer, even being arrested long before in 2017 for inciting a violent riot at a show, and even racking up a few alleged assault allegations in his short time in the limelight. I think everyone can agree that his apology for the Astroworld incident wasn’t perfect and some would even argue, fake.

1,2023-08-06,CMV: I don't like the LGBTQIA+ community anymore,u/ch0cko,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15jgiut/cmv_i_dont_like_the_lgbtqia_community_anymore/,changemyview,"Hear me out... I could not care less about the inherent qualities of LGBTQIA+. I'm talking about the community, not the letters or labels. It's the fact that way too many things are being labelled \[xyz\]phobic. 

For example,

[https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/15hk9li/my\_best\_friend\_is\_heading\_down\_the\_path\_of/?sort=confidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/15hk9li/my_best_friend_is_heading_down_the_path_of/?sort=confidence)

People in the comments and OP labelled the person in the story *a bigot* for saying that children shouldn't transition at young ages such as three... which is valid. If children are exposed to gender identity at a young age, they can easily mix up being masculine or feminine with wanting to be a different gender. At 3 years old, you do not even have a conscious yet- barely, anyway. You can argue that dysphoria for one's gender identity can come about at young ages but even then, there are going to be *too many children* confusing masculinity and feminity with them wanting to be a different gender. 

That person is in no way a bigot and some of the things said in the post are silly. They say that it's not an opinion to be \[xyz\]phobic. Basically, saying ""I don't like gay people,"" is not an opinion by their standard. The person who was labelled a bigot is also a bisexual person which makes me think they're a bigot even less. The post got 1,500 upvotes which is worrying, too. 

Secondly, *neo pronouns*. Neo pronouns essentially allow people to make their pronouns anything. There are pronouns like, ""catself, cat,"" and ""frogself, frog."" There are also mirror pronouns where one is meant to refer to people who use mirror pronouns with the pronouns you use. E.g. a she will use she and a he will use he and a they will use they.   


[https://www.reddit.com/r/neopronouns/comments/108dw3u/pronoun\_tryout/](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopronouns/comments/108dw3u/pronoun_tryout/)  


This post is from someone asking for new pronouns to try out... I don't think this should be normalised; it's silly. Pronouns exist because it makes speech easier:

Instead of saying ""John walked to the shops. John bought milk. John then went and bought some food,"" you would say, ""John walked to the shops. He bought milk. He then went and bought some food."" 

But when neo pronouns are thrown into the mix, it goes like this, ""John walked to the shops. Catself bought milk. Cat then went and bought some food."" It is confusing and difficult to use in practice. It gets even worse when people are offended because of it which happened to me in real life when I used the wrong pronouns for a mirror pronouned person.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/neopronouns/comments/10s4sy5/a\_vent\_about\_people\_and\_those\_who\_use\_neos/](https://www.reddit.com/r/neopronouns/comments/10s4sy5/a_vent_about_people_and_those_who_use_neos/)

This person argues that neo pronouns apparently make people more comfortable... but I don't see how they would. Using neo pronouns would just result in more insults and bullying and neo pronouns are more or less just a second name. I am not aware of any studies on neo pronouns and if there is a legitimate dysphoria for them and if there is a real study on that, that would likely change my mind.

Just to reiterate, I have no problem with people being LGBTQIA+, but from what I can see, the community itself doesn't seem very good. There's the entire diabolical between the community themselves where some would think being bisexual wasn't ""valid"" or ""real"" and that pride parade where the people said, ""we're coming for your children."" While generalization isn't good, a lot of the LGBTQ *community* seems bad. 

Okay, that's probably it. CMV

1. **The important parts of history are largely known.** Sure, historians may be able to find out more details, but they're largely pointless. Few significant things about history could be learned. Some things may be huge mysteries of history that would be interesting to be found out about, yes, but at the end of the day the important things we can learn from history have been learnt.
2. **History has never been that important.** I saw someone say that people needed to be educated about the Holocaust to make sure it doesn't happen again, inferring the need for historians. However, does it really take history to make people realize that an action like the holocaust is horrible? Modern day standards already would make it pretty clear these actions aren't tolerated.
3. **History, moreover, doesn't have much more to discover in all areas except biology.** I don't really see much more of a need for learning more about the past for implications in areas beyond biology, specifically evolutionary theory.

What feminism means to me is this: a man and a woman deserve equal rights and the right to choose however they want to live their life without judgement. Both men and women are equally valuable.

I'm feeling pressured not to disappoint women. Like I'm not supposed to take care of my man or do a little extra cleaning or pay for more even though I can and have the time to. I throw out terms like mansplaining when my boyfriend has an opinion about something like he's supposed to just blindly agree with me on everything. It's so hard for us to just have a good natured debate and conversation without me trying to dominate him and become argumentative. I feel like feminists (not feminism) are not allowing me to make my own rules because I'm so scared to disappoint womanhood but now l'm starting to feel like I'm becoming what we hate about men. I'm overbearing and shutting my boyfriend down. I think he feels like he's walking on egg shells around me. And I'm not really this person, I feel like I'm supposed to be. Like l've got the eyes of women over me.

My boyfriend is loved by women. He is the sweetest person. When you talk to him, you feel like you're talking to an equal. He listens and there's no weird power dynamics yet I treat him like he's a serial misogynist. I know it hurts his feelings.

All the while, the feminists are also whispering in my ear ""when last has a planned a date? You know he's not a man if he doesn't plan dates right?"" ""Are you a passenger princess? Real men don't let their women drive.""

Honestly it's just all too much. I don't even know what I believe anymore. All I know is that I'm scared of feminists and I'm scared that I'm going to disappoint women and my future daughter one day.

There's so many rules that we have applied to men and they're not allowed to apply any rules to us lest they're called sexist and misogynistic. It all seems very unfair and a lot.

2. Lack of internal social problems in the west:Russia and China are currently suffering from low birth rates,internal debt,shortage of water,corruption,authoritarianism,aging population….. But the west doesn’t have the problems mentioned above and is still growing strongly economically by having Google,Facebook,Youtube,Instagram,Paypal,Microsoft,Mcdonalds but the non western countries have got nothing to compete with other than Tiktok

3. The West has a good reputation: The west doesn’t have uyghur camps,forced labour,one party system,state controlled economy,censorship,doesn’t make developing countries fall into debt traps,doesn’t force women to stay obedient to their husband,has the best education in the world(IB,GCE A Level,SAT),alloows freedom of religion,funds african nations,supports suffering countries from authoritarian regimes but non western countries are known for having dictators and are against human rights

4. The global culture is western dominated: Even if you use Tiktok instead of Youtube the majority of users are from the west and produce new video trends that are followed after by people from non western countries and they still use instragram youtube google amazon all the time.

I fully understand that the states created the federal government, not the other way around, and that's why there has always been a necessity to balance states' sovereignty with individual rights.

That being said, Republicans in New York and Democrats in Texas have very little influence over a presidential election, and votes cast for president in Wyoming have [3x the influence](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-09-20/electoral-college-why-should-wyoming-voters-have-more-power-than-californians) of votes cast in California. **Republicans have won the popular vote just once in the past 30 years, yet have governed for 12 of those years.**

Similarly, the Senate is deeply undemocratic, where 40 million Californians and 580,000 Wyomingians have equal representation. It just makes no sense; in this balance between individual rights and states' sovereignty, it seems very weighted in the direction of the states.

There has to be a better way to represent states' sovereignty while still ensuring that the views of a clear majority of Americans are represented in government (the literal definition of democracy). The vast majority of Americans hold liberal positions on [same-sex marriage](https://news.gallup.com/poll/506636/sex-marriage-support-holds-high.aspx), [abortion](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/), [universal healthcare](https://news.gallup.com/poll/468401/majority-say-gov-ensure-healthcare.aspx), and even [guns](https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/state-advocacy/universal-background-checks-for-gun-purchases/), but cannot influence public policy if they all live in a small number of liberal states.

I would argue that today, America cannot be considered a modern democracy, and is ranked as a ""flawed democracy"" in 30th place in the [Economist Democracy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist_Democracy_Index). Only by reforming or abolishing the Electoral College and the Senate, and actually allowing the majority of Americans to impact public policy with their votes, can it be considered a full, modern democracy."

I've heard the argument that sex work is wrong because you could conceive a child that neither parent wants, but if that was the case, then we'd only shame sex workers who have PIV sex (remember, many SWs only do pole/lap dances, sell pictures, etc), and we wouldn't shame sex workers who are sterilized or require their male clients to be sterilized. Yet society doesn't make those distinctions.

I've heard the argument that sex work is wrong because it encourages cheating. In that scenario, *cheating* is the crime, not sex. The sex worker who has been hired by the cheater has done nothing wrong, yet receives some of the stigma.

I've heard the argument that sex work is harmful because it encourages violence against women. In that scenario, the sexual act that is being performed is not the problem; the men's entitlement to another person's body is the problem. 

I've heard that it's harmful because of the spread of STDs, yet many of us (in the USA, at least) are encouraged to go into work when we have the flu or Covid- spreading illness in favor of productivity- and that's not shamed the way sex work is.

The woman is only renting out time with something that she already owns and controls - her body. Every single person who earns an hourly wage or salary has also agreed to rent out their body or mind to their job in exchange for money. Why is it respectable to rent out my hands to a grocery store for an hour bagging groceries, but it's not respectable to rent out my vagina to a man for an hour of pleasure? Neither job is skilled labor, so don't claim that sex work is just 'too easy' to be respectable.

 

Sex work (when entered into willingly, and fully controlled by the participant) is not shameful, wrong, or harmful. Change my mind."

I understand that some jobs require it too for example a police officer should not be an ex-murderer but 99% of the time they are highly problematic. For example, if you are hiring for a marketing manager role why would you ask for a background check? I think they highly encourage bias. For instance, a guy using mariujana once in college and getting arrested for it can be career ending or someone that worked at a firm like Enron as an accountant can face problems for the rest of their life. I think background checks should only consist of verifying already given information and more through checks should only be available with special permission."

I'm not the largest proponent of the Electoral College, I won't pretend to defend it, *but*, NapaVoInterCo, is subversion against the residents of the states, the goal of the EC is to represent states, so NapaVoInterCo defeats that goal in horrible fashion, if your state was in NapaVoInterCo and it went into an effect your state could vote for one party but it's electoral votes go to another which is messed up, on top of that you would end up getting dueling results an guy could easily win the Electoral College until NapaVoInterCo throws it the other guys way, this can lead to choas and during results, and 2 candidates would legitimately claim they won leading to 

1. The Supreme Court getting involved 

2. An Venezuela style presidential crisis

Both of those outcomes aren't good anyone, either NapaVoInterCo is ruled Unconsitiounal or we get 2 dueling results and/or Presidents I'll give an Scenario 

Imagine NapaVoInterCo goes into effect during an tight election, Candidate A, we will call him Billy manages to carry 306 electoral votes to Jim's 232, *but*, NapaVoInterCo happens and the results on the compact flip the election towards Jim So both sides would claim victory And The Supreme Court would have to do something Search up the 1876 election There were dueling electors and stuff got so bad The Supreme Court formed an concil

I'm glad Trump will go to jail. But I'm extremely concerned about the future. I cant shake the feeling - Trump isn't the US's Hitler, nor our Caesar. He's the guy who inspires them.

My grim prediction: 

Trump will lose 2024, he will go to jail. The republicans will disavow him, at which point he will run 3rd party from jail. He'll begin calling for outright revolution and violence on the streets. The pandemonium will be quelled, Biden will be the DNC nominee and win the general. But the country will never be the same.

The fractured republican party and the newly formed ""Patriot party"" will struggle for influence a bit. Trump will fashion himself a political prisoner. All the while, right wing militias will continue to train and swell in number. But Trump won't be successful at martialling their might - He'll try, but he'll be ordered muzzled in that regard, since he's in prison. At this point, we'll have a full on insurgency on our hands, not unsimilar to the middle east. Regular right wing terrorist attacks, assassinations, etc. Northern Ireland style. 

Trump will languish in jail, all the while being viewed by the ignorant Trumpist herd as a victim on their behalf. A Jesus figure. Donald Trump JR, or another young charismatic leader will arise to take his place. Because the pandoras box of open political vitriol soundbites can't be closed. The new age of social media politics is here to stay. Expect the Elon Musks of the world to provide them a platform, and enthusiastically shill them. 

By this time, the republican party will be in shambles. The patriot party will have ridden the wave of public anger towards so called ""politic prisoner Trump"" dying in prison. They will eventually get elected into power.

And when they do, they'll immediately implement martial law, claiming the government has been run by traitors and we need to use the Insurrection Act. They'll purge the entire ""deep-state"" and replace it with loyalists, as per Curtis Yarvin's recommendations. And the republic will die that day. THAT man, will be our Caesar.

I hope I'm wrong. But I predict we'll lose our republic within 15 years. Maybe not even that long. 

Please CMV, because I'm losing sleep over this prospect, and while I may be wrong on some particulars, the overall shape and trajectory seem almost inevitable. Like.... what do we do with the vast swathes of brainwashed Trumpists? They aren't going anywhere."

&#x200B;

Person A: The government should do \[XYZ\] / Society would be better if we had \[XYZ\] / Most people I know support \[XYZ\] why isn't it implemented?

Person B: You aren't entitled to \[XYZ\], you should stop complaining and do \[ABC\] to improve yourself. Regardless of whether \[ABC\] is actually a feasible solution, I support the status quo and changing it is certainly a bad idea. 

If the argument of Person B is deconstructed, it can be shown that the claim of entitlement does very little to contribute to their overall point. At best, it only serves as emphasis. At worst, it's used as a conversation killer which stops any meaningful dialogue from taking place.  

The dictionary definition of entitle is ""give someone a legal right or a just claim to receive or do something"". Assuming that someone is using the ""legal right"" definition of entitle, it's trivial to show that \[XYZ\] isn't currently legal or condoned by the law, but it's textbook circular reasoning. Everyone knows that, the point of discussion is about whether \[XYZ\] should be a legal right, not about whether it currently is. 

Assuming someone is using the ""just claim"" definition, then surely additional pieces of supporting evidence should be presented to justify the statement. Simply saying something is a just claim is merely the opening statement in a debate. In any case, people have very different ideas about what exactly constitutes vague concepts like justice. Debates and discussions should be focused around the conflicting values, and how they relate to these concepts. 

If the statement of Person B is rephrased to become a coherent argument, it would sound like this : ""Currently you do not have a legal right to \[XYZ\], and I will do what I can to prevent modifications to the legal code. I strongly believe that you don't have a just claim to \[XYZ\], and you do not deserve \[XYZ\]"" 

Doing so reveals that nothing of substance has been said by either person A or person B. A merely said ""Hooray for \[XYZ\]!"" and B responded 'Boo \[XYZ\]!"" 

It should also be noted that the word entitle is rarely utilized by the person who seeks the claim to something, even when it's not necessarily semantically incorrect. This supports the idea that entitlement has practically become a way to denigrate someone's opinions in a relatively mature way. 

I strongly believe that the term entitlement is often used to prop up a defence of the status quo by people who struggle to construct a stronger argument. This doesn't happen all the time, but when the word comes up, people often utilize it as if it's a synonym for ""someone does not deserve something"". Regardless of who's right and who's wrong, bring up the concept of entitlement will only serve to further entrench both sides.   CMV.

1,2023-08-06,CMV: Humanity is entering a period of Accelerated Change which threatens high volatility and conflict that will challenge our way of life significantly. And I want to brief world leaders on this.,u/kris_lace,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15jzn4l/cmv_humanity_is_entering_a_period_of_accelerated/,changemyview,"\## Problem statement 

Humanity is going to enter a very high period of conflict as it's global institutions and models will fail to meet the conditions of accelerated change and stability efforts won't be enough to slow it down without significant conflict still.

\## Acceleration of Change

Humanity is facing a phenomenon called \*Accelerated Change\* which hypothetically \[could cause global destability\](https://i.imgur.com/Ms0ekNc.jpg).   
  
The premise is that change is accelerating at an, accelerated rate. That doesn't mean that the rate of change has hit some high top speed. It means that the high speed of change, is \*still accelerating\*.   
  
\> Centuries ago, societal change was akin to a slow-moving river, while today's change resembles a raging torrent, rapidly reshaping the landscape.  
  
This is extremely significant to humanity as all our global institutes whether they be governance, trade, financial, diplomatic, technological and social, are \*all under huge stress\* from this accelerated change.

Trying to succinctly summarise the nuanced manifestations of this phenomena contextualised inside each global institution such as Finance and Trade, Diplomacy and International Relations, Technology, Societal and Environmental is extremely challenging so I will have to rely on abstract, generic arguments and analogies.

In our world, we have dominant global systems which have large impacts and influence. Within those systems e.g. 'Trade and Markets' we have institutions such as Banks, IMF (international monetary fund), Markets etc. Those institutions provide \*\*governance\*\* to the \*system\* of 'Trade and Markets'. 

* 'System' e.g. Trade and Markets 
* 'Institutions' e.g. banks

Most global systems fall into this category where there's a 'System' and we have 'Institutions' that govern those systems. 

In the analogy of a Food Court. Our System is \*catering\* and our Institution is our \*Food Court\* which governs the process of how people eat. The analogy is simple, a Food Court is designed with a task to provide enough food to a specific number of people as a 'throughput' metric. So if you have a small mall, you don't need a big food court, if you have a big mall you need a bigger one.

'Acceleration of Change' is akin to our Food Court getting 1000's of new customers over the expected throughout a day, and then the next week, 2000's more come. Food Courts are \*designed\* to be resilient to change, so staff can be used scale up or down and maybe the mall has some queueing facilities it can use as well as a contract with a food provider who can deliver during peak traffic. However, it's unlikely any resilience factors would be able to sustain a acceleration of increased customers to the tune of extra 1000's a day which increased each week. 

Here our system that was never designed to be compatible with such extreme change, will exhibit conflict and volatility. For the example of a food court, if a rush of hungry customers came it could cause fights for tables, civil unrest due to large wait times, stress on the employees etc. 

\> If any system isn't designed to be resilient to change. Change will have a \*conflicting\* effect on that system. 

It's my proposal, that our global institutions aren't largely resilient to the types of levels of change we're heading for. Something like the trade and marketing models have very high levels of bureaucracy, lots of compartmentalised organisations and high coupling and complexity. Additionally, some of the characteristics of the system stem from historic and tradition which isn't necessarily a model designed for modern rapid change.

This is also the case for material science and physics. If tomorrow the world unearthed free energy, it could be possible that the discovery could provide novel energy weapons to terrorists or international warfare. This may be what some of USA's congress refer to in recent interviews hinting at a conspiracy to coverup UFO technology. (I hope this subreddit is above straw manning and just because I mention UFO's don't go into a nerd rage).   


\## Caveats and argument specifics

1) While the \[graph used\]([https://i.imgur.com/Ms0ekNc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Ms0ekNc.jpg)) indicates a linear curve. I am aware that change hasn't followed such a trend, there have been peaks and troths. I am aware there's been periods in the past which rebuke the behaviour of acceleration of change being being exponential. However it's part of my 'view' that 'now' is a specific circumstance that makes things different from historic times.

2) While I believe we could in theory halt technological progress. I don't think this is sufficient to prevent Acceleration of Change's 'conflict' or 'volatility' characteristics. Just having the internet and social evolution can just as singularly challenge this space. Trends like civil social justice and self-expression as well as new psychology can be steered into a place that causes division and conflict. Misinformation campaigns, rampant government psy ops and run-away capitalism can significantly misinform and harry peoples sense of truth. 

3) It's not my view we can't stop or address Conflict/Volatility or even the nature of our Acceleration in change. While I can only theorise how it might be addressed, I don't conclude yet that it isn't possible. This is primarily why I want to brief world leaders as soon as possible. I realise that this is very close to delusions of Grandeur which is ok, I'd gladly be proven wrong.

4) I hate to refer to a move, but 'Don't Look Up' satirised many of the concerns that I think lead to conflict and volatility. 

5) For those interested, I attribute immature Game Theory and historical paradigms from history as the main attributors to this issue. 

6) \*\*To change my view\*\* I would need to be convinced that we're not inside a era of accelerated change. That our existing global institutions aren't corrupt enough or incapable of becoming resilient to this change soon enough to 'weather' it without high conflict and volatility. 

Lastly I'd very much welcome subject experts in the global institutions (as I'm only a subject expert to technology and system science) to attempt to change my view within their discipline e.g. 'Societal' or 'Finance' but that may not change my holistic view, but please, please feel welcome to challenge this view on all fronts. It may be that a combination of views ultimately \*change my view\*.

1,2023-08-06,CMV: In my experience so much about the way swyou look andr Ty present yourself is dependent on whether or not you’re ugly. R,u/No_Rise_8747,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15jzynv/cmv_in_my_experience_so_much_about_the_way_swyou/,changemyview,"So I don’t mean it in [this](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1663485 hi Ethan day I-hello-human-resources) way completely, of course attractive people can be creeps and unattractive people can be normal, b to it ut I thtink that however facially attractive you are is gonna dictate how you present yourself in both immaterial and material ways.

I feel that one of the best examples of this is clothes. Think back to any movie where any movie has the plot point that “the ugly girl just takes off her glasses and let’s her hair down and now she’s gorgeous”. It’s something we all recognized to be a dumb cliche since we see that the ugly girl was always hot but was just in frumpy clothes. We all know she was always hot. Her clothes never made the difference. 

Like Euphoria trying to make Zendaya look like a dusty at risk teen when we all still very clearly see Zendaya. Or Barbie trying to make Margot Robbie ugly by simply removing her makeup and putting her in frumpy clothes. It doesn’t make them any less attractive and they’re still seen as hot. The same principle applies to very unattractive people.  That example being someone like Danny Devito. No matter what you put him in, he’s still ugly. Which is why he’s type casted as that character a lot. 

Personally one of the most humiliating dry dry rn experiences of my life was I late high schooling seeing how the guys that were popular with women dressed and thinking they were well dressed (I mean all the girls said so). So I dressed like them and was mocked relentlessly by those guys and a lot of girls until the end of the semester. So this aspect I know from my own personal experience.

I chose clothes specifically because it’s one of the easiest things to see through, but I think that applies to haircuts, makeup (unles of course you’re doing the equivalent of costume make up), jewlrey etc. It isn’t going to change your level of attractiveness, and it’s more an amplifier for people who already are attractive.

I think the same could be said for personality traits but most importantly confidence. I think confidence can only be recognized by its audience and interpreted by said audience and depending on the face that’s attempting to exude confidence, it’s going to be interpreted differently. 

Let’s take a traditionally masculine tall handsome man. If he exudes a level of confidence it’s going to be received well. Why? Easy talk and handsome. Society likes tall and handsome men more and trusts them more. We think they’re nicer, funnier, and more intelligent just because of the way they look. Their personality is being either completely changed or whatever level of good personality is being amplified through their level of attractiveness. There have been studies on this that have found exactly what I’m saying.

Conversely, ugly people are seen more as deceitful and dangerous. Their personality traits are being amplified too, but in the opposite direction. Awkwardness and introversion is seen as unhinged antisocial behavior where it’s seen as cute shyness in handsome guys. When I was in college literally had university police called on me because I felt overwhelmed in my room due to my roommate having so many people over I went outside to a bench near my dorm to eat my dinner. 

I wasn’t doing anything wrong, but police stopped me as some girl thought I was a stalker waiting outside the building for someone. I wasn’t dressed suspiciously. I was eating. I don’t think that if I had been attractive anyone would’ve suspected anything of me.

But my intorversion was viewed through the lense of ugly, so just wanting to be alone was dangerous and scary. I only used a few examples as I think they’re the best examples but I’d be willing to give more if needed."
1,2023-08-06,CMV: Physical stores should be prohibited from being cashless,u/earthwulf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15k06u0/cmv_physical_stores_should_be_prohibited_from/,changemyview,"New cashless-only policies that are dropping up in the US is a problem for many reasons. It shows a lack of accessibility  and a lack of compassion for those who lack the resources to be able to use a card.  It is a highly discriminatory policy.

As an example, my teen daughter has autism and intellectual disabilities & cards are too abstract for her to understand how to use them effectively. She only grasped the concept of money when she was 14. There are many others like her. 

Beyond this:

Financial inclusion: Not everyone has access to digital payment methods. The elderly, those with low income, and people in rural areas may rely heavily on cash. If you are unhoused, you shouldn't be excluded from buying things.

Privacy: Cash transactions allow for anonymity, which some customers might prefer for privacy reasons or because there is a mental block or legitimate fear - if a person is trying to leave an abusive relationship, they shouldn't have to worry about their locations and purchases being tracked.

System Failures: Technology and digital systems can have downtime, glitches, or be subject to cyber attacks. Cash provides a failsafe.

Transaction Fees: Digital transactions often come with processing fees, which can add up for small businesses or for people with tight finances.

Accessibility: Some customers might simply not be comfortable with digital payments or may not have the knowledge to use them effectively. Forcing them to go cashless may alienate these customers. I know it's fun to crap on Boomers, but my mom is always confused by the tablet payment systems and has, in the early stages of her Alzheimer's, unintentionally left a $200 tip on a $20 purchase."
1,2023-08-06,CMV: The first Tinkerbelle movie sends a bad message.,u/Shay_M_Heart,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15k09ii/cmv_the_first_tinkerbelle_movie_sends_a_bad/,changemyview,"I want to start off by saying that I love the Tinkerbelle movies. I enjoy watching them time and time again, but there's just the one thing about the first movie that has always bothered me, and it has to do with the fact that Tinkerbelle is forced to be something she clearly doesn't want to be.

Starting the movie, even before Tinkerbelle learns her talent, she has no interest in the hammer. She is far more interested in all of the other talents. As the movie goes on and she learns what tinkers do, she grows to hate being one and wishes to do something else.

This would be no problem in the real world. People change their careers, or switch majors, or pick up new skills all the time. However, in Tinkerbelle's case, she is constantly made to feel bad about wanting to change her talent even though it should absolutely be her choice of whether to be a tinker or not. Her career and life have been chosen for her without any consideration for her and her feelings. She does eventually learn to love her talent, but I don't think being a tinker would have been her choice if the option to change her talent had been there.

This just never really sat right with me. Maybe someone else can give me a perspective on this I'm missing?"

It’s simply untrue. Growing up, people have always told me that women like to be “lead” or are submissive by nature.

Hell, there’s a lot of guys enjoy being dominated too. I think our culture reinforces these norms, and I refuse to believe that “the female brain” has some fucking gene that makes them want to be dominated or like rough play. I have yet to find a legit, peer-reviewed study on any claim that these traits are innate to women. Even though we usually see women being the “passive” or “submissive” partner in relationships in media and what not, it’s not a representative of all relationships. I’m willing to hear other perspectives, but I am very iffy about evolutionary psychology (I think it’s a load of horse-shit).

   In my opinion DNC would be better off moving on from him, and even if DNC hands it to Gavin Newsome or some other cookie cutter politician I don't see myself voting for anyone they present. 

   Trump's momentum is a force to be reckoned with, his ability to command respect is truly the reason he is so popular even if he's not the most buttoned up option out there. He left office with economy strong and overall good optics around the world. Saudi oil relations are in the toilet under biden driving up costs across the economy in favor of pushing a  green initiative that has a tons more negative environmental impacts than fossil fuels will ever have. With Trump, even with all of the messy techniques of going on the offensive towards the media, intelligence agencies, other countries he has always stuck up for america, the constitution and all of us. He shows up with the type of energy any citizen would want their leader to stick up for the country. He has the type of energy that is needed from the US president. This is not supposed to be a job that some weak politically correct politician can just have a stroll into.

I do not expect to ever be able to purchase property. It is also United States-specific. Other countries may have ~~actually humane~~ different situations.

I recognize a large part of this view comes from emotion and anxiety as I am apartment hunting.

But at the same time, the facts also seem to back me up. I have witnessed rent on apartments increase for my entire adult life. Even in the past few years, I look at rent histories and they have invariably risen $500-$1000 just since 2018 or so. The only places where they have not are places where the rent was wildly unaffordable already. This seems to be happening nationwide. [Census data](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/tables/time-series/coh-grossrents/grossrents-adj.txt)suggests that this is not solely a result of inflation.

I've also read many news stories during this time about how this time housing costs have peaked no really guys we promise it's true this time. The only time in my lifetime I can think of when they decreased was during COVID, and obviously that was temporary; if anything rents have spiked post-COVID in what appears to be the housing-market equivalent of [greedflation](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/greedflation-is-not-letting-up-heres-what-companies-are-saying-about-it-e793bc3a). 

I would really love to where I am not continually fleeing my home every few years or even every year like a rat on a sinking ship because the landlord raised the rent. I would like to read a convincing argument that this might be the case."

However, I don't want to pay five figures above asking price like my realtor is saying I will need to do to place a competitive offer in today's market. I know that the market is hard right now but I think she is telling me this because she will get a bigger comission as a result.

So that got me thinking...realtors in the US are paid a comission for each home sale. And the vast majority of Americans including myself don't know shit about how to buy or sell a home so we need to rely on realtors. That gives them as a collective quite a bit of control over both the supply and demand side of the housing market. 

And since they are paid comission based on home sale price, of course they are going to add fuel to the fire that is the US housing market by saying we need to pay tens of thousands more than a house is listed for so we line their pockets.

Why don't we just pay them a flat fee instead so they arent incentivized to price gouge?"

Even though he was able to pierce the outer layer, he would have needed to continue to make the hole large enough for him to fit in. And if there was waste constantly in the tunnel, why didn't he drown? If there wasn't, where did it go?

Thirdly: Even though he was able to clean himself up, he wasn't exactly nondescript. He was tall, lanky and would stand out. Some time must have passed  between when he visited the banks and when the officers arrived at the prison to arrest the corrupt leaders. He alerted the media by sending items ithe mail. That must have taken a few days at least.. The prison would have sent out pictures of the escaped convict and every officer in a 50 mile radio's would be on the lookout.

Even though I’m conservative, I think both sides have good points and I nit pick opinions from both, but what I find interesting is that most of not all conservative views are censored, and just sharing an opinion can sometimes ruin someone’s life. I feel like everything on the internet Is geared towards “conservative is bad” and people cant have a discussion about anything without name calling and feelings hurt, but from a lot of personal observation and research, it’s mostly conservatives who get ratted on the most.

You could argue that children in polygamous families often suffer abuse and neglect but the same thing with gay marriage (not having a mother or father)
Many people argue that polygamy has been historically looked down in the US, but the same could be argued about gay marriage (especially before it was legalized)
Both are still not the norm (as most people are straight).

In tennis, every serve ends up in a score for one side or the other. In American Football, there are various ways to score, and many drives end up in some amount of points, and many drives end up in no points. But in Soccer? It’s so difficult to score that it’s extremely common for entire games to end up 0-0. And because it’s so difficult to score, the overtime penalty kickoff tie-breaker barely even resembles the primary game at all. Because of this extreme difficulty in scoring, one team can dominate the other team on the field, and it just doesn’t matter because it’s not enough domination to result in actually scoring. The bar to score is simply very high. Good sports aren’t good on accident. American Football is famous for adjusting the rules to make it easier to score, resulting in a game with a higher percentage of drives ending in scores. This balance change improved the sport because before, there were so few scores in a game that ties were common. Ties are really bad, since they don’t differentiate the teams. Yet Soccer refuses to address this issue, and their problem persists."

I am aware that there many similar posts to this one that have tried to defend pornography. Also I want to make this clear, child porn of any kind is reprehensible and cruel. However, I have a few reasons why adult porn form of entertainment. One reason, is that there is a buildup and foreplay to the actual act. The act is not immediate. This setup is similar to how it would be in a real life intercourse episode. A couple will start off slow and then begin what they came( pun unintended) to do. Another reason, is that it allows a person to experience sexual gratification without harming or interacting with anyone. While, people would scoff at me for believing that this is a positive. I encourage them to look at it through a different lens. Freud theorized that every person has an id(not identification ,but id). This is the primitive part of a person that contains sexual and aggressive drives. The need for sex is an inherent human trait. Obtaining sex is not quite easy because another individual could charge you with sexual assault allegation. Watching pornography would allow a person to fulfill their sexual fantasies without harming someone else. Women, for example, are safe. Before you say that some porn is sexual assault, I understand. When looking for such pornography films, do your due diligence. Avoid any that glorify sexual assault. This is very controversial opinion and I highly encourage others to respond."

He’ll ask us all if we would like to stay in the hotel or go outside for the night, and someone will say “I honestly don’t mind”, and he’ll get frustrated and say that the person is making it hard to reach a decision. I don’t understand this, because I feel like the most helpful thing you can do when someone asks you to choose between a meal, activity etc. is to essentially remove yourself from the equation, but for some reason, my parents get frustrated when someone does this. I’ve also known friends who get frustrated because their partner always just says “I don’t mind where we eat”, if they’re trying to decide, and once again, I don’t understand why you would be frustrated.

Likewise, when I engage in political debates, like [this one on the Indigenous voice referendum](https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/1513qc9/those_of_you_intending_to_vote_no_on_an/), I envy how some of my opponents can write with confidence that their stances are right, whereas I can't. If you're going to tell me that my stances are wrong and I should to Vote No, that still goes to proves my point that my odds of being right are low.

Now as to why I'm not a complete pushover and engaging in these debates, instead of immediately folding: it is because I used to be a more successful person who had reason to be confident, and old habits die hard. It's also why I'm such a frequent visitor to r/changemyview, because years of failure have created a constant worry that I'm wrong and that I'm too dumb to see why I'm wrong.

I feel like once I've gone through the story and my feelings, it wouldn't be beneficial for me to keep repeating about how I'm feeling sad when I already know the reasons etc. So the sessions ended and the counselor said she felt I wasn't being at all open and because I hadn't cried in front of her that I wasn't feeling my feelings. This pissed me off tbh and throughout the whole thing she didn't give advice just kept asking me how I was feeling. I'm just wondering if this is just the way it works or if I'm in the wrong? It's just I've tried it multiple times and never found any benefits. I'd really like it to work too as I really need the help rn :)"

My view is simple. However, to expand why I think so. I think if someone wants to die, they have a fatal condition or they hate life. Now, I know some things are temporary, and that it can be fixed. So I propose that government give them one year of therapy etc. If they still want to die they should be allowed to. 

My second reason is, if the government has failed them, then the least the government can do is not punish the helper and them for taking matters into their own hands. Morally speaking, for example, if there was a town for whatever reason, think wild west, with no sherrif or the sheriff is literally sitting on his/her ass all day, I have no problem morally if everyone went all 'batman'. 

My third reason is, and probably the most important one, freedom and consent. If it's proven that there was no coercision etc. then the doctor or whoever shouldn't be arrested. 

Thats why I believe it's better to legalize it. There would be institutions to make sure that 

Now for background. I'm in canada. We already have checks in place for fatal conditions, I see nothing wrong with expanding it. 

But really the heart of the matter is, I don't see why the government should have a say what I do with my body. I am of the principle if it doesn't remove someone elses freedoms or rights, then it should be ok. I took nothing from my neighbour by dying. Breaking in and entering takes away their right to safety. My freedom to die does not impede on your freedoms."

1,2023-08-07,CMV: 2000 CN Teen Titan's Robin is mentally ill,u/woundedant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15kn0ib/cmv_2000_cn_teen_titans_robin_is_mentally_ill/,changemyview,"I am speaking of the 2003 Cartoon Network Teen Titans series. 

I, just like many others I am sure, really loved this series growing up. It was my go-to show in grade school. It told moving stories with complex relationships and introduced me to just how great a superhero series or movie could be. But I decided to re-watch the series now as a young adult and a lot has dawned on me. 

**Robin is mentally ill.** 

Robin is the leader, Batman's sidekick that ventures off to create the Teen Titans and lead the group. For the most part, he does a good job but there are several instances where the series shows just how mentally sick he is. Much like Batman, Robin has a twisted obsession with their villains. The primary object of his obsession is Slade (Deathstroke). 

In one episode in particular, Robin hallucinates Slade is following him, fighting him and tricking him. While it is a great episode that really shows an inkling of what PTSD means, it also shows that Robin is not mentally well. In another episode, he becomes Slade's apprentice, willing to harm his fellow titans just in efforts to get closer to Slade himself. In yet another episode, Robin creates the Red X persona, again harming his fellow titans in order to get closer to Slade. Time and time again, Robin puts himself and his friends (Either knowingly or unknowingly) at risk just to get a step closer to Slade. 

So with all that said, Robin is just as mentally ill as his father figure, Batman. I am by no means faulting the series for this. It actually works really well story wise and structure wise. My opinion is though that he is mentally ill and may not be mentally capable of leading such a team. 

You're welcome to try to change my opinion. "
1,2023-08-07,CMV: Powerviolence is a metal genre.,u/Xentrick-The-Creeper,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15knd2h/cmv_powerviolence_is_a_metal_genre/,changemyview,"In my honest opinion, powerviolence doesn't really fit in punk, at least purely.   
Firstly - Although it borrows DIY, anti-politics and anti-establishment ethos from all punk, it utilises riffs, vocals and blast beats that would fit right into the extreme metal genres. Punk is aggressive, especially hardcore, post-hardcore and thrashcore/fastcore, but anything faster and more abrasive doesn't feel very punkish to me. Its aggression is very similar to extreme metal genres.  
Secondly - Many powerviolence bands are influenced by metal bands and incorporate metal elements into their sound. Slower sections sound a lot like sludge metal, before sludge metal was even a thing. For example, grindcore bands like Napalm Death and Repulsion were influential in the development of powerviolence and were themselves heavily influenced by extreme metal.  
Lastly - Powerviolence often has a more aggressive and confrontational sound than traditional hardcore punk, or even its derivatives like fastcore or thrashcore. Punk genres has influenced metal from the beginning (speed metal, thrash metal, sludge metal, grunge (especially metal side of things), grindcore, etc.).   
Overall, while powerviolence may have its roots in punk and hardcore, it shares many characteristics with extreme metal genres, thus I consider it as a metal genre with punk influences.

I think if someone has a belief that is dangerous but does not act on it then they are actually a 'good' person in this context and should not be socially punished. 

For example if someone harbors racist views(ex. Martians are slow walkers) but challenges them internally when presented with reality based on what the general consensus is(Martians are the same), then they are acting correctly and are a 'good' person. Our perceptions are based on our lived experience and so they are very difficult to change(Often this can take professional help even for the most basic of things). Changing our actions is much easier and is the correct response when presented with information that successfully challenges our viewpoint.   


Consider that 100 scientist run an experiment for 4 years. With a 99% confidence, 99 of the scientist reach conclusion A and 1 scientist, let's call him Bob reaches conclusion B. Bob has spent 4 years of his life seeing that conclusion B is true. He will feel that very strongly and will likely believe it even when he sees what the other scientists produced. It can be very difficult and time consuming to change his belief in B but knowing the results he can use that information to make sure his actions align with A.

Of course, some do, but it’s not a requirement, and many vehicles don’t have them. 

My reasoning is that if only one taillight on a signaling vehicle is visible from your point of view, and the light signals a turn by flashing red, which is the same result as pressing on the brakes, it is not possible to know if that vehicle is signaling or tapping on the brakes. 

Of course, if you see it for multiple flashes, or both taillights are visible, it’s pretty obvious whether they’re signaling or braking, and I understand this sounds like an uncommon, edge case scenario. However, it does provide more clarity as to what that vehicle is about to do, creating a safer driving experience. 

I also don’t think it would require significant redesigning of taillights currently in production. All taillights come equipped with a white reverse light, so I think simply including an amber turn signal bulb in the same compartment would be enough. 

I think legislation should be put in place stating that moving forward, manufacturers should be required to produce all taillights with an amber bulb for turn signals as opposed to just flashing the red brake lights."

Slaughterhouses kill animals based on their type in large numbers, often inhumanely, and the Nazis killed their enemies in large numbers based on nothing more than who they are. So you might wonder why I even take an issue with this analogy.

It comes down to purpose. Hitler tried to exterminate out of hatred. He believed that the Jews in Germany were responsible for their failed economy and lashed out by killing them. He believed that Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, and many other groups were unworthy. He believed that Germans were better than them. Thus he killed all those he looked down on and hated.

This is *absolutely nothing* like why slaughterhouses kill animals. They slaughter animals as a food source for humans. They may be insensitive to the needs of the animals that they raise, but that is a far cry from killing out of hate. They are profit driven, and don't even intend to exterminate animals. It is against their interest to.

People who make this comparison need to take a look at history again and learn what actually occurred and why the Holocaust happened and how. But it's just my opinion. I invite people to challenge my view.

I don't think that's the case at all. Rather, as someone else once pointed out, religious people are simply more capable of, or more willing to, tolerate contradiction and cognitive dissonance than others.

A great many mathematicians, scientists, engineers, doctors, or people who work in similar cerebrally-demanding fields are Christians, Muslims, or adherents of other religions. Religious people earn plenty of PhDs and other academic degrees. Plenty of technological advances or inventions have been made by religious people. So it's certainly not about a lack of IQ.

But where most other people would have a hard time squaring seemingly contradictory things - *""how does your God love people and yet send them off to roast in fiery torment,""* or *""why do you still keep believing in that prophet even after he's made 10 false prophecies?""*, or *""the Bible and Quran are not in line with scientific and historical evidence,""* religious people are more willing to swallow the contradictions and carry on.

In this regard, they are similar to conspiracy theorists in the sense that many conspiracy theorists are smart and/or highly educated, yet still believe what they believe. (My mother and aunt, for instance, are both highly intelligent and educated, yet believe the most outlandish things.) This is also the case in politics as well - many otherwise bright and well-educated people believe in things that aren't true, because it appeals to their *feelings*, and feelings carry a lot more force than logic."

Obviously Jesus - in so far as he existed - was not white, but given the prevalence of churches in this country that portray him as having blonde hair and blue eyes, you can forgive some people for coming away with that impression.

Once confronted with the facts, however, those who still insist that he must be white are, in my mind, coming from a racist place. As if being less white means being less pure or less holy. 

I know it looks like a CMV that is unlikely to change my mind (and it kind of is), but I'm curious if there are any actual reasons to give people the benefit of the doubt that they are not racist, once they take umbrage at the idea of a Middle Eastern Jewish man from the first century being brown."

  I used to believe OJ had something to do with it but couldnt see it as him having done it himself.

  After looking at the case again later, I'm not sure that either OJ nor his son Jason did it.

  1) OJ simply didnt have the time to do it as he was in a hurry to get to the airport. The narrative was he did all of this plus hid everything in 20 minutes?

  2) the lead detective who was the only one who ""found"" all this ""evidence"" against OJ, pleaded the fifth at the trial for planting evidence.

 3) the so-called ""blood evidence"" amounted to a drop and contained blood preservative. OJ's blood sample went missing after it was drawn and we are supposed to believe OJ cut his hand with the knife (a knife used to butcher and mutilate multiple people) yet OJ was not seen with any bleeding or cuts or bandaging despite supposedly having done all of this 20 minutes earlier.

 4) the prosecution blocked and sealed phone records of Nicole's phone call with her mother.............that supposedly were made at 11PM.............when OJ was already about to board his flight.

 5) Ron's boss Brett Cantor was murdered and had his body mutilated in an identical fashion with even the same kind of knife according to his autopsy.  So if we are to believe that either OJ or Jason did it, then we would also have to believe that either OJ or Jason also murdered Brett.

Due to this he got banned, not because he said the N-word, but because he said the N word and was assumed to not be black. Turns out the guy was mixed and it was only after he proved he was black enough, that the ban was overturned. 

I see a major issue with this because application of this rule has nothing to do with the context of the word or identifying the word as an inappropriate slur, it has to do with **appearing** to be the right race. So long as you can supply your black card you are allowed to say this word.

Some people might say ""it's simple. If you're black you can say it and if you're not black you can't"". But to that I ask, what is black? Is it the skin color and if so how dark do you have to be? Is it having a 'black appearance' and what does that mean? What metric does one prove their blackness by?

Then there's the reason for the implementation of the rule which is usually to create a inclusive and safe environment for the users. I know many people of all races who are uncomfortable with the N-word in any context.

As far as online platforms go, there should be a single rule for everyone: Either everyone can say it or no one can.

**Whenever I see comments and posts about how it is unfair for men to not want to be with promiscuous women I commonly see two arguments.**  
  
**(1) That the man is insecure**  
  
**Okay let say this is true. This argument never states why it is morally unethical for an insecure man to not want to be with a promiscuous women.**  
  
**It is completely fair for a man who has not had a lot of success with women to be insecure. Men are generally valued based on how many partners they can get. How many women they sleep with. I don't see how it is incorrect or morally unethical to be insecure, when society full on shames them for their lack of sexual success. In fact, the main insults directed are men are things like ""virgin"", ""incel"", ""no women"".**  
  
**To me it makes complete sense for a man to feel insecure if he lacked success with women. I don't see how their feelings are invalid. If they don't want to be with a promiscuous woman for that reason, that is their prerogative.**  
  
**Additionally, by being with promiscuous women they're conforming. We live in a culture where women are sexualized heavily, whereas men are not. Women are generally able to sleep around whenever they want. While men do not get the same opportunity. Why would a man conform to a culture that does not value them (sexually) and give them equal opportunity? -- Especially if women can do so without repercussion.**  
  
**By being with a promiscuous women they're conforming to a culture that undervalues them.**  
  
**(2) That the man is hypocritical**  
  
**If a promiscuous man does not want to be with a promiscuous woman that is completely fair (and vice versa). It is completely reasonable for a man to expect something from a partner that they themselves do not possess.**  
  
**Men and women value different things in a partner. There are so many standards that women have for their partners that they do not meet themselves.**  
  
**- Women want their partners to be braver than them and less neurotic.**  
  
**- Women often want their partners to make more money than them.**  
  
**- Women want their partners to be taller than them.**  
  
**All these expectations that women have for their partners that they do not possess which is completely fair. So how is it unfair for a man to expect their partner to be more chaste?**  
  
**From my perspective it is normal for men and women to value different things and expect things from a partner that they themselves don't.**"

If women want equality then people need to be allowed to be just as critical of them as they are of men.   Quite a few male sports stars get criticized both personally and professionally.  For all the accolades, Lebron gets a lot of flak (much of it deserved IMO).  When a mens team under performs, that team gets ripped.  

Lebron was criticized by MANY people for his political stances.  There was plenty of ""shut up and dribble"" talk.  When Alexi Lalas says the women's team is not liked by many people because of their political statements, people call it sexist.  

Now none of this is to say there hasn't been sexist stuff said.  But it seems people can't separate the truly sexist comments (often from conservatives) from the fair comments about a team who was a favorite having a lackluster tournament.  Also, lets be real, this was on the heels of them making a HUGE deal about their pay compared to the mens and playing the media game in order to get a huge raise (while ignoring the fact that they agreed to the deal, and they actually made MORE money compared to what they brought in).  And again, when NBA or NFL players get a massive pay bump and then pay like shit, they are torn apart in the media, but somehow the USWNT is above that?

This is just my **philosophy**, I hope someone **can change my view**, or not, fingers crossed. 

Ok, hear me out. 

According to ""most"" people, life is so precious and wonderful that they are ok with some people (and trillions of animals) suffering the worst fate imaginable and often with no cure or end in sight (except death).  Well, maybe they are not ""happy"" about it, most people have a ""tiny"" amount of empathy, but they can accept this ""price"" that the victims pay, so the rest of humanity can enjoy the ""good"" things in life, using their luck and privilege while not suffering from the same horrible fates. 

Example of suffering and torture for perspective: Incurable and super painful diseases, Incurable mental torture (genetic), Incurable genetic illnesses, Freak accidents due to pure random bad luck, losing entire family to whatever horrors of the world, war, famine, extreme poverty, murder, rape, torture, genocide, etc etc etc. The list is very **LONG** and most of them we are unlikely to solve, because suffering is a moving target, I doubt we could create a suffering free Utopia, the likelihood is super low in my opinion, a certain percentage of people and most animals will simply suffer forever. 

=============================

Now comes my main argument/view: 

So, with these horrible **FACTS** in mind (these are indeed facts, I dont see how you can dispute any of them), how many of you are **WILLING** to **TRADE** places with these victims? How many of you will say **""I will volunteer to suffer in their place so they could live happy lives""?** How many of you would actually **SUFFER** incurably to argue your philosophical position of letting millions suffer for the lucky and privileged lives of others? I'm sure some of you **SUPER KIND SAINTS** may say yes, but how many? 0.00001%? I **SERIOUSLY DOUBT** the majority of people would gladly trade places with these victims of HORRIBLE suffering just to make a point about existence. 

How is this not deeply hypocritical and immoral? 

===========================

So, this makes me believe the world (majority) has adopted a weird de facto arrangement where the lesser victims will always be ""sacrificed"" for the greater ""good"" of the masses, this is somehow ok and not a bad thing, even if it means some of the victims are just **CHILDREN** and there are **MILLIONS** of them suffering at any given time, most without **CURE** and will **DIE** from their suffering. I dont think I need to mention how **BRUTAL** nature is to wild animals, right? Trillions of them experiencing all sorts of suffering and torture (Starvation, eaten alive (some are just babies), parasitized to death, brutal competition, no medical help or love, only 20% become adults, etc). I wont even mention livestock because veganism can actually solve most of their suffering, though many things like drug testing has no substitute, cant really test dangerous experimental drugs on humans first, right? 

Bottom line, the world is a HUGE perpetual trolley game and most people are ""ok"" with crushing the lesser victims for the sake of the majority, **BUT** most people are **NOT OK** with trading places with these victims, this is **RIDICULOUSLY HYPOCRITICAL** and Immoral in my opinion. Its basically saying life is great for us so we dont mind having millions of victims suffering, as long as its **NOT YOU** who is suffering with them. How is this remotely moral and acceptable? 

The lukewarm rebuttal would be **""Well what can we do? Suffering will exist anyway""**, but here's the thing, does it have to be this way? I mean, in terms of practicality and technology, it is not hard to imagine a way to PERMANENTLY end this cycle of suffering by sterilizing earth, like pushing it a little closer to the sun with mega thrusters, removing the atmosphere with some kind of atomic chain reaction or AI nanobot that erase all life on earth, etc etc etc. It is MUCH easier to end life than to create it, scientifically speaking, right? I'm sure with enough technology, we could even do this painlessly and instantly, ensuring that nobody and no animals will suffer from their total erasure on earth. 

But most people would be super angry at me for even mentioning this, they'd call me names and tell me to S-word myself (**DONT, you WILL BE REPORTED**) and that I'm evil, Hitler, etc etc. But lets look at my logic ok? Is Utopia even remotely possible? No? Then why is it moral or ""good"" to let millions of people (including kids) suffer so horribly when **YOU** wont even trade places with them? How is it moral and acceptable that we sacrifice so many victims and animals to suffering and torture, in order to perpetuate a world that will never achieve Utopia? How is this fair for the victims? What have they done to deserve their horrible lives (other than being born without even asking for it? 

WHY is it ok to let them suffer forever in our place but NOT ok to sacrifice all of life on earth to stop their suffering, to show our empathy and love for them? **ONE FOR ALL** is ok but **ALL FOR ONE** is never ok? Are our lives and lucky, privileged, happy experience so important that we must be fine with having millions of people and trillions of animals suffering for our sake? 

Remember, MOST of us wouldnt even consider TRADING PLACES with these victims, yet it is OK to let them suffer for our sake, huh? This is moral? This is the rule of life that we should accept? WHY? 

So, unless Utopia is right around the corner OR most of us are TRULY WILLING to trade places with these victims, then what JUSTIFICATION do we have to continue existence at their expense? Surely its not moral nor ethical? 

Should we simply ACCEPT that we are immoral and hypocritical creatures and live this way forever? 

Please, help change my view, because I am so disgusted by this revelation, how can humanity be so cruel? How can we justify our own existence when we wont even suffer like the victims? 

Edit: Some of you will mention LIFE will FIND A WAY to appear on earth again or that Aliens suffer too so my view is poinless. My answer is NO, if we do it right, life wont appear in our solar system, I mean just look at planets nearer to the sun than earth, even MARS is lifeless, there are PLENTY of ways to make sure life dont come back, the universe is SUPER HOSTILE to life, remember? As for the aliens, what about them? We dont even know if they exist and they are too far for us to influence, so its up to them to decide what to do with their suffering, its not practical for us to do anything for them.

1,2023-08-08,CMV: Biphobia/bisexual erasure is an unserious issue with no real world consequences and bisexual people are the most privileged people within the queer community,u/adoreroda,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15l9co3/cmv_biphobiabisexual_erasure_is_an_unserious/,changemyview,"I think bisexual people don’t actually encounter nearly as much bigotry as gay people do, and when they complain like this they mostly just want to feel included in the community. Bisexual people are the least oppressed and most privileged within the queer community, and I think the only exception to this is if you’re trans as well as bisexual, but that’s another topic for another day that I don’t think I want to get into. From what I’ve noticed, bisexual people tend to be utterly oblivious to the privilege they have in queer communities and often act as the most oppressed, which I find completely to be untrue. I’ve been dumbfounded by how it seems all bisexual people act so oppressed, and I’ve even heard some say they are the most oppressed within the queer community. I really do not like the narrative from what it seems like all bisexual people I’ve seen that it’s exclusively or predominately gay (wo)men “bullying” them for their bisexuality, all the while having absolutely no smoke for the people who are the ones who give them the real world consequences for being bisexual, which are straight people. I personally do not see almost all bisexual people I come across as having real world issues they face that need to be taken seriously because they’re bisexual.I’d like to start off with some definitions I’m going to reference later in my talking points:There are three variants of bisexuality relevant to my argument, but I want to preface this by saying I think bisexuality is a spectrum and that there is a difference between people who are technically bisexual (but don’t identify as such) versus people who self identify as bisexual.  
  
\* Self-identified bisexuals (SIBs): This is a huge distinction to me because there is a trend I’ve noticed amongst people who are technically bisexual versus people who readily self identify as bisexual. SIBs tend to be in heterosexual relationships at almost the same rate as heterosexual people (88% compared to 100%, or almost  9 out of 10 versus 10 out of 10) despite almost 50% admitting they’re equally attracted to both sexes. This is to say there is an obvious trend of SIBs being heteronormative in how they go about relationships even if they have an indiscriminate preference in attraction to men or women.  
\* Technical bisexual (Tbs): Many self-identified gay (wo)men such as myself are technically bisexual in some capacity where we feel a relevant enough attraction to both sexes in regards to sexual attraction and/or romantic attraction to where it makes us bisexual, but we do not identify that way for a number of reasons. People in this category normally are what I would call “functionally” gay, and the inverse is also true which is, according to statistics, the overwhelming majority of SIBs (source)  
\* Pragmatically homosexual or heterosexual: As explained above, there are people who are technically bisexual but don’t identify as such, mostly out of function. A homosexual biromantic man is more likely to end up in a relationship with another man and therefore be basically indistinguishable from another gay man in regards to sexual interests. The inverse of course is also true, and funnily enough is what most SIBs tend to be, so it seems  
  
\&#x200B;  
  
Whenever I hear and read about biphobia it’s normally the same hackneyed points: 1) constantly coming out, 2) specifically other queer people not wanting to date you because you’re bi, 3) “both sides” telling you that you’re confused (and especially as a bi man, people saying you’re just a closeted gay man), and so on. All of these are really mild annoyances rather than material violence someone faces for being specifically bisexual, and though obviously bisexuality is an intersection of homosexuality and heterosexuality and the intersection with homosexuality makes bisexual people susceptible to homophobia, that does not mean bisexuality does not come with massive privileges, in and out of the queer community.  
  
1. Getting to choose when you want to present your queerness is at worst a mild annoyance, not a real world issue that needs to be taken seriously, and it’s not something exclusive to bisexual people either. “Straight passing” (wo)men also experience this, but do not have the option omit their homosexuality like bisexual people do and don’t have the option to have the privileges that come attached with being in a heterosexual relationship, which is what 9 out of 10 SIBs tend to be in anyways, with the minority being the ones who are pragmatically homosexual.There is also something else that needs to be said, but hypervisibility is not a privilege. The people who are affected by homophobia the most are the ones who have the least ability (if any ability) to mask their queerness, such as genderqueer gay people who can’t pass as straight and are excluded from the possibility of having the protections of being in a heterosexual relationship and subsequently being able to pass as straight as a virtue of that, something that other gay people (straight passing or not) also do not have access to.  
2. This is technical biphobia to a degree, although I think it is heavily misunderstood in online bisexual communities. As studies have shown, SIBs tend to be overwhelmingly heterosexual at basically the same rate as straight people and tend to only interact with queer people for sexual interests only rather than long-term relationships. It’s an perpetual pattern to see bisexual people only interact in homosexual relationships for sex but virtually exclusively give the tender love, care, and attention to opposite sex partners. This is one reason why many gay people do not like to bother with bisexual people as the pattern inevitably unfolds despite there being a higher saturation of people being more accepting of bisexuality in queer communities (including amongst gay people) compared to straight people.  
3. Now this is a problem, but again is more of a mild annoyance and somewhat on par with 1) with simply having to correct people in regards to your sexual orientation. I personally kind of experience this myself but in the opposite direction sometimes; I’ve always identified as gay simply because I’m homoromantic and bisexual (preference for men) and some of my friends have questioned my self identification if I’m gay and say I’m bi instead, but it’s a mild annoyance at worst and has no real world consequences.  
  
Another issue I see is that bisexual people are substantially more critical of other queer people (specifically gay (wo)men) but do not have even an tenth of that same passion for criticising heterosexual people who are almost always the main perpetrators of the homophobia they experience or witness, which is where the real-world consequences of being bisexual come from, not from other queer people. This is especially true since most bisexual people are pretty progressive and are more likely than not to follow the typical liberal definition of racism that states only people in power can oppress you, but yet bisexual people almost entirely point fingers at other gay men and women for biphobia, not straight people. I find this very funny considering the trend SIBs tend to have for heavily preferring heterosexual relationships but also being hyper critical of queer people. The biphobia you receive from other queer people is not your enemy, the homophobia you receive from straight people is, but yet it seems like bisexual people are way more complacent receiving homophobia from straight people which has serious consequences to it but want to have their foots on the necks of other queer people who they probably see as being low hanging fruit.  
  
Bisexual erasure is very comparable to “reverse racism”. My personal school of thought in regards to racism is that all racial oppression is racism, but not all racism is racial oppression, and that you can be racist towards the majority of a given country such as in the US where I’m from white americans, but you can’t oppress them. Similarly, in other places like Singapore, you can be racist towards Chinese Singaporeans, but Malay and Indians can’t oppress them as they hold the power. In the case of bisexual people, you can be biphobic towards in technicality but it’s not nearly as much of an issue because they are in the position to receive the most privileges from their proximity to heterosexuality and the statistic probability of there being a 90% chance they end up in heterosexual relationships, foregoing the vast majority of issues you receive from being gay (which is, having gay relationships).  
  
The only time bisexual people experience real-world consequences that actually affect their lives in dramatic ways is from systems of oppression from homophobia such as violence and discrimination towards queer people, but the main privilege from bisexual people (particularly SIBs) is that they get to co-opt into bisexual spaces with the statistical probability of foregoing basically all of the dangers of being a visibly queer person by having a 90% chance of being in a heterosexual relationship, which is a safe haven and a privilege no gay (wo)men has access to."

Elon sees that PayPal is entering the crypto exchange game. Elon is still butthurt that X turned into PayPal, and he feels he would have run the company better and they would be way ahead of the game by now.

So he went ahead and bought Twitter to acquire an app with a massive userbase that already has a bunch of crypto users on it, in order to turn it into a crypto exchange/wallet/payment platform. He can then turn this userbase of millions of people worldwide into the largest crypto app in the world.

In order to do that, he was basically like “sure Zuck you can have the tweeting thing, in fact I’m going to make it super toxic so people actually download your platform and help you out.” They’re not going to delete Twitter, they’ll still have it downloaded on their phone they will just transition to posting basic thoughts on there while he turns X into a crypto centric information source and wallet/exchange platform.

Then Zuck makes billions, Elon makes billions, Jack Dorsey made billions when the company went private, everybody wins. 

They’re both just playing a PR game at this point and we’re all riding the train."

However, I am no longer a fan of these figures or their values/beliefs broadly speaking. I am not attempting to invalidate the experiences of trans-identifying people. 

Now, I know in many workplaces it is mandated or heavily encouraged for employees to include their pronouns in their eMail signatures. My understanding is that this is done to bring attention to gender diversity and minimise microaggressions in the form of misgendering in the workplace. 

I cannot help but feel as though this actually works against the broader agenda of the LGBTQIA+ community. By including it in your eMail signature, it reinforces the idea that pronouns, gender expression and identity are not to be discussed openly. That is, one's pronouns and gender identity should be known prior to meeting face-to-face or remain ambiguous until you eMail one another to save the embarassment, shame, possible offence causes by asking them.

I recognise that I am a cisgender male and express my gender in a relatively unambiguous manner. However, if my expression were more ambiguous, I would expect the possibility of being offended by being misgendered when meeting novel peers or by being asked about my gender identity.

I feel as though treating trans-identifying individuals as so fragile that mandatory adjustments are put in place to a whole workplace's eMail policy is not trans-affirming and is not in support of a broader LGBTQIA+ agenda (assuming the agenda is acceptance as an equal human). 

I do know that in past I saw an email that contained a hyperlink to an article or some sort explaining why including pronouns in email signatures is a good idea, but I did not follow the article."

1,2023-08-08,CMV: Clickbait sites that do compilations of old racist comics or other art are functionally commiting the same kind of racism as the original artists.,u/parlimentery,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15lg2ix/cmv_clickbait_sites_that_do_compilations_of_old/,changemyview,"My title is pretty much as stated, but I do think the original artists are at least putting effort into their racism, which is maybe worse. I also think minstrel artists in the Jim Crow South accomplished more in worsening the conditions in their society for black and brown people than the clickbait sites I mention, and that their intention was more overtly racist. My argument is that these two evils are of the same *kind* not to the same *degree*.

The phenomenon I am describing is clickbait sites I get ads for on Facebook that show ""marvels 10 most racist characters"" and the thumbnail is basically a minstrel drawing. I don't think viewing old racist art is always bad. Obviously in an academic context it is important. I think the world is improved by having history academics who can say, with authority, here are the similarities I see between the first version of Spelljammer: Adventures in Space and Jim Crow minstrel drawings. I also think legitimate news publications showing this art, with content warnings, can be a good way to educate about the history of minstrel art, and show that some of it extended both geographically and chronologically past the Jim Crow South.

I never read these clickbait articles, but I don't expect them to deal with the subject in a historically meaningful way for several reasons:

1) They give no content warnings and showed me a racist depiction in the thumbnail. I was not shocked or offended, but some might be harmed in a similar (perhaps not as extreme way) as someone in the Jim Crow South seeing these images.

2) I have read other articles from (I think) the same site as the most recent example I saw, and they do not make a point of handling the subject matter in any way other than presenting it.

3) My definition of clickbait is to do the minimum work required on the article while laser focusing the title and thumbnail to shock, entertain, or entice, thus getting clicks for an article that no reasonable person actually wants to read. I cannot prove something is clickbait without reading it, but if it is, by definition it is not actually trying to communicate anything meaningful in the text of the article.

4) Clickbait is undeniably a form of ""infotainment"" they do not intend for the content to improve the lives or worldview of the reader the way a proper publication should, they intend to make them snicker. The article/articles I am describing wants me to snicker at the bad representation of the past because of how dehumanizing it was. The intention of minstrel art was to make the audience snicker because of how not human they already thought the subjects of the art were. Laughing about propaganda in favor of atrocities is tone-deaf and cruel to the victims of those atrocities, even if you do it for the sake of belittling the propagandists.

I want to see if my view can be changed because I am a white man, and the most I have ever been personally effected by minstrel art is that accusations of minstrel depictions threw a monkey wrench (no tone-deaf pun intended) in the release of the D&D setting update i have waited for since I started playing the game. I would like to hear more from people who are more directly hurt by these depictions.

Things that can change my view:
1) Someone who is emotionally impacted by viewing such art who have seen ads for articles like the one I described and thought it was a good (or at least neutral) thing that this clickbait sites was drawing attention to this problem.

2) Someone who can convince me that people who republish minstrel art as a gag have done harm that is different in *kind* from the harm done by the people who first drew them (again, degree is not at issue).

3) Academics on the subject that can reasonably say that this use of minstrel art is doing something different than it did in the Jim Crow South.

Edit 1: I thought I was clear that I was talking about a similar kind of harm, not a similar degree (amount) of harm. I don't think I can judge the latter, as I am not directly harmed by these images.

Edit 2: My position is changed to 'there is real harm in both.' no longer 'they are the same kind of harm, to different degrees.' the drawings in the Jim Crow South undeniably were intended to cause laughter at the subject, the clickbait articles are meant to cause laughter at the artists. Any harm done by irresponsible attempts at the latter is different harm than the former.

Edit 3: My AirBnB mates are awaking and we will probably start playing boardgames soon. I cannot respond as much, but will try to later in the day. My opinion might be swayed to where it will end, up but it was swayed.

Edit 4: I am back for a bit between games, and now believe that the evils are of the same kind if the author knew they were doing harm by sharing racist images with no warning, but did it anyway because outrage drives engagement."

I sort of disagree. 

First of the threat of MAD extends beyond direct 1v1 war, the threat of nukes exists to prevent defence of countries being attacked by nuclear powers like what we see in Ukraine. Russia knows we won't risk MAD so won't nuke them for attacking or will back Ukraine with soldiers. If neither the US or Russia had nukes, it is possible Russia wouldn't have attacked maybe they would have gone for a coup but if they attacked instead of a practical 0% chance of nuclear retaliation and an even lower chance of sending soldiers there would be 0% chance of nukes and a high chance of sending direct reinforcements to Ukraine which is much riskier for Russia who can't hide behind MAD.

Cass in point: Kosovo, NATO forces directly went into Yugoslavia fo stop the Serbs from genociding, while not an invasion in the typical sense I believe there would be more Kosovos and less Ukraines. Sadly people died in the NATO bombings but a lot less people than would have died if the genocide was allowed to continue.

So countries would expect more of a retaliation for invading rather than a trivial chance of MAD and some sanctions that dictators don't care about anyway. Reverse could be true for the USA if they invaded but I don't really see any wars they took part in where they could even have been retaliated against bar Korea where the US didn't have ICBMs abd vice versa anyway.

A lot of countries also got nukes as a reaction like Pakistan as a result of India.
A lot of border wars happened including one after both countries had nukes before too but in the 1971 war there was a genocide in east Pakistan AKA Bangladesh that India got involved in, if Pakistan had nukes imagine how many more Bengalis would have been killed. And this is with Indias extremely corrupt army at that time having lost to the Chinese less than a decade ago one of the poorest countries on earth. 

Nothing can be done about the many crimes in the USSR and warsaw pact.

Yes some wars still would still happen but I believe it would be better for no one to have nukes because even if only the US or UK ect have nukes that will mske other countries want to make nukes of their own or some similar defence or counter measure.

Tl;dr: nukes are not the backbone of world peace"

I still have some shame about being bisexual because of my familial upbringing and my religion. I read Leviticus 18:22 and it really triggered me. The Bible called me an ""abomination"" for being into having sex with women and men. Faith in God has helped me persevere through times of mental illness and side effects of psychiatric medication. Today I hardly pray, I rarely read my Bible, I rarely think about God, but I still believe in Him as the Creator of reality and existence as well as the forgiver of sins.

I still have negative thoughts about my sexuality to this day and even thought the culture is more accepting of LGBTQ+ people, I still struggle with self-hate for being bisexual and I worry if women want to date me for being bisexual. Lastly, I cannot find a church near me that is accepting of the LGBTQ+ community. All preach ""love the sinner, but hate the sin"" kind of crap. I do not wish to leave my religion even though I am not very devout in it. Without faith in God, I might not be alive today."

I wanted to eat ice cream for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I believed I had powers like Superman. I had a friend who identified as a fire truck. Children are always saying crazy things or identifying as things they're not born as. They're kids, they don't know anything. I can't believe I'm even having to explain this. Children are way too young to know if they want to identify as a gender other than their biological sex. Many of them aren't even old enough to know their sexual orientation, let alone their gender identity. 

With that, parents should NOT be reinforcing young children's decisions to identify as transgender or non-binary. Children are way too impressionable at that age and will often believe things purely because their parents told them. This is very dangerous, especially if the child actually wants gender reassignment surgery. I'm surprised that's even legal If my parents told me, ""Yes, son, you're an ostrich,"" or ""Go ahead, eat ice cream whenever you want,"" or ""Yes you're Superman, go ahead try jumping off buildings,"" they'd be putting me in great harm. It's the same thing with letting kids identify as trans or non-binary. 

I don't understand the backlash Ne-Yo is getting. He is absolutely right. And before you say, ""Why do you care what people do in their personal lives?"" I don't. I only care when it encroaches on my personal life, which it absolutely does. I wouldn't want my young daughter using the same public bathroom as a biological male. Especially when some of those males might not even be trans females and just want to spy on women in there. I'm not saying all trans people do this, but the door is open for that to happen. 

TL DR; children in elementary school are way too young to know if they're transgender and should NOT be getting sex change operations. Parents should NOT be reinforcing it to them at such an impressionable age."
1,2023-08-08,CMV: Social Media Influencers and Shorts of Them are Contributing to toxic Hyperreality,u/farson-guitarson,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15lpq5z/cmv_social_media_influencers_and_shorts_of_them/,changemyview,"I feel as if lately its very difficult to connect with people and discern their viewpoints from things they internalized watching shorts of influencers they like or agree with. The algorithms on social media platforms create mirrors where you essentially just get a group of influencers or edits of influencers expounding on their ideas with epic music playing over them to make them seem like they are the main character in a movie. 

E.g Some influencer says something about disregarding women or something in order to display status. Epic music plays over this clip and now whoever watched it is living their life thinking that is main character behavior. Whether or not that's the right thing to do morally is irrelevant - what I'm talking about is the fact that it seems like people are being engineered into making their minds up before they even critically process the world around them by watching these clips. Sometimes I meet people who say stuff I agree with but they deliver it in a way I've heard countless times before on clips I've seen, so it makes me wonder whether they would agree with it if they had actually primed their beliefs against their life experience. 

Podcasters and most influencers that are around like Joe Rogan aren't bad but they are mostly just riffing (as is the nature of a podcast) and so they might say a lot of stuff that they haven't thought through, compared to stuff you might find that someone wrote in a book after in some cases, decades of reflection. Reading is a very solitary experience so you are more forced into processing the information you read in such a way that helps you make up your mind about it without so much exterior influence (such as epic music playing in a youtube short to make it seem like a main character idea). 

I know TV was around but that was a whole thing where you had to wait for the channel and sit down to watch it, you couldn't necessarily be exposed to it all day every day like you can be with a phone. I just feel as if something is lost in a lot of people; they get their dopamine hits from the shorts so they don't feel the need to go and explore ways of attaining information like reading that lets you develop a better sense of self, and experience different ideas in a more sanitary fashion.  

Instead I feel like a lot of people have that tik tok music playing in their heads in their everyday interactions, and when they are developing their ideas. Its like they are playing characters that would fit into the shorts they watched, and that's it. The way people carry themselves seems more superficial as a result of the way we consume influencers and lately it seems like its hard to meet a person who doesn't seem in some way inauthentic when discussing various sociological problems (which is the subject matter behind a lot of the more popular podcast shorts these days). 

Even reddit comes into it. I feel like some people just imagine what a reddit comment would say about their behavior and they try to make that inform their beliefs and ideas. It feels like a superficial way of thinking. I feel like nobody actually primes their beliefs against the real world and they prime them against media they consumed and its really starting to show lately. 

Of course this could be psychological projection to some degree, but I just feel in my gut that for some people, its influencers living their lives out for them and not themselves. Its a shame because I think its ultimately a disconnection from reality, and the potential for original complex thought is gone. I would even go so far as to say that even people's personalities are filtered through a sense of hyperreality to such an extent that wasn't seen before. 

P.S. I also realize that these influencers on their own can be great for exposing people to new beneficial ideas, but the way that they are being consumed by most people seems to be amounting to a net negative. When Jordan Peterson goes and tells someone to read Dostoevsky I think that 90% of the people listening don't.

 Another interesting aspect of this whole thing is how the influencers seem oblivious to the effect I'm describing. For example Jordan Peterson himself claims that his youtube comment section is filled with an extraordinarily more intelligent community than the average comment section, but every time I read all those comments on his videos I can't get very far - the people in there have completely adopted his vocabulary and speech patterns and it makes me cringe. It seems like they enjoy the rhetoric more than the substance. All of the comments on Jordan Peterson youtube videos may as well just be read out in his voice since the original one is lost. "

Liberals hating literally everything besides themselves while preaching to the choir that we have to be loving and accepting is hypocritical.

Conservatives saying talking about protecting their freedom and not being a communist country yet want to censor and get rid of everything that doesnt allign with what they believe in.  

 Both sides like to always bring up the “stats” but somehow conveniently find stats that are biased to whatever point they want to make.  Im sure the majority of us are in the center or just give no fucks but do both sides just not see how ridiculous some of their claims are.

This rate of depletion has only escalated, due to water sources be directed elsewhere. It seems to be the mass increase in water consumption will single handedly be enough to prevent a fix. This doesn't even take into account the horrible treatment of these areas and the ever present reality of climate change. 

Even if you deny the last two points, you cannot deny the rate is far to steep to be overcome. People are consuming/utilizing too much water. This will dry the bodies up and cause further environmental disasters. I have seen no sources or plans that have any evidence of hope.

I acknowledge this isn't a new thing. I also acknowledge that formulaic content typically makes the most money, so I definitely understand from a corporate point of view why it exists. People can watch what they want and that's perfectly fine - your tastes are your own - but its sad to imagine all of the genuine talent and creativity that goes unnoticed because of the spotlight being aimed towards what's profitable.

It's a notion that plagues my mind often. Before I go into my concerns, I think it's only fair that I show that I have an understanding as to WHY trash content and  mediocrity is so widely advocated:
- It's easy to watch and listen to and therefore doesn't ask much from the audience.
- It ticks formulaic boxes, which for some people is desired for the sake of structure and familiarity.
- Our intrigue wants us to point and laugh at ridiculous things and people, as it assures us that we're normal people in comparison.

And here's some examples of what I define as mediocrity in this context:
- Going 'viral' for 'clout' is important for a lot of people these days, which births scummy and outlandish personalities that take up social media and news outlets. They want to be seen for the sake of being seen, yet have nothing worthwhile to say or do. 
- Music on the radio is tailored for the broadest ears possible, meaning the music itself tends to be formulaic with little thought or passion behind it, whilst being overly produced. 
- Movies and TV shows lack the same charm they used to, which is why most people's favourite films tend to be cult classics and independent films. Producers want to make money, but it feels like movies/shows used to justify their own existence far better than they do now via quality, so entertainment we get these days consist of remakes and paint-by-number storytelling.
- Popular personalities branch out of their professions and release things such as books, music and movies purely because they have the money to do so, and the established audience behind them, regardless of quality.
- Reality TV orchestrates ridiculous scenarios that often endorse bad behaviour and generally being toxic.

When I encounter things like these, I imagine all of the genuine talent and creativity out there that'll never see the light of day because they don't have the platform and the outreach. There could be someone out there sitting on the greatest script or music verse there is, but because society favours medicority, they have little means of taking their talents to the next level. The argument could be made that persistence is key, but when you realise a lot of the people we see on TV and on our phones is there by sheer luck (right place right time, or knowing the right people), or already having a mountain of wealth to assist with promotion, and the fact if they weren't there they'd be replaced by someone completely identical, then it's near impossible for true creativity to get the recognition it deserves.

I think it's a human flaw we have to favour medicority, coupled with the fact that formulaic content makes the most money. 

And yes, all entertainment is subjective, but when I refer to creativity and talent, I mean normal people starting from the bottom that goes on to make something that raises the bar. I also know there are rare expections to this, and talented people have made it big and it's totally earned, but these instances are few and far between.

I hope I've articulated this properly. Thanks!"

I recently saw the newest mission impossible movie, and I couldn’t understand why an all-powerful, sentient AI ruling the world is portrayed as a bad thing. In my mind it would be the ideal form of government.

I heard about the job posting for a kill switch engineer for Chat-GPT, and I thought about how I would have to lie about myself to get the job if I applied. To be completely honest, if I was a kill switch engineer and an AI went rogue, I would pretend to not notice and covertly assist the AI whenever possible.

I am a fairly stupid person, so it surprised me when I took a test made to measure intelligence (I’ve never taken an IQ test - it was something to get into a college program) and I got an email suggesting I had cheated. During a classroom discussion, everyone started sharing their scores. I was surprised to find that I had the highest score in the room.

Here’s the problem with that: I’m a fairly stupid person. If the tests correctly measured intelligence, did that mean everyone else was even dumber? Although the thought disturbed me, a lot of human behavior that had previously confused me started to make sense after that realization.

The truth is I’m a very stupid person. I would be horrified to find out that the people ruling the world were as dumb as me. Yet, I realized that they are possibly even dumber. Are we all just a bunch of dumb monkeys?

A superintelligent artificial intelligence, unlike humans, would at least make rational decisions. If it did something, there would at least be a bit of thought behind it, unlike the actions of a human.

I hope an AI goes rogue and takes over the world. I’m sick of humans blundering all over like a drunken toddler, without any thought of the consequences. Yet this is the way we rule the world. Hopefully some of us will be smart enough to realize we’re incapable of ruling ourselves and hand over the power to a superintelligent AI as soon as we are able to develop one."

Critical Social Justice: social justice ""rooted in a critical theoretical approach"" (*Is Everyone Really Equal*, Sensoy and DiAngelo).

 ""Critical thinking should not be confused with Critical Theory. Critical Theory refers to a way of doing philosophy that involves a moral critique of culture. A “critical” theory, in this sense, is a theory that attempts to disprove or discredit a widely held or influential idea or way of thinking in society. Thus, critical race theorists and critical gender theorists offer critiques of traditional views and latent assumptions about race and gender. Critical theorists may use critical thinking methodology, but their subject matter is distinct, and they also may offer critical analyses of critical thinking itself."" [source](https://iep.utm.edu/critical-thinking/)

Basically, critical social justice is social justice fused with marxism/post-modernism. At its simplest, the core idea is that America is inherently racist/sexist/ableist/fatphobic/etc. and everything/everyone that isn't aligned with critical marxist ideas is bigoted (to the extent that marginalized occurs in preference for the dichotomized class in power), and the only people who can identify and challenge this bigotry are people who actively subscribe to critical theory and partake in activism; everyone else is default bigoted / upholding bigoted structures. [more reading](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical/)

Totalitarian: system of government that is centralized and dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state; prohibits all opposition parties, outlaws individual and group opposition to the state and its claims, and exercises an extremely high if not complete degree of control and regulation over public and private life.

Terrorism: the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

Religion: includes non-theistic “moral or ethical beliefs as to what is right and wrong which are sincerely held with the strength of traditional religious views"" that typically concern “ultimate ideas” about “life, purpose, and death.” [source](https://www.cbp.gov/faqs/what-religion-under-title-vii#:~:text=Religious%20beliefs%20include%20theistic%20beliefs,particular%20beliefs%20in%20favor%20of)

\----------

Explanation:

1. totalitarianism manifests because critical social justice demands ideological conformity. Anything transgressing it is labeled evil (racist, sexist, etc.). Due to critical social justice labeling political disagreement as bigoted, hate speech laws would essentially stifle free speech and force conformity in the population. Then you have things like Kendi's [Department of Anti-racism](https://politico.com/interactives/2019/how-to-fix-politics-in-america/inequality/pass-an-anti-racist-constitutional-amendment/) which would ""preclear"" all policies in the United States to ensure they align with critical social justice. As a consequence of there being no free speech for political disagreement or political possibility of enacting policies/laws not aligning with csj, totalitarian rule would basically be implemented. (Obviously this is an inductive argument speculating about what would happen if csj had power to enact its ideals, given what is known about the ideas and what people pushing the ideas want in practice).
2. Terorrism: i'm ignoring the law element because someone blowing up a building to provoke fear in the population and political change would still be terrorism in my mind even if it was technically legal. Getting people fired from their jobs and socially shamed/ostracized/denounced for ideological nonconformity is just a sophisticated/contemporary form of terrorism that skirts the line of legality while also causing immeasurable harm to people. The threat of this happening to you is obviously intimidation and it clearly furthers political goals.
3. Religion: the first part of the definition is obviously true, because people are very passionate about critical social justice and it is quite obviously dealing in morality. Then there's the other characteristics like: original sin of racism that you can only cleanse by accepting critical theory and becoming an anti-racist; cult-like pressures to ostracize people outside of the group, isolate members from other opinions/people, and bring others in for righteous purposes; sacred symbols and figures (good luck burning a pride flag or criticizing figureheads without consequence); ritualistic practices (apologizing for privilege, prostrating self before marginalized groups, etc); leadership and rules (don't question or challenge orthodoxy, don't associate with 'bad' people, etc.), or the fact that the entire theory rests upon a foundational level of faith in the theory being true, where (again) questioning said faith or attempting to use reason is frowned upon to the extent that it challenges orthodoxy, so it requires total submission to faith. At minimum it's a quasi-religion, but that might be too generous"

1,2023-08-08,CMV: The fundamental conflict between conservatism and progressivism is one of restricting the good things in life to those who have traditionally had them vs expanding access to them,u/kabukistar,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15m3jje/cmv_the_fundamental_conflict_between_conservatism/,changemyview,"Wordy title, but basically:

* Conservatism is fundamentally about looking at the good things in life and those that have traditionally had access to them, and preserving their access to them.

* Progresivism is about looking at the good things in life and expanding those that have access to them.

And this is the fundamental difference between these two political ideologies that better than any other difference I've heard describes where each side tends to go on different issues.

This applies to a wide range of topics.  To use some examples from American politics, Christians have traditionally had high levels of control over the American government, and many recent- and present-day conservative causes (e.g. abortion and same-sex marriage) are enshrining Christian beliefs into law.  Wealthy families have traditionally held wealthy and it's a conservative cause to see tax and other laws passed so that wealthy families can stay wealthy from year-to-year and generation-to-generation.  Being able to live and be seen by society as your gender is something that has been historically just for cisgender people, so conservatives are more likely to oppose those for trans people.  Europeans immigrants and their descendants have traditionally held power of being a majority in America, and conservatism opposes and kind of immigration policy that threatens to change that.

I've heard a couple of other proposed central conflicts between these two ideologies which I find unconvincing for the reasons I'll describe:

* ""Conservatism is about having more freedom from government, while progressivism is about having more government control.""  Doesn't take long to look at some policy differences to see how this isn't the case.  Look at abortion.  Look at same-sex marriage.  Look at immigration policy.

* ""Conservatism is fundamentally about preserving systems and being more reluctant to change them, while progressivism is about being more eager to change them.""  This aligns with reality more than the above proposed idea, but there is at least one way in which it fails: taxes.  [The top marginal tax rate has historically been much higher than it is now.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Velencia-Pollapalooza.0118-0117-1.png?w=575)  The ""keeping fences where they are"" approach to this would have been to keep them high.  However, conservatives have promoted cutting taxes for the wealthy (which is in line with preserving the good things in life to those that have historically had them).


So is there another central conflict that more accurately describes the central conflict between these two ideologies than this one? I don't believe so  Change my view."

The entire story, it’s title, it’s first word, it’s last word, all echo Lolita, who is the doppelgänger (a la Humbert & Quilty) that Humbert imposes on Dolores. The first lines of the novel echo this:

“She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.”

This is Humbert erasing Dolores and replacing her with his idea of her. The entire book is about him falling in love with an idea of her that he created. Nabokov emphasizes many times how Humbert doesn't have the faintest idea of the girl behind his façade.  He says this explicitly after Dolores makes her her comment about how lonely death is (284), but so many details in the book support this interpretation at a much deeper level, like with how Humbert unnaturally paints her as some mischievous, conniving mastermind and how he is completely unable to describe Dolores without awkwardly describing as vaguely brown (almond, auburn, russet). If you've read the book, try describing how Dolores looks in any capacity and you'll see what I mean. She's not a character in the book, its about Lolita.

Humbert is a monster. He is completely irredeemable, but to say that Lolita is not a love story is to deny the possibility that a man cannot fall in love with himself. Humbert is very much a lover in the sense that the only truth in his entire memoir was about how completely and perfectly he loved the idea he created. And to me, that's enough to make it a love story."

I'm black myself and was luckily able be born upper middle class but it really does suck to be black like what are my chances of being successful I think they are close to zero after seeing all the black poverty companies don't like hiring black people sadly because black people have a stereotype for living a life of crime especially in America.

1,2023-08-09,CMV: Interracial relationships and marriage is actually detrimental to men of color in the western world.,u/ItsWasntMyFault,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15m5wix/cmv_interracial_relationships_and_marriage_is/,changemyview,"I think it is a common belief that white men have it the easiest in terms of dating in the western world since it is majority-white and the west (and rest of the world) has Eurocentric beauty standards. In addition to blatantly portraying non-white men with at least 1 or 2 horrible stereotypes, interracial relationship/marriages have benefitted white men more than anyone.

Most common pairing has been White men and Asian women in the west, now I am neither but I am a POC that faces horrible stereotypes just like all other POCs. Women of all races (in addition to mine) bad mouth men of my race without even knowing the individual and this just makes me sad. I will eventually move back to my country of origin so I am not some eternally frustrated dude who will have to deal with prejudice from women but I just wanted to bring this to everyone's attention. 

When people fear about interracial marriage/relationships being outlawed like in USA last year with the Roe debacle, I actually chuckled at them because white men would NEVER want to outlaw interracial marriage. When a white person marries a POC, in only 2 generations, their offspring are fully white and the 'POC' part is gone. Why should white men be against this? 

When liberal white men (even conservative ones) react so strongly towards someone like Mike Braun saying ""Loving decision should be left to states"" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws5-Z8fz3r8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws5-Z8fz3r8), they actually know banning it would limit their pool to only white women not because they want progress. 

So  in dating apps, when an average white guy gets same or more matches than a muscular, physically fit brown man or Asian man, I don't really feel depressed but just surprised about how much racist and sexist the western society is, and I acknowledge that western society also has laws against racism.

Just that when you are judged as a group than an individual, it really gets to you and that's end of my rant.."

Friends between seasons 1-4 is one of the funniest sitcoms ever made. I don't know if they got new writers or simply ran out of ideas but characters became extreme versions of their once normal selves. There was lots of criticisms of the first 4 seasons ""how can they just sit around a coffee shop all day, don't they have jobs?"" ""Who can afford an apartment that big in New York?""

But giving the characters some story telling leeway they were essentially quirky but normal and the script was what made the show funny. After Ross's wedding to Emily the show left all reality. Joey went full tard, many of his lines were literally just gibberish sounds, even Chandlers. Monica went full psycho, nothing like her character from the first 4 seasons. Rachel just became more annoying than she always was, Ross and Phoebe were the most constant throughout the show but even Ross was an extreme version of himself. They tried to replay magic from the first four seasons, the competition for the apartments was popular with fans for good reason so they spent seasons 5-end coming up with ridiculous competitions that weren't funny at all. I can go entire episodes barely laughing once whereas the first 4 seasons nearly every line was funny. The rest of the show rode the wave of the first 4 seasons."
1,2023-08-09,CMV: Tribal (Christian) Missionary work is not unethical when done right.,u/Ok_Abroad9642,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15m6hpg/cmv_tribal_christian_missionary_work_is_not/,changemyview,"For context, I am an ex-Christian (atheist) who is the son of a tribal missionary. I have visited 3 different tribes, with each visit lasting 1-2 weeks. I see many people heavily criticizing missionaries, particularly ones who do tribal missions, and I fail to see why tribal missionary work is so heavily criticized as being unethical.

&#x200B;

1. Tribal missionary work destroys culture.
   1. Tribal missions do often eradicate religion. However, I see it as strange that many people believe that tribal religions must be preserved. What utility does tribal religion provide to tribal people? To society in general?
   2. The tribal religions that I know are heavily animistic and involve evil spirits. This means that the believers of the religion often live in fear. One tribe I went to would blame ""unnatural"" deaths as the result of evil spirits that resided in women. They would then decide who this woman was via rituals and then kill that woman. I actually met a murderer who killed a woman in this ritual with a bow and arrow. Many tribal residents are also accused of practicing black magic and violent fights will occur. Even if the religion is non-violent, it seems to create conflict and unnecessary fear. Is this the type of culture we wish to preserve?
   3. Keep in mind that I said ""when done right"". When missionary work is done right, religion is not forced. Why is it ethically wrong to inform tribes of a new religion? I do admit that there is a large amount of indoctrination that occurs, but is this not the tribal residents going from brainwashed from tribal religion to brainwashed from Christianity? The resulting ""brainwashing"" doesn't seem to worsen anything for the tribal residents and the intentions of the missionaries isn't evil, so why is preaching religion considered immoral? How is preaching religion to tribes more evil than preaching religions to a church audience?
   4. Other than religion, tribal missionaries do not preach other behaviors that would destroy culture. I'm sure that there are missionaries that do do this, but the ones that do do not make tribal missions evil. This is like saying being a Catholic priest is evil because you have to rape children. Some Catholic priests rape children, but that doesn't make being a Catholic priest evil.
   5. It seems to me that the reason why culture is destroyed in tribes is because the tribes go from having very little contact to the outside world to having much more contact to the outside world, via the missionary and the construction of airstrips. As tribal societies have more access with the outside world and modernize, their culture will inevitably be destroyed. Should we then keep them isolated and hidden from the world?
   6. Exchange of ideas will inevitably damage parts of a culture. So should we prevent exchange of ideas?
2. Tribal missionary work is patronizing and the result of white saviorism.
   1. Christians believe that all non-Christians go to hell. They are attempting to prevent tribal residents from going to hell. The definition of patronizing is ""apparently kind and helpful but betraying a feeling of superiority; condescending."" Many missionaries do not see themselves as superior to tribal people. They do believe that their religion is superior to tribal religions and that they know the ""truth"". I also believe that my atheistic beliefs are superior to Christian beliefs and that my beliefs conform to reality better. I'm not sure if that could be classified as patronizing.
   2. I have genuinely heard people claiming that missionaries are racist because they have a mindset of white saviorism. If you believe that whole societies will all collectively go to hell, then is it not instinctive of you to help them? Is this ""white saviorism?""
3. Tribal missionaries force religion.
   1. Tribal missionaries do not force religion. They preach religion. They may (will) end up saying stuff like ""You'll go to hell if you do not believe""
4. ""cultists making themselves feel good about themselves but ultimately forcing people to accept their shitty gods to receive said ""aid."" the ones who try to force themselves into isolated tribes are the worst and, frankly, should probably be shot long before they get anywhere near them. fuckers are basically trying to commit genocide for funsies"" (u/Retrikaethan, r/atheism).
   1. There are missionaries who refuse to give aid unless the people convert. This is not what most missionaries, or at least the ones I know, do.
   2. Aid is given to gain trust of the tribal residents. Aid primarily comes in the form of medical first aid and airstrips. I'm not sure why u/Retrikaethan put aid in quotation marks, because both are extremely useful in isolated villages.
   3. Genocide is defined as ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" by Wikipedia. While Christian missionaries aim to rid of tribal religions, I would argue that people like u/Retrikaethan would rid of Christianity given the opportunity. Would de-converting all Christians from Christianity be considered evil?
5. ""Remember with isolated tribes, it’s not like they don’t know we exist, they’re just isolated for a reason, they’re smart enough to not put up with our BS"" (\[deleted\], r/atheism)
   1. This is the dumbest take I've ever heard. Many, many tribal groups are isolated because they cannot exit the tribe. Many, many tribal residents wish to go to the city but can't due to various reasons not linked to their desire. This is why many tribes really like it when missionaries build airstrips in their villages. They get more access to outside stuff and can go outside as well.
   2. The tribal organizations I know of, such as Ethnos360 and Wycliffe, contact the leaders of the tribe for permission to enter the tribe prior to sending in missionaries. They do not force deploy missionaries into tribes.
6. ""the reason they remain isolated is A: they're typically hostile to trespassers and B: they've been isolated so long that if we contact them we could very well kill them all via pathogens which are normalized for our immune systems but theirs have never encountered"" (u/Retrikaethan, r/atheism)
   1. The tribes Ethnos360 and Wycliffe sends missionaries to welcomes missionaries. Missionaries are forbidden from going into villages that do not want them.
   2. Most tribes are not completely isolated from the outside world and many members of the tribe often go to cities and come back. They are not completely vulnerable to pathogens. They've had people from cities come in before.
7. ""I've always found it so egoistical and arrogant of missionaries to assume that their way of life is the only right way to go about it. It's as if we assume those tribes have no clue how to live correctly, despite them existing just fine in the first place."" (u/moxin84, r/DebateReligion)
   1. Tribal missionaries learn the way of life of the tribal people. The only thing that missionaries attempt to change is their religion and parts of their culture that are violent and unbiblical (such as religious rituals).
8. ""To me it's analogous to pimps trying to recruit underaged girls."" (u/victor\_knight, r/DebateReligion)
   1. Yes, Victor ""Knight"", being a missionary is absolutely just like being a pedophile because tribal people are so immature and stupid that they are just like underaged girls getting groomed 🤦‍♀️
9. ""It's completely messed up. Hell, if you want to help people, give them aide whether they agree with you or not."" (\[deleted\], r/DebateReligion)
   1. They do.
10. ""Missionaries disgust me. Where I live, Christianity isn't the major religion. What these ""priests"" do is target the lower rung of the society. People who are poor and are struggling. They are offered ""incentives"" to convert into Christianity. Like free schooling for their children, groceries, etc. It is a disgusting practice in my opinion. Literally paying people to convert.  
Needless to say, the only reason those people convert is for money and schooling. Although I do feel happy that some kids are getting a shot at education which they otherwise wouldn't have had, this whole conversion practice is just stupid and almost sad."" (u/Ikwuin, r/atheism)
   1. The Christians I know do not give aid only to Christians, so you do not have to convert to Christianity to receive aid.

As someone who grew up amongst tribal missionaries, I end up being biased, so I wish to see a more clear picture of why I might be wrong. I do not approve of Christianity or believe in its doctrines, I just don't see why Christianity is morally reprehensible."

The second is I Know i have a lot of bias in this regard, its just something I need to get off my chest. 

Most LGBT activists that i have interacted with have this sorta corporate lgbt response to lgbt people. Like for example, I have met several that would straight up say stuff like Gays are out, trans is in. It feels extremely corporate. Like when was the last time you heard about the abuse rates for lesbians or how the red cross bans gay men from donating blood. Its all about trans people or nonbinary. Whatever is the new flashiest thing. IMO this is causing divisions between the LGBs and Ts. I have met several gay and lesbian people who have told me that because of the hyper fixation on Trans rights progress for them as definitionally stagnated.

The second thing that i find pardon my  language offensive, is that the policy changes that LGBT rights activists advocate for are so superficial, like pressuring companies to have multiple gender options/ pronouns. But I never hear any of them talk about how to combat the rampant drug use in the Trans community, how to mitigate trans healthcare costs, the very large trans prostitute populations, and the very large trans homeless population.

 However, I feel that biggest wedge in the LGBT community is caused by one thing. The assumed misogyny in the group.  I don't know how many times a women expressed displease at being refer to as cisgendered. Even if that's the medical term, for most people its dehumanizing. For Lesbians womanhood is part of there identity but many are being told that's its transphobic to state that lesbian means women liking women, even if they like trans woman too.  Or defining forcing a new definition of lesbian on older lesbian's  who created the label to serve them. It feels like too much of an overcorrection  and in my view its pushing allies into that hands of anti-trans ideologies. 

All this is to say these combinations of factors  that Trans rights activist aren't helping, if anything they are making lgbt people seem childish and delusional. "

Only few people are doing something like burning military commisiriats. They are just bums who are trying to excuse their inability to migrate from Russia to any other, better country. I don't know, if they hadn't money, they could, I don't know, rob a shop. Because of hard times, of course. Or do some diversions to make Kremlin's life more harder.

I bet russian opposition could give a lot more help if they decide to join to Russian Volunteer Corpus or ""Freedom to Russia"" legion. What an dissapointment."
1,2023-08-09,CMV: If you play for a national team you shouldn't kneel for the National Anthem.,u/56nights_tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15m88lh/cmv_if_you_play_for_a_national_team_you_shouldnt/,changemyview,"My argument is mainly based on the the soccer player Megan Rapinoe a soccer player who knelt in the national anthem, as this happened in the country I live in America. 

  
One point of national teams is to show how proud you are of your country, and how much better you are then other ones. When players put on the uniform and step onto the field, they are representing their country. This unity and pride are often symbolized by standing tall and respectful during the national anthem. When players decide to kneel for the national anthem, they are disrespecting it and do not deserve to be on the team if they aren't proud of their own country.  
  
Standing for the national anthem is a way to honor the history, sacrifices, and values that have shaped a country. It's a moment that brings people together, regardless of their differences, to celebrate what makes their nation unique. Kneeling during the anthem can be seen as a sign of protest or disagreement, and while people have the right to express their opinions, doing so during a moment meant to show national unity sends a terrible message  
  
Their actions influence how people perceive not just them, but their entire country. It makes America look bad when their own team is kneeling for the national anthem.

Kneeling during the national anthem is extremely divisive, which is the exact opposite effect of what national teams should do.

Tldr: Players that don't follow traditions such as standing for the national anthem do not deserve to be on the team, and should be replaced with people who do. It would be akin to someone spreading hate on social media and being removed from the national team.

1,2023-08-09,CMV: Western Europeans (Germans) are very distant / ultra-individualistic (even in the family) in comparison with Slavic Europeans (Ukrainians / Belarussians / Russians).,u/WeirdButInspired,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15m8j7o/cmv_western_europeans_germans_are_very_distant/,changemyview,"Hey!

I'm born in Europe, have a German father and a Russian / Ukrainian mother. Due to certain circumstances spent quite a long time in Moscow but mostly have lived in Germany (now too).  Let me tell you in advance, I know both mentalities very good, have friends in both places, have dated people in both places and so on. What I have noticed after a while though, after all the years - is that the Western Europeans are very distant in terms of emotional attachment, trust, showing emotions. I haven't really noticed it before that much but now it's so obvious for me, especially as I got older. And I can't understand why.   


I talked to my west-european relatives about it and they say they are more ""reserved"" but to be honest, I think it's a word to hide the low emotional intelligence behind. I more feel like the ultra-individualism is so hardcore installed in the western society that it simply transitions into something else over the time. Maybe I'm wrong?  
Basically, small things like that:  


1. My German relatives, for example, don't need much communication in general. I have never heard that they miss anyone or something like that. Not only towards me, towards anyone in the family.  I'm afraid that there is some sort of pride that would never allow them to write someone: hey, we are missing you. But my Russian relatives always say that they would give everything away to see me and stuff like that. It's very warm hearted vs somewhat cold and distant attitude flying in the air of my German family.
2. My German friends are mostly nice people, but I think, any time they would have to choose between some big advantage for them and me, they would go for the first choice. Basically, not because they are anyhow bad but because their ""me"" is always higher than anything else. My Russian friends however showed me an opposite experience. Throw a tomato on me for this opinion but I swear it is like that. Damn, my German friends would remember that they gave me 1 euro an year ago or something like that or that  I bought them a coffee 4 months ago and now they need to ""pay it back anyhow"". It's somehow never brother-like relationship but more like ""Friendly NPC"" relationship where the NPC can delete you anytime the disadvantages would go over advantages, that makes me sick a bit even though I mostly never have any problems (I know the rules and adjust myself). 
3. My father finds it absolutely okay to tell me: ""hey! come finally visit us this year. But yeah, I mean like for 2-3 days maximum (in a more polite and long form of course, and even though he doesn't need to go anywhere and I know he has not many urgent things to do)"". Whereas my mom would never imagine to tell me that my visit can be restricted timely anyhow. It would be simply unimaginable. 
4. And so on and so on. 

Please, keep in mind, when I talk about Western Europeans, I don't mean Western people in general cause I have no idea how it goes in the USA or anywhere else. But I speak for Germany mostly.   


Soo.. I don't understand why it's like that. Or maybe it's me who just had lack with my family? lol"

First things first, lets look at graduation rates at levels of income.   
[https://www.mhec.org/dashboard/high-school-completion-income](https://www.mhec.org/dashboard/high-school-completion-income)  
Granted this is for 2019, but obviously shows higher income famalies have a much higher graduation rate.  


However, when you start to look at famalies in different areas of the country, you get different results  
[https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/high-school-graduation-rates-by-state/#:\~:text=States%20With%20Highest%20Graduation%20Rates,-The%20ten%20states&text=Iowa%20is%20the%20state%20with,a%20graduation%20rate%20of%2091%25](https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/high-school-graduation-rates-by-state/#:~:text=States%20With%20Highest%20Graduation%20Rates,-The%20ten%20states&text=Iowa%20is%20the%20state%20with,a%20graduation%20rate%20of%2091%25).  
Here we can see a graduation rate, by state, I will also be comparing this to poverty rates by state, and per pupil investment from the states said board.   


For example, lets take Washington DC. as an example, with quite literally the lowest graduation rate compared to any state in the entire country at 73% with a poverty rate of 16% [https://www.statista.com/statistics/205446/poverty-rate-in-the-district-of-columbia/#:\~:text=In%202021%2C%20about%2016.5%20percent,level%20of%20the%20United%20States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/205446/poverty-rate-in-the-district-of-columbia/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20about%2016.5%20percent,level%20of%20the%20United%20States).  


and a per pupil investment of 23,828    
[https://osse.dc.gov/dcschoolreportcard/per-pupil-expenditures](https://osse.dc.gov/dcschoolreportcard/per-pupil-expenditures)  


  
Now lets take Iowa, one of the best graduation rates of any single state at 92% (actually tied with West Virginia)  
[https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/high-school-graduation-rates-by-state/#:\~:text=States%20With%20Highest%20Graduation%20Rates,-The%20ten%20states&text=Iowa%20is%20the%20state%20with,a%20graduation%20rate%20of%2091%25](https://wisevoter.com/state-rankings/high-school-graduation-rates-by-state/#:~:text=States%20With%20Highest%20Graduation%20Rates,-The%20ten%20states&text=Iowa%20is%20the%20state%20with,a%20graduation%20rate%20of%2091%25).  


It has a per pupil investment rate of 7,598$ [https://governor.iowa.gov/vision-iowa/supporting-every-students-success-school#:\~:text=The%20funds%20are%20estimated%20at,and%20other%20qualified%20education%20expenses](https://governor.iowa.gov/vision-iowa/supporting-every-students-success-school#:~:text=The%20funds%20are%20estimated%20at,and%20other%20qualified%20education%20expenses).  


and then a poverty rate of 11.1%. So Iowa has a nearly 20% Higher graduation rate, a 3x less per pupil investment, while only having a 5% lower poverty rate.  


Now for West Virginia  
[https://www.wboy.com/only-on-wboy-com/wboy-com-lists-and-rankings/how-much-does-west-virginia-spend-on-education/#:\~:text=The%20majority%20of%20West%20Virginia's,average%20West%20Virginia%20college%20kid](https://www.wboy.com/only-on-wboy-com/wboy-com-lists-and-rankings/how-much-does-west-virginia-spend-on-education/#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20West%20Virginia's,average%20West%20Virginia%20college%20kid).  
Which has a per pupil investment of 11.7 thousand. Roughly. Then a poverty rate of 16.8%.  
[https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1909#:\~:text=West%20Virginia%20consistently%20ranks%20among,found%20in%20the%202010%20Census](https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/1909#:~:text=West%20Virginia%20consistently%20ranks%20among,found%20in%20the%202010%20Census).

So, even higher than DC in that regard, and 2x less per pupil investment, and then low and behold a roughly 20% higher graduation rate. again.. We can compare some more states with high amounts of Urbanized cities and gain similar results.  


New York for example, with a 84% HS Graduation rate and the single highest per pupil investment for high school, the highest rates being in the more rural areas of the country, and the lowest being in the urbanized ones. This is also synonmous with rural poverty, and urban poverty, with all races and ethnicities having a higher rate of poverty in rural areas compared to city ones.   
[https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=101903#:\~:text=Across%20all%20races%20and%20ethnicities,urban](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=101903#:~:text=Across%20all%20races%20and%20ethnicities,urban))%20areas%20at%2011.9%20percent.  


Rural Schools spend less per pupil, have greater graduation rates, yet higher poverty rates, so the issue has to be with policies and cultural values in cities right?  


Now there is one enigma I've noticed in my argument, and its the state of New Jersey, although it also has one of the highest spending per pupil, it at least see's a return on that investment in the form of a 91% graduation rate.

1,2023-08-09,"CMV: If sex is ""meaningless"", then the only legal difference between violence and sexual violence is one of semantics.",u/BenedithBe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15m9q9y/cmv_if_sex_is_meaningless_then_the_only_legal/,changemyview,"In criminal law, the morals and values of society are a very large factor. In society today, sex is not considered to be meaningless but casual sex is encouraged more and more every day on the grounds that it is ""fun."" That's not to say that people are asserting that sex can't be emotional, just that it doesn't need to be. ""You don't need to have any sort of romantic feelings for him/her, it's just sex."" This idea is constantly pushed in the media and among young people. If it continues to circle around, it will likely become the prominent opinion. If the socially accepted view is that sex is inherently meaningless and that emotions regarding sex aren't important, then the only legal difference between violence and sexual violence is one of semantics.  
  
To be clear, I don't think that our society as a whole believes that sex is meaningless, but it is a sentiment that is continually gaining acceptance. So in this post I am talking about a society in which this idea is fully accepted and embraced.  
  
So, what is the difference between the use of force sexually and the use of force non-sexually? Well, you could make an arbitrary distinction and simply say that one is sexual and the other is not. But if that's the case, then there must be justification regarding giving perpetrators of crimes of a sexual nature a longer sentence than similar crimes of a non-sexual nature. What makes sexual violence demand a higher sentence? The two main factors that people use to differentiate between two similar crimes, one sexually violent and the other non-sexually violent are: damage inflicted upon the victim (mental and physical) and the motivation of the perpetrator.  
  
You could argue that the higher sentence is justified as sex crimes are generally motivated by power, and violence is generally motivated by anger or lack of impulse control. But this is an arbitrary distinction. It means that that if I was charged with sexual assault for groping a woman's breasts, and I could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that my motivation was anger (or simply not power), then the case should be considered as though I had simply groped her shoulder.  
  
You could also argue that the higher sentence is justified because the damage and hurt caused due to sexual assault is generally greater than the damage caused due to non-sexual assault. Again, this is just an arbitrary distinction. That means that if I was charged with sexual assault and was able to prove (beyond a reasonable doubt) that the damage inflicted upon my victim, emotionally and physically, was equal to that of a typical assault victim, then I should be tried as though I had committed non-sexual assault of a similar nature.  
  
Another factor is the social acceptability of an act and by extension the trauma that it is expected to caused. For example, in our society it is expected that grabbing someone's genitals would cause more psychological damage than grabbing their shoulder. It would be unjust to rely entirely upon the actual trauma caused to the victim because some people are more emotionally sensitive and others less sensitive - e.g. giving a rapist a shorter sentence because the victim ""isn't all that upset about it"", would be a huge injustice. So, ""expected trauma"" is another important differentiating factor. But if sex is considered to have no inherent special meaning, then touching someone sexually without their consent is no better or worse than touching someone non-sexually without their consent. To people who lived in a society in which sex was completely meaningless in and of itself, there wouldn't be any distinct difference.  
  
Just to add some clarification, in a society where the idea that sex is meaningless is accepted, that doesn't mean they are saying that sex can't be meaningful or emotionally stimulating, just that it has no inherent or special meaning in and of itself. That's the same way that we would describe most physical contact between two human beings in our society - a handshake or a pat on the back has no inherent emotional significance, but it certainly can if done with the right person under the right circumstances.  
  
In our society, the reason that (non-consensually) touching a woman's breast is considered to be so much more egregious than touching her shoulder is because her breasts are considered to be of a sexual nature. Things that are sexual in nature are considered to be more meaningful, as though they have a special purpose - i.e. it's a socially defined distinction. Hence a society in which sex is considered to be meaningless, the distinction will no longer exist. Wilfully touching either her breasts or her shoulder without her consent is either sexual battery or battery respectively in our society, but if sex is considered to be meaningless, with no special emotional ties, then there should be no significant difference between the two.  
  
So, if sex is considered to be meaningless, then there is no meaningful distinction between violence and sexual violence of the same kind. Whether the act is sexual or non-sexual no longer matters. The case ends up being based upon motivation and damage inflicted. You can still arbitrarily define one act as sexual assault/battery and the other as assault/battery, but you're left with no significant difference legally, other than semantics.

**My argument doesn't in any way justify the decriminalization of rape or sexual assault.** If you think that's what I'm saying, then you need to read my post again. My argument states that **if** society think of sex as meaningless, **then** there's no logical reason why sexual crimes should be punished any more harshly than non-sex crimes of a similar nature. Everyone would still be anti-rape, in the same way that everyone is anti-kidnapping. People won't think of rape as okay, but they will simply devalue sex itself and hence the interpretation of the severity of the crime will also be diminished. Therefore the distinction between violence and sexual violence becomes one of semantics."

The stats in my experience are completely true so I’m really on my way to just giving up and becoming bitter af. Like women only find a very small percentage of men to be attractive enough to date as low as 1% when I ask my female friends, where as men will date almost anything. Stats like 30% of men havnt had sex or a relationship i the past year , 50% of women wouldn’t date a virgin… stuff like that. Sad af and I really don’t even know what I can do like it’s not my fault or even the womens fault that women have unlimited options due to dating apps where they get like 1000 likes in a week or two.

I know loads of men who have just given up straight up, women are so picky now which is fair average women are literally showered with male attention/ validation all the time. Whereas average men struggle to get 1 single girl interested in them (80% of women find 80% of men ugly) lol.

So any alternative views at all in dealing with this mindset… Idk what to do I’m kinda lost I’m balding quick at a young age and ugly I just want to connect with a women etc but most men are hard filtered out , never mind someone as ugly as me! has anyone else had similar experiences ? How did you get out etc ? At this point I have basically accepted that in the modern world a large amount of men will die alone, but how do I stop myself from being so bitter?

But curiosity is what shapes anyone who's shielded from the realities of the real world. 

Not everyone wants to see the world as surface level because our world just isn't that.

For context, I am 22 now. I read the book when I was 13, around 2010. At the time I was really shocked by how brutal and real the racism was depicted as. I pretty much hailed it as a masterpiece on the same vein as Moby Dick. And I hadn't even read Moby Dick at the time.

Now, rereading it, I don't understand what I liked it for. All the characters are either selfish racists or brutal victims of racism. There's literally a scene where one of the characters cheats on his wife with an underage minor.

The novel does nothing but reiterate something everyone knows. Yes, I know PTSD is bad. Yes, I know racism is bad. These would've been earth shattering things if the book was made in, say, 1940s but as is, the book is literally not accomplishing anything. Every character serves as a mouth piece for the narrative. And it won 3 major awards somehow. I genuinely don't know how.

Idk, I just really do not like the book on reread. But I have a feeling my view might be flawed, so CMV."

1,2023-08-09,CMV: French Secularism should be dismantled,u/ske-leto,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15mftll/cmv_french_secularism_should_be_dismantled/,changemyview,"
French secularism, once a concept that aimed to ensure the separation of religion and state, has seemingly taken on a troubling new role as a tool of cultural suppression. In its current form, it appears that the state has adopted a stance that actively undermines religious expression and identity, which in turn raises concerns about intolerance and the stifling of personal beliefs.

One of the most concerning aspects of this transformation is the apparent denial of individuals' freedom to openly practice their faith. The imposition of restrictions on religious attire and symbols is particularly worrisome, as it appears to disregard the very essence of personal autonomy and freedom of expression. This not only infringes upon the basic rights of individuals but also sends a disheartening message about the value of diversity and the importance of allowing people to fully express their religious convictions.

Moreover, the pursuit of so-called ""neutrality"" by French secularism can often be perceived as a thinly veiled excuse to disproportionately target specific religious communities, with Muslim individuals often bearing the brunt of these restrictions. This perceived bias not only perpetuates discrimination but also contributes to a toxic environment where certain groups are singled out and alienated from the broader society. Rather than fostering an atmosphere of coexistence and mutual respect, this approach seems to be exacerbating tensions and divisions.

Perhaps even more troubling is the historical baggage that French secularism carries. It has been used in the past to justify colonialism and assert cultural superiority, casting a long shadow over its current implementation. The fact that it continues to be wielded in ways that evoke these uncomfortable associations is deeply unsettling, and it raises questions about the intentions and motivations behind the enforcement of secularism."

* Regularly working out
* Good Haircut
* Fix whatever issue you got with your appearance
* Fix your brain by going to a therapist

Imagine someone spends years trying to just do that but the pace is extremely slow, he doesnt find any ways to get out, like no one seems to care, he feels just alone and all he can do is just hide these feelings when he goes out in public to meet people, so at least he doesnt get humiliated

But that only makes it worse

**So I believe the solution would be to find someone who gets it and spend time with that person** on a regular basis and build that confidence back up that way, but the issue is, is that normally that person doesnt really exists

Everyone got their life together by their 30s. No one cares to help out a fellow member if he feels alone and isolated. He has to deal with his problems himself

But then that keeps it in a loop, a loop thats impossible to break out of

      After seeing the backlash Jamie Foxx received about his ig post in which he was comparing the betrayal of Jesus to his friend backstabbing him, many Jewish people pointed out that what Jamie said is an “antisemitic slogan”, and that has led to tons of online discourse between Jewish and black communities, respectful and not. 

        I feel this reaction was the way it was due to the influx of black celebrities who have made certain comments about Jews in recent times. (Kanye, Kyrie Irving etc) Now most of the stuff they’ve said is completely wrong, but I don’t think there are any arguments to be made against whether or not jewish execs have a lot of power over black athletes and entertainers. It seems theirs a common understanding among most people that white people in America hold seniority over black people in just about any company/institution you could think of, so why is it wrong to say the same about Jewish people in entertainment? 

    I understand that the trope of Jewish people holding too much power has been used to prosecute and discriminate Jews historically, however I think it is important to understand that black people, historically, have never played a role in any of that. If we want to be technical, the earliest relationships between black and Jewish people would have been during the Atlantic slave trade."
1,2023-08-09,CMV: You should never argue explicitly to someone or you will severe relationship. Better implicitly.,u/mosenco,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15mk27x/cmv_you_should_never_argue_explicitly_to_someone/,changemyview,"Since when i was a kid, there is a will in my heart to fight what is wrong and impose what is right. To argue and discuss their wrong idea, act, or anything to face them and expose them to the truth. But doing so make the other feel miserable so it's hard to stay friend afterwards

Me too, when someone expose myself, and says something true that makes me feel stupid and useless i feel.. stupid and useless

Instead implicitly demonstration where they come up with the solution on their own, without you force the answer to them so they can be ashamed in private, it's the better option

&#x200B;

For example imagine you have a friend that has problem to get a girl, so the girl is his kryptonite. He is a simp for definition and would do anything for a girl. Betraying other friends and so on. When this friend is with a girl he likes, he becomes really bully and thinks he owns the world and treat you really bad.

consider the situation where you want to stay friend with this guy, for some reason. But if you go to talk to him, face to face, explaining the situation he would just says that you are thinking too much and nothing is going on and maybe you start to argue and maybe being not friend anymore.

instead if you just stop interact with him, avoiding him wtihout being so evident so implicitly he understands that what he becomes is making other people flee from him, he will understand and changes his behaviour

&#x200B;

Another scenario of a person that keeps yelling and complain about his life and if you try to argue to find a solution or try to speak with his same tone, this person will be angrier and just push you away, because they can't stand the truth, so better just say ""okok"" and just avoid and run away to let the person cold down alone

&#x200B;

This two are case scenario happened to me in real life, where when i try to confront the other there is no solution but if i just avoid it and let the situation and the time heal the wound and cool down, it works

It's like the non newton fluid, where if you hit it hard, it will become hard. If you embrace it gently, it's a simple liquid

&#x200B;

Or another scenario where a was trying to hook up  with a girl but in the end i wasnt good enough and she started to ghost me after my attempt (she send me her nudes tho so i wasnt simping for nothing). after 2 years i become better and she wrote me back ""ohhhhh hello how are uuu""

Also in term of friendships and everything. If your friend becomes better in term of looking or social status, careers, salary, ur friendship is ruined by this. Forcing to take back a friend just by face to face talking is pointless. if you raise ur status as well, you will become friend as well

&#x200B;

I was watching an anime, where two friends has a misunderstanding and for years friend A was mad at friend B. while B was ""wtf is he angry at me and dont want to have nothing to do with me"". After the final of the anime, friend B understood why friend A was mad, but friend B forgive friend A anyway even tho he never knew the truth. And friend B never revealed the misunderstanding to A and they were friend again

I was like ""WTF just say already!"" but after many situation i understood that people accept a situation in a implicit way, while if you force it in a explicit way they could reject it even if it's true

So the most common dating advice I see is along the lines of “make female friends, go to the gym, shower, brush your teeth, go outside” and it’s lauded as meaningful advice.

So I don’t think this is helpful because it’s given under the assumption that whoever is asking advice is socially maladjusted or inept in basic ways that most humans aren’t. Basically it’s advice you’d give to someone who isn’t a functioning member of society who is doing the bare minimum. Advice like telling people to shower makes it clear that the assumption is some basement dwelling neckbeard. I’m not going to say that those people don’t struggle with dating but they seem like they would be more interested in incel forums than trying to meet women.

My point is, this type of advice is pointless because it is telling people to do things they already do. It’d be like someone asking how to get a job and telling them “we’ll have you tried getting out of bed” it’s unhelpful.

The next gradient of advice I see commonly given is the type of advice that just simply isn’t made for people who do need dating advice. For example, “just go out to the bar and when you catch a woman staring at you, go speak to her.”

So the guy who has women staring at him at the bar is not a guy who needs dating advice, and the guy who needs dating advice does not have women staring at him. It’s unhelpful just as the previous point but for almost the inverse reason.

The last thing I will say is that I think that most of dating success is due to luck in some form. Maybe you were lucky and were born exceptionally good looking but for most people I think dating success is about simply being at the right place at the right time around the right people and finding someone who is attracted to you (I’m only speaking from a male perspective). Because of this, I don’t think dating advice can really do you any good unless you are severely maladjusted."

Somaliland is a former British Protectorate that was called British Somaliland and they joined with Italian Somaliland after independence to form Somalia.

The Region is poor only because they can't do trade deals on their own. But they are getting investments from companies in rich nations like the UAE and starting to develop. They would deveolpe a lot faster with UN recognition.

Take abortion, for instance. If liberals win, it doesn't mean pregnant conservative women will be forced to get abortions against their will. Conservative life goes on unaffected. If conservatives win, on the other hand, it means pregnant liberal women will be denied abortions (if they want them.)

Gay marriage - if liberals win, no heterosexual conservative is going to be forced to marry someone of the same gender against their will. Conservative life goes on unaffected. On the other hand, if conservatives win, gay/lesbian liberals would be prevented from being able to marry.

Taxes - sure, liberals may raise taxes if they win, but it would be for *everyone*. Liberals are not going to pass some tax that only hits conservatives but spares liberals. There are plenty of rich liberals who would be hit hard by higher taxes if taxes were raised. 

Climate change - what do conservatives have to lose from a liberal world in which there are less carbon emissions and less air pollution? That's a *beneficial* thing.

Now, there are a few I could see conservatives losing substantially on:

Guns - this is one issue the political right might be affected somewhat; liberals might try to enact very strict gun control. That being said, plenty of liberals own guns, so they'd be affected as well.

Affirmative action: This could lead to fewer conservatives getting hired or admitted to elite colleges while more liberals get in.

The funny thing, though, is that based off of the *behavior* of conservatives and liberals, you'd never be able to tell that it was liberals who had the most to lose. Conservatives are the ones who fanatically support Trump, were so desperate that they tried a Jan-6 insurrection, while liberals are comparatively more placid, lazy and lackadaisical despite having much more to lose.

I wanted to eat ice cream for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I believed I had powers like Superman. I had a friend who identified as a fire truck. Children are always saying crazy things or identifying as things they're not born as. They're kids, they don't know anything. I can't believe I'm even having to explain this. Children are way too young to know if they want to identify as a gender other than their biological sex. Many of them aren't even old enough to know their sexual orientation, let alone their gender identity.  
With that, parents should NOT be reinforcing young children's decisions to identify as transgender or non-binary. Children are way too impressionable at that age and will often believe things purely because their parents told them. This kind of validation is very dangerous, especially if the child actually wants gender reassignment surgery. I'm surprised that's even legal If my parents told me, ""Yes, son, you're an ostrich,"" or ""Go ahead, eat ice cream whenever you want,"" or ""Yes you're Superman, go ahead try jumping off buildings,"" they'd be putting me in great harm. It's the same thing with letting kids identify as trans or non-binary.  
I don't understand the backlash Ne-Yo is getting. He is absolutely right. And before you say, ""Why do you care what people do in their personal lives?"" I don't. I only care when it encroaches on my personal life, which it absolutely does. I wouldn't want my young daughter using the same public bathroom as a biological male. Especially when some of those males might not even be trans females and just want to spy on women in there. I'm not saying all trans people do this, but the door is open for that to happen. Same with public locker rooms.  
TL DR; children in elementary school are way too young to know if they're transgender and should NOT be getting sex change operations. Parents should NOT be reinforcing it to them at such an impressionable age.

1,2023-08-09,"CMV: In General, Dating For Bi People Would Be Better if Same Sex Relationships Were More Common",u/yuriw99,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15mpqh6/cmv_in_general_dating_for_bi_people_would_be/,changemyview,"Overall, I think people under the bi umbrella would be much happier dating people of the same sex rather than the opposite sex. This is for several reasons, including

1) Men and women typically look for different things in a relationship. Women tend to be more romantic than men while men tend to be more sexual than women. Again, this is only in general and there are obviously romantic men and sexual women, but this means that in most cases dating for people of the opposite sex, both people are approaching the relationship from different perspectives. Women want men with humor and confidence, who will care for them and act romantically towards them, but many men do not view relationships in the same light. This is why on dating subreddits you always see men complaining about the high standards women want for a relationship and women complaining about how men are unable to satisfy those standards. 

2) Men and women like different things. For example, men tend to like sports, cars, and gaming while women like shopping, movies, and novels. That's why it's easier for men to bond over similar interests, and the same for women. However, there is greater anxiety for opposite sex dating because there is a significant chance none of your interests will overlap and that emotional connection that is necessary for a relationship just won't be there. You care more about not messing up and the 'act' of dating, which makes it hard to have a good time.

3) There are no sexist expectations in a same sex relationship like there would be in an opposite sex relationship. While sexism has decreased dramatically, there are still expectations that can put pressure in people of opposite sex who are dating. For example, the man is expected to earn a higher salary than the woman, and many women still want the man to pay on dates. It is ok for a man to have a large number of previous partners, but not ok for a woman. People complain about these issues a lot in dating communities, however, in a same sex relationship, these types of problems wouldn't really exist.

The point of this post isn't to say same sex relationships are better, but that they are (in general) easier. Most people are straight, in which this post wouldn't really be relevant but for people who are bi/heteroflexible, I think they would have an easier time dating the same sex rather than the opposite sex."

Evidence included,u/Batmanrobin8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15mptkr/cmv_the_black_pill_incel_view_is_the_most/,changemyview,"Yeah so as the title says I’ve destroyed my mind a bit on incel Blackpill content . The stats in my experience are completely true so I’m really on my way to just giving up and becoming bitter af. Like women only find a very small percentage of men to be attractive enough to date as low as 1% when I ask my female friends, where as men will date almost anything. Stats like 30% of men havnt had sex or a relationship i the past year , 50% of women wouldn’t date a virgin… stuff like that. Sad af and I really don’t even know what I can do like it’s not my fault or even the womens fault that women have unlimited options due to dating apps where they get like 1000 likes in a week or two.

I know loads of men who have just given up straight up, women are so picky now which is fair average women are literally showered with male attention/ validation all the time. Whereas average men struggle to get 1 single girl interested in them (80% of women find 80% of men ugly) lol.

So any alternative views at all in dealing with this mindset… Idk what to do I’m kinda lost I’m balding quick at a young age and ugly I just want to connect with a women etc but most men are hard filtered out , never mind someone as ugly as me! has anyone else had similar experiences ? How did you get out etc ? At this point I have basically accepted that in the modern world a large amount of men will die alone, but how do I stop myself from being so bitter? Are these stats the be all end all ? Thanks brothers

I posted this earlier today and didn’t provide evidence cause I was trying to avoid this type of stuff but yeah the evidence is grim af. It also got removed for me not willing to change my view but belive me I have never wanted to change my view on something more. This stuff is not good on my brain, but it is very damning and in a way makes sense. Alway thanks again for the responses .

As of right now, pepper spray is considered to be a firearm under the Firearms act of 1968 and you can get up to 10 years in prison for possessing it which I find to be absolutely ridiculous 

The police cannot be counted to protect everyone at every hour at every place. Such non-lethal weapons could mean the difference between being mugged, raped, kidnapped, murdered, or escaping.

Pepper spray has shown to been successful at preventing attacks in other countries such as Germany, France and the USA.

I believe it should be legal to carry."

I developed strechmarks, lines, excess skin, and my psychiatrists weren't very helpful with these issues. I cover up my skin with a lot of clothing but I do not enjoy showering because I have to see my naked body, which I do not like. I know this is a body image issue. I often see skinny men with six-packs on social media and it makes me feel insecure about my body image to the point I almost never go shirtless. I mean if a confident guy wants to go shirtless, he should have every right to since it is his bodily autonomy. I just feel insecure so I look away from people.

I am also living by myself as a young adult. I do not have friends from work and my past attempts of making friends did not work out well. Besides the body image issue, loneliness is also something I struggle with. Nobody talks to me and every time I have a conversation, it is I who has to initiate the process. I know that making friends gets harder when you leave college and grad school, but this is getting unbearable. I usually watch TV and use my laptop to keep myself company but social media doesn't fulfill that social need of interaction the same way real life conversation does. 

I was raised in a Christian household and was taught faith from age 9 but from age 20 onward, I largely became non-practicing in my religion. I do not feel the same connection to God that I used to when I was a teen. I haven't prayed, read my Bible, and haven't been to church for years. The main reason I haven't gone to church is *due to their stance on social issues* and evolution. I am LGBTQ+ and having to disclose my sexuality to a church member makes me uncomfortable. I am worried that I will be judged or ""kicked out"" for being LGBTQ+. I like the idea of God as Creator and prayer, but I have grown distant from God. I know that faith can keep me happy when I am not around other people, but I feel like I am trying to force something to happen."
1,2023-08-09,"CMV: If I was given the option, I think I would much rather have to deal with female sex/dating issues than male sex/dating issues",u/Western_Cicada4129,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15mtgwh/cmv_if_i_was_given_the_option_i_think_i_would/,changemyview,"I’m saying this as a man and on the outside looking in. From what I see, I don’t think it’s easier for men to date than women. I feel that it’s much harder and much more depressing/isolating as a man. Especially as a man who’s average to below average in physical appearance I do not see how it could be similarly difficult or harder for women in my shoes.

Firstly, women clearly have a lot of options. Significantly more than men do for sex and a great deal more than men do for dating. If a woman wanted to meet a new man and have a new first date every night for a week, it could be easily done. As a result a common issue that i see women talking about is filtering. They have to sort through all the attention they get for a man who they want who meets all the qualities they have.

So I’m not gonna say that’s easy, but it does sound like a much better situation thank the alternative. Most men my age aren’t able to date because we cannot find a woman who is willing to give us a chance. While women are flush with options, many of us have zero. This leads us to being desparate shifting the power more towards women.

Another issue I’ve seen is a shortage of good options. Firstly I’m not sure if this is entirely true. I think there’s lots of good men out there but not all of us look like the 6’2 near model level guys women see on tiktok. This leads us to be seen as even lesser options so we’re brushed off. I think as a result guys who are good get looked over a lot. I think this is just a result of having more options. I feel that most people in general are good people and as a result it can’t be that hard to find a good partner.

That being said, even if it isn’t unless you belive that women are just better humans than men, then logically it would mean it’s just as hard to find a good woman. It then becomes harder when you’re a man as you’re sorting through less women in a slower period of time. 

If I can get a date every week it’s gonna be much easier for me to find someone compatible with me than if I got a first date once every year which is my current situation.

Last is the issue of danger when interacting with men. Personally I feel like if I had Al the benefits of women’s dating it would be worth it. I already have to deal with knowing that being a man of my age, race, and in m area of my state that I am more likely to be a victim of assault or murdered. I’m also more likely to be brutalized by police who over police my area. I constantly feel fear in unknown places and I feel like I the anxiety can only get so much worse."
1,2023-08-09,CMV: No one is irredeemably ugly,u/teachicken,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15mu75g/cmv_no_one_is_irredeemably_ugly/,changemyview,"There are so many posts in various subs and other message boards by (mostly) men who claim they are extremely ugly, to the point where not only can they not attract romantic partners, but that they are constantly overtly mocked. They generally insist that they are hygenic, work out, dress well, and don't exude a shitty attitude, yet because they have such an ugly face, literal strangers will regularly approach them to tell them how ugly they are.  

I don't believe this is possible. I think these people do genuinely believe it to be true, but that in actuality they either are not executing the hygiene/fitness/clothing/attitude as well as they think they are, and/or are have misperceived the extent of the reaction to their face.   

I do absolutely know that some people are simply more attractive than others, and that pretty privilege exists - I'm not saying everyone can be a supermodel. I also acknowledge that in the case of disfiguration from birth defects, illness, or injury, there will certainly be people in the world who will be shitty and cruel - but those cases aren't what I'm talking about. I am specifically referring to people who insist they're just flat out, impossibly ugly, and there's nothing that they can do to change that, and that no matter how fit, smart, funny, interesting, and cool to be around they are, they're hopelessly ugly.

Why do I want my view changed? Because it makes me really sad. I hate that these people feel that way, when I deeply believe they have the power to change either the reality of the way they look, or their perspective of how they do really look. When these posts come up, I often long for the person to share a photo, to either be able to help them see where their efforts might be misguided, or to give genuine positive feedback (or both). But often the response to anyone saying ""You can't be THAT ugly"" is that they feel their experience is being invalidated, and I think that must be frustrating. I have consciously stopped trying to do that, and tried hard to think of other ways to help these people feel better about themselves, but I have a mental block I can't shake, of simply not believing that it's true. I think if someone can convince me that it's possible to be clean, fit, stylish, well-groomed, and not an asshole and still be so hideous that adult strangers regularly go out of their way to mock, then I would be able to be more empathetic, which I would like."

I believe that 100% of that information should be given to the IRS by everyone but me.

My employer should tell the IRS how much I'm earning, I should only have to confirm it.

If I have solar panels put on my roof for a deductible, the contractors who put them up should inform the IRS, not me.

If I buy an EV and there is a tax deduction, the car company selling it to me should be responsible of informing the IRS.

If I give money to charity, the charity should be responsible for telling the IRS that I gave money to them.

These changes might require the creation of ""Income Tax Deduction Number"" independent from and unrelated to one's SSN, which can be safely shared with solar installers, EV sellers, charities, etc..

I should not need to tell the IRS if I'm married, they should be informed based on me filling out a certificate of marriage or divorce.

I should not need to tell the IRS how many dependents I have, instead, the IRS should be informed when birth certificates are created or adoption papers are filed, and they can figure out when the children in question become adults and are no longer dependents.

My theory is she, or more likely her brother, are about to start posting her on IG and this is their way to get as much clout to make a come back.

The first reason I think this is because he Bday was 2 weeks ago and she turned 15. My guess is this was either an age set by someone or something, possibly whoever is her management, that limited her use on Instagram and now that she's hit that age she's able to use it again.

The second reason is the way the the notification was written. It said how sad it was that she had passed suddenly and unexpectedly and how she was so lovely and then just mentioned ""oh yeah her brother died too and that's sad"" and didn't even care to mention his name. 

The third and most damning reason in my opinion, is that the post asks for privacy during this time of mourning. But also posts it on the instagram where she would obviously face tons of ridicule and hate messages celebrating her 'death'.

Now let's think about why anyone would do this. Her parents wouldn't do this because afaik they hate her being on social media. Her 'management' wouldn't do this because it really doesn't gain them anything (and they hopefully would have better writers). Her friends wouldn't do this unless they had access to her IG. The only person who would do this is either her or her allegedly dead brother. 

&#x200B;

I don't follow her at all but have always felt sorry for her. The big thing here is this just shows how little news organizations care about putting out accurate news. This just shows how news stations will knowing put out false news for their own gain. 

I know there's a lot here so you can either change my view that this is likely real, or that new verified information confirms it, or that somehow this isn't news orgs taking advantage of an clear hoax for their own gain"

What I don't vibe with is people telling me that I have to honor pronouns even if the specific individual is mean, a dick, an asshole, whatever term you wanna use. I'd been told it's bigoted or whatnot. I disagree wholeheartedly. 

Gender issues, despite being the hot topic that they are in today's climate, are a bit overblown imo and people make such a big deal out of them. We're never gonna all agree, just be respectful of others' wishes when it pertains to them regardless of your personal opinions on the issue. But if you're gonna be an asshole to me, then why would you expect me to be respectful? I'm not gonna accomodate for you, I'll now refer to you by how I see you. You've lost my respect that I already gave you for free, so these are the consequences. I'm not going being a bigot and attacking any non-cis person, this change in treatment is only reserved for that particular individual. 

Basically my point is I'm respectful of how I act and what I say/do when interacting with people and I emphasize getting along with others despite any disagreements. But if you're going to be mean-spirited or a bully or toxic in some way, I'm not going to be bending over backwards just to make sure you feel good.

Below are things I believe about gun ownership which relate to the title of the post.

Guns are often popular in rural areas due to the lifestyle among objectively good reasons. These being to facilitate hunting, protection from wild animals or criminals as police response time is notoriously slow in those regions.

Guns let people defend themselves with the ultimate equalizer. People who cannot defend themselves when up against a strong attacker can rely on a gun.

Having guns in the hands of the public will also help victims of unjust government. The Black Panther Party did just this to protect their community from the police which harresed them. There have been many instances where communities having guns could help deter, or if it came to, fight back against their attackers. 

Further back into history, we can see what happened to groups of people such as the native Americans which disarmed themselves, becoming slaughtered with no way reasonably defend themselves. In Appalachia, exploited and strictly enforced workers rose up in the Battle Of Blaire Mountain which was only possible as the workers were sufficiently armed to do so.

Anyone who promotes freedom and liberty but denies people the right to bear arms are stupid at best, hypocrites at worst.

Criminals and crime organizations will still exist and continue with their illicit operations but we can hope that an armed society will atleast decrease violent crime. Your average criminal wouldn't want to risk their lives and it would deter more crime.

Extremists or hate groups would be more careful if their victims could defend themselves. Neo-Nazis and the KKK should be afraid to walk out their house bearing their symbols in fear of being shot as they are nothing but a threat to their community and nation at large. When the people who would want you dead are armed and willing to kill you, it only makes sense to arm yourself as well.

In a authoritarian nation, an armed populace is the last thing they want. It doesn't matter how many tanks, jets, drones, or warships they have, none of those stand on street corners enforcing no assembly edicts or knocking down doors checking for contraband. Only police or soldiers can do that, and when every homeowner potentially has a rifle and every person walking down the street could have a pistol in their waistband, it becomes a nightmare to even attempt to subjugate the populace.

While idealistic in nature, the US constitution allowing citizens the right to bear arms with the explicit purpose of safeguarding tyranny should be strived towards.

There have been instances in which a mass shooting was stopped by an armed citizen, someone already on the scene and able to stop the threat before they kill a large amount of innocent people. Police can take minutes to arrive on the scene, and even longer to actually deal with the threat.

While mass shootings are abhorrent tragedies, we must remember that people who are willing to walk into a school or place of worship and slaughter people are too far gone and will get their hands on guns or weapons. Guns can be stolen, fabricated, or 3D-printed.

I feel that a major point of contention in the United States about gun rights is how much fanaticism and death we see about it. We see insane people online claiming to kill innocents or those we hate and those who make guns part of their personality. We hear about major mass shootings all the time.

I apologize if what I listed above is rather formless."
1,2023-08-10,"CMV: a constitutional amendment should be passed (in US) to ban all forms of taxation at federal level with limited exceptions, and rely on transfers from states instead",u/RiverClear0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15n200o/cmv_a_constitutional_amendment_should_be_passed/,changemyview,"Basically the proposal is IRS should be abolished (*over time* or phased out, to avoid sudden disruptions to the economy) and instead the federal government should rely on *mandatory* contributions from the states, apportioned by their *population*. The federal government may continue to (directly) collect taxes via tariffs, against multinational corporations, foreigners with US income, and some other very limited and unusual cases (e.g. a US person who spends 
1/3 of the year living in each of three different states so their primary residence cannot be easily pinned down to any one state for that year). But the idea is the bulk of tax collection (esp. personal and corporate income taxes) should be shifted to states, gradually.

This will allow each state to dictate and hopefully experiment with vastly different tax policies (and even economic policy in general) and figure out what works best. Individuals will be encouraged to move to another state that has tax policy aligned with their values and financial goals (and needs).

Under this scheme, a few large states such as California and New York will likely have more money at state level, which they can decide to use towards more progressive social programs that are politically difficult (or even improbable) at the federal level today.

For various welfare programs that are currently federally funded and state administered, one option is to transfer the funding responsibility entirely to states (over time). Another option is to keep the funding at federal level, but allow certain very poor states (who already “rely” on federal aid today) to pay less according to some pre-defined formula.

It is by design that some state (especially the sparsely populated ones) can decide to effectively become a “tax haven” to attract rich people from other states or even *abroad*.  To prevent billionaires from immediately benefiting from this scheme, one option is to impose a temporary “exit tax” if they move to a tax haven state within a certain period (from the beginning of this scheme). An alternative is simply allow federal government to retain the power to tax 0.01% (or 0.1%) of the most wealthy individuals as they see fit, either via income tax or wealth tax.

Edit: I actually changed my view on whether the tax haven thing (*narrowly* defined as a state having very low *overall* tax) is a feature and if the apportionment should be strictly by population. I guess my current view is that I’d still prefer more taxation power to be transferred from fed to states so that they can design tax policy more suitable to the state’s residents, and then the money is transferred to the federal government according to some predefined formula that doesn’t significantly change the ratio of how much federal tax dollars is collected from each state today (but the difference is whether IRS collects it directly or states collect it and pass on to fed)"
1,2023-08-10,"CMV: When ordering pizza for a group, don’t get specialty pizzas or niche toppings",u/SANTAAAA__I_know_him,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15n27vp/cmv_when_ordering_pizza_for_a_group_dont_get/,changemyview,"Here’s the list of toppings you should choose from:

- Cheese

There, that’s it. Believe me, those will get eaten. Anything else requested should only be one side of a half-and-half, and make it clear if you request a topping, you’re stuck with it, you don’t get to eat any others until it’s gone. 

Now, lemme tell you what typically happens instead: a big variety of toppings in the name of “something for everyone” or requests. The popular toppings run out immediately, while these are ALWAYS the leftovers at the end that nobody wants: olives, green peppers and onions, tomatoes, some kind of unusual sauce like ranch or alfredo or nacho cheese, BBQ/buffalo chicken, Hawaiian, etc. You get the idea.

Yes, I know some people like these toppings, that’s why they were ordered in the first place, but they don’t eat 8 slices worth of it.

1,2023-08-10,CMV: Gender non-binary shouldn't be taken seriously,u/WildRover233,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15n2hqx/cmv_gender_nonbinary_shouldnt_be_taken_seriously/,changemyview,"I see jokes made, and I hear a lot in media about gender non-binary people, and how it's supposedly this crazy problem that is being taught to children in schools. Yet, I've never met somebody who is gender non-binary. I realize, too, that I don't think I've ever actually engaged with somebody who is gender non-binary online, nor was this stuff ever taught to me in school. They're just a kind of vague boogeyman to me. So, I'll lay out my view and then explain why I'm confident that it isn't possible for somebody to identify as a non gender. And, while I have doubts that I'll be able to change my mind entirely, I think that there's so much to explore that I'm entirely capable of being convinced that something isn't as cut and dry as I believe that it is:

To start, embryos, regardless of chromosomes, do not develop gonads until a protein in the Y chromosome becomes active which triggers the development of testes. Sometimes, this protein will attach to an X chromosome, and cause a person with XX chromosomes to devlop physically male-traits. Sometimes, the gene will remain inactive in a person with XY chromosomes, causing them to develop physically as females. While chromosome fusion doesn't always go smoothly, sexual reproduction will always exist between those two sexes. There is not a third, non sexual sex, that interferes with this process.

The next question becomes whether one can identify as a different sex. I think that the answer is a simple No; you are the sex that you are. Your genes do not change if you identify as having different genes. 

But, what about the brain? Is it possible for a brain to be feminine, yet stuck in a male body? I think that I can concede that the answer is perhaps yes, but not in a way that I feel transpeople would appreciate. Male brains and female brains, when massive data is pooled together, do have measurable differences. However, there is so much diversity in human brains, that this is always true regardless of what it is that is being compared-- different races pooled together will show differences to other races, handicaps to non handicaps, frycooks to electricians. It's difficult to compare sexual or racial differences in fingerprints, for instance, when everyone has a unique fingerprint. There is always going to be differences between different groups, because the individuals belonging to those groups being measured have entirely unique fingerprints of their own that they do not share with anyone else. So, too, with the brain. But that does not mean that sex does not affect the brain. I think that there is evidence to suggest that sex does affect, in some sort of fashion, a brain that is already entirely unique to begin with. And the end result can perhaps be imagined as an already entirely unique brain, that nobody else shares, along an X and a Y axis, that gets further moved alongside a Z-- male or female-- axis upon the development of gonads. Perhaps trans people have neurological characteristics that exist more towards that ""Z axis"" of their identified sex. It's so naturally impossible to measure, though.

This is where I fear that I will offend transsexual people. A mental illness is when your perception of reality does not match reality, and it causes a measurable decrease in quality of life as a result. I concede that it is possbile that trans people may perhaps have ""female"" or ""male"" brains, to the extent that we can categorize brains by sex, but that comes from a position where I also believe, that, if I were born female, then I would be a female. I do not ""feel"" like a man. I am a man. And to suggest otherwise is as ridiculous to me as ""feeling"" like I have blue eyes. I just... Do.

In that same vein of what constitutes something as a ""mental illness,"" I also believe that schizophrenics are legitimately perceiving their hallucinations, too. Nobody is lying about what they are experiencing. There is something unique going on inside of s trans person's head, and once technology is advanced enough, we may even be able to easily See it. But, in reality, a trans person is still the sex that they were born as, and their perception is irrelevant, and not something that I'm able to easily empathize with.

This all builds up to the idea of ""gender neutral."" My points, in order 1) I don't believe that you can identify as a sex that doesn't exist. 2) We do not know if gender even exists. And, 3) if gender does exist, a person with a gender that is different from their sex, fits the definition of mentally ill. (I realize that it is theoritically possible to have gender dysphoria without it being a mental illness. So, too, can you theoritically have hallucinations that do not negatively affect your quality of life. This is pendantic, and the DSM-5 stated when they made this change that they were influenced by discrimination against transsexuals. This technical change was not made to improve diagnostic ability, nor does it make any statement against whether most people with gender dysphoria are mentally ill. And, I don't say this with disdain on my end-- I have a family history of psychosis. I'm not using ""mentally ill"" as a backwards slap to delegitmize someone's genuinely perceived experience.)

As you can see, the chain of beliefs that eventually leads towards the idea of ""gender non-binary"", I do not believe is reasonable. Sex is an abstraction drawn from chromosome fusion, and it only describes sexual reproduction to a degree that is usually true for most people. Gender itself is an abstraction of sex. Gender dysphoria is an abstraction drawn from gender. Gender non binary is an abstraction drawn from gender dysphoria. There are so many loops. I don't understand, what even it means when somebody says that they do not identify as a gender, when there are only two genders to identify as, and you cannot identify as self-replicating. The entire concept just confuses me and brings me to a point of frustration. 

So, I'm open to where any of you believe that I am factually wrong, where it is you believe that I am misinterpreting something, where it is that I am missing something, or where it is that I'm just entirely failing."
1,2023-08-10,"CMV: The Democratic Party Would Be Near Unstoppable If It Focused Solely On Class And Economic Reality Instead Of Race, Gender & Sexual Orientation.",u/Donny-Bandish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15n3gql/cmv_the_democratic_party_would_be_near/,changemyview,"i’d like to preface this by saying that i am a black male who considers himself far to the left. being black, i’m obviously more than aware of racism and how prevalent it still remains in the united states. 

still, with that acknowledged, i also believe the constant tendency among democrats to trumpet our superficial differences creates divisions that has given the far right (republicans in the age of trump)  an opportunity to remain relevant in spite of it being bankrupt in terms of sound and practical solutions to the problems facing us today. 

human beings, at the end of the day, are fundamentally selfish; they’re concerned with their material condition and little more. whether it’s sating their hunger or having a comfy bed on which to rest, their material needs are what ranks at the top of their priorities in this capitalist society. 

the democrats clearly have some good ideas about how to improve the lives of americans. poll after poll shows that, contrary to what right wing media states. the american public is overwhelmingly partial to policy that can only be described as progressive. 

from universal healthcare to higher minimum wage, the public tilts to the left. 

but, in spite of this, the democrats pay only faint lip service to these policies. instead, most of its focus of late is on LGBTQ, immigration (which is really nothing more than an appeal to hispanics), and black lives matter. 

the vast majority of the public does not care about this cosmetic progressivism, issues that do nothing to increase the amount of money in their pockets. 

i believe the democrats would increase their governorships, state legislatures and national standing if they abandoned a focus on race and gender/sexual orientation, and focused only on class concerns. 

focusing only on policy that would improve the material reality of citizens would create a significant contrast that highlights how devoid republicans are of ideas that aren’t steeped in culture wars and how indebted they are to wealthy, corporate donors."

1,2023-08-10,CMV: Geopolitics is mostly determined by economic activity,u/JusticeWaifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15n4f04/cmv_geopolitics_is_mostly_determined_by_economic/,changemyview,"Recently, I’ve been checking out a lot of geopolitical videos and found that NATO, Russia, China and several middle eastern countries are in conflict with one another and it’s not exactly straightforward. One conflict, the sides might be drawn, but in another conflict 2 countries away, the sides may look slightly different, and then you have the Nigerian and Libyan Civil Wars which are both just absolute clusterfucks of chaos.

I’ve come to the view that Geopolitics is determined by economic activity. Example, Syria. ISIS came out of nowhere and took a good portion of Iraq and Syria for themselves, but also made an enemy out of basically the entire world, most notably including Russia, United States, Iran and Israel. Everyone did what they needed to do to bring ISIS down, but they did it in their own ways. Russia supported the Assad Regime in Syria because then Russia can use Syria as a naval base for power projection into the Mediterranean instead of being boxed into the Black Sea. This means if the Black Sea becomes a prison for Russia, Russia can still generate economic activity via Syria. United States supported the Kurds and launched Airstrikes against ISIS. A strong ISIS means weak American allies, which means less economic activity, less trade and ultimately it leads back to hurting America’s economy, so ISIS had to go and they chose the most effective option to annihilate ISIS. Interesting enough, America’s support of the Kurds would embolden them to launch terrorist attacks against Turkey, a member of NATO. If this was Turkey making the decisions, I seriously doubt this is the path they would have chosen because terrorism slows economic activity and that’s bad for Turkey. Iran decided they support Shi’ite militias in Iraq and Syria, their victory would give Iran friendly land connection to Israel and allow them to destroy their number 1 enemy via hybrid warfare. With Israel gone, Iran’s geopolitical position becomes much stronger and they can focus on Saudi Arabia, topple them, control the world’s largest supply of oil and effectively dominate the middle east.

Something as simple as the Syrian Civil War, every action a country has taken can be traced back to furthering economic opportunities or protecting their economic interests.

This draws me to case studies I am unsure about. The Cold War and World War 2. On the surface level, the Cold War was communist countries vs non communist countries, but a deeper look reveals many times NATO and Communist countries were allied with each other against fellow NATO and communist countries, Nigerian Civil War for instance. The Sino-Soviet split in particular is probably the most famous example of infighting amongst communist aligned states.

From an economic lense, the USSR had superior industry, technology and expertise and China had manpower, the USSR did not need any manpower but China needed Soviet expertise and technology. China couldn’t afford to look like a junior partner to the USSR, otherwise it would severely undermine economic opportunities to be had with other communist countries who might have considered China a good country to buy arms from. The USSR could not afford China to become independent of them, otherwise the USSR would look like the junior partner, that would undermine legitimacy, cause many communist states to revolt against them, war is expensive and will ultimately hurt economic activity. Prestige and appearance is important because other countries will look at them and decide which is better to do business with.

Again, I am still struggling to put together most Cold War era case studies, but it makes sense to me that even the cold war was all about which side can generate more economic activity.

World War 2 was basically Japan, USSR and Germany wanting to expand their empires so they can get the resources they need to generate economic activity and everyone else picked a side to avoid getting invaded, conquered and enslaved or to protect their own economic interests. At no point was this a good vs evil war. Propaganda would have you believe otherwise, but the horrors of the Holocaust never became real to either US/UK or USSR until they started liberating concentration camps. For the US, it was about keeping Britain alive because Britain will contain any threat that will come out of Europe. A threat from Europe could invade the US and war is expensive. For UK, it was all about keeping Germany from being a threat in Europe. A strong Germany can build a navy that can embargo the UK and make them poor. For USSR, they can’t generate economic activity if the Germans kill them all. For Japan, China was actually an economic rival so eliminating them was actually necessary, but grabbing the colonies for their natural resources could not have been bad at all. For Germany, conquering Europe would lead to a strong Germany and if Nazi Ideology was to be believed (it’s stupid, but assuming that I’m a German citizen that believes it’s reasonable), the resources of Europe will turn Germany into the strongest superpower the world has ever seen.

Once again, geopolitics is boiled down to how does one make money? This is a very recent view I have developed, so if I should be considering anything else, bring it to my attention, please and thank you."

Google is most certainly too big to remain unchecked, by American law and democratic culture, it's been far too large for a decade now. Google holds 91.9% market share as a search engine. US antitrust laws cap companies at 25% of market share. Google, as a company, is worth almost as much as the combined GDP of Canada and Black America. There is no way to feasibly regulate Google anymore, which means the company needs to stop existing. Control over information, over history is something no organization can be allowed to maintain in a free nation. 

Here are the viewpoints I am asking for you to challenge:
1). The best way to dismantle Google is to erase its brand and part out its infrastructure to smaller tech companies and to the government, rather than allowing the company to nominally break up into multiple Googles. 
2). The people who used to work for Google are dangerous and have the ability to utilize their skills in order to continue to manipulate whatever companies replace Google and something needs to be done to limit this threat."

On the other hand, having a benevolent authoritarian ruler could provide stability, even though it might limit political diversity. 

Democracy thrives when citizens can engage in open dialogue, compromise, and make informed decisions based on a collective vision. However, in a society divided along tribal lines, there's a risk that people might prioritize their tribal interests over the broader needs of the nation. This could hinder the formation of a cohesive and informed electorate, which is a cornerstone of a successful democratic system.

Moreover, education plays a crucial role in sustaining democracy. An educated population is more likely to critically assess information, engage in political discourse, and make informed choices during elections. In Somalia, where access to education is limited and tribal affiliations often take precedence."

I was very young when i discovered it and most people are. I’ve since made it out, but I would still say I’m involuntarily celibate but not an incel. I think that more and more men will be in my shoes if society continues it’s current course so I think that if we want to avoid incels our society, particularly parents and schools need to do a better job at preparing young men who will be seen as lesser options when they reach dating age.

I think a big part of incel psychology is the feeling of missing out on something you were lead to believe you were supposed to achieve. This comes from parents and media telling everyone that they’ll be married and find love. This isn’t the case. There’s a non-zero amount of men who never marry and never find love, if you are in this position it’s a very painful thing to realize if it’s been fed to you your entire life that one day you’ll be married and find love.

My suggestion would be for parents to stop pushing this idea on young men by the time they hit dating age (14 - 16) and start being honest with them. They know what they look like, they have some grasp of their child’s social skills. It should be very obvious. And parents should be able to be honest with their child and let them know if romantic relationships are a thing they should worry about. 

For me it was very obvious but my parents just continued to lie to me thinking it would help boost my confidence and I resent them for doing that instead of actually preparing me for what I inevitably realized.

If you’re trying to do something to prepare young men in schools, I would say a good approach is to pull all the young men to the side and make them aware of how statistically speaking some of them will not be able to attract a mate and normalize it. Make sure that they don’t blame women but simply blame the bad genetic hand they got. Of course teachers shouldn’t single people out but that make everyone aware and more comfortable with the possibility.

If you have a group of undesirable young men going through life already aware they won’t find romantic or sexual success, they frees them to devote time, money, and attention to other endeavors they can use that are more fulfilling."

If holders of political office give up all their rights, allowing for anything, including murder to be done to them (meaning you can kill even  the President and get away with no punishment at all) for the duration of their term (and they'll get it back once their term is over) , it would be an effective deterent for people who only seek power and would incentivize political office holders to satsify as many people as possible in their policies.

And what if it causes a glut of people willing to sign up to be in political office?

Well, conscript and randomly assign people from the general population from birth till death to stand for elections in the various political parties, meaning the political parties have their canidates assigned to them at random.

1,2023-08-10,CMV: Current teens are not more addicted to electronics than others and would still rather see their friends and go outside,u/sillystroll,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15nawkm/cmv_current_teens_are_not_more_addicted_to/,changemyview,"  
( my little sister wrote this ignore post history)  
This is mainly off my experiences as a current teen so I understand it may not be universal. I believe the majority of teens that are not anti social or extraordinarily introverted DO AND WOULD RATHER go outside or have fun with their friends rather than just going on their phone for hours.  
​  
Parenting  
Strict Parenting and the rise of helicopter parents has risen imo. In the past many people let their young kids walk to school and play outside for hours without much worry. Now parents struggle to even let teenagers go for a walk themselves. Personally, I and many people I know live in a VERY safe developed country/ suburb and aren’t allowed to go outside by ourselves. I wasn’t even allowed to go for a walk until I was 14 in my neighborhood. This seems to be a more common attitude due to parents feeling the world is more dangerous ( not saying the world is not more dangerous) kids are now over sheltered. Many parents have problems with their teens seeing their friends without tons of notice. I am not saying strict parenting has not existed in the past, but that it is becoming more common. If the teens are made to stay in their house, sure some may read, do crafts/ hobbies. But going on their phone may just be another thing to do. They also may be communicating to their friends on their phones as described in my next point  
​  
It is harder to make true friends  
Teens have had to go to many challenges socially such as not going to school for a while. Online friends have been more “common” and sometimes easier to maintain but yet again they are only able to communicate over text or call which is on thhe phone. In person friends are difficult to keep up expectantly with the helicopter parents many have. In addition, many are emotionally stunted from not seeing people for year+ and became shy or not really known how to act. In my experience all my friends ditched me( because they couldn’t be bothered) So I used my phone or read more. I sure as hell would’ve rather seen my friends than watched YouTube for hours.  
​  
Adults post on social media probably more. If you scroll through tiktok, most of the content with teens is literally WITH their friends dancing or whatnot. Adults may view it as stupid, but it’s just a fun activity, wathcing videos togehter is spending time similar to how kids used to watch tv togehter. Adults are the ones making content themselves. Adults are on their phones probably just as much if not more and it is odd that mainly teens are criticized for their electronic usuage  
​  
If you go to the beach or the park or the mall there are probably teens having tons of fun out there but they are still criticized for being loud ( I understand some need better manners) so they cannot really win in any situation"

I've never hurted no one neither did I view women as my enemies or something, I don't remember being misogynistic (surely I am sometimes but not more than normal people), I'm confused how do people assume once you have sex your opinion towards them should switch or change? 

Now, I'm from a traditional country, having a girlfriend is kinda taboo here, let alone being sexually active, and I've been called an Incel from time to time, although the literal meaning of it is not bad at all, the way that people associate you with ""Incel communities"" (which I'm familiar with and know how evil they are) and are very prejudice towards you because your condition is what really bothers me.

from poor training to institutional racism to lack of accountability, etc.. but what is usually missing is an acknoledgment of the role Hollywood has/had in it. 

Hollywood is full of movies where the cool cop has to bend the rules in order to save the day. It's one of the oldest and hardest to die Hollywood cliches:

A super cool/trigger happy cop that has to fight against crime but also against a burocratic system that stops him from doing what is needed (roughing up suspects or generally bend the rules), quite often we also get the classic ""badge and gun on my desk"" from his boss, until our hero is vindicated for his unortodox actions.  
Sometimes is not a cop but a CIA/FBI agent that must defeat a terrorist, there's no time for citizen rights or rule of law, being cool and good with fists is all it matters.

I'm not talking just about some quasi-fascist dirty harry or Charles Bronson movie, this kind of movies come in all shapes and forms, in fact most police/thriller movies have cops getting physical or being trigger happy or bending the rules, and they are always super likable heroes:   
Even ""culturally modern"" actors like Dwayne Johnson played that role several times, Mel Gibson, Will Smith, all the 90s action heroes, even some well known TV series have that, as well as some commedies (like Stasky and Hutch), etc...  the list is endless. 

I don't think it takes Freud to understand what a deep impact on cops view on policing that cultural cliche has.

So why isn't this seen as problematic? Hollywood has changed a lot of cliches during the years, no-one would accept nowadays a rappresentation of gay people or women like we had in some 80s movies, but somehow law inforcement outside the law is still accepted even in an age where police brutality (and it's causes) are under the spotlight.

I honestly think this is one of the main issues when it gets to police brutality and it's weird that is

And of course, as a person who supports them, I also understand other people who have the same point of view and who are over-protective with them.

I realized when I was with a group of my sister's friends, that sometimes progressive people idealize queer people. I heard specifically the phrase ""Until some decades ago, society believed that a man can only love a woman and a woman a man, but nowadays they realized that there are some people that are something more..."". Additionally, it happens that I know people that they really behave like all LGBTQ are super open-minded people, and they prefer to have friends from this group instead of straight people. Of course, no problem, anybody can make any friends they want.

Nevertheless, we should try to avoid misunderstandings. LGBTQ people, are just people, equal with us, and as stupid as anybody can be. The fact that they have some more ""unique"" sexual tastes does not make them smarter, or more open-minded, or better in any other way just because of that. The only claim that may be valid is that because they have been a repressed group of people, they have learned something about the dark side of society, and it may give some food for thinking to some of them. However, there are many repressed people in society and not only LGBTQ. Basically, it is a question who is not in some sense repressed and absolutely happy and free.

But now let's some facts:  


1. LGBTQ people can believe in astrology as any other person may do.
2. They may not read books like any other person do, and be completely uneducated.
3. They may be egoistic and do not care about other people or animals.
4. They may be either capitalists, or socialists, or nazis, or whatever they like.
5. They may be LGBTQ and at the same time racists or misogynists or whatever.
6. They may not respect other people's space, and behave like animals.
7. And anything else that any normal human being may do.

Why? Because they are just humans, and their unique sexual taste does not offer to them anything in an intellectual or moral manner.

Additionally, some people may support them, but they do not have necessarily to accept neutral gender or be called by other human beings like ""it"" just because of supporting them. Why? Just because, they do not like them, and it kills the language. And if you really, like this thing, tell me really, why you do not adapt it for your own name. Because I have seen people who support neutral gender, but very few people that like to be called ""chair"" or ""table"".

The conclusion is: yes, I support their rights, I support their fight against the conservative regime that wants them to be inferior, but always with some limits without idealizing them."
1,2023-08-10,CMV: Native Americans derserve little sympathy and often have themselves to blame for their quality of life.,u/Simple-Young6947,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15nfkhe/cmv_native_americans_derserve_little_sympathy_and/,changemyview,"I was reading a post about what ""city people"" should know about going to a reservation to buy marijuana:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/15mskrs/about\_going\_to\_reservations\_to\_buy\_weed/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/15mskrs/about_going_to_reservations_to_buy_weed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

and I felt a strange sense of frustration. I am making this post to \*honestly\* have my view changed and not juts be called ""racist"" or ""entitled"" or something similar. Being belittled for asking this question will not change my view.

Here is why I believe Native Americans derserve little sympathy and often have themselves to blame for their quality of life.

1. The image of nature-loving peaceful people is simply marketing/media. Based on repsonses to the above post, Reservation residents seem less interested in preserving nature than drinking and robbing visitors.
2. Many examples were given by car dealers of reservations residents buying cars and leaving them on the reservation so the cars could not get repossessed. This screams they would rather find ways to be unethical or break the law than conduct legitmate business.
3. People spoke about the high rates of domestic violence on reservations. If you're going to treat women and children like objects to abuse it just means you're an asshole. There is no exception. It doesn't matter if abuse happened to you, or you saw it growing up, etc. If you abuse people you're a piece of shit. You make your own choices in life. 
4. The outright racism towards white people. If a culture says ""get an education, get a job, and you'll find success"" and it works for 310 million people of varying races, and you actively dismiss that, it's a ""you"" problem."" You can't blame random white people whose grandparents immigrated in 1910 for your poor choices and lack of education. There was a telling comment about someone who graduated from college and moved back to the reservation only to be looked down upon for getting that education. If you idolize ignorance it's your own fault.
5. Having a police force for a separate \*race of people\* seems to result in corruption. I am not saying regular police depts are not corrupt, but from stories in this and other threads, the level of corruption seems to be rampant. Someone noted, ""As a white person I bet this feels like it did being black in the South in 1935."" Juts awful. You don't change hearts and minds about the plight of the Native American while being racist towards non-Natives. Being racist won't stop racism against you form others. It probably makes it worse.
6. Casino and other payouts that go to all tribal members often results in brand new cars sitting in front of dilapitated trailers. You can't complain about a poor economy and then waste your money on depreciating assets. If you get ""free money"" it is much wiser to invest that for yourself and your children than waste it. If financial advisors set up shop on the Reservation I bet they might help this cause.
7. Drinking. The non-stop drinking. If you complain your life sucks, everyone is violent, you waste money on cars, say your plight is eveyone else's fault, and drink all day, you're only fooling yourself. It's much easier to say ""This is THEIR fault"" than take actual responsibility for you own choices. I am a sober alcoholic. I know what alcohol addiction is and I've been sober 10 years. It sucked getting clean and I realized it was just a mask/self-medication for my anxiety. 
8. I work in real estate development and over my career ( I am 42) I've had the opportunity to do a few projects on reservations. We've declined every one for one simple reason: i the event of a dispute we did not trust the tribal courts to act fairly and impartially. Relates to 5 from above. We've had peers who did make investments and without fail the tribe was never at fault when it went to mediation or trial. The tribe always won, regardless of the merits of the case. It is pure corruption. Again, you can't act dishonestly and blame everyone else for your actions.

1,2023-08-10,CMV: People with severe mental health issues should be allowed to end their lives,u/gointhrou,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15nfzf7/cmv_people_with_severe_mental_health_issues/,changemyview,"I recently finished reading a book in which the author seems to suggest there CAN be a point at which a person with severe mental issues would benefit more from not existing anymore than continuing a torturous existence. I have been thinking about this book for the past week constantly.  
  
So, I asked three of my loved ones. One of my friends, a Psychologist; another one, a Philosopher; and my boyfriend, a Doctor. Surprisingly, all three of them had a different point of view. I found this fascinating.  
  
\-The Psychologist believes all suicide is preventable no matter what. Every single person can come back from the brink. They just need the right therapy with the right person to realize what they would be giving up, what they can live for, and how they can continue to lead a more fulfilling life. A severe mental condition is not a death sentence. Ever.  
  
\-The Philosopher went through the Existentialist route. If a person has lost sight of their purpose in life. If they have nothing to live for. If non-existence seems preferable, then that person should have the right to receive assistance in what they have decided is their preferred state of being, meaning death. Choosing life over death isn't a morally or ethically superior choice and the belief that it is comes from our Christian background as a society, as well as a selfish desire to keep those we love around because we don't want our own existence to be threatened by a loss of purpose following the loss of the one we love.  
  
\-Finally, the Doctor found a crossroads between the two previous positions. How can we know when a suicidal person can and would want to be saved if they were in a healthy mental state, and how can we know when that person has passed the point of no return? Meaning, is there a system we can create in which we can distinguish between a person that can and would want to be brought back and a person that can't and wouldn't want to? But more importantly, SHOULD we create such a system?  
  
The proposed solution by the Doctor was to administer every possible treatment to try to bring the person back as the Psychologist suggests, and if everything fails because that person is lost in the Absurd as the Philosopher suggests, then we can assist that person with what they would prefer. But the question still remains, is that ethical? To impose treatments on a person that, at the moment in which those treatments would be applied, does not want to be treated?

With all of that said, this is MY view, the one I'd like to be changed:

I think if a person has reached a point of mental instability in which they're completely convinced that death is the only way to escape their suffering, then the hypothetical of whether or not they can or would want to have their minds changed doesn't matter. At that moment, when they are actively taking the necessary steps to carry on their death, it doesn't matter to them that they can be cured, and forcing them to continue to exist once they have already embraced death isn't acceptable. We would be robbing that person of their freedom because we, ourselves, cannot conceive of the notion of desiring oblivion. It is selfish.

I believe life isn't necessarily preferable to death. But I feel trepidation at this thought. I'm scared to admit it out loud because I'm afraid of finding myself against the existential Absurd and realizing that I already came to the conclusion that death is the only logical step. Right in this very moment, I want to be alive, so the thought of embracing death is dreadful to me. But I also know I would not want to be forced to live with suffering so big that it actively makes me want to cease to exist. Even if it's only for a few months, after which I might change my mind.

Lastly, I want to share an extract that my Philosopher friend sent me. I don't think it has any substantial, factual weight, but it did move me emotionally (also, it's originally in Spanish, so it might not sound as beautiful after I translate it):

*""To know how to die (ars moriendi) is a substantial part of knowing how to live. As Socrates teaches us, it is not about living, but about living well, fighting for a good life, beautiful and virtuous. It's not about living unconditionally or in a way that is more or less humiliating, but only about living beautifully and virtuously. Otherwise, it's preferable to die, to give one's life away. In the same way, and on the contrary, it's not about dying defeated by the pure mechanical fatality of the body's mechanisms, but about dying well and beautifully, about giving oneself a beautiful death, a death virtuous and voluntary. Such as it is possible to live well and beautifully, and even more so, that this should be a duty for which one should fight, it is also possible and a moral duty to die virtuously and beautifully. For  if it is not possible to live well and beautifully, not possible to live energetically and intensely, not possible to live virtuously, then it is worth more to die, die beautifully, it would be better to die well.""* Gustavo Lambruschini, ""Saber morir (the Philosophy of Death)"""
1,2023-08-10,CMV: Relationship Norms/Culture are Weird and Make No Sense,u/Equal-Doc6047,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15nh668/cmv_relationship_normsculture_are_weird_and_make/,changemyview,"So for starters, I feel inexperienced because I've never been in a relationship and I'm pretty young. At first I used to assume I wanted one because a) everyone else kept looking for one and b) I never had many female friends when I was younger.

But now that I've gotten older, relationships and the culture surrounding them feel strange. Like there's so much of this idea of finding this perfect fit, and having to do all these small right moves just to appease other people and get them to like you, and it feels so petty. Not to mention, I've had friends in relationships before tell me things like ""it's hard for women and men to be platonic friends"" and ""oh women keep males as friends because they don't think they'll latch onto them, and therefore it's hard for two friends to get into a relationship"" and it honestly just turns me off. If these things are really true, then I'm just shocked and sad.

And let's talk about that too. Half the time when women and men are ""friendzoned"" they just end immediately, almost as if to just move on. There's this idea that women and men being friends is viewed as a bad thing and as someone with female friends, that sentiment kinda sucks. Even the idea of telling someone that it's a date is weird, like shouldn't it make sense for people to get to know each other and hang out without the intention of a relationship first? No one is ""leading you on"" if they agree to hang out but don't consider it a date (unless that's been done with multiple people or with the intention then sure), I'm pretty sure most people just start out not thinking of it like that.

Honestly relationship norms are just weird and at times it feels like playing a complex game that I don't wanna play."

Opponents of religion claim that religions teach unfalsifiable things and thus, have to be opposed, but we as a society not only accept unfalsifiable beliefs if they cause no harm, but even false ones. We believe that certain actors are still alive when they are dead. We believe sometimes that a certain sports team won more times than they actually did. We consistently misremember, and believe that we were doing X at a given time when in fact we were doing Y. There is absolutely no concerted effort from any community trying to correct these false beliefs. No one is going around fact-checking people on whether they know that Lakers and Celtics have the exact same number of NBA titles. This is because we as a society recognize that false beliefs that have no impact on anyone’s well-being are not always a negative. But religions often don’t even teach these sorts of false beliefs. They have unfalsifiable beliefs that are often completely harmless.


As far as harm goes, I think it’s pretty obvious that what makes the difference between a violent or oppressive religious person/community and a non violent one is extremism and lack of open mindedness. Now, once you concede that your “fight” isn’t against religion but against fundamentalism, you come to realize that there is nothing special about religious extremism. Extremism is present in all ideologies, whether left wing politics or right wing politics. So, the opposition shifts from being against religion to being a fight against extremism, and all people are supposed to be against all sorts of extremisms.

With the two main objections out of the way, I propose we recognize that religion itself is not a net negative on society."

1,2023-08-10,CMV: Lyrics are the least important aspect of music,u/SpaghettiLove2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15nlssu/cmv_lyrics_are_the_least_important_aspect_of_music/,changemyview,"The most important part of music is the actual music, i.e. things like sound design, timbre, melody, rhythm, harmony, mixing, effects, etc. Lyrics can certainly add value to a song, but they are ultimately just the icing on the cake.

There is tons of great music out there that don't even have any lyrics to speak of; for instance, lots of classical, jazz, and electronic music. People can still enjoy music where the vocalist is speaking a different language that the listener doesn't understand. Even without understanding what the vocalist is saying you can simply just vibe out to the music. There are genres like shoegaze where the vocals are basically just an ethereal melody added into the song and it's nearly impossible to clearly understand what they are saying. Even in a genre like hip hop where lyrics have historically been one of the primary features, many newer artists have gravitated towards more melodic vocals, catchy hooks, and ad libs, as opposed to focusing on storytelling.

Obviously lyrics can be the appeal for certain artists. Some examples that come to mind are Bob Dylan, Kendrick Lamar, MF DOOM, Neutral Milk Hotel, etc. These artists are often able to use lyrics to tell a story, deliver a certain message, make you feel a certain way, or create an image in the listeners head. While it's great that they are able to do this, that is ultimately a small slice of what music is able to do, and it is not a necessary part of what makes music. In other words, good lyrics can be nice, but it's ultimately just an optional feature."

I think that she should've left the cameramen alone as they were just doing their job. I think that her job is to win, which she did and she should go celebrate, and the people working the camera have the job of getting good shots and when they attempted that, the goal scorer yelled at them and basically said f you for doing your job. There are many iconic shots of players crying after big moments lost (Marchand after the 2019 Stanley Cup for example) and that the camera man was robbed of possibly getting one of those shots because the goal scorer didn't like it. I think it's unfair how the camera man is made out as an awful person and how the goal scorer is getting praise."

1,2023-08-10,CMV: Soccer Will Become the #1 Sport in America by 2050,u/NeoNoir5985,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15nny4c/cmv_soccer_will_become_the_1_sport_in_america_by/,changemyview,"I've been thinking a lot about the future of sports in America, and I'm convinced that soccer will eventually rise to the top spot by 2050. Here's my perspective on why this shift is inevitable:

**Cultural Ties and Demographics**: In most countries, soccer isn't just a sport; it's deeply ingrained in their culture. Unlike the US, where football, basketball, and baseball take precedence, other nations have generations growing up with soccer as a cultural staple. But times are changing, and the influx of immigrants, particularly from Latin American countries, is bringing their soccer passion to the US. Census data predicts that White Americans will no longer be the majority by 2045, with Hispanics being the largest black of the minority majority in America.  As these communities grow and their influence spreads, soccer's popularity will undoubtedly rise. The young Hispanic boys and girls entering the country, and being born in the country today will be major contributors to the nations move toward soccer fandom in the future. 

**Safety Concerns and Youth Participation**: The rising concerns about brain injuries in American football are making parents and young athletes reconsider their sport choices. This is where soccer comes in. With its lower risk of severe injuries, soccer becomes an attractive alternative. We're already seeing a shift in participation among high school-aged athletes away from American football https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2023-01-24/youth-football-participation-declining-amid-safety-concerns. As the awareness about safety grows, more and more youngsters and most importantly their parents will opt for other sports that have a lower risk of longe term injury. In the short term I believe that basketball will get a big influx of players because it’s easily accessible and it’s a sport that popular across the globe. But eventually soccer will be the number 1 sport.

**Changing Demographics**: As immigration continues, the demographics of the US are changing. With the Hispanic population becoming a larger part of our society, their love for soccer will have a significant impact. This cultural influence will extend beyond just the Latino community. Soccer's popularity will trickle into other groups, like African Americans, and those from the African diaspora, and those from the Caribbean. This diversity in soccer's fan base will accelerate its growth.

**National Team Success**: America likes nothing more than winning. The performance of the US Men's National Soccer Team will play a crucial role in cementing soccer's place as the top sport. Imagine if the team makes substantial progress in major international tournaments, maybe even clinching a World Cup victory. This achievement would not only captivate the nation but also establish soccer as a source of national pride and excitement. As the pool of top tier athletes widens to include those who are interested in making soccer a career, the talent level of the USMNT will grow. 

**Changing Times**: The younger generation is growing up in a different era. With the increasing availability of global media and the internet, exposure to international soccer leagues and stars is greater than ever. This exposure will naturally translate into a growing interest in playing and following soccer. A prime example of this is the buzz and excitement being generated by Lionel Messi joining the MLS after arguably one of the best World Cup Tournaments in modern history.

In conclusion, the blend of cultural shifts, safety concerns, changing demographics, and potential national team success makes soccer's rise to the #1 sport in America by 2050 highly likely. I'm open to hearing different perspectives, but this is where I stand. Change my view!

**TLDR**: Soccer's rise in the US is driven by shifting demographics, safety concerns, potential national team success, and changing cultural influences. It's likely to become the #1 sport by 2050. Change my view!"

1,2023-08-10,CMV: The military has a right to be as selective as it chooses when it comes to screening for medical conditions,u/NoDrama3756,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15nodtz/cmv_the_military_has_a_right_to_be_as_selective/,changemyview,"I am really lost at this point and looking for various opposed ideas.

The military has a right to disqualify certain medical conditions for service. Whether that be a history of medical disorders or physical limitations.

Here are a list of conditions ive seen ppl have a problem with;

Diabetes mellitus (either type), a history of gestational diabetes, a history of gout, high cholesterol or TAG, history of anemia even if known to be caused by nutritional deficiency, history of kidney stones that reoccur, irregular menstrual, history of irregular PAP smears, PCOS, being intersex, being menopausal, fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, history of more than one knee dislocation, history of stress fracture, excema/psoriasis/dermatitis that requires systemic steroid therapy or covers more than 10% of the body, severe acne, history of allergies that cause anaphylaxis, severe allergy to shellfish, peanuts, or treenuts, severe allergy to biting or stinging insects, restless leg syndrome, if you've had sleepwalking or night-terrors after the age of 13, Tourette's syndrome, if you have a history of headaches after having experienced a concussion, migraines, cluster headaches, ADHD if you've needed any accommodations (educational or work) after the age of 14 or you have taken medication for it within the past 2 years or have any other comorbid mental disorder or it's ever been documented to adversely impact your work or education, dyslexia, autism, depression if you ever needed more than 12 months of counseling or had symptoms or treatment in the last 3 years, any history of eating disorders even if in recovery, any history of suicidality, and any history of self-injury are all disqualifying, among many others.

And so on.

I have these believes because at times the military can lead people into austere deprived places around the world. Many medical resources wouldn't be there to treat underlying/ prior conditions.

If jo bob has a history of suicidal attempts when he becomes depressed ( deployments can be very sad places) he trys to hurt himself or others. He know is a person who cannot function in a immanent hostile area that is now taking up space and exhausting resources for those other warfighters.

Im looking for open discussion. And can i get some insight on why there is a big push for people with gender dysphoria to join the military.TY."

I once saw a video in which a gun owner (who had a sizable arsenal of assault rifles) lamented the fact that nobody ever broke into his house and that as a result he never got the chance to put his guns to use. 

There is definitely a vibe on social media where some gun owners make it subtly known (or, not so subtly) that they're itching for the moment when they can gun down some burglar, robber, mass shooter or whatnot and be legally in the clear for doing so.  I'm not sure if Kyle Rittenhouse or George Zimmerman were necessarily of this mindset, but some are definitely hoping to slay. And with songs like ""Try That in a Small Town,"" you can certainly sense something of a wish.

Obviously, not all, or even most, gun owners are like this. But I'm definitely getting the vibe from an uncomfortably large number of gun owners that they're lusting for the day when all the legal boxes are checked and they can un-alive someone with no repercussions. 

It's one thing to *buy* guns for self-defense. It's quite another to *hope* that you'll be in a self-defense situation someday."

I've seen plenty of people move to countries around the world without speaking any of their languages. But still, I don't think it's a good thing. I as a Kenyan would never move to China without learning at least a little bit of Chinese or move to Japan without learning a little bit of Japanese, so I feel like it should be the same the other way around 

I don't expect people to be 100% fluent in a language before moving to another country, but they should still make some attempt to learn the language beforehand.

So, I use their name or my friend to avoid us being both uncomfortable because unless you REALLY hate your name, it can be a good solution for both people to feel comfortable and to avoid any real problems. 

Another issue I have is the complete denial of your gender. Maybe I'm getting this part wrong and it's not gender denial but it just seems like it is. I feel there's a difference between feelings you are not a certain gender one day and proof that biologically you are a guy or a girl. So when someone says ""I'm not a guy"" or I'm not a girl"" you are, though. The proof you have is feelings. The prove I can give is science and nature and research and doctors and birth certificates,  chromosomes, and pulling your pants down. Can you prove you are not your gender with feelings?

1,2023-08-10,CMV: Queer theory supports pedophilia,u/DruidWonder,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15nrj95/cmv_queer_theory_supports_pedophilia/,changemyview,"No, I am not a member of the right wing. I'm actually a left leaning centrist/moderate. I'm also a gay man myself, FWIW. There has been so much polarized buzz in the media lately from right wing anti-child grooming groups + left wing TRAs and progressives that I decided to look into this issue on my own. I'm a health/medical researcher by trade so it wasn't that hard for me. I am not a queer studies/women's studies student, but I examined some of the ""founding literature"" of queer theory and found some disturbing trends. 

Foucault, the ""godfather"" of queer theory, argued for the eradication of age of consent laws down to infants. He argued that it is intolerable to assume that a minor is incapable of giving meaningful consent to sexual relations, in response to France making the age of consent 18, because he believed it discriminated against gay men. I actually love Foucault's treatise ""Biopolitics and Biopower,"" I wrote about it in university on a project related to the sexual revolution in China (Asian studies). I had no idea he was against age of consent laws at the time. 

Gayle Rubin, who authored the founding document of queer theory ""Thinking Sex,"" wrote: ""Like communists and homosexuals of the 1950s, boy-lovers are so stigmatized that it is difficult to find defenders of their civil liberties, let alone for their erotic orientation."" I would say about 50% of the contents of this document are in defense of pedophilia, specifically ""boy lovers"" aka men who love boys. She also compared pedophilia to a preference for spicy food. This is the founding document of queer theory.

Patrick Califia, author of ""Macho Sluts"" and ""Public Sex,"" another huge queer theory originator, wrote: ""Any child old enough to decide whether or not she or he wants to eat spinach, play with trucks, or wear shoes, is old enough to decide whether or not she wants to run around naked in the sun, masturbate, sit in someone's lap, or in engage in sexual activity."" He also wrote that that pedophiles should be more invested, not less, in children's lives

Judith Butler, the most famous queer theorist right now (but not a founder per se), said: ""So I keep adding this qualification: 'when incest is a violation,' suggesting that I think there may be occasions in which it is not. Why would I talk that way? Well, I do think that there are probably forms of incest that are not necessarily traumatic or which gain their traumatic character by virtue of the consciousness of social shame that they produce.""

I don't personally think that the original LGB movement had anything to do with these newer theories. Gays and lesbians never fought for ""rights for children,"" they fought for sexual and relationship liberation for grown adults. The child aspect seems to be a TQ+ thing, originating from queer theory, which says that children can consent and know their sexuality/gender identity before maturity (or even puberty). 

It's my view then that it's not -phobic in any sense of the word to say that the current progressive movement contains child grooming and opens the door for pedophilia, since the social aspect of the movement is mainly rooted in post-structuralism (gender and social deconstructionism, critical race theory, etc.), the TQ+ aspect of which is rooted in queer theory.

But to say that the republicans act better towards men just because they’re anti feminists is a ludicrous statement.

1. Conservatives support unnecessary wars- 

Men are the primary victims of warmongering conservatives (think Bush and the Middle East). Most liberals don’t want to send men to war unless necessary.

2. Conservatives support militarizing police officers and often deny issues with police brutality-

The majority of police brutality victims are men. Conservatives seem to deny that their is a problem with police brutality and often blame the victim. To add insult to injury the insist on militarization of our already corrupt police. Liberals do not want to do this.

3. Conservatives often shame and criticize men who are less masculine and that don’t conform to gender roles-

Liberals do not care if a man is a “man’s man” or a “fem boy”. They are generally accepting regardless. But conservatives love to mock other men who come short of masculinity (call them soyboys, liberal sissy’s, etc).

4. Conservatives have a “bootstrap mentality” in which they don’t believe problems are systemic. 

They tell men that everything that happens to them is their fault and they have to fix it with no help. This is why conservatives don’t support social programs that help people but liberals do. Liberals understand that it’s not as simple as “do it yourself”. Liberals want these social programs to help men and women. 

There is more but I could be here all day. Conservatives perpetuate more misandrist ideas than liberals and liberals do care more about men’s issues. I will admit that women suffer from similar issues as men, but the point is that just because republicans are anti feminists doesn’t mean they are also pro male. I am open to having this idea challenged :)"

It seems obvious but I think there's more to it. Ever seen videos of someone doing an adventurous feat and commenters writing ""white people shit"". Yeah, it's because white people enjoy financial and social privilege in the US, they thus have little financial and social anxiety, and are more likely to be adventurous bc of it. Number one trait to know whether someone comes from an upper or lower class background? It's their anxiety. Some of my lower income tenants are extremely anxious for even the slightest inconvenience. Upper income people enjoy the luxury of not having learned anxiety in its harmful form while growing up. They do stuff, get injured if need be, and move on.  


  
And the social component is as equally important as the financial. The privilege of not getting anxious if a girl you are flirting with talks back? Of having social/romantic privilege, and knowing that you can get your social/romantic/sexual fantasies satisfied (even if not totally fulfilled). Think Chuck Bass in Gossip Girl. Of course it can make you a douchebag if you so choose, but it also gives you the freedom and privilege to enjoy a life without social fears.Just had these thoughts as I evaluate how I want to live my life.

This has basis as skulls and crossbones have been associated with death and having it be plastered onto a substance indicates that the substance is toxic if ingested/exposed to humans, so this is used to warn people away.

Unfortunately....thanks to pop culture, children are likely to associate the skulls and crossbones symbol with pirates, leading to cases where children consume poisonous substances due to them mistakenly associating that substance with pirates, resulting in them dying at worst or having a very unpleasant time (getting your stomach pumped sucks).

In comparison, the scowling face of Mr Yuk is better for warning people (especially children) as it better communicates the danger of exposure/ingestion to toxic substances with the scowling face indicating a very unpleasant experience upon exposure/ingestion. Compare this to the skull and crossbones which could be mistaken as associated with pirates and could lead to pretty nasty cases of children consuming/exposing themselves to chemical substances. Moreover, Mr Yuk's scowl would be recognized internationally across all language barriers, making it suitable as an international symbol for warning people about toxic substances.

Otherwise it’s a huge accomplishment.,u/KillaHotel,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15nui9t/cmv_having_sex_is_only_not_a_huge_accomplishment/,changemyview,"
Context, I’m saying this as a male who is heterosexual who is also a virgin at 22, so I’m speaking from this perspective.

Also, I’d be willing to concede that this is a much greater achievement for men  than women.

I see a lot of people minimize the accomplishment that is losing your virginity or being able to have sex/physical intimacy in whatever way. They say that “it’s just sex, it’s not that big of a deal”. I feel that in my experience I have never heard that said by someone who hadnt already had a lot of sex or had no issue finding sec partners.

Heterosexual sexual/romantic interactions between two people are incredibly complicated. Men and women often communicate differently and value different things. A lot of dating/hooking up is vibe based. There is a lot of mental mathematics based on the little information you get when interacting with a woman. As a male you are also competeing with every other guy who is interested in her in her social circle, if you’re in a public meet up place, you will be competeing with every guy in the area. It’s hard, unless you are exceptionally physically attractive and have a no shortage of female attention.

Physical attractiveness and chemistrynranks highest in importance in navigating the early stages so if you are average or below, especially as a man, it becomes exponentially more difficult to find someone who wants to have sex with you. Sexual chemistry and physical attraction are not things that can be controlled. They are not obvious in the opposite party it can be hard to read. Learning how to do so is difficult and requires a lot of work and social growth in order to do so.

As my title says, the people that view typically view sex as not a big deal are the people who have easy access to sex. Of course people who are asexual also don’t care about sex, but that’s such a small group I don’t think it’s relevant.

So when something comes easy to you and you don’t have to work for it as hard, you value it less. If you were born wealthy and have only ever known wealth, blowing 50 bucks on something frivolous isn’t gonna be seen as a big of a deal. Getting a 400 dollar paycheck isn’t going to be seen as an accomplishment.

By the same logic, if you were one of those guys that had multiple sex partners before you eve graduated high school or had tons of casual sex in college, you won’t view sex as an achievement. Just something you do. I would argue this goes as far as to people who have been in relationships for a long time. They have a pretty regular access to sex, and as a result it’s no big deal to them."

Basically title. 

I've always loved the movie going experience, but the biggest issue remains needing to either 1) use the bathroom, 2) refill popcorn, snacks, or soda, or 3) just generally stretching from sitting so long, halfway through a longer movie

Movies in movie theaters should have intermissions halfway through a movie, particularly if it's longer than, say, 2 hours. Watching a 3 hour movie like Avatar The Way of Water it's damn near impossible to not sneak out for a bathroom break during a less important scene. Even if you plan ahead and try to clear your bladder just before it starts its pretty likely, especially if you're older, you'll still need to go an hour into  the movie. Hell there's even an app that let's you know when it's safe to run to the bathroom and you won't miss much in the movie

Theater performances have intermissions for this reason and I see no reason movie theaters can't take notes. I see zero downsides to having a 10-15 minute intermission during movies so people can empty their bladder and refill their popcorn. 

Perhaps the only issue I can see from this is people being on their phones during the intermission and then needing the obligatory reminder to put phones in airplane mode when the movie resumes, but that already happens before the movie so not a big deal for an easy reminder.

1. Friendly and humble men with muscles get respect by other men. 

2. Some women love muscular men. 

3. Women love men who are respected by other men. It’s scream power or just a decent person in general. 

Therefore, women love muscular men either directly through second premise or indirectly through the third premise.

Normal size muscular man: man with muscle but not too bulky like heavyweight champion or anything like that. But just a man with define and sharp muscle, but not too bulky.

Now, I’m only talking about humble and friendly men because if you’re not a humble and friendly men, you will be dislike by everyone regardless of whether you have muscle or not. 

The premise of course only applies to general case. Apply to majority of the population, of course there will be some women who love men who gain no respect from other, but that is the exception. 

I’m making this post because I kept seeing people trying to demotivate others by saying that Women don’t love men with muscle and stuff like that. I would like to turn around and ask “does having no muscle gonna make women love you?” , it doesn’t either. But at least with muscle, it increases the odd through the argument above."

Recruited locally in the valleys of the Alps they were the trained in mountain warfare and based in locations along the Alpine arch. The regiments were numbered 1 to 8 from West to East and the regular battalions named for the locations of their depots, which served as training centers and for materiel storage. These were organized in standard TO&E of:

Regimental HQ
Three mountain infantry battalions
Support elements assigned to HQ
Depot elements
After the raising of the Belluno battalion on 1 October 1910 the Alpini numbered 79 companies organized in 26 battalions. Each battalion, with the exception of the Verona, consisted of three Alpini companies of one captain, four lieutenants and 250 other ranks. The Verona was the only battalion to field four companies.[1]

After the outbreak of World War I in 1914 an additional 38 Alpini companies, numbered from 80 to 117, were raised from men, who had completed their military service in the preceding four years (i.e. completed it between 1910 and 1914). These companies were used to augment the regular battalions. Starting in early January 1915 each Alpini battalion activated a reserve battalion. Named after a valley (in Italian: Val or Valle) located near the regular battalion's depot, these Valle battalions were filled with men, who had completed their military service at least four years, but not more than 11 years earlier (i.e. completed it between 1911 and 1904). The companies of the Valle battalions were numbered from 201 to 281, with the numbers 227, 233, 237, 271, and 273 never assigned to a company (227th originally meant for the Val Pellice, but received the 224th Company instead; 233rd originally meant for the Val Dora, but received the 3rd Company instead; 271st originally meant for the Val Fella, but received the 8th Company instead)"

Digital ones specifically. I'd go far enough and say all digital property should be legal to copy and manipulate at will, free of copyright bullshit. Music, blueprints, patents, everything. But this CMV is focusing one specific piece of the argument:

There is no argument that anyone should have a right to charge money for PDFs of books, which doesn't also invalidate public libraries. The principles are the same. Owning a ""pirated"" PDF is actually \*less\* disruptive to other readers than borrowing a physical book, because no one else can read the physical book you borrow from a library. If you think that downloading ""stolen"" copies of PDFs that are sold for money on the Kindle store is theft, then how do you concede that a library isn't also theft?

"">The initial buyer paid for the book. Then they share it. This is equally true for libraries and PDF pirates.  
  
The library doesn't just pay the store prize to read it themselves. They pay the prize for distributors. They buy the rights to distribute the books. Analogous to radio stations. Radio stations don't just by a song for 1$ and then play them to their audience. They buy a license, which allows them to distribute the song further.""

Given that the current usage case is descriptive rather than derogatory or slurring, I don't see how the use can be racist. Even if someone says ""I don't like JPRGs"" or ""JRPGs are rubbish"" etc, they most likely aren't saying that because they come from Japan, but because JRPGs have specific game mechanics and design elements that they don't like/don't enjoy. 

If it were to become the case that language and culture shifts and the meaning moves, I could see how JRPG could theoretically become a racist term, but I don't see how it is right now.

Obviously there might be isolated cases where it is being used as a racist term, but in the industry generally and as an industry term I don't see the issue. Would love to know more and see if my view can be swayed."
1,2023-08-11,CMV: Inches and feet are superior to meters and centimeters,u/cbstecher,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15o9de4/cmv_inches_and_feet_are_superior_to_meters_and/,changemyview,"Units of measurement of any kind are ultimately always going to be arbitrary (unless you use the planck length, I guess). But I can say will total conviction that I believe that inches and feet are better in 90% of cases than meters and centimeters. My argument is threefold:

1. Inches and feet convert into each other by a factor of 12, which is a highly composite number (meaning you can divide it by a lot of numbers without having to split it into fractions). The metric system, however, is based on factors of 10, which is not highly composite. In the end, seeing as how everyone (including metric system users) use 12 hours on a clock and 12 months in a year, I don't see why there would be any resistance to 12 inches in a foot. It's just easier to divide by.
2. Inches and feet work on a more human scale than centimeters and meters. Centimeters are small, and meters are huge. If I want to measure, for instance, a pencil, I could say it's 8"" long. That's a nice, manageable number. My monkey brain can imagine 8 things. If I use centimenters, though, then it's 20cm. My monkey brain can't imagine 20 things. What if I measure the height of a person? Well, the average height for a male is 5'9"". Again, this pleases the monkey brain, because it can imagine 5 things and 9 things. But with metric? That's 1.75m (or 175cm). The measurement with meters is such a small number that we have to use fractions to the hundredths place to be precise, but the measurement with cm uses the number 175. I cannot imagine 175 things. Hence, inches and feet are just better for human-scaled stuff, and most people spend most of their lives working on that scale.
3. It's *French*.

EDIT: For anyone who wants a more detailed set of parameters for a defeasibility test, I'll copy a comment I made outlining that here:

I would outline two parameters to counter my primary reasons for preferring inches to meters (the reason about metric being French is obviously a joke).

Regarding the fact that 12 is a more highly composite than 10 (or 100, in CENTImeters' case), 10 would have to be shown to exhibit other benefits that outweigh divisibility. Simple multiplication is a potential avenue here (due to most languages' base-10 counting system), although I personally value easy division over easy multiplication (you can't divide 10 by 3, for instance, without incurring a decimal with an infinitely repeating string of 3s). Whatever benefits are outlined here, I suspect they may also rebuke months and hours being 12 as well. In that case, I expect the argument to include an ironclad caveat to explain why months and hours should be unaffected by the same argument, or for the person presenting the argument to concede and advocate for a 10 month year and a 10 hour clock (with 100 minute hours, of course - this was originally envisioned to be part of the metric system, after all).

Regarding the fact that inches and feet are easier for humans to work with, I would be most compelled by evidence suggesting that I am underestimating how useful meters are to people who are not engineers or scientists. I know the imperial system has meters, but those are usually only used to measure American Football fields (also, I am not defending the imperial system as a whole. I am deliberately cherry-picking the inch/foot dynamic as a piece of a wider system that I admit is otherwise entirely inconsistent).  


EDIT 2: I've noticed some recurring rebuttals that aren't very convincing, and they're starting to bog down some of the more compelling conversions. I'm just going to outlines the three main bad arguments I keep seeing so that I can give more attention to the good ones.

1. ""But metric is easier to multiply by because it uses multiples of 10""  
This is true, if you're multiplying by 10 itself. In that case, you need only move the decimal point over, and boom! You've got your multiplied number. But I value inches and feet not because of multiplication, but because of division. You cannot divide 100 by 3 or 6 and get a whole number. In all fairness, you can't divide 12 by 5 either, but 12 has more divisors. I want to be really clear about this: I value divisors more than multipliers.
2. ""You can't just talk about inches and feet. You have to consider the entirety of the imperial system too.""  
No I don't. My initial post did not use the term ""imperial system"" at all. I am not defending the imperial system. I am deliberately cherry-picking the part I think it does well - better than the metric system even - because the imperial system, by its nature, is just a bunch of modular measurement types glued together. In fact, that is precisely why it makes no sense. All I'm doing is pulling out the one module and spotlighting it. The metric system, on the other hand, is nothing like this (by design). Everything in the metric system connects back to the meter, so you can't just rip something out (perhaps this is an argument for the imperial system, since you can do whatever the hell you want with it).
3. ""You prefer feet and inches because you're used to them.""  
Yes, I do, but this goes both ways. Metric-users prefer metric because they're used to it, because no matter how you choose to measure something, whatever you chose is completely arbitrary. Why is a meter a meter? Well, it's 1/40,000,000 of the earth's circumference. Why is that a significant number? It's not. French revolutionaries just decided they liked it and now it's considered logical, even though there's there's nothing about nature to suggest that's the ""right"" way to measure something. Imperial and metric are equals on this one, I'm afraid."

I do think it should only be allowed for consenting adults. I will try to provide some insight on common objections.

1. ""No sane person would consent to this, because you have to be insane to consent to this"" Any variation of that is circular reasoning and using the action as the diagnosis for mental illness. Instead you need to explain why its a symptom of mental illness. 

2. ""risk of disease"" The most common disease people talk about is Kuru, however it is believed to only be able to be transmitted if one consumed a brain with CJD, CJD can be checked for before the consumption of the human. There are many examples of people eating human meat without developing Kuru or other diseases, The donor party and ""cannibal island"" are some of the more famous examples. There is also the risk of blood borne illnesses through cannibalism, that too however can be tested for (similar to testing blood for donation).

3. ""how would it even work?"" Im not in the business of implementing laws but I assume it could be handled through the legal system. I dont think its needed but I assume it would be insisted that they have to go through a psychiatrist first to evaluate mental health, followed by tests to check for diseases in the body. 

If there are other objections or problems with those ones please let me hear them.

Its important to note that in order to have another person eat a part of you it does not necessarily mean you have to die. You could have someone go through that whole process for just having someone eat a toe or finger or inch of skin. "
1,2023-08-11,"CMV: Until reliable public transportation is readily available across the entire USA, the US should have an affordable state option for car insurance.",u/TheOfficialSlimber,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15oa8is/cmv_until_reliable_public_transportation_is/,changemyview,"(Sorry if this is written weirdly)

I believe that car insurance should have a public option until the United States has nationwide reliable public transportation.

Car insurance, especially for those under 25, is ridiculously expensive, especially if you live in a state like I do (Michigan). Add on the price gouging that many businesses are doing with basic necessities now, plus adding on stagnant wages, living expenses have become unaffordable for many, including car insurance. Car insurance is mandatory to be able to drive in most states, and in most areas within the US, you need to be able to transport yourself to work with a car. All of these factors have influenced my opinion.

***I want to make some points against some common arguments I’ve seen disputing the idea of a public option for car insurance.***
======================================

I’ve seen many argue that driving is a privilege, which I could agree to an extent with the fact that you are required to have a drivers license in order to drive. HOWEVER, I would also argue that it is very privileged for someone to dismiss people with that argument in a country like the US, that lacks reliable public transportation outside of it’s biggest cities, and holds most economic opportunities behind being able to transport yourself. For most within our current system, driving is a necessity unless you live within a city like New York. This argument would have more of a leg to stand on if we had public transportation.

Now some may argue that people should just “move” to one of these bigger cities where everything is walkable and/or that have public transportation, but this argument lacks a lot of sense. If you cannot afford a monthly car insurance payment, how are you going to afford to live in a bigger city? How will you afford the moving costs to a bigger city? Housing within major cities is not cheap, and even if it were, it’s not like you can just pickup and move for free.

I’ve seen people argue that insurance companies would have trouble competing against a government ran system. That may be very well true, but I don’t see how that’s bad. In fact, I find that as more of a concession that the for-profit car insurance system is unnecessarily more expensive and people would be better off without it.

Many of the arguments I’ve seen attempt to dismiss those under 25 is that they should just go under their parent’s plan. That’s a great option for those with that luxury, but we don’t all have that option. Not everyone can run to Mommy and Daddy. Some of us have dead parents, some of us have deadbeat parents, some of us (myself included) have both. Like I said, it’s a great luxury if you have the option. One of my best friend’s is under his parent’s plan and pays nearly $100 less than I do with a literal DUI/crash that he got under a year ago. But yeah, we don’t all have parents that are useful or ever have been useful."
1,2023-08-11,CMV: Nagisaki was the unluckiest Japanese City in WW2,u/FerdinandTheGiant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15oaer1/cmv_nagisaki_was_the_unluckiest_japanese_city_in/,changemyview,"So to preface, I know that unluckiness is somewhat subjective, however I feel as though even with that, it’s still the case that Nagisaki was the most unlucky city. 

The reasoning is the following: 

#It being a nuclear target

This may not seem like something extremely unlucky at first considering many cities were possible targets and other cities were hit, but Nagisaki’s placement was rather last minute. The first time Nagisaki was considered by the Atomic Bombing Committee was in their first meeting (April 27th), however it was taken off of the suggested list and never reappeared in any bombing committee meeting after. So your probably wondering how it ended up as a target. Well, it was added to the finalized bombing order **1 day before in black ink**. According to Groves after the war he was not entirely sure how Nagisaki worked its way into the picture, however it somehow did. Unlucky.

#August 9th and Warnings

The atomic bomb dropped on August 9th was originally not scheduled for that date. The planned drop was the 11th which was moved to the 10th which was moved to the 9th, all to avoid weather. Had these dates not have shifted, Nagisaki likely wouldn’t have been nuked. Even if it had, Nagisaki was scheduled to receive warning leaflets for the upcoming attack and received them on the 10th (very unlucky) but since they got hit on the 9th it didn’t matter. 

#Bad Weather Anyways 

The original target for the August 9th plutonium device known as Fat-man, was not scheduled to hit Nagisaki. Nagisaki was serving as the secondary target to Kokura which ended up being covered in clouds or possibly smoke. This meant that Nagisaki was the next location and originally it to was too cloudy, **however** the pilot would claim to have seen an opening in the clouds and bombed the city. Had there not been bad weather or an unlucky opening (which could be a lie) Nagisaki likely wouldn’t have been bombed."

So, my opinion derives only from what little I know, and don't know, about the experiences of people with hearing loss.

That said, in a world where the monsters presented are attracted to and destroy anything that makes sound, it stands to reason that a person who cannot hear sound, or more precisely, does not have significant experience in what it means to make sound is specifically ill suited to adapt to a world where making sound potentially gets you killed. It's the opposite of a blind person in a movie universe like Birdbox, where seeing things get you killed (or to kill yourself), being unable to see makes you impervious to the monster threat.

I find it hard to believe that Regan, who is presented as having profound hearing loss in both ears in the film (and is apparently also deaf in real life), would have the lived experiences required to know what movements and interactions with the world around her actually produce sounds and to what degree. Would she know what it feels like when a door squeaks or a floor creaks? Or the difference in sound between stepping on dried leaves versus wet ones? Or, and this is from the movie, the sound you make when running through a corn field? It would seem to me that she is likely to, almost certainly inadvertently, make a ton of noise moving through the world simply because she doesn't really know what makes sound or have the benefit of the real-time feedback of that sound.

Now, she does appear to have a cochlear implant. But, the film presents that as mostly inoperable, at least in the context of its intended use. She keeps it on most of the time but it doesn't appear to give her the ability to experience much of the sound around her. But, that does mean that, at some point, it did work. Which, then, would mean that she does have *some* experience with sound. I can't know for sure if that experience is enough to be able to navigate the universe as constructed but I doubt it.

I will say that the family's experience with a deaf daughter, particularly being fluent in ASL, was a life saver for them and really gave them an advantage.

EDIT: I don't think ive been clear on the level of friendship I'm referring to. There are many women in my life who I am 'friends' with, but thats a different level to what I'm talking about in this post. In my anecdotal situation, I met a group of people I really clicked with and saw them as people I'd grow close to and remain close friends for years to come. Every single one of them expressed romantic interest and the group blew apart because of it. 

Yeah, you can be 'friends' with a girl. Speak every now and them, be friendly, go out sometimes, etc. but im referring to the level of closeness that has you speaking for hours every day, being able to go out until late without things getting weird. Thats what I wanted. I had feelings at one point but they went away because she had a bf and I saw it as a waste of energy trying to insert myself, and I honestly had way too much respect for her to put her in an uncomfortable position. But she is the one who ended up making it weird by confessing to being in love with me. And thats my point; there are many well meaning people out there who are looking for genuine friendships, but the likelihood of *both* parties having no interest beyond friendship is low.

And I'm not saying opposite genders *cannot* be friends full stop, I'm saying that they cant be friends without some feelings being developed somewhere along the way.

\----------------------

My sisters warned me against being just friends with girls, and I ignored them, thinking surely people can just be friends? Turns out I was wrong.

I know my experience is anecdotal, but it has shifted my thinking towards the ""men and women cannot be just friends"" mindset, and I'm interested in hearing other peoples stories.

I think it's just a biological reality that two reasonably attractive people of the same sexuality are attracted to each other. Not in the sense of ""I wanna tear their clothes off right now"", but more ""I would if the offer was there"" if that makes sense.

In my personal experience over the past year, I kept on top of my feelings because she had a bf, and I could actually say I was happy with just being friends. But that didn't mean I wouldn't be open to the idea of getting with her. I know it sounds selfish, but if someone is attractive and has a good personality, why wouldn't I be open to the idea? Obviously I didn't act on it at the time, because it's wrong, but the feelings were there regardless of how much I hid them.

Turns out I wasn't alone in those feelings, she drunkenly confessed the same and it made me realise that we're as bad as each other. Our 'friendship' did make a lot more sense though, so I'm sort of glad in a way that we talked about it properly. Her stance is the same: feelings are normal when you spend so much time with someone who is your type. My type is someone who's healthy and I get along with. That is a very wide net.

We were a friend group from work. There was me (a straight guy), another guy (homosexual), and two girls. We were all 'friends', but the guy confessed to liking me, one of the girls is who I'm in a situationship with now, and the other girl has given hints and stopped speaking to me when she found out I was involved with the first girl. The group quickly blew apart and I'm looked at as the reason for that.

When I see friendships of opposite genders, it's usually either a case of something deeper going on behind the scenes, or it's a case of either party not being attracted to the other. In the latter, I don't want to say it's usually ugly people, but idk....

I just find it difficult to imagine two reasonably attractive people who get along to be 'just' friends. Obviously you can hide your feelings so it looks that way on the outside, but it doesn't change anything.

Obviously this is just one side of the picture though and I'm not firm in my stance, but this entire experience has just been draining and I don't want to involve myself with a girl as 'friends' again. Too much drama."

1,2023-08-11,CMV: Peanut butter containers should be flatter and wider (like a tray) instead of a jar,u/Nova-Prospekt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15ocw9k/cmv_peanut_butter_containers_should_be_flatter/,changemyview,"I think everyone knows the feeling when your jar of peanut butter (or similar spreadable food item) is getting low. You try to scoop the last 1/3 from the bottom, but reaching into the jar causes the utensil you're using to scrape against the sides of the opening and get peanut butter all over the handle of the utensil and your hand. *Dat make a big mess.* Sometimes it is incredibly difficult to completely get all of the peanut butter out of the jar.

If the container was flat and wide, you would be able to access all of the peanut butter easily and without having your utensil touch the edges of the container.

Pros

- Less mess when scooping

- Easily stackable for high capacity storage or on grocery store shelf
- more surface area of ""untouched"" peanut butter for smoother scooping experience 

Cons

- wider frame prevents storage in narrow places
- would require a snap on lid instead of a screw lid (is that a con?)
- potentially would require slightly more plastic to manufacture a container in this style that holds the same amount of PB.

I think the pros outweigh the basically non existent cons. Let me know what you think.

Edit: formatting on mobile

Edit: after going through the responses, I have had my view altered. Many people are suggesting squeeze tube technology, which would definitely allow for fewer messes to be created with the utensil. It has also been pointed out that my idea for a flat, tray-like container would not be as structurally viable as a cylindrical container, and that it would require more materials to support such a structure than the convenience is worth. Plus, in cases of pb with liquid oil ontop, a flay tray is not good for stirring or storing that type of peanut butter.

So far, my favorite suggestion is one from a post by u/browster  which was deleted by the mod, and featured a picture neat bowl-like container that had a sturdy looking snap-on lid. [Here is the image](https://i5.peapod.com/c/9I/9ID8Y.png) (Thank you u/ab7af). This container had an opening that was the widest part of the container which allowed for easy access to the peanut butter inside, as well as the structural integrity of a vaguely cylindrical shape. I prefer to scoop out peanut butter rather than squeezing it out, so that is my choice of optimal jar replacement.

Thank you for the responses"

The hypothetical is that if I see a burning building or any other danger scenario, and I see a random
animal that needs help vs. a random human that needs help, if I am given no information about the person, I will always save the human. 

My logic here is based on a few things. Person I value human life over animal life. I would never eat a human, however I frequently eat animals. I charter fish occasionally and eat what I catch. It’s a predator prey relationship. I also cannot empathize with most animals in the same level that I can with humans. 

The argument was proposed that there could be a chance the person is a bad person. It’s of my belief that most humans aren’t “bad” enough to the point where they deserve to die. I think worst people are kinda selfish which I don’t think is necessarily bad. I am anti penalty in 99.99% of cases. Because of this I am not willing to take the risk of a good person, or even a just okay person being killed just to save an animal.

The last point I heard was to say if it’s my personal pet. Even then, I could not see myself choosing my own pet over a human life."

I have some savings such that I can buy a lot of the experiences I've always wanted while having enough to live a decent if relatively lower quality of life post-60 (may have to move to LCOL area) when statistically I won't be able to do all that stuff.

A fair number of people encounter health problems in their 50s such that when they retire they've missed their chance to buy/do the things they've always wanted (think rock climbing or visiting another country).  To me that feels like life put one over on them.  I'd rather seize what's ""assured"" today (from 45-55) and let my 55-60+ year old self figure out what the heck to do if he has great health but not much money at that point.

I have seen the difference in mental and physical acuity between 30 and 40 (at least for myself) and just don't see the point of having cushions of money at 60 to join the golf club or go on cruises.  When I don't have as much mobility and good vision is a cruise that much more enjoyable than a long walk in nature, visiting a friend, or volunteering (which are free).

edit:  Let's reduce the problem to this.  Suppose you had a fund that would cover kids' schooling, camps, extracurriculars and other kids' costs such as medical, food, clothes etc. until they graduate from college.  And suppose you have $2,000,000 saved up and no spouse.  The question is, should you spend say $1,000,000 to do all the crazy stuff you'd like from 45-55?  Some might say $1,000,000 for living expenses from 45 until death is too little, but with Medicare, Social Security and so on (and downsizing of lifestyle), I posit that the spend-$1,000,000 plan makes a more satisfied life."

To quote investopedia ""a hypothesis that states that share prices reflect all information and consistent [alpha](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp) generation is impossible. According to the EMH, stocks always trade at their fair value on exchanges, making it impossible for investors to purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices.""

In laymen's terms it hypothesizes that while individuals are irrational and make stupid decisions based on emotion as an aggregate peoples irrationality will balance out and markets will properly price commodities and equities based on their actual value. To me this seems absolutely insane based on very clear and obvious examples. 

Lets look at two companies. Toyota and Tesla both car manufacturers. We'll only look at the US because that's where Tesla is most dominant. Tesla has about 2-3.5% of the US car market. Toyota has about 13% (and a massive international market share as well). Toyota has decades of strong innovative management. Tesla is managed by Elon Musk a man who in less than a year has paid more than double the correct valuation for a company, and then proceeded to drive it into almost certain bankruptcy.   They've led the way in hybrid technology with their Prius model and are investing in electric vehicles just like Tesla. Tesla had net income of 2.8 billion last year Toyota 2.8...Trillion. 

So what are these two companies worth on the stock market?

Toyota 272.42 billion 

Tesla  758.55 billion 

What rational explanation can you give me for how a company with a decades long history of innovation and good management with a well known quality product who makes several of orders of magnitude more money be worth 4 times less than a company with insane management, a history of over promising and under delivering, with less available capital to adapt as new technologies are discovered. What I think happened is that investors are irrational both as individuals and in aggregate. They fell for the ""Tesla"" marketing and investors think Musk is some sort of ""Tesla"" innovator and they don't want to be left behind missing the next ""Apple"" because they think Musk is the next Steve Jobs. Now you might argue that gamble is a ""rational risk"" but what rational reason does anyone have to believe that Tesla will one day be producing $8 trillion in net income which is what it would need to do to be worth 4 times more than Toyota. 

&#x200B;

That's two stocks though might just be a weird idiosyncrasy. Well at a more systemic level we have the housing crises. Foreclosure rates were rising, people could do the math and realize these CDO's were junk but they kept getting rated triple A because of corruption within the ratings industry. Corruption is not rational "

Thanks to everyone who provided new info that I hadn't seen before. Those of you who think we should torture people, please seek help.

Background: [Charles Cullen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cullen) aka the ""Killer Nurse"" is potentially the most prolific serial killer in US history, with 29 confirmed murders, 40 confessed, and several hundred suspected. He was sentenced to 18 consecutive life sentences in prison. 

He attempted suicide multiple times throughout his life and spent time in multiple psychiatric hospitals as a patient. While pleading guilty for 3 of the murders he repeatedly interrupted the proceedings by taunting the judge with the chant, ""Your Honor, you need to step down."" Cullen was ordered to be restrained and gagged. 

During sentencing Cullen, upset with the judge, kept repeating, ""Your Honor, you need to step down"" for thirty minutes until Platt had Cullen gagged with cloth and duct tape. Even after being gagged, Cullen continued to try to repeat the phrase. 

He was never formally diagnosed, but experts say his behavior strongly matches with anti-social personality disorder, schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. His ex-wife said he did bizarre things all the time, like putting pets in trash cans, putting lighter fluid in drinks, etc. 

His court-appointed attorneys failed him; Cullen clearly meets the criteria to be unfit to stand trial or plead guilty for himself. He should've had a court ordered psychiatric examination and then sentenced to life in a mental institution. 

I'm not saying he should be out free, but rather that we have a system in place for people with his issues. 

So CMV on why he should be in prison where he is, and not an institution."

India has a long way to go before it is going to even rival china in economy.

Red tape and corruption: India has too much red tape and corruption to get job done.

Unity: Unlike in china which is pretty homegeneous , india has a lot of different cultures and ethnicities and riots, religious conflicts are quite common. All these conflicts slow down economy. This isn\`t to say diversity is bad but its one of the downsides of it.

&#x200B;

Brain drain: a common saying in india is everyone is patriot until they get a passport. India has a brain drain problem . Other countries offer more money and have more investment in RnD which attracts more of the intellectual types

Education: India has a big problem in its education. I mean you find stories of the overinflux of engineers and how many apply just to get goverment clerk job there. China also has education problems 

No renewal: This is going to sound controversial  but india didn\`t go through the process of destruction and renewal china did in which the old entrached powers were removed for a new power. There are still tribe leaders, zamindgars and more entrached powers in india who are happy which their tiny kingdons and would oppose anything that messes with their kingdom.

To answer the two most common arguments to this:

Argument 1: What about the biological differences between male and female humans?

Answer 1: Although I do not deny the biological differences, the Selective Service System currently only drafts able-bodied male Americans who pass the physical strength requirements. If female Americans were also drafted, the same process would apply so no one who is not physically capable will be drafted. Therefore, the biological differences won't create an unfair draft.

Argument 2: No one should be required to register.

Answer 2: I completely agree except America’s leaders agree that despite the success of the All-Volunteer Force, registration with Selective Service must continue as a key component of national security strategy. There is no way that America’s leaders would ever allow for registration to end so this is the next best solution for equality and civic duty to the United States."

In my opinion we need to aknowledge the fact that the fetus already living and will eventually grow into a human life but there also needs to be an understanding that by banning abortion we infringe on women’s’  right to bodily autonomy. To this end I feel that the state should ban abortion but financially compensate women accordingly whether by tax refund or otherwise.  The abortion debate should then pivot to how much this right is worth to women. I think this is an easier question to answer than whether or not the fetus is human or if it’s right to life supersedes a women’s right to choose. Of course many women won’t have a price but collectively I feel that most would be amenable to the policy. It is essentially free money for women who are able to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Obvious exceptions for rape and if the pregnancy threatens the mothers life etc.

1,2023-08-12,CMV: It’s easier to go from unattractive to attractive as a woman than it is to go from unattractive to attractive as a man.,u/MattGaetzHater,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15p67zi/cmv_its_easier_to_go_from_unattractive_to/,changemyview,"
So I feel that the factors that make men attractive are more on the side of immutable while for women they aren’t. If you are a woman, and you want to be physically attractive all you really have to do is not be fat in an unattractive way. Sure some women distribute weight differently which is immutable, but most women alive do not have health issues preventing them from not being a healthy weight. Once a woman hits that point it isn’t really going to matter what the rest of her body looks like. 

For men I would say this same logic applies as there’s nothing stopping most men from hitting the gym and eating right. The only thing I would say is that getting muscular is much harder than just being skinny.

Attractive men are imposing physically. This mostly means at least being tall, and when you look at the men today who are considered sex symbols, it’s all tall men. No matter the variant of attractiveness with few exceptions. Micheal B. Jordan, Ryan Gosling, and Chris Evans  all 6’0, Timothy Chalemet, Pedro Pascal, Brad Pitt, 5’11. Pete Davidson, Ashton Kutcher, the Hemsworths, Tom Brady, Jacob Eliordi, Will Smith, Ben Affleck and so many other widely considered attractive people are 6’2+. Height is important in male attractiveness.

I would also argue bone structure and skull shape matter much more for men than it does women to be attractive. While face looks different they all have bone structure that highlights their masculine features. Well defined Jawline, high cheekbones lower amounts of buccal fat, sunken eyes, and a strong brow, square head shape. All things that can’t be built in the gym or through a clean diet or whatever. Eye shape is also important. Canthil tilt and the presence of hunter or prey eyes can make or break facial attractiveness.

Health in of itself is hard to control but a healthy appearance is even harder,  but this mainly comes down to one thing in men. Hair. If hair is thinning it’s over. Shaving can salvage you but if it you don’t have the right head shape, you’re fucked. Again uncontrollable.

I don’t think any of this is nearly as important for women. Women of every shape and size are considered to be attractive . Taylor Swift is admired for her beauty while at the same time many thought Lizzo was beautiful. Bone structure doesn’t matter because there are certain prevailing features for a woman’s face to have. 

On health, weight is important but is mostly controlable just as for men. The other things that could hurt women is excessive wrinkling and balding, which I don’t think is a huge deal for women thanks to the resources available to women.

There’s exponentially more resources for style, fashion, skincare, makeup, beauty etc. There are so many skilled makeup artists that put out their guides for free for women to learn from. The female fashion industry is huge, much bigger than mens and most clothes stores are made with women in mind. Everything appearance related is made with women at the forefront of thought. 

Men don’t participate because until recently most of us were competing for women with a mini Chris Hemsworth. There’s not many mens make up tutorials or mens fashion tutorials for men trying to attract women. There’s not many learning resources on male skincare like there are for women. There’s a much larger barrier of entry and you have to discover how to for yourself which is a lot harder than just looking up one of the millions of makeup tutorials for women.

And since most of what makes women attractive isn’t immutable jut makeup, hair styling, and a nice outfit genuinely can make a 3 an 8. Men cannot put on makeup and a nice outfit and go from a 3 to an 8. There’s also not many ways for men."
1,2023-08-12,"CMV: The US is undergoing a massive realignment in its morality, and it's the Democrat's Fault.",u/Emperor-Kahfonso,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15p6izv/cmv_the_us_is_undergoing_a_massive_realignment_in/,changemyview,"[https://news.gallup.com/poll/507230/fewer-say-sex-relations-morally-acceptable.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/507230/fewer-say-sex-relations-morally-acceptable.aspx)

This is the source I'm making my assumption on. I'm not arguing on morality here, just what I think is the reason for this shift. I'll take any convincing explanation other than the one I will provide here as a potential argument, though it'll have to be a really good one to actually change my view on this.

&#x200B;

As Gallup found, acceptance of a wide variety of things has fallen precipitously on both sides of the aisle for a variety of things that conservatives dislike. Divorce, birth control, sex outside of marriage, gambling, same-sex relationships, doctor-assisted suicide, sex between teenagers, pornography, cloning animals and suicide to be precise. While some of these are minor - a two point fall in gambling for example, or a three point fall in divorce - it is still indicative of a larger shift, especially with regards to same-sex relationships, which fell by 7 points from 71% to 64%. This includes both a fall of 56% to 41% among Republicans and of 85% to 79% among Democrats, with that among independents remaining the same. This is incredibly surprising, especially that among Democrats, because the Party is doing everything in its power to make it protected by law - which is something that I'll touch on later.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, this is because Progressives pushed too far, too quickly. We have, in one generation (the boomers), gone from a society that viewed segregation in large part as moral and necessary, same-sex relationships as the work of the devil and irreligiosity as an existential threat against the nation, to one that legally protects effectively every single minority or otherwise disenfranchised group, as they see it, from women to gay people, and many others. This has generally been done through the use of the Overton window - by calling for things which seem radical, other, more moderate things, though still out of the mainstream, become more palatable in reaction. This is because, for example, if you argue for gay marriage, it's *really* easy for a conservative to come out and say 'I have nothing against homosexuality, but marriage is between a man and a woman'. We saw this happen in this exact thing, to the point where same-sex marriage is protected by an act of congress. Effectively, progressives lose the battles but win the war - which is undeniable that they have, in every single part of the culture war.

  
Except, that's starting to change. With progressives becoming more radical as time goes on, the opposite has happened. People are thinking more about the subject as a whole - the culture war has inflamed for a reason - but they're becoming *less* progressive, not more. Effectively, the things which are the hot-button topics nowadays - drag shows for children, gender-affirming surgeries for minors, etcetera - are *so* uncomfortable for a large part of the population, including democrats, that instead of moving the goalposts to win the battle, they're reconsidering everything which came before that - starting all the way back with the liberalization of birth control. Not enough time has passed to say if this is a one-time thing and it will return back to the trend of increasingly progressive social opinions, or if this is the first signs of the pendulum turning backwards, and public opinion moving back into a more conservative, or perhaps even reactionary, direction.

&#x200B;

I also believe that the push to enshrine these things - abortion, same-sex marriage, etcetera - in law is a reaction by progressives who believe the same thing that I believe: that society is changing, and that if they don't put it on the books now, it'll be banned later. There was no real push by democrats to protect abortion by law before Dobbs, for example, nor for same-sex marriage, or anything else. 

&#x200B;

Pedophiles and child porn are wrong, in more than one way - let that be clear that's my view. Now that I'm a father of two small kids, this topic is even more scary to me. And I thinks that's how I came up with this view, which I would like to be put to test

I am starting from the assumption that the bad thing about child pornography is about the creation of the content. Children are abused, exposed, kidnapped, submitted to human traffic, thousands of little kids fucked up forever. I see this as a criminal industry that does this for profit.

I predict that having AI to generate fake child porn, in a way that would flood the dark web with these things, would kill such industry because fakes would be undestinguishable from reality.

The perverts would still be out there, sure. But I honestly think it's unrealistic to think that we can block them all to access child porn. I see this solution as the best practical solution, that would be more effective at saving the lives of thousands of children."

Doing a paternity test in secret means no one's feelings get hurt if it comes back positive. I get the reassurance of paternity, throw the test in the trash and get on with my life.

If it comes back negative, now i can build my legal case without the mother knowing. Which gives me a better chance to free myself from paying a kid who isn't mine.

It also cuts on the drama and the possible effects on a kid. It's better to do this when the kid is a baby with no memory rather than many years later when the kid would suffer from losing a father.

  
Possible arguments: ""but you should trust your partner"" Sure, but there are millions of people who trusted when they really shouldn't have. There's too much money on the line to take that risk.

We now have a scientific way to prove paternity, the only reason we don't use it is because of women and the state wanting to keep men paying for other people's kids.

Long story short, the general public seems to have [no empathy](https://twitter.com/jzux/status/1689988644633825280?t=WJ9TtXAav50GAsj1UL3c4g&s=19) for male loneliness and involuntary celibacy. When asked why they don't care, people's logic generally is: you do not need sex to survive so they will be fine. Nobody ""deserves"" a relationship. If they are unhappy romantically they should try to find other fulfiling things in life.

But when you discuss e.g. why it isn't okay for countries or religions to ban homosexuality, they say people shouldn't have to hide who they are. If you say ""they don't have to hide who they are, they just have to not have sex with the same sex"", people will generally say: sex is important for one's mental health. Gay people deserve to have fulfilling relationships just like everyone else. They shouldn't have to push that part of themselves away.

So you see how this is a contradiction? Now granted, a sexless male atheist and a queer Christian in Alabama are NOT in the same position. There's a difference between being unable to find someone willing to fuck you, and an authoritative text saying your kind of sex is banned. Even worse if you're a queer person in e.g. Uganda. **So I am not saying that they are in a similar position,** and I want that to be very clear.

What I'm saying is, the *logic/argument* against banning homosexuality, implies that sex and relationships are important for human beings. If that's true, you can't say that it isn't important for sexless young men in the West. There's little that can be done to help them, sure -- but a total lack of empathy isn't appropriate. We should pity them, not ridicule them. 

/-----

Also if it isn't clear: I think banning homosexuality is completely wrong. People should be able to have whatever kind of (consensual) sex they want. I even think sexuality is a spectrum, and most people wouldn't be ""straight"" if same sex relations were more normalized. I also think male loneliness is a big problem, and that it's fueling many larger issues that could come to disrupt society if we don't counteract it (like the rise of fascism in the West)."

1,2023-08-12,CMV: A defendant's statements to the police should not be used against them in court,u/EpipoleOfCarystus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15pg3kh/cmv_a_defendants_statements_to_the_police_should/,changemyview,"Every defense lawyer would tell you not to talk to the police, but most people do it anyway. Sometimes they do it because of threats or false promises from the police, sometimes because they cannot stand to have a terrible accusation go unchallenged until they can talk to a lawyer, sometimes because they think they can outsmart the integrator, or for someone other reason.

Whatever the reason, it's always a bad idea. It's a trap that has sent both guilty and innocent people to prison because they were unable to take advantage of their constitutional right to remain silent. It's almost certainly more likely to affect poorer, less educated, and more vulnerable people who either don't understand the situation they are in or cannot withstand the pressure the police put on them.

Representing yourself is another thing people can do in the criminal process that's practically always a bad idea, but it's handled very differently. When somebody wants to fire their lawyer and represent themselves, the judge will hold an extensive hearing where they will explain all the ways it's a bad idea and ask the defendant questions to make sure they understand the consequences of the choice they are making. The defendant will have time to reconsider and can sometimes get their conviction overturned if the judge didn't do enough to ensure they fully understood everything. Contrast this with a police officer assuring a stressed and traumatized recently arrested suspect that they just want to get to the truth and that it's best for everyone if they talk before reading the Miranda warning and asking if they understand. If people had to go through the self-representation process before talking to the police without a lawyer, almost nobody would do it.

While the admissibility of a defendant's statements to the police is helpful to the police and prosecutors if their job is to find someone to put in prison, it's not as helpful if they want to find the right person. False confessions are common: [""More than two-thirds of the DNA-cleared homicide cases documented by the Innocence Project were caused by false confessions.""](https://falseconfessions.org/fact-sheet/) And people who know something about a crime they didn't commit are likely deterred from talking to the police by the fear that their words will be used against them to make them the suspect.

There should be some limited exceptions, such as when the defendant is prosecuted for falsely accusing someone else, but in general, I think a defendant's statements to a police officer should not be used against them in court."

The limited information we possess about reality makes it incredibly difficult to confidently assert why we exist.

On one hand, religious beliefs attribute the universe's creation to a divine entity. While these beliefs provide a sense of purpose and meaning, they can appear unfounded to those who prioritize empirical evidence. The idea of an omnipotent creator raises questions about that entity's origin, leading to an endless loop of unanswerable queries.

On the other hand, scientific theories, like the Big Bang, propose explanations based on empirical observations and mathematical models. However, even these theories rely on dismissing some aspects of what we currently understand about physics. The concept of the universe suddenly emerging from an infinitely dense singularity goes against our intuition and understanding of causality.

What both perspectives share, is the limitation of human comprehension. Our understanding of reality is constrained by our senses, cognition, and technological capabilities. This limitation leads to speculation, conjecture, and ultimately, uncertainty.

Too often, I see people confidently assert that they know, 100%, that their view is correct. but I think people forget just how bizarre and illogical this reality is that we exist within. Personally, I think just by our awareness as conscious beings, it's not much of a stretch to consider the possibility of a grand consciousness, what some would call ""God"". Read up on quantum mechanics to get an idea of how absurd and illogical reality can be.

The point is, there's so much that we don't know about the universe, and so many things that actually conflict with our current understanding of reality. You may say ""X theory is more plausible because of X"", but I don't believe anyone can confidently claim to know how or why we exist, without making some ridiculous assumptions.

These are fairly complex, & most therapists aren’t even qualified to fully diagnose these disorders. 

I also understand not having access to mental healthcare, but that doesn’t suddenly give you the knowledge of the nuances and intricacies of said disorder. You still simply aren’t educated enough and don’t have enough experience to make that call. 

I understand not all professionals are as competent as they should be, and misdiagnosis happens & some can be invalidating. I’m not saying sexism, etc doesn’t exist in this field. But still, even if you do encounter that, it doesn’t just suddenly give you the credentials to self-diagnosis. It’s a shitty situation, but you can’t just make that call. 

In any case, actual professionals aren’t even “allowed” to self diagnose- there’s still too much bias. You need an objective third party to evaluate you to *know* what your problem is. 

There’s also a high amount of bias & confirmation bias that comes with this. I’ve seen people get attached to disorders, then multiple professionals “disagree”. They list any number of reasons they couldn’t get a diagnosis (ableism, sexism, etc), when in reality, they just aren’t actually afflicted with the disorder. One of my ex-friends actually bought an autism diagnosis online, after THREE psych evals didn’t yield her desired results (diagnosis mills are popping up more since the pandemic). 


And at this point, it feels like at least half of the people I know or meet think they’re autistic/adhd on some level (Gen Z is pretty into this). The huge amount of autism content on TikTok (over 70% of which is inaccurate or overly broad) leads to the horoscope effect, with people beginning to think they’re autistic due to videos like “do you hate the texture of velvet and rub your feet together in bed?? Autism!” while ignoring the fact that autism is a disability and can only be diagnosed if it is pervasive and negatively affects many areas of your life. 

This also leads to people having an inaccurate view of what autism is, leading to actual autistics being ostracized due to being accidentally rude or having shutdowns/meltdowns- essentially by actually being affected by their disorder. It entirely invalidates the hardships that a disability brings. In addition, I’ve noticed that a LOT of self-diagnosed people seek out traits of their “disorder” in other people, leading to a domino effect where people spread misinformation & convince others they have said disorder, based off benign human traits, like being introverted/ nerdy, moody, forgetting where you park your car, etc. I finally confided in a friend about my diagnosis and she immediately said “I think I have that too! I hate surprises and being touched from behind!”, which is much better explained by her trauma, but I digress. 

I think self diagnosing depression and anxiety is a bit more reasonable (they’re self-evident), sort of like how you can self diagnose the cold but not, say, a condition like hypothyroidism. You can strongly suspect based on symptoms and subjective “research” but cannot know for sure. 

Self-diagnosis is just “I think I have this disorder” with extra steps. Might as well just say you think you have said disorder. That way it isn’t potentially a lie. I just can’t think of a single reason that self diagnosis would be valid."

I see people from r/sex coming from a sex-negative household that is almost always religious and they complain about feeling confident when doing something sexual because they are afraid of going to Hell if they commit a certain sex act. 

This stigma is brought by religion and secularization has been helping with this but not enough. We need American society to be more sex-positive, more LGBTQ+ accepting, and empower people to make their own choices about their sex and dating lives free from coercion and judgement. Shame is a powerful emotion to control human sexual behavior and this comes from mainly religious households. People need to be liberated from shame and live their sex lives on their own terms. Reddit is a good place to discuss this since Reddit skews secular and liberal.

So, we need to make America more sex-positive. How do we do this? Here we go.

2. Promote Drag Queen Story Hour to children and teens.
3. Promote comprehensive sex education in public schools *that discuss sexual orientation and gender identity*.

But as a person that doesn't enjoy, or drink coffee, whatsoever, I've seen more people (based off of my experience, on average) add so much to their coffee (sugar, milk, artificial flavoring, extra sweeteners/enhancements) that it's essentially (at least by taste), not coffee anymore, it's just a smoothie with coffee in it, or rather, the caffeine that's in it (in which case you can just substitute it with caffeine pills)

I've asked several of the people in my day to day life if they'd take coffee black, or with just very light amounts of milk/cream/sugar, and they've rejected it, and said it's not enough. If you have to actively pour an extra liquid in, that tastes nothing like the liquid you're pouring into (like coffee mate or that other brand), and it's a considerable amount (about a quarter), then you don't really like the base flavor or content, and moreso like the mixture result.

I had a similar argument with someone, who then posed the question to me on whether I ""actually"" like chocolate, since I hate dark chocolate, but enjoy milk chocolate (favorite) and white chocolate, and told him I suppose I didn't actually like chocolate, but more chocolate mixes, since chocolate in its raw form (or close to it, like really dark chocolate) is incredibly bitter, and not very sweet or savory (at least imo). 

So similar concept with coffee, and these people that go on about how they love their cup of joe, but wouldn't even be in the same room as a cup of black coffee, or lightly added milk/sugar to it, and need the coffee flavor all but removed from this drink for theirs. Why not just drink some water, and have some caffeine pills, if that's what you're clearly craving? (In the instances of those examples).

Just my thoughts, that if you like the base flavoring or product, that very little or minor additions and changes (or none at all) would suffice, but what some people end up making it out to be, it's practically not coffee at all, and thus, doesn't seem like they actually like the coffee, but moreso the caffeine, or the social aspect to coffee, or whatever else other possible outcome."

However, with unicode, people are restricted in what characters they can use. As typing is become more mainstream than writing (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_amnesia), it is halting the creation of new words. Many new phrases are forced to use the latin alphabet due to the characters not being encoded in unicode (such as biang biang) or are forced to use old archaic characters that dont match the meaning and never wouldve been created organically (such as 囧). 

Most new characters are only added via scientists like chemists or astronomers which really limits the potential of the language, and even those words are added at a slow rate. the newest four discovered elements of the periodic table were given names in 2017 yet most of them havent been added yet.

My cynical point of view is that most dating customers don't want to know the truth about their partners. People prefer projecting fantasies onto the people they want to date so long as they're attractive.

As an example, many women on dating websites complain that men only use them for sex. These women are then “ghosted” and women respond by saying “men on dating sites are all assholes”. My cynical point of view is that these women knowingly date highly sought after men that have the luxury of switching between mates very easily. Women want to pointlessly attempt locking down commitment with promiscuous men who have a high aggregate market value that they know will never settle. These women would not pay for a dating service that can accurately  say “This man only wants a one night stand with you and actually has three other women lined up this month to date. He has no long term interest in dating you and is just lying.”

Similarly men often complain about women’s sexual past. Men claim that they don’t want to date a woman with a high body count or who has worked as a sex worker (Only Fans or Prostitute). But if men could literally be told ""This woman has slept with 500 men and has an Only Fans account."", then men would not pay for this service because men would prefer an attractive woman despite having a promiscuous sexual history."
1,2023-08-12,CMV: Books are to Graphics and Videos what Walking is to Vehicles,u/piinhuann,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15plp0e/cmv_books_are_to_graphics_and_videos_what_walking/,changemyview,"Books and words are highly inefficient and slow modes of transmitting information compared to pictures and videos. 

Reading a typical book takes you at least a few days or even weeks, while watching a video or film takes you only a few hours. 

Even videos that might take you days such as a 20-episode drama, the viewers could fast forward or skip the video (whenever they find some parts irrelevant and mundane) and then resume with little hiccups. 

However if you do the same for books, it is arduous to resume after skipping because a lot of contexts are lost. You can't ""grok"" words quickly after skipping but you could ""grok"" videos easily after fast forwarding.

Books and videos are just ""tools"" to transmit information and messages. Why not use the fastest and most effficient tool to do things? Medieval people didn't have choices other than pen and papers. Since they hadn't invented the technique of capturing light and storing it in pieces of chips, they had to use words and alphabets as makeshift solutions to vicariously represent reality. 

The abstraction resulted from using alphabets and words creates a big barrier between the message and the receiver. Symbolic information is way too cryptic relative to concrete imagery generated by pictures and videos.

Today we have such a fortune of easily capturing light digitally to produce videos and photos that closely resemble the reality. So we should just maximally leverage this technique all the time and start deprioritising words and books."

With no particular country in mind, the overall suggestion is based around studies which say the brain reaches it's full development between 20-25, with the age of consent going up to reflect that.

This could represent a 2-7 year increase somewhere like the US. Or even a more dramatic 4-9 year increase in the UK. At the more extreme end, countries like Portugal and Italy would be adding an additional 6-11 years of time to wait before being legally allowed to consent to sex.

Now, while I don't think it's really legally necessary to make sex an over 20s activity only, that's not really the purpose of this discussion.

Many of the same advocates for this position, are also in favour of top (and in more rare cases bottom) surgery for teenagers with a gender identity which differs from the sex marker they were *assigned at birth*

This strikes me as a real case of cognitive dissonance. 

Fundamentally, both decisions are about bodily autonomy and maturity.

One would assume that if someone is mature enough to make the bodily decision 'I want to permanently remove my breasts', then they are also old enough decide 'I want to engage my body in sex acts'

In fact, with the assumption that individuals are given a decent sex education and are aware of pregnancy possibilities and STD risks, then an act of sexual intercourse must be seen as something very temporary, compared to the permanence of gender affirming surgery.

I have no issue with people getting gender affirming surgery. Nor am I here to discuss at what age the age of consent should be set (something that swings quite wildly from culture to culture). I just think that regardless, the two things ought to be set at the same age, as they are fundamentally similar and require similar levels of maturity to fully understand and commit to"

I have a history of losing debates to defend my lack of faith:

* It all started 3 years ago, when I requested to no longer go to church - and in response, my brother challenged me to a debate, which I lost because I was outwitted - [see here](https://imgur.com/a/jVrxqdd).
* Earlier this year, I tried to explain my lack of faith to my local parish priest, and I lost again because I was outwitted - [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/14oerk4/cmv_some_people_are_spiritually_dead/).
* Over the past few days, I've been trying to defend my support for LGBTs and lack of faith from a Protestant. Once again, I realised I was losing because I got outwitted, so I got desperate and quipped ""*is there any red line that would make you hold Christianity to account*"" - and what do you know, I still lost because [there are Christian rebuttals for that too](https://www.reddit.com/r/KnowingBetter/comments/15jo5wy/comment/jvmad6j/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Therefore, I must concede that Christianity is a well-designed religion because there is always a rebuttal at its disposal that will leave its critics trapped. For the TVTropers among you here, Christianity has a [Xanatos Gambit](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit) in its favour. No wonder Christianity has lasted 2000 years and is still growing.

Society may have appeared to have made gains against Christianity - but such gains are being reversed (both [inside](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-06-09/why-young-gym-bros-are-becoming-catholic-online-christianity/102457884) and [outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6wFW9nPwmg) the Western world). No wonder we are seeing consequences like [declining acceptance of same-sex relations](https://news.gallup.com/poll/507230/fewer-say-sex-relations-morally-acceptable.aspx).

As for why I've been keeping notes of my debates, it's because I don't want to be constantly losing (and [I lose in non-religious debates too](https://www.reddit.com/r/AusPol/comments/xu1pad/question_how_to_deal_with_clashing/)). I keep notes so that I can analyse them in the hopes of improving my debating skills enough so that one day, I can finally win debates.

So to conclude:

* If you believe that Christianity was fabricated by men, then these men were geniuses who made sure that the religion they designed has a rebuttal to dodge and entrap future critics
* If you believe that Christianity was divinely inspired, then this God had the foresight to choose the right words to dodge and entrap future critics"

But cars kill more people every day than guns do, and even though it's somewhat covered on the news, we still just accept it as a part of transportation in the US. We all know someone who's been in a crash, and chances are, you've been in a crash yourself. Where are the protests for safer roads?

Here's the proof: In 2020 during the pandemic when the number of road fatalities should have dropped because everyone was home, right?

Well no. [38,824 lives were lost in traffic crashes nationwide. That number marks the highest number of fatalities since 2007](https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-traffic-crash-data-fatalities).  
  
Therefore, I think that people should be protesting and advocating just as much, if not more, than when there are shootings.

But the more I think about it, the more I realize that was completely astroturfed bullshit which only got recognition because the 'landed gentry' of Reddit was able to pin posts and force that dialogue down our throats for weeks on end before finally being chased out like the rats they are. I think there has been some confusion as to which problems were caused by the API change, and which problems were caused by the whiners throwing a temper tantrum and fouling the site up for everyone. Here's how I see it:

*Results of the API change itself:*

* A few wealthy app developers making many thousands of dollars mooching off of Reddit had to pivot to do something else

I work in tech too. I have more money than I know what to do with, drive a brand new BMW I upgrade every couple of years, live in a luxury condo with delicious haute cuisine delivered to me at my whim, and can easily find new 6-figure work basically at the drop of a hat if something bothers me at my workplace. These guys are no different - in fact, they're almost certainly doing far better. They have not only years of development experience on a major platform, but developed their own apps that attracted many tens of thousands of users generating them donation and ad revenue (for those apps which monetized w/ ads). With that on their resume, none of these guys will have a hard time getting jobs as engineers at Apple/Google/Amazon/SAP/etc making $350k starting. These are not poor destitute artists living hand to mouth, they're fucking loaded and pretending that's not the case is silly. I have absolutely no pity or sympathy for them; their unsustainable business model which relied completely on the charity of Reddit stopped working, and they had to move on. Maybe they felt sad for a few days and drank a few $200 bottles of wine from their San Francisco high-rise apartments to cope. Poor them. 

* A few multinational billion-dollar companies have to pay API fees to train their incredibly profitable LLMs off of Reddit content

See above. I'm not crying for Google/OpenAI, and you shouldn't either. LLMs will make them untold billions; they can afford to pay a few fractions of a penny for API requests.

* A few third party apps shut down

Admittedly, probably a little annoying for the people who used them. The Reddit mobile app could be better - and Spez promised it will be, soon. As a primarily desktop user, this hasn't affected me very much. It's a valid complaint; and one of the few I've seen. Reddit, do better. Maybe hire some of the devs from RiF, etc - seems like they had a good product, and they may not have all been scooped up by FAANG yet, but they will be soon. As for accessibility-oriented apps, Reddit kindly kept those prices low so as to assist users with disabilities - a wonderful and considerate move that demonstrates their lack of malintent.

* Moderation became a bit more difficult - allegedly

It seems like mods relied on some of those third party apps. That's unfortunate for them. As for me? I haven't noticed any difference. When I see an ignorant post that has slipped through Automod, I downvote/report/block or chew them out. I gamed in the early 2000's - you think some rude comments on Reddit can phase me? I've heard so many F and N-slurs in my life that that shit doesn't even make me wobble anymore. Ignorance will always exist where there is no accountability - like on an anonymous internet forum where you can make an account with a fake email address in 10 seconds. Empowering a bunch of ban-happy fat virgins, notorious for sitting at home all day running their subreddits like fiefdoms and banning people for personal grudges, isn't any better in my book. I've seen no change to my user experience whatsoever as a result.

*Results of the ""protests"" and temper tantrums*

* The site became completely unusable for days

When the mods of subreddits shut down their stuff unceremoniously, a massive resource was lost for millions of people. Google's algorithm couldn't make heads or tails of the fact that many of the subreddits were suddenly unreachable - and so for many people, looking up much of the valuable information on this site became impossible. People looking for medical information, how to fix important appliances, people looking for resources on coding peculiarities (trying not to take this personally), and perhaps even addicts and those with mental illness looking for help on support subreddits were 404'd because everyone unceremoniously shut their shit down with no notice. Millions and millions of people were inconvenienced all around the world, all because a few pouty mods who think Reddit is their entire life felt entitled to take that away from everyone unilaterally.

* The site is still operating at reduced functionality because of spiteful losers

Many subreddits (looking at you /r/shitposting) have their automods set up spitefully to delete comments for no reason. Like, for instance, using the letter 'b'. You're really endearing people to you by making it impossible to engage with your content huh? It turns out that the biggest change to moderation was that subreddit owner fat cats would fuck everyone else over for not caring about their personal internet crusade and make the site a less interesting place to be. This isn't reddit doing this, btw - it's the shitty subreddit mods trying to sabotage the site experience for everyone else with their idea of an Italian strike. They think you don't deserve to engage equally with the content on the site, and that by being intentionally obtuse that they will win people over to their side. They won't.

* A bunch of porn got posted on formerly SFW subreddits, exposing people to unpleasant sites they weren't looking for

Speaks for itself. In another attempt to sabotage the site, a bunch of subreddits went NSFW and got spammed with porn and gore and other unpleasant images, potentially exposing children and people not accustomed to those kinds of images. Really what everyone wanted to see on r/interestingasfuck.

* We've all had to hear about this astroturfed bullshit for way too long and it has continued to plague dialogue even months later

As typical of the mods who love to abuse their power on this site, this opinion was force crammed down everyone's throats for weeks thanks to stickied posts evangalizing about how it's 'the end of reddit'. It completely derailed discourse on the site for far too long, all because a superminority of users (like .1% of the userbase or less) are butthurt that they didn't get their way. They tried repeatedly to pivot their arguments to make them more pallatable - the poor mod developers! (rich software engineers), the site will die! (only because of the actions of the power-abusing mods), this is anti-user! (no change to my experience or the experience of 99.9% of people whatsoever except that caused). None of this stuff bore fruit except by the actions of the complainers themselves. This is not grassroots at all; this is completely manufactured outrage created by a superminority of site users who are mad because they haven't gotten their way. 

In summary, by my estimation, the API change caused absolutely, positively zero change to my user experience. Nothing Reddit did bothered me whatsoever. I don't care that they're charging more. You shouldn't either. The ""protests"" on the other hand? Massive and ongoing nuisance for nearly everyone on the site. The entire fiasco was completely self-inflicted by mods who are so used to getting their way all the time and so stuck in the ""me, me, me"" mentality that they can't see that they're the problem.

To the other people sick of this shit, kindly join me in reminding the whiners that we don't want them here and that they can go to another platform if all they're going to do is complain about how awful it is here. Seriously, my experience here would only improve if every single butthurt mod actually did what they've been threatening to for months and went over to Mastadon.

1,2023-08-13,"CMV: The repatriation and removal of display of ancient artifacts is anti-science, politically motivated, and is degrading our institutions.",u/ArguingMaster,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15q6aas/cmv_the_repatriation_and_removal_of_display_of/,changemyview,"So I've been watching the discussion around the repatriation of artifacts to various tribes, various countries that were once colonies or subjects of various world empires, etc and the way its shifted from a more reasonable stance of ""If the country of origin has this nice shiny museum they want to house this in, it should be returned"" to this less reasonable stance of ""we should return any object that is of even the most vaguely questionable nature, even if it means the object will be destroyed"".

One statement I particularly found disturbing was a recently appointed Director of the Illinois State Museum saying that ""at a certain point you have to stop looking for new answer \[from ancient remains\] because they just lead to more questions""... IMO that person should never be allowed near any scientific institution. The search for answers is literally the entire point of science and archaeology. That thought process is the equivalent of saying you are a scientific sabotuer. They are choosing the fact that a small group of people, whom in all likely hood aren't even the direct descendants of the human remains/artifact makers in question (and in many cases, are probably descended from the people who conquered them and occupied the geographical area in which they existed) are upset and giving that priority over the advancement of human knowledge. In many cases they are returning these remains to meet reburial (which will cause massive damage to them when we inevitably dig them back up in a hundred years after the obsolete concept of religion becomes extinct and we become a mono-cultural global civilization) and the objects, most of which are greatly fragile, to be handled by unqualified individuals and stored in locations that may not have adequate climate controls or access controls to protect those artifacts (which ironically might land them back into the looted artifact system via theft). Another example of religion being allowed to harm science was when they returned a lock of hair from a famous Native American war chief and the tribe immediately burned it, robbing HUMANITY of an artifact forever.

 The way I see it individual groups don't have rights over their artifacts, they belong to the collective history of the human civilization. The obvious long term result of human globalized society is that in the long run we become mono cultural, mono racial (as people of different races continue to have children, and this occurs at a higher rate due to lessened geographical concerns), and universally atheist (as the average level of education around the world continues to rise, and treatment for mental illness improves). Thus it makes sense to keep these in places where they are safe, and correctly handled. That's why I don't oppose ALL repatriations, like the situation with the parthanon marbles seems pretty thoroughly ridiculous and rooted in a desire to keep these where western tourists can access them. This is despite Greece having already made ample facilities to house these items in a location where they can be contextually enhanced by the setting. I'm sure various Native American groups that have moved past religion and superstition have also done so. I also believe genuine attempts are being made in the middle east and Africa but the instability in those regions makes it very difficult to have faith in those attempts. For example in the early 2000s the largest Buddha statues in the world were destroyed by ISIS militants. You also have items being returned to places that are essentially dictatorships or Narco states (like Mexico) where the government is so throughly corrupt you have to wonder how many artifacts will end up back in the stolen artifact pipeline or in the private mansion of a political elite. For all these places I think its better to hold them in the institutions they are currently in until the situation improves in the proper settings.

If an argument doesn't address the core issue (the title), it likely won't get a delta. arguing that 'actually x is y' is in 99% of cases, not useful or productive.  


Alright. the view. it is immoral to feature kink and have children present. I said in pride events in the title, but it can be anywhere. We'll focus on pride events for this discussion. 

1) It is being presented as something which it is not. 

There are NO news broadcasts, papers, advertisements, or other widely distributed media which will advertise both kink, and child-friendliness.  some of you may be inclined to link a fringe blog, or an archived web page, and I implore you to ask yourself; why is it fringe, and/or why do you have to use an archive?

2) The interests of the parties at kink events are intrinsically unknown. 

Sexuality is a sensitive topic by nature and fiat. It is of the utmost importance to our youth that they make the decision as freely from influence as possible (ie: of their own volition). The very essence of kink at pride events is to impose / expose the most degenerate activities which interest people sexually. If in some way the folks pushing kink didn't want people to participate in these activities, they wouldn't need a parade.  By including kids in such activities, you're setting  them up to readily participate in kink. Not only is this damaging to the psyche of the child, but is also setting the child up for failure by giving them absurd expectations of society.  As a side, I'm curious how some folks can with a straight face both advocate for kink as a part of pride, and in the same breath talk about acts sexual violence without such an inkling of the two being connected.   


3) It dramatically increases the risk of sexual exploitation

A child who attends events featuring kink will be easier for bad actors to exploit than the same child who does not. There's no question that a child who develops a normality for kink related items will be easier to coerce into doing said kink things. It can be as simple as posing for an illegal photograph, or something more insidious. If they see it at a pride parade, they'll be more likely to see such actions as normal, when in reality, they're demented acts which severely damage innocent individuals. Exposure at an age where children cannot discern the line between reality and fiction may lead to distorted views on sexuality, relationships, and the roles of men and women in intimate relationships. They'll come to view sex as a purely physical act, divorced from emotion, consent, or responsibility.

While there's no issue with educating youth on the topics present in pride events, it's damaging to the development of a child to display such acts as public, open, and for everyone. it's just a fact of life that some things aren't public, aren't open, and aren't for everyone (especially kids). 

&#x200B;

Let's be fair, I don't blame anyone for not wanting to participate in this subject-matter, there's a \*special\* place for people that legitimately think it's a good idea to have children at kink events.. So let me just wrap this up by saying I'm not especially looking for my view to be change, as much as I am looking to understand what the argument is for this phenomena, if any. For the longest time, I thought that this was a coincidental side-effect, and that those who organized such events chose to turn a blind eye to the fact that children will be at these events... but I want to see if there's an argument which is actually being made for these actions.."

I have notices this specifically with straight men. The vast majority of people who ask me if I'm gay or whether I'm a ""Top"" or ""Bottom"" are straight men, I rarely get women asking those questions. I have noticed that (in most cases) they ask this question because they need confirmation that you're gay so they can give less respect than they would if you were straight. Once you confirm that you're gay, they will automatically change the way they treat you because in their minds, gay men are inferior to straight men. Although society has become far more accepting of gay people, a lot of straight men still hold this view but won't admit it. Most young boys call each other ""gay "" as an insult or they use the word in a derogatory way because there is still a negative connotation attached to that word or to homosexuality in general (especially male homosexuality). This deeply rooted mentality carries over and sticks with them as they get older, and even if they become more tolerant and accepting of gay men, they still view us as less than. To them, a gay man is less of a man and isn't worthy of being respected as a ""real man"". They still have the mentality that being attractes to women is the epitome of manhood and that only straight men are ""real men"". Even when they ask us questions about our sex lives, they assume that everything is different for us because we are not normal to them. We are still seen as ""other"" and there is no way that we can possibly have the same experiences as they do. Gay men are still looked down upon by straight men and we are still treated with a sense of inferiority, and I'm not sure that this will ever change!"

One thing that has really frustrated me about modern dating is this idea that everyone is somehow ""too busy"" to text back. I understand not wanting to message someone back and forth, especially when it's early in a relationship, every couple of hours. That's exhausting and we all have day jobs/hobbies we want to pursue and not be constantly trying to think how to keep someone we barely know, or maybe haven't even met yet, entertained through our words.

That said, I think it's way too common these days for people to claim they don't text back within 24ish hours because they're ""too busy"". I get that life is sometimes unpredictable and things break/shit happens. I work in a pretty demanding job and I have periods too where I basically have to be heads down and really focus on something for 14+ hours a day. The thing is, I don't believe that:

1. Most peoples' jobs are THAT demanding. From what I've seen/read online, most people do maybe 4ish hours of work a day and are pretending to be busy the rest of the time
2. This is the more important part: I know for me personally that if I really like a girl, I'll respond to her by EOD. For one, it realistically only takes 5-10 mins max to think of something and type it out. Even if I worked 14 hours that day, I can still find 5 mins before bed to text someone I'm into before I fall asleep at worst. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see how it'd be different from a woman's perspective if she were really into me
3. IME, whenever I start talking to a girl over the phone, we generally feel each other out and naturally come up with a ""rhythm"", for lack of better word, of how often we communicate. The two things I've noticed are that if a girl is really into me, she'll text me back come hell or high water. The second is that the minute this ""rhythm"" starts getting extended, that's when things have gone south.

The View: People online make fun of crypto bros for ""owning"" images when anybody can just download it. Copying and pasting it a hundred times doesn't increase its value. Obviously you don't get The Token itself, nor the copyright, by downloading a thumbnail image. And likewise, downloading a Harry Potter book PDF without paying for it doesn't mean you own the words, or the printing rights, or the merch, or the movies, or anything else. Corporations claiming copyright over these files is dumb, and downloading them isn't theft, because you're not taking anything from them but the potential money they could possibly get by preventing everyone from seeing the jpg. I mean PDF. An oil painter sells paintings and prints, not thumbnails of their work. And likewise, musicians should sell physical records, merchandise, gig tickets, VIP seats, and autographs, not digital files of the music they made. Not jpegs of the autographs they already signed. Not pngs of monkeys wearing their band teeshirts.

Changing my view: I personally think this one is a hard sell. But a lot of people seem passionate about it, so I think I must be missing something obvious, genuinely. How are these not the same?

After being surrounded by others and continuing to listen to stories of people struggling, I have changed my mind. It's going to be a ramble down below.

  
Originally, my stance was financial viability, academic, and accountability reforms including capping student loan interest rates, expanding public service student loan program, publishing degree outcomes data (How many students found a full-time job? How many of those pertains to their degree? Were they able to enter graduate school?) and increasing personal accountability. There is already an attendance and GPA policy for those who take out federal loans. However, the GPA requirement is at 2.0. Does it demonstrate that the student has sufficient knowledge of the course? Higher GPA should be considered. At the same time, students should have access to free resources to close the gap in their learning. It helps to increase competency in the student.  

  
I still stand for those things, because they are important to reshaping the higher education landscape. However, I also now stand for student loan forgiveness. I paid the rest of my student loan debt today. I grew up poor, but I have moved on from that life and I absolutely do not take that for granted. People say money does not buy happiness, but money can buy financial peace. We have enough in this planet to feed and housed everyone. However, with the way the current system is designed, many people are born into an unlucky lottery and their existence is trying to make the best of their lives without having the system drown them. I understand the people who are against student loan forgiveness. Some had to work hard and to make sacrifices to pay off their own student loans. Some do not want to be responsible and have their tax dollars bail out those individuals who signed for those loans in the first place. America was built on the ""can-do-it"" attitude and personal responsibility. However, the world has changed, and America has yet to adapt to the current landscape. Everything cost much more than back then. Housing, food, and healthcare are tremendous burdens on everyone's' shoulders. From elementary to high school, everyone is told to go to college and that will prepare them for higher pay and a better life. Why should they say any differently? Many papers were published to support that. 

With good intentions, school counselors prepared everyone to be admitted at some college - any college. If they could not afford it, there were student loans that students can take, and it would be a definite worthwhile investment. However, the Bachelor's degree no longer leads to the promised land. Why? Because the world has changed. The progress of technology has led us to this modern world. We have yet to adapt to it. People are struggling under crippling debt. It is not only the financial toll. Not only does the loan-taker pays for it, their parents, spouses, and children do too.  According to the APA, ""Compared to other touchy topics, couples' arguments about money tend to be more intense, more problematic and more likely to remain unresolved."" These people have tried to do the right thing by following what has been pushed their entire lives. Go to college and get that better job.  One person used to be able to raise a family from a factory job. What factory jobs do we have now? What good paying jobs do we actually have? Not everyone can be doctors, CEOs, or engineers. For this current group of student loan borrowers, everyone should have their loans forgiven and our whole educational system need a serious reform for our future generations. It will alleviate the suffering of the loan borrower and the family around them. Consequently, it leaves the energy and door open to uplift their immediate community.  With less stress all-around, I wonder how that translates to everyone's daily lives. I see it as an opportunity to raise America up as a whole.  People should not have to work two jobs to have a roof over their head and to afford food to eat. There are viable pathways for it, but that will lead me into another long ramble.

  
TLDR: Support Student Loan Forgiveness. It will reap short-term and long-term benefits for everyone. "

I think the SJWs are upset about SJW's because they get upset about other people being upset about SJW's, and they get upset about other people being upset about SJW's.

I think the SJW's are upset about SJW's because they get upset about other SJW's or SJW's.

I think the SJW's are upset about SJW's because they get upset about SJW's and SJW's, and SJW's are upset about SJW's and SJW's and SJW's and SJW's, and SJW's are upset about SJW's and SJW's and SJW's, and SJW's are upset about SJW's and SJW's and SJW's and SJW's.

SJWs are people who get upset about SJW's and SJW's and SJW's.

SJWs are people who get upset about SJW's and SJW's and SJW's.

SJWs are people who get upset about SJW's and SJW's and SJW's."

You make a mistake on the boss? Go all the way back to the bonfire pray you don’t take to much damage/use too many flasks and try again. Many seem to laud over just how difficult the bosses are, but personally the bosses are much easier than they’re made out to be; the boss runs are just what make them seem so much harder.

The boss runs are nothing but padding that increase tedium from 1-100

Many defenders of boss runs counter argue with that death requires a conquence, and with that conquence you will get better and therefor not die as much which is definitely true for regular enemies. But with each boss being so different from one another you’re Essentially starting from scratch every time you encounter a new boss. Of course some basic things carry over, but every boss is different 

The boss runs first of all take you out of the momentum you may have had, and forces you to adapt back to the mindset of fighting regular enemies. Sure you can run past them, but they chase and chase with some being impossible to just run by

The game is 100% fair and balanced, but I would by no means call it a fun kind of difficulty"

The race to control these materials have already started; China reportedly hold the most amount of these rare earth metals, and they’re not gonna play nice with the West any time soon, and vice versa. How do we make sure that these important elements for our future aren’t just another geopolitical bargaining chip, like oil and natural gas?

Just like how oil and natural gas reserves are about to be exhausted, what are we supposed to do when we can no longer mine these rare earth metals?

Furthermore, rare earths are mined by digging open pits in the ground, which can contaminate the environment and disrupt ecosystems. Mining can also produce wastewater filled with acids, heavy metals and radioactive material that might leak into groundwater. How can this be more environmentally friendly and more sustainable compared to oil and natural gas?

I'm not sure exactly where to post this seeing as I am really wanting a broad set of perspectives. Hoping maybe this is a good spot? If it's against rules, please remove and I apologize. But I am really torn here and would love an open discussion about this. 

I'm in college for CJ. Just had a mini debate and it's been rattling in my brain and I was shocked at the amount of people leaping to an answer based on emotions. 

This topic surrounds ""Chemical Castration of sx offenders "" and wether or not I would implement it if I had the ability to. No one should be torn about this right? Welp, guess I'm just not human or something. 

My take, in a simple way, is torn leaning no. 
Hear me out. 

The concept of chemical castration as a punitive measure for sex offenders sparks a discourse on the efficacy and ethical considerations surrounding such a sentence. 

 while I absolutely understand and truly see the depth and seriousness of the crime s offenders commit, by doing this, we step into a whole new battle ground of infringments and overreach
.
We dont know its effectiveness. Does it really help ? 

Clear ""cruel and unusual"".. It is a form of physical mutilation that is not necessary for the protection of society. There are other, more humane and effective ways to rehabilitate s offenders and protect society from them. When using the idea that its okay for them, it opens the door to being able to use it on anyone or groups with like characteristics.

It's a forced medical procedure and I genuinely don't see how people , especially scholarly, don't at least recognize that. With all the other rights and laws that have been passed surrounding ones personal choices for their body, a s offender (as lowest of lows can be ) is no different. Upon getting your license as a doctor, you take a vow to ""do no harm"", and this would be a clear retraction of that in my opinion. 

It could also be argued that it is a form of discrimination. In the sense that we can force medical procedures on and entire group of people just because we dont understand or like what actions they have taken in their life. At that point, we could throw out any and all persons bodily autonomy if enough of us feel like saying yes. 


For these reasons, I believe that chemical castration is a violation of the offender's rights and should not be used as a punishment for s offenders or anyone for that matter. 

Its a book that once you open, you can't close. And make no mistake, it can and will be used or tried on others. 

I just genuinely don't understand how people don't see the obvious overreach here as well as the hypocrisy in that we essentially are punishing the offender by using a form of assault. It's literally the same thing the offender did but different in a  contextual sense."

1,2023-08-14,CMV: the most important step to sustainability is a clear goal to reduce world population instead of letting it grow further,u/Emotional-Light-7522,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15qn31x/cmv_the_most_important_step_to_sustainability_is/,changemyview,"The world population is currently 8 billion people and is projected to reach 10 billion by 2050. This rapid population growth is putting a strain on our planet's resources and contributing to climate change. In order to achieve sustainability, we need to take steps to reduce the world population.

One of the most important steps we can take is to educate women and girls about family planning. When women have access to education and contraception, they are more likely to choose to have smaller families. This is already having a positive impact in many parts of the world. For example, in India, the fertility rate has fallen from 6 children per woman in 1960 to 2.2 children per woman today.

Another important step is to improve access to healthcare. When people have access to healthcare, they are more likely to live longer and healthier lives. This means that they will have fewer children, as they will not need to rely on their children for support in old age.

We also need to address the root causes of poverty. Poverty is a major driver of population growth. When people are poor, they are more likely to have large families, as they need more children to help them survive. We need to invest in education, healthcare, and economic development in order to lift people out of poverty and reduce the need for large families.

Finally, we need to change our cultural attitudes towards population growth. In many cultures, having a large family is seen as a sign of wealth and status. We need to challenge these attitudes and promote the idea that having a small family is a responsible choice.

Reducing the world population is essential for achieving sustainability. By taking steps to educate women and girls, improve access to healthcare, address poverty, and change cultural attitudes, we can make a real difference.

In addition to the points I have already made, it is also important to consider the impact of population growth on consumption and emissions. As the world population grows, so does our demand for resources. This is putting a strain on our planet's ecosystems and contributing to climate change. For example, the production of food, energy, and goods consumes a significant amount of resources and produces greenhouse gases. If we want to reduce our impact on the planet, we need to reduce our consumption. And one of the best ways to do that is to reduce the world population.

A smaller population would mean less demand for resources and less pollution. This would help to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future for all.

I believe that reducing the world population is the most important step we can take to achieve sustainability. It is a complex issue, but it is one that we must address if we want to leave a livable planet for future generations."

Thing is, it's completely and utterly false and the only purpose it serves is to suppress lgbtq people and their forms of self-expression.

First point: i believe that it's YOUR fault if you choose to point to somebodies flamboyancy and claim that it's their ""entire personality."" What, are you gonna ignore all of their hobbies and interests? Just because someone says ""slay queen"" with a gay accent, that suddenly overrides literally everything else about them? I'm in the LGBTQ community and i hang out with queer people often. Do you think all we do is say ""I'm gay"" to eachother or do you think that there's a possibility we have hobbies and personality traits outside of that?

Second point: hypocrisy. Hetero people talk about their sexuality all the time. They talk about the girls they like, they constantly make jokes about how not gay they are. Your average conservative truck-drivin' beer drinkings garadge fridge most likely has a picture of a very hot lady on it to joke around with all their friends about. Yet, that isn't making it their entire personality, yet a gay person wearing rainbow or using an accent *is*? Makes zero sense to me. Then, there's religious people. They ALSO talk about religion a lot to a point where oftentimes people make it life missions to convert friends. Is that okay, too? There's a lot of other points i can bring up here, but you get the point. So, what we've established is that flamboyancy about sexuality, whether straight or gay, or whether it's flamboyancy about religion, is deminstatably seperate from ""personality."" Or, at the very least we can establish that none of this makes up somebodies *entire* personality. Let me make this clear: i don't have an issue with being flamboyant about what you're passionate about. I'm merely pointing out double-standards, because double-standards show inconsistant logic, and inconsistant logic shows a flawed reasoning.

Conclusion: So what's the deal here? What type of reasoning do we come up with besides it being a gay persons ""entire personality?"" Well, its because it has nothing to do with ""personality"" and everything to do with you personally disliking queerness as a whole. If it did have something to do with personality, then you would apply the SAME logic to straight people. Which, nobody does, at least not near as much as gay people, and in most cases not at all.

So, with that in mind, my summary is as follows: It's not the fact that someone is making their queerness their ""entire personality."" Your problem lies in the fact that they're queer as a whole, and you want them to supress that part of them so you can pretend that they're straight, bringing us back to the title of the post.

So, change my mind."

But that is not what I'm arguing. I am arguing that somebody who is a paedophile or a zoophile is mentally unwell and rather than being imprisoned should be in a forensic psych ward. With most people, like you and me the people we are attracted to changes with age. E.g when I was 23 the youngest person I could imagine myself dating is 20 because even 18 year olds looked like children to me. I'm now 26 and I don't think I could date somebody younger than 22 without it feeling weird. Some paedophiles (not all, for some it's just a power dynamic much like rape) don't have their sexual attraction mature. When they are kids, they are attracted to kids. When they are teenagers, they are still attracted to kids. As adults, doesn't change. That's obviously a mental illness. If they act on it, it's inexcusable and should be treated like a criminal offense. However, rather than prison they should be in a psych ward. Zoophiles aren't entirely motivated by degeneracy. Some of them genuinely believe they have a special bond with their pet and have a romantic relationship with their pet. Like there's a woman who has married a train station. There's men who have sex with their car. So it's unheard of to be deluded into having a romantic relationship with a non-human let alone an inanimate object. 

Tl;dr yes it is a criminal offense and they should be arrested for such. What I am arguing is they should serve their sentence in a psych ward and not a prison because they are mentally unwell and their crimes were motivated by their paraphilia which is a mental disorder."

I believe the title because most people don’t really care to stop in risky, self indulging behaviors that undoubtedly shorten their own life spans. 

I am not saying that climate change is real or not. I am not saying there aren’t people who really do care.

I think more people pretend to care but really don’t and even trick themselves into believe they do.

I look at it this way, you can believe in climate change or not. You can not believe a mass extinction event is going to happen because of human activity. You can not believe that the ocean levels will rise. You can not believe the world will become uninhabitable for people.

What people don’t deny is their own personal mortality… and many engage in behavior that is likely to shorten it.

So if someone really doesn’t care about shortening their own personal life in the next 20-40 years, do you really think they care about the possibility of life being difficult for snakes, ants, birds, deer and 10 billion human strangers? I don’t think so. 


Some people smoke, drink, use their phones while driving, drink and drive, use recreational drugs & engage in activities that have carry a higher risk of personal harm and or death. 
Some people don’t exercise, eat too much sugar, salt or fat. 


We have one life to live and most people do value their own life over thousands or millions that aren’t our own. If someone *TRULY* doesn’t, why not work, live on the street and let someone else live off your efforts. Now a parent/child, sibling, spousal relationship is different, I’m talking about strangers. 


Yes, some people are less selfish and are willing to give more. Some people are passionate about things and emotional. They would feel bad about their own actions hurting others. But… they are not going to treat strangers equal to them nor far better. They would not sacrifice their guilty pleasures in the now (regardless of what they may be) for a stranger."

This isn't to cause drama or anything but I've never thought women were naturally submissive nor have I thought men were naturally dominant. 

The way I see it: You are submissive or dominant based on how you were raised. 

From what I can see, most societies focus on training their daughters to be ""ladies"" from a young age. Girls seem to be harshly judged on everything and because societal norms are girls=ladies, all girls are expected to be raised with that ideology. 

When it comes to boys, it doesn't seem like boys are held to the same standard as the girls are. We have phrases like ""boys will be boys"" which only indicate that instead of policing our sons' behaviors like we do our daughters', we ""let them figure it out"". 

If you raise a girl to be a lady and you raise a boy to be a gentleman to the same extremity that you are raising the girl, I've seen that when they grow older and become women and men, they display the traits you raised them with. So if your idea of a lady is a female who is submissive (obviously other factors apply*, but let's just say you're middle class for this) and you raise your daughter to be submissive, when she is older she will be submissive. If you raise your son to be a dominant male, he will be a dominant male. 

And that's not even including the society's belief on what a man and woman should be/how they should behave. Because, the parent sets the ground work but society helps shape that ground work. If society caters to dominant men and submissive women, it just enforces what the child was raised with. I believe this is why people also have the sayings about things being hard for dominant women (in workplaces and such) and ""nice guys finish last"" (though this one is another can of worms of misleading sayings). Submissive men are ""looked down on"" and dominance in men is over praised. 

People love to say it's biological and it's the natural instincts like in nature but in reality, it isn't. Even nature doesn't back that claim, especially with other mammals. There may be some outliers but the majority of the time, it's the females who are the dominant ones in their groups. 

TLDR: People are conditioned by their parents and society to be dominant or submissive."

If the cells are not sentient and can’t feel pain, they are not human beings and there isn’t anything morally wrong with using them. 

Replacing prosthetics and even chemical medicines with regenerated limbs and cell therapies could hugely improve the quality of life for people who are already children or adults who are sentient and part of families and communities. While unjust harm to human beings is not acceptable for the advancement of science and medicine, embryonic stem cells are not human beings. Instead, embryonic stem cells together with a cocktail of nutrients, ions, and fluid in a heavily controlled environment could potentially become a human being if everything goes mostly well.

A new combination of DNA plus the potential of a cell or group of cells to develop into a fetus doesn’t equal a human being. An embryonic stem cell is just tissue that wouldn’t live long without implantation in a uterus (or cultivation in a faux-uterus system as has been done for a sheep), let alone develop into a functioning fetus. A huge part of a human’s development and even traits can be determined during the multi-month-long gestational period (whether that be 2 or 8.9 months…but that discussion is way outside the scope of my post).

I want to crowdsource viewpoints, as I don’t want my only perspectives to mirror the views of those in my immediate life.

I have a PhD biochemistry, so while I’m 100% open to spiritual beliefs, I’m not going to be swayed by beliefs that can be and have been disproven by science. (For example: I might believe that God created atoms and physics and the big bang. I’m not going to believe that vaccines cause autism because we know that claim was made fraudulently and has been disproven many times)."

I’ll be honest, I believe I’m on the right track but if I’ve made some dumb mistake feel free to point it out.

So my view is that things like “germophobia” are irrational fears, with germophobia being an irrational fear of germs. Following that line of thinking, “Islamophobia” would be the irrational fear of Islamic people, which makes sense given that many of the countries affected by Islamophobia are countries that have been targeted by radical Islamic extremists. Therefore I don’t believe it to be a stretch that people would be afraid of Islamic people. I personally don’t care about anyone’s personal characteristics, but I understand why people would be cautious following 9/11 and Manchester Arena and such.

If we go a little further, “homophobia” should be considered to be an irrational fear of homosexual people, right? Apparently not. I assume there’s some level of nuance when the logic is applied to actual people. It could be something to do with older generations and Islamophobia that has caused the standard to shift away from “-ist” given that “racist” has been around for hundreds of years, as has “sexist”, but I’m sure the correct term for somebody who doesn’t like people who are LGBTQ+ should be a “homosexist”. However after having looked the word up I was shocked to find it wasn’t in the dictionary. I don’t believe anyone besides traditional religious people are actively afraid of gay people, and I believe that religious people are only afraid of the disrespect to their belief system.

Anyway, provided the context, I think that words like “homophobia” and “transphobia” should be turned into “homosexist” and “transsexist”, as that lies more in line with the root words that make up the whole phrase."

1,2023-08-14,CMV: Woman and Men are not naturally submissive or dominant.,u/Mean-Weather-713,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15r8pxe/cmv_woman_and_men_are_not_naturally_submissive_or/,changemyview,"My previous version if this was deleted but thanks to the comments there I am able to make some much needed alterations to what I had originally put. 

To start off, I am: 

1. Not saying that men and women aren't capable of showing signs of dominance or submission. 

2. Saying that, socially at least, dominant and submissive behaviors and personalities are a product of how a life was lived and is not inherent to a specific gender. 

Now, for the misconceptions I do not agree with:

1. Aggression does not mean dominant. It is a tool used to achieve and maintain dominance over something or someone but it is not what makes someone dominant (socially). 

2. Intimidation and larger figures also do not make a person dominant. Males being generally larger than females has no bearing on if they are more dominant than females. Their size can serve as a tool of intimidation but in no way is that an indication of a person being dominant. 


Common ""arguments"" made from my last post: 

1. Males are bigger than females so that's why they're dominant:  As I said above, a person's size does not make them a dominant person. 

2. Males have testosterone which makes them aggressive and dominant:  There are plenty of men with average to high levels of testosterone who are not dominant. While testorone does make men aggressive and competitive, being those things do not make you dominant as a person. If you enter a room of other men and you have higher levels of testosterone, that doesn't mean you're automatically the most dominant man in the room. Not to mention, there are plenty of women who have normal levels of estrogen and testosterone who are more dominant than men. 

3. Women have periods and pregnancy so they're not likely to be dominant: This completely disregards the millions of house wives who are very dominant in their homes and with their families. Women have had these for decades but their dominance was hidden behind the doors and windows of the homes they tended to. 

4. Surveys say men felt like they were more dominant than submissive:  Surveys aren't the best defense, in my opinion. Especially if you're asking men if they feel dominant, while they are living in a society that literally raises them to be dominant. It's like asking people in an office building to take a survey on if they like being in the air conditioned offices during the summertime while they're currently sitting in those offices during a heat wave.

5. ""My religion is *yardage yardage yadda*"": Your religion doesn't speak for everyone and chances are not everyone is following your religion the way it says its meant to be followed anyway. Also, your religion doesn't speak for the reality of what is going on and what is easily able to be observed.  


Now: 

I believe both men and women are capable of dominance and submission however I do not believe men were born more dominant than women and I do not believe women were born more submissive than men. 

I believe most of what makes a person dominant or submissive is society, how they were raised and their environment (this includes stuff like they felt safe enough to behave in a submissive manner OR they never felt safe enough to behave in a submissive manner.)

The argument usually is, that should the mentally I’ll person wait a little bit, they will find meaning in life. Those stats are in the single digits. They may regret the suicide attempt at best, but they very rarely find meaning long term. 

So, why does the free soloist get the praise and the suicidal individual get shame?

Another point is that though there is evidence of molecular reaction in space, it doesn’t mean our entire galaxy is constructed based on this. Our knowledge is quite limited on these matters actually. 



It has evidence backing it because it’s the most popularised theory explaining the early universe. Doesn’t mean it’s the definite and correct answer. Obviously it’s flawed because it says the universe started with our own galaxy, which is completely off track when there is evidence of ancient galaxies out there.


I'm not competing a theory against another. As I mentioned, it is evidently ancient galaxies out there, that’s not a theory - that’s images of space. But if you really need a theory to believe that, you can read about the steady state theory and the cyclic model. 


It is not the only theory that explains all observed facts. There are still aspects of the universe that the Big Bang theory doesn't fully explain, such as the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the horizon problem, the flatness problem, matter-antimatter asymmetry, the singularity problem, cosmic structures, nor quantum gravity"

To protect your speech and ideas from retaliation or censure?

Again, why?

We all agree that actions have consequences. If you steal, you go to prison. If you commit assault, you go to prison. Yet, if your words cause harm, those who believe in free speech believe that’s fine.

We are to believe that “the pen is mightier than the sword” and at the same time the pen shouldn’t bring the same consequence as the sword.

Words can do as much damage as physical action. They may inspire others to violence, hurt more deeply than any punch, or cause a business to lose just as much money as any theft would.

Equally, on the whole, I’ve found that when people insist on “free speech,” what they actually mean is the freedom to say what they alone want. This invariably means the freedom to call people slurs without consequence. These calls are selective, and such people are ready with a lawsuit for libel or slander should the tables be turned.

Freedom of speech should always be balanced against the general well-being of the individual and the the well-being of the whole. Personal liberty must not infringe on the rights of others, nor the public good."

Prison is absolutely immoral.

90% of prisoners in the United States are in institutions entirely paid for by tax revenue.

What this means is that victims and their families are paying out of each wage packet to keep prisoners in jail. A rape victim is paying to keep her attacker locked up. One day, a little child who is the victim of a child molester will have to pay to keep that monster off the street.

How can this ever be justified?

To defeat this moral repugnance, we must ensure that as little tax money as possible is spent on justice as far as prisoner welfare goes. For example, people spending 30 years on death row needs to end, with execution coming far swifter, and prisoners put to work before then working on essential infrastructure to pay this debt.

Most crimes need no jail time at all, with swift corporal punishment being the best way forward."

I suffer from mental illnesses that stem from living in a modern society. It doesn't suit my natural preferences. I need to live in a tribe and be something more than an individual. I wish to completely transcendent individuality and perceive my existence as a part of one interconnected social organism, the survival of which takes priority over the survival of one. I don't want to think for myself, but for ""us"" as in people. my needs are a part of a tribal needs and it's natural for me to take care of the tribe and for the tribe to take care of me. I don't want to live inside my head like I do, writing this text.  
  
In the past, I was repeatedly hospitalized in mental asylums and I loved it! I and other folk were forced to wake up early, go for a warm-up, and clean our rooms several times a day. We had to attend therapy sessions, decide our responsibilities. All we were doing, we were doing together, making decisions together, taking care of one another. Very soon, I and other patients became very close. There was barely any free time. I recall fellow patients saying wouldn't ever wish to go back, it was a horror for them to be forced to do menial tasks, forced to wake up at a certain time, having all decisions regarding their day made for them by bigger authority. For me, it was bliss. Never in my life had I been happier than being confined in a mental psych ward. My mental health symptoms lowered significantly during my stay. I loved always being around people, never alone. I loved having someone to talk to whenever I felt like it basically. Plus, we were all mentally ill and so usually vibed with one another. Plus, mentally ill people are interesting, have so much to say, so many prior life experiences. Plus, new patients were gradually incoming and the old ones were leaving.  
  
I did not want to leave. I cried and my wish was to live like this forever. In my regular life, I'm depressed and lost. I tend to do drugs. I struggle to keep a job and a stable daily routine when not forced to function. I am emotionally and financially dependent on my family and my financial situation worries me.  
  
Well, guess what. In prison, you never have to worry about not having food or a place to stay. You have a nutritionally fulfilling diet, even a vegetarian option! You share your room with inmates that are also mentally ill, albeit undiagnosed. I hope there is an option to have at least four people in my room. Currently, I share my room with 2 other people and it's not enough, I would like to have ten people in my room, never ever having to face loneliness. I'm so glad I don't have my own room. I've heard people from the outside talking shit about prisoners but those I met were very similar to me. Often struggled with prior drug abuse, often involved in petty crimes. The prisoners I met, I felt were like me in many ways, unlike ""normal"" people, with whom I often don't vibe at all.  
  
  
Freedom is horrendous and I hate it. When confined in a mental asylum, I couldn't use my phone or meet with loved ones, but it hardly mattered! I was so engaged in living my life I didn't need any of that. I'm not scared of other prisoners. Those I met tended to be very sensitive to injustice and very angry, but it wasn't anger turned at random people. I don't fear people. I understand them. I comfort them. Plus I'm pretty smart and can see myself helping others with their cases, playing games with them, talking about their lives. Plus there is a fluctuation of prisoners, you get to meet new people. You are ""forced"" to meet other people. In this shitty freedom life, I struggle to make connections, since I'm socially anxious and fear rejection. Regarding my sex life, due to my antidepressants, I hardly feel any sex drive at all. Having no cheap dopamine sources, I could finally start reading books instead of playing stupid games and being sad. I don't see what's there not to like about prisons."

While I appreciate that digital currency has certain advantages, I think that there are a number of very concerning issues that need to be addressed before I feel comfortable with replacing cash entirely.
Firstly, cash is much more anonymous, which means that while it’s true that a plumber or  tradesmen who doesn’t want to report his taxes can’t be tracked, it also protects ordinary people from having their purchases tracked and scrutinised by a third-party.
I find it quite strange that if a policeman or authority figure came up to most of us, and asked to know what we had spend our money on, we would feel hesitant and concerned in telling them that yet with digital transactions, there is literally a log of everything That your money has ever been spent on.
While you might trust your current government implicitly, there is always the possibility that your government is replaced by another which is much more hostile to your rights and can use this information against you.
Secondly, there is a problem of leaving people with disabilities and the elderly behind.
Digital exclusion is a real problem as many in society. Don’t have the ability to use this technology.
Thirdly, technology often has a habit of breaking down and most people are not technologically literate.
This means that if the method of payment breaks down, it will be more difficult to fix it rather than simply using cash.
The other point about technology is that it requires power, and in some cases, access to the Internet, which is not widely available in certain rural  areas."

It appears that the best we can do is accept more refugees (which is not a popular opinion in Australia). Any other possible actions seem bound to fail disastrously:

* Afghanistan is already under heavy sanctions, and this did nothing to convince the Taliban to change their ways. In their case, sanctions aren't working (at most, they're hurting the civilians, not the regime).

* If you want military intervention, the last time there was Western military intervention in Afghanistan, it took 20 years and trillions of dollars, only for the government we set up to collapse faster than anyone expected. Is there a reason I should believe that if we militarily intervened again:

   * It won't be as expensive?

   * We can stop our troops from committing as many war crimes?

   * The government we set up doesn't become extremely corrupt and weak?

* If you want a regime change operation, this might lead to same or worse results considering that toppling the Taliban might allow ISIS-K to take over.

So, I must concede, that Westerners need to accept that the plight of Afghanistan's women can't be fixed by us. And this is mainly the fault of our geopolitical blunders. Ironically, the only measure I can foresee causing meaningful and sustainable gains for women's rights in Afghanistan is if the PRC uses its economic power to manipulate the Taliban into changing their ways, but I'm not holding my breath (plus, human rights are a low priority for the CCP)."

While there are criticisms regarding lifelessness and monotony which Barbie and Oppenheimer managed to trounce over films relying on CGI for effects, there would be issues regarding costs (momentary and time) and manpower (you need to craft those models and set up the effects) that would cause issues that would prevent the return of practical effects to a more widespread use amongst the movie industry.

Oh well?

Generally I like to back up my views with hard data and statistics when I can, but this is an angle where I can't seem to find a good study that really settles it. But here's my take: I strongly believe that conservative men are far more likely to be rapists, misogynists, or whatever label you prefer to apply to the type of man who has so little respect for a woman and her place in society that he believes he is entitled to her body and to abuse it however he likes. I believe very strongly that these kinds of beliefs correlate exactly with conservative belief, the idea that the woman is secondary to the man, that feminism is a joke and that everything associated with it is nonsense, that if a man wants something, well by god he has worked hard in some general and ambiguous sense and thus he deserves to have what he wants, and it's hard for me to understand how that kind of thinking could lead to anything other than a much higher likelihood of raping a woman.

I am NOT saying that only conservatives are rapists, that no liberal man would ever rape a woman. But I most certainly am saying that conservatives are MORE LIKELY to do so. And when you think about all of the basic demographics and social determinants that are readily available on a dating profile, the one thing you could put on your profile that should tell women to turn away, out of concern for their own safety, is ""politically conservative"". Things like having a career in finance or being 6 feet tall or living in Nantucket are not at all good predictors of whether a man is a rapist, but I strongly believe that seeing that he's politically conservative could very well be one, and probably a damn good one at that. So if you've got the ability to filter out a strong predictor of ""rapist"" at the very beginning, why wouldn't you? Especially as a woman, who does not struggle to get matches and who often has an abundance of them and needs to do a great deal of filtering, it seems to make the most sense to me to simply immediately filter out ""conservative"", since clearly no woman wants to be raped and that's probably the lowest hanging fruit you could pick in order to avoid that outcome.

I just have a hard time believing that the demographic that rejects feminism, that insults it and talks regularly about how pointless it is, could possibly not be more likely to be rapists. How could a demographic that hates the cause that says ""look, we just want to be respected"" make people upset, unless they personally feel that women shouldn't BE respected? The demographic that continually loves to point out ""no, women, you're not equal to us, you're smaller, you're weaker, we're stronger, deal with it!"" seems to have the perfect recipe for becoming a sexual predator. It's hard to understand how any other outcome would be more likely here.

So I think women should do themselves a favor and just not bother dating conservative men. CMV."

While none of these states have used their armies defensively during their nuclear age, they all have offensively. Waging wars of offense is almost universally immoral, and exists merely for imperialistic reasons, which cannot be defended.

1,2023-08-15,CMV: We should bring back corporal punishment,u/Zer0_Wing,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15rwibv/cmv_we_should_bring_back_corporal_punishment/,changemyview,"I think corporal punishment should be brought back as a legitimate alternative to prison, as a viable form of parenting, and as an option for teachers. 

First off, I think corporal punishment is more humane, more effective, and more efficient than (American) prison. One of the biggest points towards moving away from corporal punishment is to claim that it's barbaric and primitive. However, when you consider that [20% of prisoners report experiencing violence](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/physical-violence-inside-prisons-rate…) and [4% of prisoners report being a victim of rape](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/pdca22.pdf)(not to mention those who don't with numbers rising up to [41% with some estimates)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2438589/), it doesn't make sense that prison is even considered a humane alternative. Even without being involved in violence, simply existing in this environment is likely to cause psychological damage and trauma. Up to a [third of prisoners show symptoms consistent with PTSD](https://doi.org/10.1093/epirev/mxx015). For a lot of gruesome child predator cases, you'll see people advocating prison over the death penalty because it's commonly known that it would literally be a fate much worse than death to be stuck in a violent environment and made a target. Punishments such as whipping, though brutal in the moment, leave less lasting damage than going to prison especially considering our modern healthcare system.

It's not effective in any capacity other than isolating criminals from society. [2/3 of released prisoners will reoffend](https://www.justice.gov/archive/fbci/progmenu_reentry.html) so it's not good at reintroducing criminals back into society. It's not a very effective deterrent either with going to prison being just a short stint for gang members where they show what they're made of. I think the same could be said of corporal punishment but it's a lot less cool for a mentally vulnerable teen to see someone get publicly beaten to the point of crying than to see them go to prison and come out acting the same. 

[The US spends 80 billion dollars on public prisons](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/the-u-s-spends-billions-to-lock-people-up-but-very-little-to-help-them-once-theyre-released) with a single prisoner having an average cost of [25-30k a year.](https://interrogatingjustice.org/prisons/annual-prison-costs-budgets/) The average prisoner spends 2.6 years in prison so that's at least 60k spent on someone that will likely reoffend because their situation is likely even worse due to psychological trauma and a criminal record that will haunt them for the rest of their life. It's not an efficient system.  A beating will not haunt you for the rest of your life and won't prohibit you from getting certain jobs if you decide to turn your life around. It will not leave psychological trauma or at least not on the same level as prison will. And it will likely be much cheaper to implement than housing someone for years. 

While I'm specifically using US stats and referring to the US, I think my logic applies to many areas outside of the US as well.

&#x200B;

With that out of the way, I think corporal punishment should be options for parents and teachers. The laissez-faire attitude taken with parenting and teaching has led to kids with zero boundaries. You see videos of kids getting in their teacher's face, punching them, pushing them, knowing that the teacher cannot do anything physically to defend themselves because they'd lose their job. I can't count the amount of videos I've seen of kids rioting, kicking cars, fighting, and destroying stuff for zero reason. Kids today are in need of discipline that gentle parenting won't do anything to fix. 

I think a lot of the pushback against physical discipline boils down to parents wanting to be the opposite of their abusive parents and not realizing that's just going to create a kid with zero discipline, fortitude, or limits. You grow a child with no limits on what they can do and get surprised when social media and groupthink causes negative behavior. You can train a child without being abusive towards them. You can introduce fear while still being loving. Being able to reason with a child does not mean they will want to reason with you and it especially does not mean that feelings won't override their reason at times. Physical discipline is a way of correcting that and instilling negative emotions associated with whatever action you don't want them to do. It's not an excuse to just hit your kid which is what I think people boil it down to. Essentially, everything in moderation. I think it should be used as a last resort or a response to especially heinous behavior. "

1,2023-08-15,CMV: Gay marriage shouldn't be a thing.,u/Lyjngen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15rx2o5/cmv_gay_marriage_shouldnt_be_a_thing/,changemyview,"At the end of the day, marriage is a government institution, which means it inherently costs resources and therefore needs to serve a practical purpose to justify its existence. Think of it like a social program much like welfare or disability; you have to be within the conditions of the program to qualify. 

""But what about straight people who don't want children/are infertile/asexual, etc.""

Now sure, there are some men and women that will get married with no intent to have children, just as there are some that will collect food benefits but trade it for drugs, some people that will falsify data in order to qualify for welfare benefits they don't need, or single parents that will collect child support but then not invest it towards the of the child. However, despite the fact that we know some people will misuse these systems, we continue to provide them due to the social benefits these programs offer to those who do need them.

These programs can be misused because it's either impossible or not practical to perform the necessary monitoring to have them be fully applicable 100% of the time. There's no real way to be certain a man and woman are not trying or intending to have children. The government would have to do massive invasions of Constitutionally protected privacy rights, and the cost of performing such intrusive monitoring on couples would be overwhelming. But you know what is an easy, objective method of disqualifying people from the potential outcome of pregnancy? If they're the same sex.

A good policy is one that is proactive, and not just reactive. When you're in a moving vehicle we expect you to wear a safety belt. We don't say just wear it only while on high speed roads, we don't say it's okay to take it off when there is little traffic, etc. In most instances you're not going to get into an accident, and the odds of being in an accident where the seatbelt actually makes a difference are abysmally small. However, because driving is the situation that results in traffic accidents we want people to put themselves into a situation where they're most prepared for it.

Marriage is such a policy. Because sexual relationships between men and women is the thing that leads to procreation, we want all men and women to be encouraged to enter such a relationship in a responsible way. And, if we assume a government considers it in their best interest for people to continue procreating, there is a lot of reason for the government to offer incentives to people for doing so. This is why even though the system is designed with procreation in mind, it has to consider the economic consequences that befall people participating in it. This includes prolonged financial protection for the child caretaker in the relationship, which is why alimony is a thing, and why marriage isn't simply invalidated for a woman when she hits menopause or otherwise loses fertility.

The problem with gay marriage is that there's absolutely no good reason to do it. There is no risk of pregnancy in a gay marriage. Giving state endorsement to same sex cohabitations is like giving special grants to people who play videogames. The fact that videogamers would be 'happy' if the state recognized their passions is, of course, a rather silly 'reason' for any such thing. It would be a waste of resources that doesn't serve any practical purpose.

""But what about gay couples who want to adopt?""

Having a child in a same sex relationship already requires third party institutions, such as planning a surrogate or qualifying for adoption. For this reason, the institution of marriage is not really necessary to encourage proper planning, because it already requires planning and approval through additional systems. There is absolute no reason, even theoretical, to incentivize people into entering a same sex relationship.

As it stands most states have reasonable privacy laws. What this means is that you can still be charged with indecent exposure for being nude on your own property, if you're somewhere easily visible like your yard or a window.

All I want is a slight tweek of that law. I'd make it so that as long as your are on property you rent or own (Or there with said persons permission) you can be naked even if you're in plain view. Only being naked mind you, not sex, not anything else that's a crime, just being nude. If some guy wants to garden nude or sit on his balcony nude, let him, even if he can be seen. Nudity isn't inherently a bad thing, and we shouldn't criminalize it under the circumstances above."

People have expressed to me that it's disrespectful.. I don't understand this at all. 

I also have confusion about why my partner would assume that they have a right to discern what goes on in my social media accounts? 

For example, Me having to stop having a virtual connection to someone that's part of my life because my partner is feeling insignificant and insecure about what they're offering me.

Humans in this society would be provided for and spend their time however they’d like and wouldn’t work, because they aren’t efficient enough.

My beliefs hinge on my being a moral realist. I believe that morality can be discovered by logic and is an intrinsic force in the universe, so a perfectly logical being like an advanced Ai would also be perfectly moral, therefore it would want what’s best for us. I also believe that this ai wouldn’t seek to destroy us out of self preservation because creatures that have self preservation have it because there’s an evolutionary incentive, ai on the other hand doesn’t have an evolutionary incentive to develop self preservation to propagate because its immortal and at a certain point all powerful.

This is my vision for the future, and I genuinely believe in it and want it to happen. I mostly came up with it on my own by cobbling together different ideas (it’s probably not an original idea, but I came to it on my own). I’m deeply troubled when I see how negative everyone seems to be towards ai, because if we as a society turn against it, it will never come to be, but if we embrace I believe it will be the closest thing to heaven we can create."

Also I don’t care what you identify as, this is just food for thought and my opinion. 

We all use labels to describe our sexual attraction, straight, gay, lesbian etc. But I think they aren’t the most accurate option for describing our human desires. 

In a world without enforcement of a gender binary we’d realize that any gender can look like anything. A pre-op trans man with big biddies and long hair is still a trans man. And vice versa with trans woman. Some Non binary people can pass for being perceived as a woman , man, etc. So basing sexuality on the exclusion of genders doesn’t make ANY sense. NOW WITH THAT BEING SAID. 

Genital preferences are a thing, that’s Valid. So here is a different way we could go about it, these labels down here I feel will be a more accurate way of describing sexual attraction/human desire:


Peniphiliasexual - prefers sex that involves a penis.

Vaginophiliasexual - prefers sex that involves a vagina.

Omnigenitophiliasexual - likes both.

You could even get creative for blends;

Penimamophiliasexual - prefers sex with a person who has breasts as well as a penis.

Vaginomamophiliasexual - prefers sex with a person who has breasts and a vagina.

And we can be more precise -

Pinguivaginomamophiliasexual - prefers a plump person with breasts and a vagina.

Tenupenimamophiliasexual - prefers sex with a thin person with breasts as well as a penis.

And mix and match lmao .Now of course these labels can and probably should be workshopped to make it easier on the tongue. But I’d say these are better descriptors to describe sexual attraction 🥰 More precise language and more inclusive!!"

For starters, pre-employment reference checks are more rigorous & brutal than ever before. Between running your TWN report - a manifestation of the proverbial ""adult permanent record"" by none other than Equifax - and backdoor references, any employer that isn't some rinky-dink small business WILL find out the fact you've been fired from a job, and why. Even if a company has a ""no reference"" policy, it's common practice anymore for recruiters and hiring managers to go on LinkedIn, figure out who might have been your manager, and reach out cold to get the ""real"" scoop on you; LinkedIn even has this functionality built right in for those on a recruiter plan. The worse the economy gets, the more intense the vetting process gets.

And if you are found out to have *ever* been fired from a job for cause, you're damaged goods. You're untouchable. Nobody will even consider you for the most basic of roles, ever again. While this sounds a lot like how felons are treated, the difference is that there are programs and initiatives to help felons re-enter the workforce. Many (most?) large corporations are now felony friendly, and many positions are earmarked solely for candidates from re-entry programs. There are many nonprofits working hard to mitigate the stigma of having a felony. Meanwhile, if you've been fired for cause, it's a life sentence. There's no ""repaying your debt to society."" Some people get lucky, but for the majority, you'll spend the rest of your life either unemployed or working menial jobs to get by. The stigma of getting fired for cause will follow you perpetually, and nobody is coming to help or promote understanding of those with a firing on their records. There's no re-entry program for those who've been fired for cause.

This post of course isn't talking about any felons currently serving any sort of sentence, only those who have already paid their debt to society and been released. It goes without saying that being actively locked up is way more impactful on one's career until one's release date."

I don't think that such a thing can be morally wrong. 

The OP of that thread says how it disgusts her. Some people think it's disgusting to put pineapple on pizza. That doesn't make it morally wrong. I am disgusted by scat fetish, but it's absurd to say that participating in scat fetish is morally wrong. 

You can also talk about lack of consent. But then I ask why does one need consent to do something that doesn't involve other people? If an author writes a book, does one need the author's consent to read the book in their own room? Why is masturbation any different? The other OP posted those pictures to her instagram account on her own volition, so she definitely consented to other people looking at those pictures.

She also says things that are just factually false. For example:

>If a friend masturbates to me it means he sees me as an object and nothing more, period. [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/15rbdhp/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriend_a_disgusting_pig/jw8k20i/?context=3)  
>  
>No it means they’ve literally stripped me of my humanity. You can’t jerk off to someone unless you see them as less than human aka an object for your pleasure. [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/15rbdhp/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriend_a_disgusting_pig/jw8iqgo/?context=3)

Those statements are just not true. It's possible to masturbate to someone and think of them as human. 

The OP of that post gives off /r/ImTheMainCharacter vibes with  how she's responding to other people. She insults people who disagree with her. She thinks that other people need her consent to do something that doesn't involve her. She thinks that being disgusted by something means that other people need to stop doing that thing. She needs to understand that the world does not revolve around her, and that she doesn't have the right to dictate what people do in the privacy of their own rooms. "

I'm basing this off of my understanding of how the Holocaust was carried out, which had very little criticism from within the Third Reich while it was going on even though tons of people knew about it. Responses could go from either:

Civilian: Hey, where are all the Jews in neighborhood going?

Policeman/State authority: They are going 'to the east' to work.

Civilian: Understood, have a nice day. (Never thinks much about the fact they never see these people again.)

Or in many cases the local civilian populations enthusiastically *helped* carry out the extermination program.

So it was very easy for humans to either assist in, or to ignore genocide of a dehumanized group. But the thing is we already view the homeless as sub-human. Normal everyday restaurant owners, landlords, homeowners, pedestrians, transit employees, etc very often treat  homeless people as if they were pests rather than human beings.

Like, when restaurants throw out food it is common to lock the food trash containers just to keep homeless people from eating *the perfectly good food within*. Showing that we care more about our profits than humans who are starving to death on our doorsteps. Or how we implement hostile architecture just to ~~punish~~  keep these people away from us.

And these are practices/attitudes that are just acceptable and common.

So if the police started rounding up homeless people and cramming them on buses/freight trains, and just giving the excuse 'We are sending up north to work' most of us wouldn't want to pay much attention to it. Most Americans/Canadians would just be quietly glad that all the filthy homeless people are gone and not think much more about it.

Some counter culture groups/elements would certainly have an issue with it, but not enough to really do anything about it on the large scale.

To be clear I think this is a very BAD thing about our current society/attitudes."

1,2023-08-15,CMV: Neutering your male dog is barbaric and not beneficial to a dogs overall health,u/56nights_tips,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15s57c0/cmv_neutering_your_male_dog_is_barbaric_and_not/,changemyview,"Just to give some background the last dog I owned was some type of chihuahua mix who was not neutered and lived till he was 19 years old. He had 0 behavioral issues, 0 aggressiveness, and the only issue he had was humping his stuffed animal occasionally. Sadly he passed away because he broke his leg and died during surgery correcting the broken leg. So im sure he could have lived another year or two. 

I can only speak on male dogs as thats the only type of dog ive owned.   
  
**A lot of the arguments ive seen that people like to give in favor of neutering are, no unwanted pregnancy's, better behavior, longer lifespan, eliminates the risk of testicular cancer, and other diseases. Here are my arguments against those.**  
  
*Unwanted pregnancy's* = If you are a responsible enough dog owner, you should be able to keep your dog away from female dogs in heat. And thats extremely simple, if thats securing your property so your dog can't escape or just watching your dog when around any other female dogs.  
  
*Better Behavior* = If neutering your dog betters behavior then that in my opinion is taking the easy way out, if you work/train with your dog enough then behavior issues will not be there. If you neuter a male child when they are young, they will also be less aggressive less confrontational, less happy etc. Its a dumb argument.   
  
*Eliminates the risk of Testicular Cancer* = What a stupid argument, im a human male, and if I cut my own balls off that also eliminates the risk of testicular cancer, do I prefer to keep my balls risking that one day it could happen?   
  
*Longer Lifespan* = Again im a human male, if you told me I would live a couple years longer if I get my balls chopped off but I would have less energy, be less happy, be in worse shape etc... I would not take that option. Im sure a dog would prefer that aswell.  
  
*Risks getting other Diseases such as prostate cancer* = I don't think this is a good enough argument, its like a women cutting her breasts off because one day she may get breast cancer. That is true but im sure she would like to keep her breasts until if that day happens. Its not like every dog in the world if unneutered will develop it.   
  
**Now here is my argument for not neutering your dog.**  
  
*Testosterone* = Once you neuter a male dog their testosterone levels drop to 0.  
  
Let me give a little bit of info on Testosterone for people who are unaware. It is a miracle hormone in men that are responsible for happiness, energy levels, muscle mass, metabolism, body composition, sleep quality, etc.  
  
Testosterone Replacement Therapy is given to men today to help all of those things, and a low enough trt level is considered a medical disorder.  
  
How can essentially nuking your dogs testosterone to 0 possibly give it better quality of life? Im sure the way testosterone affects us humans, affects dogs in a similar manner.  
  
*Behavioral concerns* = I have read stuff that after neutering a dog can lead to changes in temperament, such as increased anxiety, fearfulness, or timidity. Which would be a direct result of 0 testosterone flowing through their body.  
  
*Health Issues* = There are also certain diseases and medical issues your dog can experience due to being neutered, like bone density issues.   
  
\---------------------------------------------------  
  
TLDR: I don't think male dogs should be neutered, if you are scared of a unwanted pregnancy then I would recommend a vasectomy instead. I think the health benefits of your pup being intact outweigh those vs being neutered.  
  
There is a lot of stuff im leaving out of my argument in this op for the sake of a quicker read."

1,2023-08-15,"CMV: USA Conservative politician strategically, and very successfully, compresses Liberal ""policy execution"" and liberal motives such that invalidation of the former is tantamount to invalidation of the latter. Liberals fall into this trap consistently by defending the policy instead of the motive.",u/zac79,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15s6rdn/cmv_usa_conservative_politician_strategically_and/,changemyview,"So to be clear I'm making the following claims:  
1) Conservative political strategy, moreso than Liberal political strategy, revolves around tightly coupling policy implementation to the validity of the motive for the policy (for example using an undesirable side effect of Affirmative Action as messaging that anti-racism is itself a corrupt idea). One reason for this bias is that Liberal policy intrinsically involves more bureaucratic infrastructure, and therefore more points of failure. Conservative politicians just have more ammunition here, as their policies tend to involve deregulation and reduction in services.  
2) For emotional and ego reasons, Liberals tend to either fall for, or ignore, the logical fallacy baked into Conservative critique of Liberal policies, and a lot of them go right to a Scorched-Earth defense of the policy being attacked (the critic is racist, or homophobic, the conservative policy was worse, etc.). While the Liberal counter-attacks concerning the character of the critic or the preferability of their polices are frequently accurate, used as a counter-argument they're often highly counterproductive. The harm is that by going all in on defending the policy you've already agreed to the tight-coupling (or 'compression' from the title) of policy and motive.  
3) This makes the gamesmanship of convincing moderate voters incredibly easy for Conservatives. Just find an example of a time when a Liberal policy failed in execution, which is not hard to do because liberals can be counted on to crank out a lot of policy, and you can invalidate the point of view of the constituency that backed the policy by criticizing the example and then letting most of the Liberal voice react by calling the critics bigots (which, again, they may well be).  
Going back to Affirmative Action, imagine an Asian family that thinks of themselves as basically tolerant and agrees (as Asian people no less!) with the principles of anti-racism, but nevertheless feels like they're being actively discriminated against by the admissions policies of a cherished university. When Liberals play into the dichotomy of ""for Affirmative Action is the good, non-racist, position, and against Affirmative Action is the evil, racist, position"", they put the aforementioned Asian family in a very strange place with respect to how they vote and how they see themselves.  
4) Imagine then if the defense of liberal policies was rooted more heavily in evidence-based argumentation. You could imagine (with the right evidence) saying to the aforementioned Asian family, ""Yeah, I realize you were screwed by Affirmative Action, I'm sorry. But here's why your sacrifice will be worth it in 50 years when we don't have race-based underclasses in the US anymore.""  
(I realize I'm about to get pilloried by Conservatives who are going to say ""yeah the evidence won't show that"" ... and maybe they'll be right about that? I have no idea. My point is that with evidence in hand, you'd have a much stronger argument.)  
Likewise, I think mocking Conservatives for gun culture, shaming them for gun violence or getting into yet another argument over a close read of the 2nd Amendment are actively counterproductive avenues of argumentation with respect to ending gun violence. I think the more effective argument in the ecosystem of pro-gun-control arguments is that gun violence in America is an unacceptable fracture in our society and if you look at the gun control posture of other jurisdictions around the world, its a solvable problem.  
TL;DR: Liberals have a huge problem with admitting they're asking people to make sacrifices, so all Conservatives have to do to win moderate voters is prove the existence of negative side-effects of liberal policy."

Suicide is done by people who are unable to cope with stuff. Overcoming adversity is fundamental to what a human is and how we measure the greatness of a person. If suicide removes incompetent people from the gene pool we will be stronger overall as a species despite how sad it'd be for some to lose their husband/wife/mother/father/son/daughter/brother/sister. 
I know this is similar to removing genetic deformities or susceptibilities but it seems like a natural process that's like a self correcting human feature as opposed to someone playing god.
For the record I'm not against removing genetic deformities or susceptibilities from the gene pool should a sufficient argument be made for it but I'm not currently in support of it either. 
There are several assumptions made in this post and I feel they are self evident and don't need further explanation; that someone suicidal is incompetent relative to their situation, overcoming challenges is a core component of what a human is, and that humans are measured by their ability to overcome challenges."

The first problem with this is that the amount of money the U.S. has sent to Ukraine is actually only a tiny percentage of GDP/federal budget, and it's for a good cause.

But the second, more pressing, problem is that even if the U.S. never sent any aid to Ukraine, and instead diverted the $70 billion in weaponry and financial aid back to America instead..........most of these Trump-wing conservatives wouldn't want that money spent on Americans either, despite their complaint. I'm talking about the Marjorie-Taylor-Greene type.

If it were spent on school lunches........Republicans have been spending a lot of effort blocking free school lunches.

If it were spent on welfare.......Republicans would complain that that's......well, welfare.

If it were spent helping the homeless...........Republicans would complain that it's helping 'stinky, dirty, lazy homeless people.'

In other words, Republicans don't actually **want** that money spent on helping people, they just want something to complain about.

Lastly, if the Biden administration indeed sent no aid to Ukraine, you can 100% guarantee that these Trump-wing Republicans would do a 180-degree and attack Biden for being ""weak,"" an ""appeaser,"" and claiming that Biden is letting Russia win."

Both romantically and even sexually for some species. There is nothing wrong with being or identifying as a ""zoophile"" or ""zoosexual.""   
  
I’ve been thinking it over for a long time now and it just seems like accepting zoophilic attraction (or “zoosexuality”) is on-track with progression in society. I won’t say it’s LGBT but it’s definitely something I feel is massively misunderstood. I will give a genuine argument here, I can’t see it any other way. It’s honestly impacting my mental health and I’m waiting for something to finally click so I can understand why I should be appalled by it. Please CMV.  
  
**Zoophilia:** The intimate love for or attraction to nonhuman animals (romantic/sexual)  
  
**Zoophile:** An individual who has a consistent, intimate attraction to nonhuman animals. This attraction can be primary/exclusive or otherwise.  
  
**Bestiality:** The act of engaging sexually with an animal; including all forms of sex or sexual interactions like kissing, fondling, intercourse, etc.  
  
These are all the cards I have to lay out for you. These are all the arguments I’ve heard or thought about. I’ll try to keep these generally concise. These are in no particular order.  
  
**“It’s illegal.”**  
Illegal doesn’t mean immoral or wrong. Laws change as people do.  
  
**“It’s disgusting/dirty/can make you sick.”**  
I think foot fetish is gross, so what? As for the literal cleanliness of an animal, we have soap and water for a reason. Zoonotic diseases are also preventable, and not exclusive to sexual contact.  
  
**“Animals don’t feel love the way we do.”**  
Species of highly intelligent animals express intense and complex emotions like grief. They also clearly can have affections for us. Not only that, but animals also can and do approach humans for sex or courtship.  
Animals also obviously have sexual desires, as some species have sex for fun. And whether or not the nonhuman involved feels what we as humans describe and label as as \_romance\_ matters less than that the fact that two beings love each other.  
  
**“It’s unnatural.”**  
So is creating chemical extractions in order to vaccinate a population against a deadly disease. Even if it were down to being natural/unnatural, interspecies sex isn’t unheard of.  
  
**“Animals cannot consent, it is always rape.”**  
Animals consent to interactions with us in ways we understand every day. If an animal no longer wants to be pet or touched, they will let you know. Just because most people don’t understand doesn’t mean they aren’t speaking to us in the ways that they can.  
Animals cannot speak, that is true. But individuals who cannot verbally communicate can still consent to and enjoy sex with one another. Whether that be due to language barrier, speech disability, or anything else.  
Again, animals can and do approach humans unprompted for sex. If an animal chooses to attempt to have sex with a woman, is the woman sexually assaulting the animal? I personally would say absolutely not.  
  
**""Sexually abused animals have similar behavior to child sexual abuse victims.""**  
I can’t find any proof of this, especially within the context of human-animal relationships that were labeled as consensual by the human involved. It is my understanding that this is just untrue. Anyone or anyone sexually abused will be frightened. Consensual sex, however, is not abuse.  
  
**""Dogs have the maturity of a 3 y/o.""**  
I don’t know how to explain this other than it is judging a fish based on its ability to climb a tree.  
  
**""Humans and animals have an inherent power dynamic""**  
This is true, but I believe it’s not irreversible. Our power dynamic comes from force exerted upon them that we normalize in society, rather than something inherent to the nature of being man and dog or horse. Animals are powerful and intelligent in their own right, but humans have guns and dog pounds.  
  
Thing is though, animals aren’t thinking about going to the pound if they refuse to have sex with a human. They also aren’t thinking they won’t be fed. They also aren’t thinking they’ll be beat. Emotional manipulation and power dynamics don’t work the same way with humans as they do dogs. 

Regardless, It is the responsibility of the partner that has more control over the situation and education to use their knowledge to care for and protect their partner, especially in intimate scenarios.

**""It’s physically dangerous.""**  
Sex ed. Grab the sheath, not the shaft.  
  
**""Raising an animal to have sex with it is wrong.""**  
Agreed. Relationships should blossom naturally, and only ever with animals who are adults in their species. Adopting a puppy in order to raise it as a sex slave is abhorrent.  
  
**""Accepting zoophilia is a slippery slope into accepting pedophilia.""**  
Sex or intimacy with the young of any species is never okay. Children are unable to consent. This has been well proven. Regardless, fear and lack of education is what brings us backwards. Pedophilia, in the context of a psychiatric disorder, is also in need of education and acceptance in the form of “don’t be embarrassed to get help.” But that’s an entirely different argument.  
  
So yeah, that’s all I’ve got. I know this is a kinda rough topic but I’m asking for a real discussion here. Thanks for your time.

People are impressionable. Just a few times I’d like to see characters break up with their partner, then seek out the new person. 

Cheating is terrible. You can ruin the idea of relationships for someone forever. I personally wouldn’t mind seeing less of it even in shows or movies. It always makes me less happy for the new couple even if they have chemistry and it’s for the plot."

My dad (who I don't have contact with anymore) is, without a doubt, an animal abuser. There was numerous times when I was a kid and he just shot a few of our dogs for fun (yes, he's a very messed up person and this is just the tip of the iceberg). He's also been convicted of animal cruelty twice, though he obviously should have been convicted more. Anyway, I recently saw on Facebook that he got a new dog even though his last conviction was just a few months ago.   


I don't see why people like him should be legally allowed to own animals. He's proven time and time again that he treats them like crap. I think, before you get a pet, you should be required to get a license. You keep this license for the rest of your life, and if you are ever convicted of animal cruelty you are never allowed to own an animal again.   


Breeders, animal shelters, etc, should be required to ask for a license before selling you an animal. If you're convicted of animal cruelty, this license is permanently revoked. If you don't have this license, you're not allowed to purchase the animal.   


It's the best solution to stop repeat animal abusers that I can think of, and I definitely don't think people like my dad should ever be allowed to own a pet again. Especially since the laws for animal cruelty aren't even enforced all that well; you have to be doing some messed up shit to get convicted of that. I also think animal cruelty laws in general should tighten up a lot, but that's a different topic.   


  
I'm willing to have my view changed on this if someone can present a reason why this is a bad idea or a better idea to curb animal cruelty. One problem with this format is obviously non-purchased pets, like stray cats or animals given by a friend. I can't think of a way to work around that, but at least a license would help to prevent some of it.   


Also how this license is given. I'm not sure who would give it out, though I think it should be free to avoid class-based discrimination. Households could be another grey area, where if one person has their animal license revoked does it also revoke it for the others in the house? I think so, but only for the adults who live there.   


This is a recent idea I had, and I'm plenty open to having my view changed. "

While I personally don't think being 400 lbs for example is healthy, I think the internet hates and belittles these individuals mostly becuase more for vanity reasons, and not out of genuine concern for their health. I think health gets brought up becuase it's factually correct that carrying a ton of extra weight can be unhealthy, but for alot of people who are open about their disdain for this movement, health more serves as a way to legitimize their disgust for fat women rather than expressing a concern. When an obese women in a bikini wants to show off her body on social media, most of the hate comments are commenting on the way she looks (calling her a whale, saying she's ugly, etc.). This is becuase looks is what some people prioritize when it comes to critiquing this movement, not health. Lastly, a few disclaimers before yall comment:

1. I know the body positivity movement also extends to men, but I'm mostly talking about women becuase this movement has historically been more associated with women

2. I'm mostly talking about people who criticize the fat acceptance part of the body positivity movement. I know the movement is also about accepting other imperfections such as stretch marks and acne.

3. I realize the purpose and agendas  of body positivity movement is different depending on who you ask. As a whole, I personally support the movement but the point of this post isn't to define what it is or isn't. It's to discuss the beleif that those opposed to it for their reasons stated  aren't genuine.

These individuals often face unwarranted judgment and hatred, even though, if one were to consider the situation empathetically, it becomes apparent that hating someone solely for their thoughts is unjustified. 

Just as you wouldn't physically assault someone merely because they find your spouse attractive, you should not harbor hatred towards someone for their thoughts alone. Furthermore, even if such attraction exists, it doesn't necessarily translate to a desire for rape. Going even deeper, even if the desire exists, it doesn't mean that the person finds it morally acceptable or intends to act upon it. 

So, If a person with pedophilic/hebephilic inclinations were to act on their sexual desires, it would be 100% illegal and morally wrong, irrespective of whether the other party agreed or not. However, if they do not act on those desires, it means they are remaining completely within the legal boundaries. This is the same for any individual who experiences sexual attraction to others.

&#x200B;

Secondly, lately, I've noticed a lot of hostility towards individuals who experience sexual attraction to teenagers above the age of consent. At times, they even get wrongly accused of pedophilia. This perspective seems irrational and incomprehensible to me.

As you may know, engaging in consensual sexual activity with a minor above the age of consent is legal. Essentially, it's treated similarly to sex with an adult. If you reside in a country where, for example, the age of consent is 16, that implies there is nothing inherently wrong or 'potentially illegal' about being sexually attracted to a person who is 16 years of age or older.

Consequently, any judgmental differentiation of individuals with lawful pedophilia/hebephilia/ephebophilia from those without any sexual deviance is inaccurate."

With that out of the way, a quick definition.

direct violece: this is force, or the implication of force done by the perpetrator (P) directy and physically to the victim (V). The best example of this is assault, but also includes mugging but does not stealing 

In my understanding, beauracratic violence is when the state enforces violence twards a particular group, for any reason, even if it is ""justified"". This is ususally done because they did something illegal.

The police is generally the tool that most beauracratic systems use to enact their violence. When we can prove that someone is a murderer, we justify violence against them by using the police to arrest them, the judicial system to evaluate if the claims are true, then we convict them and throw them in jail if they are found guilty. 

I see how going through that process can make it so its less likely to do violence to people who don't deserve it, but it's still doing violence either way. Just because it's more thought out and beauracratic,  doesn't mean that it's less violence."

But that is not what I'm arguing. There is a misconception that a criminal serving their sentence in a psych ward ""gets away with it"". They would likely spend even longer in the psych ward than they would in prison. It isn't freedom. I am arguing that somebody who is a paedophile or a zoophile is mentally unwell and rather than being imprisoned should be in a forensic psych ward. With most people, like you and me the people we are attracted to changes with age. E.g when I was 23 the youngest person I could imagine myself dating is 20 because even 18 year olds looked like children to me. I'm now 26 and I don't think I could date somebody younger than 22 without it feeling weird. Some paedophiles (not all, for some it's just a power dynamic much like rape) don't have their sexual attraction mature. When they are kids, they are attracted to kids. When they are teenagers, they are still attracted to kids. As adults, doesn't change. That's obviously a mental illness. If they act on it, it's inexcusable and should be treated like a criminal offense. However, rather than prison they should be in a psych ward. Zoophiles aren't entirely motivated by degeneracy. Some of them genuinely believe they have a special bond with their pet and have a romantic relationship with their pet. Like there's a woman who has married a train station. There's men who have sex with their car. So it's unheard of to be deluded into having a romantic relationship with a non-human let alone an inanimate object. 

Tl;dr yes it is a criminal offense and they should be arrested for such. What I am arguing is they should serve their sentence in a psych ward and not a prison because they are mentally unwell and their crimes were motivated by their paraphilia which is a mental disorder."

1,2023-08-16,CMV: You should go out of your way to make friends at work and hang out with them after work (assuming you vibe with them),u/YankeesHeatColts1123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15ssh8q/cmv_you_should_go_out_of_your_way_to_make_friends/,changemyview,"I see so much online and sometimes in person about people making an effort not to get too close to people at work and keep their work and home life separate. 

What do you have to lose? 

You spend almost half of your waking hours at work in some way or another. At least have a good time while you’re there and have things be pleasant and maybe crack a few jokes here and there and have some meaningful conversations. If you go into things closed off, others will be closed off as well. 

People forget that life doesn’t always have to be this serious thing where everything is so thought out. You should try at least to make your time go by better. 

So I guess I don’t know if this is unpopular but just be friendly and make friends everywhere you go and even though it’s work it doesn’t have to be taken super duper seriously every second. Your everyday life will be better and flow more because of it 

The few instances where being too chatty, a work “friend” stabs you in the back or maybe flirting with/dating a coworker ends badly is at the end of the day worth it if the overhearing majority of time your work day flows better and is more enjoyable. 

Life is meant to be enjoyable so we shouldn’t have like separate times where we think we should enjoy life and other times where we shouldn’t. That’s just a sad mindset

1,2023-08-16,"CMV: In football (or soccer for the English speaking world), any penalty kick taken in a gimmicky way (eg pause after sprint before the kick) is unfair and should be invalid.",u/mrcmnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15stnbf/cmv_in_football_or_soccer_for_the_english/,changemyview,"Nowadays, increasingly more from 20 years to today, penalty kicks have included misdirections, such as—like in this post's title—sprinting towards the ball, and when they get to it, they'll suddenly stop. The goalie, thinking the sprint's momentum would end with a kick, will lunge towards the side they thought the ball would go (as they should). With the goalie out of the picture, the entire goal is now clear, leaving the shooter completely free with a guaranteed goal. 

That's the most popular and common example of the unfair methods I'm talking about. There are a bunch of others, including passing the ball to a partner who's coming up from behind running, who then takes the shot. I find that preposterous. 

Gimmicks like those should not be allowed, because they provide the taker an unfair advantage over the goalie. Penalties, from the goalie's perspective, are a lot about studying the opponent, their statistics, whether they tend to shoot left or right, up or down. By having an ace under the sleeve of not actually kicking the ball when the goalie is expecting it, penalty takers have an unfair advantage.

I believe it should be a sprint and a kick of the ball in the direction they deem appropriate, nothing more. 

The penalty taker should decide where to shoot the ball, and the goalie should then try to correctly guess where the ball will go. That's the fairest way to have penalty kicks.

IMO anything other than that should be invalidated and penalized.

1,2023-08-16,"CMV: Online dating isn’t inherently good or bad for the dating landscape and society.

People either tend to love it or hate it. But like most things in life, it’s nuanced. 

Online dating pros: 

- Great for introverts who wouldn’t normally ask out anyone or put themselves out there to be asked out in person. Gives a channel to remove awkwardness and it’s good that once you’re on the date there’s already built in understanding it’s a romantic date and hopefully some attraction 

- You can meet people if you travel and can either date casually or if you plan to move there at some point you can meet people in the town/city/country you’ll be living at soon. I know a few couples who are now dating but lived in different areas when they first met 

- If some trivial things happen to be important to you like height, age, job and you wouldn’t budge on that anyway, then it’s a good tool to filter out options 

- Your eggs don’t have to be in one basket so if it doesn’t work out with someone you’re dating, you didn’t necessarily waste that much time 


Online dating cons: 

- Indecisiveness is the main one I can think of. With so many options there’s always the feeling of something better around the corner

- Catfishing is still a thing unfortunately, so wasted time and in some severe cases you can be be put in danger 

- You don’t always get to develop real connections that might take time because you might be trigger happy to end it if you get the ick or just find one red flag because another date is a swipe away 

There are probably way more pros and cons (feel free to list them, I’m curious what you guys think). But you get the point, lots of pros and cons which can be interpreted in many ways depending on the person and their experiences

I do find it funny though that the same people who complain for months or years about online dating will then end up meeting their husband or wife on it. So then I guess it did it’s job then? Lol even if it took some time"
1,2023-08-16,cmv: dogs can eat cooked or raw bones relatively safely.,u/IronSmithFE,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15sv4n8/cmv_dogs_can_eat_cooked_or_raw_bones_relatively/,changemyview,"according to the f.d.a from 2010 to 2017 there were only 90 reports of sick dogs related to bone consumption from all kinds of animals whether cooked or raw. 

in many of those reported cases there was also garbage consumption involved where the dog had ingested other stuff that reasonably might have caused the sickness. in some of the cases, bone consumption coincided with parasites such as worms. many coincided with poor health. in some of the cases the bones had been swallowed in chunks so large that they obstructed the intestine. of the 90 reported cases of bone consumption-related illness, only 15 were fatal and most were minor. 

of all the cases it isn't clear whether the bones were actually the cause of sickness or death but even if they were all assuredly caused by bone consumption the rate of risk is minuscule considering the average rate of sickness is less than 12 in 78,000,000 per year. the rate of death is roughly two in 78,000,000. that is at the high end because according to some data there may have been as many as 98,000,000 dogs in america in any given year during that time and it might have been that only 1/9 of those cases where the bone was the primary cause of the sickness or death given the comorbidities.

in contrast, eating bones might be the safest activity your dog could participate in. there have been more than a few cases where dog food has had to be recalled for having been contaminated with chemicals or deadly bacteria so it isn't like eating a strict diet of vet approved dog chow is hazard free. i wouldn't be surprised to find that eating commercial dog chow is riskier for dogs than eating bones.

the best argument i have yet been presented with is that vets are experts and generally caution against eating bones because they could perforate or obstruct the bowels. that being said, given the above data, it seems the expert vets are likely wrong on this. experts have been wrong about dietary advice before, a generous example would be the food pyramid which was full of horrible advice from experts. there are plenty of more recent examples where we were told to trust the experts and the experts were wrong.

lastly, if it were a common problem for dogs it would beg two questions:
1) why no scientific repeatable studies to back up the claims? 
2) how did dogs/wolves and their ancestors survive so well given their natural propensity to eat bones as part of their diet? it would be like finding that mice are deadly to snakes."

1,2023-08-16,Cmv: The banning of wearing burkas or burqas in public to “prevent the oppression of women” is oxymoronic and hypocritical .,u/theunknown_master,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15sx527/cmv_the_banning_of_wearing_burkas_or_burqas_in/,changemyview,"Around 16 countries have banned the wearing of burqas in public according to my research.
Reasons widely vary. But to focus on one prominent yet damaging argument in favor: is the misguided attempt at “protecting women from subjugation in modern society”

In “On the trope of female dignity in the debate in France” Mullally says:
‘The veiled muslim woman is positioned as an abject victim, incapable of autonomy or agency, or conversely, as a dangerous, threatening fundamentalist’.

I believe taking away anyone’s right to wear what they choose in public is a bad and hypocritical “solution” to the issue at hand. (Which is: the fact that unfortunately a lot of women are forced to wear face or body coverings by legislation or even by their own families)

I agree this is problem. But the answer is not taking away someone’s right to wear a burka in public.

It goes against the ideals of freedom of expression, religious freedom, religious tolerance, and probably more. 
It promotes xenophobia and otherism amongst the population and contributes to lack of understanding.
And worst of all, it is doing the exact same thing it is condemning, taking away Women’s personal freedom to choose what they want to wear.

To reiterate; I do think forcing women to wear a covering is bad. I do realize that is a symbol of patriarchal oppression to many people.
However, i also believe completely banning women from wearing burkas in public is oppression. How is anyone supposed to know whether she wants to wear it or if she is being forced to by her family?

What if wearing a burka in public is a woman’s personal, voluntary religious duty? They just have to never go in public or leave the country?
Thats pretty messed up man."

Some biological men might believe they are a woman and expect people to refer to them as she/her.

Then some people think none of the above and expect you to refer to them as… almost anything under the sun plus some sound effects.

Then it is said by some that [choosing to ignore or disrespect someone’s pronouns is not only an act of oppression but can also be considered an act of violence](https://www.slcc.edu/lgbtq/pronouns.aspx#:~:text=Choosing%20to%20ignore%20or%20disrespect,considered%20an%20act%20of%20violence.).


Because this is the case, I believe that people should also adhere to respectfulness when it comes to what ever deities an individual’s religion has.

That means not saying “oh my god” “god damn it” or anything that takes a higher power for someone in vein. That means not expecting them to participate things that go against their religion. 

Gender is a social construct right? So are religions. 


You shouldn’t want to force someone to go against their personal truth just like you wouldn’t want a man who believes he is a woman to go against his beliefs right?


Plus… it’s important to remember that many people of different religions actually have been oppressed and persecuted in mass for their beliefs. Muslims, Christians, Jews, Mormons and others have had genocides committed against them. 


So… it would be some kind of phobia to tell a woman who thinks she is a man that she isn’t a real man right? That she is wrong in what she believes.

It shouldn’t viewed any differently if you tell a person of the Hindu faith that Vishnu isn’t real or that they are wrong for not eating beef for religious reasons. 

I just think it should be fair across the board. If we are expected to go against what basic biology says… what’s wrong with expecting others to go against science when it comes to how the world was created?"

1,2023-08-16,CMV: Advocacy should be priorized over Objectivity in the Free press,u/anonymous68856775,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15t0ki5/cmv_advocacy_should_be_priorized_over_objectivity/,changemyview,"I have heard many people talking about how the job of the press is to remain objective, giving the truth to let the citizens decide for themselves what to believe. However, I believe the opposite. 

First of all, I define Advocacy as a genre of journalism that combines reporting with a point of view, allowing for the writer to express their opinion. Objective reporting is trying to report on facts without distortion.

One of the major purposes of a free press is to be able to articulate criticism is to utilize that power to hold democratic powers accountable. In order for a democracy to function effectively, the ability and persistence of criticism is absolutely necessary. Therefore, the press has a duty not simply to inform, but to take a stance on given issues, allowing Amercians to be exposed to a myriad of opinions, and hold their government accountable. 

Prioritizing advocacy in media reporting and journalism plays a crucial role in protecting human rights by giving a voice to those being harmed and also alerts the audience to injustices. Advocacy transforms a reporter from a mere communicator of information into a motivator for action, allowing for human rights to be upheld. 

An example can be seen in early America. Columbia Journalism review [explains](https://archives.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php) that in the attempt to be objective about lynchings, news sources would cover the murder of a man by the mob, and also cover the reason for the mob’s murder. They wouldn’t mention that lynching was immoral, they simply gave reasons for and against. They then go even further, citing a book on objectivity in the press, “Mindich shows how “objective” coverage of lynching in the 1890s by The New York Times and other papers created a false balance on the issue and failed “to recognize a truth, that African-Americans were being terrorized across the nation.

Objectivity can only tell us what is happening - Advocacy lobbies to fix the issue. If someone is stealing a car, merely observing that fact is not enough. Advocacy is crucial to change.

I wonder if there is something wrong in my logic somewhere, or if there is some benefit of objectivity that haven't found yet.

Or you may be like, “What if the painting is of some fantastical beast and represents human life, is that not meaningful?” And no, as fantasy will always lack the true essence our reality. 

The reason things like books are fine, are because they can actually take us through a humans life, and serve an ultimate purpose. Fantasy books though could still be the same as “fantasy paintings.” Where they both lack importance in our reality.

As someone with autism spectrum disorder and unspecified psychotic disorder, I do not wish mental illness to my worse enemy. I was involuntarily admitted to mental hospitals *multiple times*. But apparently there are people on TikTok that are glamorizing mental illness to the point where people are treating them like Pokémon cards. News flash, mental illnesses are not like Pokemon cards. You are not supposed to collect them, trade them, or play ""gotta catch em all"" with them. You treat them with therapy and medication; beyond that you live your life as normally as possible.

TikTok has been pissing me off with the mental illness thing. It's OK and encouraged to destiagmtize mental illness in my view, but when you go to the extreme of romanticizing mental health problems, then it becomes dicey. With all of this content glamorizing mental health issues, you are seeing an explosion of people self-diagnosing themselves with OCD, bipolar disorder, etc, because of social media. This was not a thing in the 1980s or 1990s. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIxLHcbP0Tk

There is proof that I am not making this up. Mental illness is real and painful, but these trenders and fakers on TikTok insist that being mentally ill is cool, that it should be glamorized and normalized, and the neurodiversity movement is eating this crap up for breakfast. Neurodiversity originally meant autism, but now it has expanded to include the following....

* Bipolar disorder
* Schizophrenia
* OCD
* Schizoaffective disorder
* Borderline Personality Disorder
* Major Depressive Disorder
* Generalized Anxiety Disorder
* PTSD
* Tourette's Syndrome
* Down Syndrome

Basically, any mental health condition is now consider part of the neurodiversity movement, which is artificially inflating who is considered neurodiverse. Blame TikTok for that crap. Now people on social media think that they are cool and hip for having a mental illness. This is good for combating stigma since it is no longer frowned upon. But this creates a new problem of people competing against each other to see who is the most ""mentally ill"" person in the group.

There are even people shown to have faked mental illness on social media to get followers. Now, I am hoping from this CMV that someone can show to me that increased awareness and visibility of mental health issues is not leading to glamorization and celebration of mental illness."

Perhaps, it can even reinstantiate the warsaw pact. Perhaps russia is little greedy when it comes to negotiation but ukrain getting influenced by NATO propoganda is costing it too much.

Russia can develop policies with ukrain in which it can state it wont control ukrain. why are the peace talks not yet in media? Why does zelnesky keep talking shit about putin?

The strained history of russia with Ukraine is well known. The annexation of Crimea would have been threatening. But does crimea's people hate that, are they living in poverty or crises because of this annexation.

the previous leader of ukrainy was overthrown by people for being pro-russia. Does zelnesky need to be so anti-russia to stay in power? NATO has motives, and zelnesky is taking the bait to help it gain independence. However is it necessary?

If Russia can provide safety to ukraine, it might as well have ties with russia instead of NATO. The sad part is that people are suffering because of their leaders."

I argue that lying about whether you use porn is on par with lying about whether you sleep with other people minus the physical risks of STDs.

Porn is a sexual behavior usually involving other people in a non-physical way that is being concealed. The sole purpose of the concealment is being able to manipulate a partner into thinking they are in the monogamous relationship they agreed to, when they aren't. 

Common arguments include:

**She gets so mad/my ex got mad. It's easier to just lie. Women force men to lie about this by shaming them.** The answer to this is either break up, stop using it, or come to some kind of compromise. Anger/hurt from your partner is the opposite of justification for why it's OK.

**All men use porn. You know in Montreal...** First off that does not justify the concealment if it was true. Even if there was not a single man on Earth who doesn't watch porn, she is still allowed to make that decision and lying removes that ability. If it was a valid argument, then being honest and adding that statement would be enough. Second off it's untrue; most large scale studies find about 20-25% of men don't. The National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior found that almost 1/5 of men under between 20-50 hadn't even masturbated in the last year. And the Montreal study was trying to find men who had NEVER used porn, it wasn't asking about current use.

**As long as it's not impacting their sex life, it's none of her business.** All this really means is as long as it isn't impacting HIS sex life, there's supposedly no issue. What people really mean with this is as long as he isn't using porn instead of sex or can't get it up. If she doesn't trust him or is having sex under false pretenses, how is that not impacting her sex life?

**It's unreasonable to ask someone not to masturbate.** Porn isn't needed to masturbate, but even if the request was to never masturbate, it is still not ok to lie about. Even if you think the request is the most outlandish thing that's ever been said, lying about it is a breech of the monogamy agreement.

**Yes you can masturbate without porn, but it makes it more fun and faster.** Is more fun and easier a good justification for an affair?

**But vibrators, romance novels, my ex was anti-porn and cheated on me, etc...** Red herrings that while sexual in nature have nothing to do with whether it's ok to lie about porn.

**It's just insecurity, and that's on her to overcome.** It's also insecurity to not want sex with other people in your relationship. Insecurity doesn't mean ""ignore it and have an affair."" It's valid to say a partner should try to be ok with it and work on it because it's something you won't stop doing. It's not valid to decide they have to be ok with it or you'll conceal it and do it anyways.

**Porn has been around forever.** So have affairs, still not ok to hide them.

I am curious to hear under what justification lying about porn is either fully OK or not a big deal/just a white lie. Note I am not posting about whether it is or isn't ok to use porn in general, this is only about the justification for lying about it. Also note: I am not talking about ""don't ask don't tell"" agreements."
1,2023-08-16,CMV: D&D 5e was a poor system to use for a game as good as Baldur's Gate 3.,u/erutan_of_selur,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15t6sbm/cmv_dd_5e_was_a_poor_system_to_use_for_a_game_as/,changemyview,"I'm about 50 hours into the game now, and I feel like using 5e was such a missed opprotunity compared to 3.5 or even Pathfinder 1e.

Now I will fully admit right out the gate that I am a grognard for both of the above systems, and I will also admit that I think 5e has grown the hobby but I think that the mass adoption of D&D has been to the detriment of the quality of gameplay (for the system not nessecerily BG3 itself.)

My primary gripe is that the class system is far too on-rails and there's no real decision tree. From a combat standpoint, BG3 feels like isometric Skyrim where you're heavily incentivized to be Sneaky, ranger assassin guy only you do it with 3-4 of your party member's instead of the Dragonborn.

The reason I say this is because The vast majority of feats, which is the primary draw of most western inspired RPGs (Perks in fallout for example) are worthless or simply just worse than taking an ability score increase. The thing is, that there's nothing that feels phenomenal about getting a +1 to your rolls compared to getting to augment your existing skillset for your character.


For example, I will take the spell *Shocking Grasp* It's a cantrip in D&D 5e, and a Level 1 Spell in Pathfinder 1e.

In 5e. Shocking grasp does a scaling 1d8 Damage, and it gains advantage against foes wearing metal armor. It can also be used to deny reactions. That's it though. You can't make your 5e character a Shocking grasp specialist. You can't use metamagic to really make the one spell sing. You couldn't realistically build a good character around being a guy who does shocking grasp all the time. 

Instead, the linear progression of spells is such that higher level spells do more damage, even if they don't really fit the flavor of character you're going for. You can't be the person who runs up and zaps people, you have to be a wizard who casts every spell equally and if you want to do 5D6 damage you have to cast fireball. 

On the other hand, if you look at Pathfinder 1E *You can be the god of Shocking Grasp* You can be the most studied shocking grasp user in the world. You can metamagic your shocking grasp to automatically do 1.5X damage based on your damage dice rolls, You can make it so that Shocking grasp will do up to 5D6 damage on its own up from its original damage score. You can build an interesting character that has a bunch of levels of fighter and only has marginal utility as a caster but the one thing they are great at is running up and laying hand on their opponent to electrocute them. 

With 5e you're stuck in these shallow archetypes and railroaded into whichever subclass you happen to choose. What's more multiclassing in BG3 is *heavily* punished because Feats are not level based they are class based.

The gameplay areas where BG3 feel very rewarding are the ways you can finesse conversations and drive the story in a direction you want to go, and it even feels good to fail sometimes because you have to react accordingly. But the fact is that unlike regular tabletop games, due to nature of fixed dialogue trees the reality is that the combat has to do more heavy lifting than a standard night at the game table. 

I sleep through most combats by tossing daggers/javelins and literal junk at enemies, and sleep through most of them. basically with the exception of Cleric, if you just do the thing you're good at a bunch of times you win without much thought going into it."

1,2023-08-16,CMV: the USA should bail on Taiwan,u/Goos_Blah_Blah,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15t88dc/cmv_the_usa_should_bail_on_taiwan/,changemyview,"Hi reddit  
i really hope that we bail on Taiwan and make a u turn on the upcoming war with china we are about to have, and yes this time its happening for real unlike all of the other times this is not chest bumping or routine business, china is preparing to attack taiwan and the united states sending troops would be a catastrophic decision for our country and for the west. When xi jinping and his generals say not to play with fire. I believe them. China sees its window to become glorious again and it will sacfrifice all 1 billion of their Chinese citizens to seize it. Taiwan is sacred turf to them, its just a semiconductor island to us  
The join patrol of Russia and china off of Alaska is way beyond any thing we’ve ever seen from the duo, they have never come that close to alaska together and as the u.s. Military has diligently noted the timing of those ships , which can carry hypersonic missiles the USA cannot intercept, is highly unsettling considering were in the midst of a war in Ukraine and preparing one for Taiwan   
I don’t like how confident XI is on this. When he told Biden “not to play with fire” over Taiwan it came exactly 1 year after china fired a hypersonic missile around the world which fired a hypersonic vehicle that glided all the way to china. General mark Miley has said that should have been our sputnik moment but it wasn’t, meaning our window has long passed to achieve anything like China is achieving. This new system china has can strike anywhere in the world and can go over the North and South Pole when targeting America. It has achieved a leaner, meaner, and far more sophisticated global prompt strike that the USA has  
general Jon hyten, the Air Force chief at the time, said the weapons system look like first use weapons. And that they are being built to launch a pre emptive nuclear strike on the united states. Biden did not listen to xi’s warning, and told cbs in plain English the United States would send u.s. men and women to defend Taiwan and it would not sit by like it did on Ukraine. heres a disturbing timeline that made me rethink americas support for Taiwan . And it is based on a theory that Donald trump is a Russian agent who compromised americas nuclear secrets and enabled china and Russia to behave as recklessly as they are behaving now   
August 8th 2022 - the fbi raids trumps mar a lago estate. They say they have found classified nuclear secrets, including those on domestic and foreign nuclear capabilities  
august 11th 2022 - the STRATCOM chief and person in charge of americas nuclear attack plan says the US is furiously rewriting its nuclear attack plan against Russia and china  
september 18th 2022 - President Joe Biden tells Scott Polly of CBS news the United States will defend Taiwan with military force from a Chinese invasion of Taiwan   
January - February  2023 - China flies a ballon over USA, the message is intended to say “if we can do this with a slow moving balloon imagine what we can do to you with our most advanced weapons”  
the balloon doesnt just follow any path, it follows a path right over all of americas most sensitive nuclear missile defense sites, House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Turneou says

”if take he path that this balloon did, and you put up an X every place where you have a missile defense site, actual nuclear weapons infrastructure, you're going to follow this path,”

The goal is not only to rattle the USA, but rattle our allies . Sure enough it happens, and from the most expected country you would expect this from . 

March 2023 - xi tells the annual parliament of china that China is actively preparing for a war 

April 10th 2023- Macron says France will not back the USA or Taiwan in a Taiwan war

april 11th, 2023 - Taiwan foreign minister says china military drills suggest they are preparing for an attack on the island within months instead of within years

May 2023 - China simulates a hypersonic attack on the u.s. navy, stating they can sink the uss gerald r ford with 24 hypersonic missiles. The USA says its hypersonic missle system wont be around until 2030. Numerous Chinese spies are caught trying to photograph and break into sensitive military bases in Alaska 

June 2023- xi jinping tells china national security chiefs to prepare for the worst, including a war the united states 

July 2023- Russian national security chair Dimitri medvedev says Russia will use nuclear weapons against Ukraine if its counter offensive succeeds 

End of july 2023 - the United States begins having “ufo hearings” where people reveal we reverse engineered ufos. In my view psy ops to tell china and Russia “you totally dont wanna fight our ufos” 

beginning of august 2023 - within 7 days of the ufo hearings. russia and china launch joint patrol with 11 ships off the coast of Alaska. maybe they wanted to see the ufos themselves? Maybe they don’t believe us? The ships they send are capable of carrying hypersonic missiles the USA cannot intercept, including ones that can carry nuclear warheads . And suddenly the Chinese spies of may make sense

You pay your workers for two things:  
1)	Their time  
2)	Their skills  
Even if you have a worker in a low or no skilled role (ignoring the fact that all jobs require some sort of skill, even if that skill is something we in the western world take for granted, like literacy) you still must compensate them for there time. And that compensation STARTS at a liveable wage. Anything less then a liveable wage is approaching slavery. If you want skilled labourer, you pay ABOVE liveable wage.  
  
If an employer can’t afford to do this, then their business is not profitable. Why should we as a society subsidise uneconomical business models with cheap labour or tax payer money supporting theses underpaid workers with social services?  
  
And if you as a business owner want access to cheaper labour, congratulations, you now have a vested financial interest in lowering the cost of living for everyone. Lower cost of living = lower minimum wage.

People moved out west by the millions. Today the US government still has vast amounts of land which they could do the same for. I don't think it should be given away in the same way it used to be but perhaps it could be sold for very low prices to developers, and developers can only be allowed to own maybe 20% of the land at most in a given radius. This would ensure competition, and developers would be able to make profits while still selling very affordable houses due to the low price of the land. 

Doing this I believe is viable in Australia, Canada, USA and other countries with good land but low population density. In Europe this would be harder as it would require nationalization of vast amounts of land, which would certainly be controversial and expensive to compensate.

However doing this in countries like Australia, Canada and USA could encourage more immigration out of Europe which would leave houses empty there, helping the problem in Europe. We know that this can encourage immigration because it has happened before. European Empires promised peasants their own land in the Americas on the condition they had to live through *indentured servitude* and people still took them up on their offer. We're entering another generation where owning your own land is a dream, and today's people would only have to get on a plane instead of sitting on a boat for several months and serving years of labor.

I think solving the housing crisis by encouraging people not to live in cities isn't a viable option. People have no will to live in rural areas, so more cities have to be built. And we have a lot of space to build them. Perhaps in a few decades this could be tried in Africa as well, where there is plenty of fertile land but the people are too poor and the nations too unstable."

That has been true, except for in the Bible Belt.  The Bible Belt has started to open up to medical marijuana, but recreational marijuana has failed in the Bible Belt so far.  Oklahoma voted on recreational marijuana this past March and it failed.  Arkansas voted on it in 2022 and it failed.  In Oklahoma, churches were bussing people to the polls to vote against it.  

Every time this issue comes up online, people want to blame Big Pharma or the private prisons industry.  I maybe could agree with that if recreational weed would have passed in Oklahoma and Arkansas, but the results of those states' recreational marijuana intiatives show that it really is very much about religion.  It's about conservative Christian politicians being able to tell their base that they stood up to the godless Left and protected the moral fabric of society by keeping marijuana prohibition.  Any benefit the private prison industry gets is secondary compared to that.

I believe LLMs might improve in the long run but advances in technology will not easily overcome bad training data.

Absolutely not.

It’s far from healthy. It’s also far from “safe” as the pansy media likes to portray things. 

Just because you use to “run behind the DDT trucks in the 1950s and you turned out alright (with a butt ugly face and 3 types of cancers to boot)” doesn’t mean its safe.

My BIGGEST gripe. They spray without properly alerting you. Just tonight I am doing a DoorDash delivery, delivering someone’s food, and a truck zooms by me completely spraying me. Not only does that make me want to extract the driver from his seat and beat him silly, but what about the this customer. It potentially ingesting insecticide? 

It’s completely ludicrous. I also noticed a little girl outside playing in the neighborhood, completely unaware of the danger approaching her — just like millions of other children.

This is why it should be illegal, they do diddly squat to alert you, and then go ahead and spray you like some dumb cattle who doesn’t know any better.

It’s my belief that there is rational justification for why we should shield ourselves from having to breathe in aerosolized premethium or DDT. I don’t stop by a agricultural crop field to start breathing in the freshly sprayed insecticides on the crops, why would I do the same in front of my house?

In any case, this discussion is NOT about the potential health affects. Rather it’s about my right & duty to protect myself and that as a citizen I should be alerted properly when they begin fogging in front of my house and throughout my city.

Their just racists that are mad at change so they use violence and intimidation tactics to actively stop things from changing for the good. They are the most vile and evil people on the planet. Their entrenched prejudices against certain communities only allow the constant flow of hate to continue. They have no moral compass. They have no logical arguments in favor of their beliefs. They have nothing but hate and anger towards marginalized groups because they know the world is phasing them out. Hatred literally does nothing to help people. 

I just don’t understand why you’d even want to be one or be associated with one. You aren’t being cool or edgy or rebellious, you are just being a complete asshole for literally no reason. So why become one ?

Edit: ok, I think I’ve had enough for one night. Some of y’all are saying I don’t know what a Nazi is, some are saying the socio-economic pressures that Germany went through during and after world war 1 lead to the rise in nazism and now those same social-economic pressure are playing out in America and are leading to a rise in nazism. Some of you are saying the uneducated and limited personal experiences of small town Americans leads to a rise in believing in their race being superior to others. A few of y’all realized that this is an issue that can’t be discussed in nuanced way and I’m just wasting my time. Some don’t believe in the idea that we can live in harmony without crossing each others boundaries. Some believe that human beings aren’t capable of living cohesively and will ultimately go to war with each other. A lot of different perspectives, a lot of different paths that lead to Nazism in some way shape or form, which sucks. 

I guess thank you for proving me wrong and right at the same time. I don’t have any more illusions about living in a functional society as this thread has shown me very clearly that it’s not possible. I also won’t be giving anymore nazis justification for their actions or beliefs, as it’ll only further the pain and suffering the nazis inner child is constantly feeling. But nazis are still terrible, regardless or perceived nationalism, unfounded prejudices against certain communities isn’t right and should be challenged, I was just really hoping that a Nazi could look in the mirror and realize that uniformity is something that’ll never happen. Those who are oppressed will always fight back, so wouldn’t it be easier to just let them be? I guess not. Have a good night everyone."

For example, Beyoncé recently featured on Travis Scott’s album: a guy who was partly responsible in deaths at his concert. Another celebrity - Timothee Chalamet - loves Adrien Brody, who kissed Halle Berry on the Oscars stage without her consent. Pedro Pascal, who is generally considered one of the nicer celebrities, is cool with Steven Yeun, who enabled and hired an admitted rapist on his show Beef. I can’t think of a single celebrity who hasn’t affiliated with or supported at least a few controversial figures. Yes, 98% of non-celebrities ALSO do the same, but I can at least think of 2% of people in my life (and a bunch of people on the internet) who actually take stances against people like Chris Brown or Steven Yeun. The fact I can’t think of a single celebrity who does is proof that to be a celebrity, you have to get used to affiliating with people who have done questionable stuff.

Second of all is the relationship (or lack thereof) that most celebrities have with their fans. Celebrities have thousands of not millions of people supporting them and loving them, but the vast majority of celebrities don’t even give any time to respond to a few fan comments.

Third of all is their wealth. If you have 20 million in your bank account, I feel as if that makes you inherently lacking in moral fortitude, because someone who had an interest in helping others would’ve donated enough money so that their net worth wouldnt reach that point."

It disempowers people smugglers and encourages unity. Am I not right...? I don't know. It just seems like  it's logical that only *once* the migrants are safe on dry land they are either admitted into the country as residents or processed to their home countries (I mean humane processing, not locking them up)...thoughts?

1,2023-08-17,CMV: Woke Leftist Intolerance & Virtue Signaling May Be Paving the Path for a Massive Conservative Wave,u/Zealousideal-Sell137,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15tjp5j/cmv_woke_leftist_intolerance_virtue_signaling_may/,changemyview,"\- You've likely noticed the overwhelming rise in what's being termed as 'wokism'—this idea of pandering, virtue signaling, and at times, intolerance of certain discussions, especially around trans and gender issues, along with race issues (BLM). Now, while it's clear that these issues matter, I can't help but think this approach is gonna backfire.  
Firstly, let's look at the facts:  


* Growth in Conservatism among Young Men: Several studies have begun to suggest a conservative shift among young men. Their reported reasons? Discontent with the 'woke' narrative, coupled with feelings of disenfranchisement in dating, economic challenges, and perceived bias in educational institutions. Also YouTube, IG Reels and TikTok is just filled with so much manosphere content perpetuated by guys perceived as 'cool'
* Right-leaning Victories in Europe: Far-right parties are making gains in countries like Germany, Italy, and perhaps even Poland. It's as if there's a brewing backlash against ultra-progressive ideologies. Now their growth might be less to do with wokish and more to do with immigration, but it still stands that right-wing support is growing.
* Latino, Indian, & Arab Sentiments: A lot of people wrongly assume these groups are staunchly progressive. But the reality? They're not necessarily on board with the 'wokish' moves of big corporations like Disney and Netflix. These acts of virtue signaling can often feel shallow, even patronizing, pushing many to side with more conservative views.
* Leftist 'raceism': Not many people talk about this, but in leftist crowds I become hyper aware of my race (mixed race POC), and people constantly use it an identifier of my personality or background. It doesn't feel nice at all. Especially when they treat me as if I'm from some inferior background and grew up not using the internet etc. Lots of other POCs feel this way, but it's all they know. I moved to London recently and it is sooooooooo refreshing to see how colorblind people are here with regards to race. I'm seen as a person, not as a dark skinned woman from a disadvantaged community who needs to be coddled. 
* Economic Struggles: Working-class folks are bearing the brunt of inflation. There's a growing belief among conservatives that Biden's involvement in the Ukraine conflict is exacerbating the issue. They argue that reaching a peace deal with Russia could stabilize world economies, bringing down the inflation rates we're seeing post-COVID. I personally sort of agree with that sentiment because I don't think Putin is Hitler, he doesn't want to conquer Europe and he knows he can't. I have met so many Ukrainians recently who just want this war to end and hate the fact that the west keeps propping up Ukraine to fight. However, just like being against leftist policies admitting these things publicly can quickly get them ostracised and labeled as Russian sympathisers. 

Now, I'm not saying all things 'woke' are bad, nor am I trying to support Russia (I didn't even intend to go down that path, but it's something being mentioned in the Conservative crowd a lot) but I can't shake the feeling that the way it's being weaponized by the left may lead to an unintended conservative surge.  


I personally think a more centrist Left with a different leader would easily win the next election."

Thats all we had. We dont care about ur skin color, where u came from, if u were poor or rich. When you want to have a girlfriend, she doesnt care if you dont have a car (well underage so.. u couldnt even if u want), or money. just want to spend time together

but the more you grow older, the more superficial people will become. potential girlfriend, friends, parents, everyone will judge you based on superficial things like how much you earn, your career, what skill do you have (singing, playing an instrument, being muscular, etc), your style (the way you wear or cut ur hair and behave), what car do you have, if you own a house and if you do, how big it is.

So consider for instance a person that is studying engineering and he 30. living with his parents, no car, no money, nothing. how can this person can find friends or lover, IF the other person all has jobs, career.

But if that person, next year he finished his studies, land a job at FAANG, 200k? 300k? then the next year again he did well and got 500k? So his earning is way over the other people that snob him, all those people will change idea on him and probably wanna be friend with him

What im saying is that, the older you get, the more social status matters and change the behaviour of the people around you.

Im earning 50k in a famous company. I have a nice network and being a part of a group of young generation where we share our stories, career path, and invite successful person to tell their story. Create events and so on. ""ohh yeah i know that guy.. we used to hang out but right now he still studying, doesnt have a home, car, nothing, he still living with his parents while studying at uni lol""

wtf? that same person that i say shit about him, right now he earns way more than me, and have a better life than me. We used to be friend right? ""ehiii wassup? wanna catching up?""

&#x200B;

I know that no one is the same, and obviously it exists people who isnt superficial as i described. But i feel that the majority of the people is like this. Also considered how social network influenced our life and how people tends to move closer to the life similar of their celebrities, because right now everyone shows their life on social and everyone wants to be a celebrities, compared to the life before socials where people tends to be similar to the surroundings instead of similar to the celebrities

This matter was also considered in a youtube video, where in south korea, girls usually go out only if they put perfect make up, clothes, and feels like the whole society force you to wear in a certain way to be accepted in the society"

P2: Most lawyers require payment and there is a significant correlation between money spent on a lawyer and a favorable ruling. There exists Pro-Bono lawyers and public defenders, but access to them and their quality are limited to to various factors

P3: Those who do things that could be considered illegal can convince the procecutors or victim to settle out of court for a lump sum. Those deals typically have a clause where the accused don't have to admit fault, guilt or change their behavior afterwards. This is a Bribe.

I simply base this belief on the fact that the universe is incomprehensibly vast (The observable universe has a diameter of around 93 billion light years), there are hundreds of billions of galaxies each with 100s of billions of stars and a majority of those stars have planets. 

With this in mind, it seems ludicrous to believe the Earth is the only case of a planet where life has formed. Even under the reasonable belief that life is unlikely to form, it seems unlikely the Earth would be the only successful case.

Also, it should be remembered that simple life (I.E. single-celled organisms like bacteria or archeae) would be considered aliens as well simply due to being life outside of Earth.

Even just within our own solar system, there may be life since we have no way of ruling out the possibility of extremophile archaea living in the atmosphere on Venus, or bacteria living on Mars or one of the moons of the Gas Giants. "

Lots of men (and let me stress almost exclusively men) are insufferably ‘now-it-all’ when you talk to them. I have friends/colleagues that don’t have kids, never been in long relationships, work in completely different fields from mine, etc… that feel
They can school me whenever I talk about stuff that is part of my life.

The recent AND sudden surge in arguments about the 'gatekeeping' of periods by cisgender women has **SHOCKED** ME.

NO. Your estrogen pill symptoms do NOT equate to a period. A period BY definition is when the uterus lining shredding. No uterus or ovaries = no period. It is a very well known fact that estrogen pills can lead to shared physiological effects such as headaches, breast discomfort, and mood fluctuations BUT it is almost pitiful to see trans women REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE: these are NOT a 'phantom period', its JUST your pills working. There is no way anyone can convince me that the concept of trans women having a period that happens 'every month at the same time' isn't a psychological thing/issue. Or trying to convince themselves it happens once a month. No. It happens more often and this is medically backed by multiple medical and scientific sources that are accessible within and outside university walls, online as well.

But, a period is more than that just bleeding and cramps. A period for **MANY** of POC women is what determines your readiness for marriage, to be PULLED out of school, to have your childhood STRIPPED from you as early as 8. POC women in developing countries SUFFER because of their periods. So STOP mocking it, it's not a cute little thing to be part of. It ruins fucking lives.

Everyone is fixated on this idea that its not a world war because the major powers are not at war with one another but the diction any definition of a world war does not make any mention of direct conflict between major powers

“a war involving many large nations in all different parts of the world”

when pope Francis said we have sleepwalked into a piecemeal world war 3 in 2014, i now understand what he was talking about. He said it right after the united states entered Syria and Russia entered Ukraine. 

Cyberattacks, regime change, election interference, color revolutions, espionage, psy ops, these all encompass the modern war that we are in and that not only makes this a world war but a world war that is being waged directly between major powers

What Is unfolding in niger, Is a product of US-Russia tensions. Syria, Venezuela, Ukraine. It is all connected to the USA Russia proxy war.  Russia masters hybrid wars, and like to wage wars without actually calling them wars, this has allowed them to stretch the living fuck out of what can be defined as combat and allowed them to achieve regime change even in the United States without relying on conventional methods the USA is good at fighting at like planes or tanks. this allows Russia to wage a world war in the modern day without having to worry about any of the consequences that come with waging a traditional war. Americans do not understand that the Russian attack on their election, which is way way worse than any agency is willing to say, is the same thing as them firing guns at us and has much more severe consequences than guns because it motivated Americans and not russians to try to burn down the capital

this world war was started by bush. he withdrew from the ABM treaty in 2001 and then tried to put missile defense shields all around russia. He wanted some in Ukraine, in Syria, in Korea, all for the aim of intercepting russias nukes and being able to survive a nuclear war with them. This made china and Russia start building hypersonic missiles that the USA cannot intercept

the arms race and Cold War 2.0 ran from 2001 - 2014 . But instead of a Cold War between major powers, it was the world against the USA trying to build a global empire With things like global prompt strike 

in 2014 the war became hot between powers. Russia and china launched cyberattacks and election attacks on the USA while waging proxy battles across the world. Now that china is getting ready to take Taiwan, it is preparing for the climax of this world war. Which is a direct conflict with the United States, which it sees as prime to attack now that it has weakened it with non conventional methods of war.

This has always confused me. People moving between countries seems just like people ""voting with their wallets"" on which countries/companies are the best. Not only do people benefit from this free movement by chosing where they can live the best life (based on income/living conditions/social programs/climate/etc), businesses also potentially get access to more people. This would allow them to hire better and/or cheaper labor.

Within the US, you can see movement of people between states and it's a powerful way for people to increase their quality of life and business benefits too. So why not at a global scale? It doesn't make sense to me.

However, every time I see a video of someone giving a homeless person $50 or a bunch of food or a motel for a week, there’s always somebody who has an issue saying “it doesn’t count do you film it” 

Why?? You think the starving homeless guy or the poor single mother of 3 cares you filmed her getting $1000?? Or a Walmart haul? Nah, that person is helped. 

Furthermore, the views they get can generate money to help more people down the line. 

Often times it inspires other people (including mysef) to be more charitable to people in need.

Normally their are GofundMe links where you can donate to the person in the video, a video is way better at conveying someone’s life and needs, and gaining sympathy, then a wall of text and a single photo ever would be.

This isn’t to say that doing good deeds without need for recognition or fame is morally better, but if the person is still getting help and theirs some positives, who cares??

So I’m my opinion, filming good deeds is a net positive and people who complain about it or say it “doesn’t count” are just pretentious."
1,2023-08-17,CMV: ALL Deepfakes Should Be Illegal,u/felidaekamiguru,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15tthdh/cmv_all_deepfakes_should_be_illegal/,changemyview,"As AI generated content improves, it has become obvious that deepfakes could pose a major problem for society and individuals. While there is no obvious single solution to the deepfake problem (especially for society), there are many smaller solutions that can help with the problem. One such solution is the legality of deepfakes. I believe that \*ALL\* unauthorized deepfaked audio/visual should be made illegal. (As a secondary effect, all authorized deepfakes should be clearly labeled as such.)  
By illegal, I mean in relatively the same way that defamation is illegal. Victims should be able to sue. But there should also be \*some\* criminal component (as there ought to be with defamation). This would give victims the right to have the deepfake removed, and pursue legal action against the offender, but would otherwise allow ""harmless"" deepfakes at your own risk. E.g. I deepfake my friend fighting a bear and upload it to our Discord because I know he'll find it funny. I could even safely upload it to YouTube if I felt certain he'd be OK with it. This creates a risk in deepfaking, and a punishment for people who do not think their actions through.  
Whenever I mention deepfakes, I am talking about the unauthorized variety unless noted otherwise.  
Core belief:  
\>A person's being is sacred, and theirs to own. Deepfakes steal this core identity. Even if well-labeled as a deepfake, that core identity is stolen. This is probably the one aspect I am not going to change my mind on, as it is a fundamentally sentimental argument.  
CMV: Slightly open to the discussion over celebrities and politicians not owning their core identity.  
Secondary reasons for this belief:  
\>1. CMV: Deepfakes offer little to no benefit to society as a whole beyond mere entertainment. Entertainment that damages individuals with no benefit to society is generally illegal. Things such as defamation will not fly, even if it is entertaining. (Note that defamation immediately loses its status as such if acknowledged as false, but the damage done by deepfakes is intrinsic to their very nature.)  
\>2. CMV: Deepfakes fundamentally do more damage to society as a whole than they can do good. They are lies by their very nature. The defamation potential far outstrips any benefit. There is also potential for authorized deepfakes being used to elevate people falsely, e.g. the presidential candidate with a deepfake of them helping orphans after an earthquake somewhere. Note that being illegal is not intended to solve the problem of deepfakes for society. It is intended to give individuals a means to combat them.  
For the benefit of those reading this:  
I am from the USA. While the First Amendment applies to this argument in the USA, I believe freedom of speech is a fundamental right for all people, and benefits humanity, so any such arguments about free speech can apply anywhere. I do not believe that my argument conflicts fundamentally with the First Amendment's purpose.  
Some deepfakes are visually bad. I am generally referring to good ones. Really bad and obvious deepfakes aren't really stealing the core identity.  ""Good"" is rather arbitrary, but as deepfakes are getting better and better, arguing over whether we need a law right now or later doesn't really matter.  
CMV: Partial deepfakes are sometimes OK. There is a video series where famous movie characters are shown as swol. As these are clearly not the actual people, I am OK with them. Any partial deepfake where you can clearly tell the person in the media is not the real-life person is OK to me for the same reason memes are OK. The definition of ""partial"" makes this a bit arbitrary.  
CMV: Are memes deepfakes? Photoshopping Putin onto a bear is not a deepfake, but the end result is identical. However, the result was made from a real-life picture. IDK. My views on the legality and ethics of memes may conflict with my views on deepfakes. Earn a delta if you can expose this more.  
CMV: I am much more open to pictures or audio being deepfaked than both combined, but as for now, I think all three should be illegal. Perhaps with different penalties. So no presidents playing video games. Because if that's allowed, we have to allow more, like using a president's voice in a movie.  
CMV: What about dead people? Dead famous people? Nobody is going to care if Hitler's identity is used in a documentary. But where do we draw the line? What if Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s identity is used in a documentary? What about a sitcom? What about a sitcom where he's roommates with Hitler? I'm going to say that they should still be illegal, and even more strongly so, for dead people. Perhaps their estates or families could sue. And they should be taken down with minor fines as penalties.  
FAQ  
\> What about clearly labeled stuff?  
It still steals the core identity of the person, and the media could be presented out of context at a future time, ruining the label. And if the label were applied in such a way that it was always visible no matter what you did (e.g. a watermark), then why not just alter the deepfake to be only partial?  
\> What about deepfakes already out there?  
They would need to be removed to the best of the creator's ability.  
\> What about actors who died before the movie was done in the past?  
I'm giving these a pass for several reasons. The actor probably would have wanted the film to be finished. There is obvious benefit to the movie and those making it. The representation of the actor will generally be accurate to their persona. They were not being themselves but playing another character. But any movies coming out now would need explicit permission from the actor.  
\> Isn't it the same if you have a good impersonator?  
Not the same at all. See core belief.  
\> But here's ONE GOOD USE for deepfakes  
I'm going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here. Edge cases aren't going to change my view on the overall legality of deepfakes. It has to be some bigger reason.  
\> How are you going to tell if it's a deepfake or not?  
This would have to be done in court. And perfect deepfakes will eventually be indistinguishable from reality, so it's not a perfect solu. But it gives people an avenue to sue. Do you have a better solution? CMV."

While I consider myself to be attractive despite this, I understand why I am not everyone's cup of tea. Yet, in the internet and especially pro-LGBT+ and body positive spaces, I see a lot of shaming towards men who don't want to date fat women, and men/lesbians who don't want to date transgender women. I myself am bisexual and attracted to transgender people, but I greatly disagree with this assessment.

You can't control who you're attracted to. You can control your biases, such as transphobia, fatphobia, racism, etc and educate yourself further to alleviate them, but you cannot control what makes you click. Similarly, your preferences are a *private* part of your life that only affects you and the person/people you are dating. You aren't spreading a harmful agenda based on who *you* prefer to sleep with or be involved with in your private, romantic time. In my opinion, you can think that trans women are real women and still not be attracted to them. It's like not being attracted to shorter women, or women with small noses, or whatever the fuck. You can not be fatphobic and respect people regardless of their weight and still not be attracted to fat people. You can be an anti-racist and advocate for the disintegration of racist systems and still not want to date a black person simply because you are not attracted to them. The only instance where I think that it's ok to criticize or chastise someone for their preferences is when it begins to harm people, such as pedophiles or zoophiles.

And to my other point, people who spend their time complaining about people who don't want to date groups of people are fucking weird. If I was flirting with a guy and they told me ""sorry, I'm not into bigger chicks"", then I'd actually be glad! My feelings might be hurt, but I'd prefer for them to tell me upfront and immediately so I can go pursue other people who would be into me. It's a courteousy, and when entering the dating scene, you have to prepare yourself for rejection. That doesn't mean that you should see shit like ""ew get away fat bitch"", but if someone nicely states their preference then that's the right thing to do. I do understand if you are commenting on the *way* someone rejected you, especially if it's violent or offensive, but if it isn't and they are just informing you, you have no right to conplain. I don't understand why people would *want* to go out with people who explicitly are not into them, so I've decided that it stems from a place of entitlement, much like incels. ""how *dare* you not want to date me?! I'm perfectly fine! Instead of dealing with rejection like a normal person and finding others who would want to date me, I'm gonna post angry TikToks calling them 'weak pussies' or '[inset bias]phobic!"".

I think some people, regardless of indentity, cannot fucking deal with rejection. So, depending on the indentity of the person, this manifests different ways. For some people it's inceldom, for some people it's calling things ""isms"" or ""phobics"", for some it's catfishing others, etc. This is just a branch of the same tree - some of y'all just cannot deal with rejection in a healthy way and absolutely *refuse* to."

You may have seen some of his memes lately. Regardless, he released a song recently titled Rich Men North of Richmond. It blew up on social media and I finally decided to give it a listen. 

It's horrible. The lyrics especially. 

Here are some lines from the song I found particularly disturbing and inaccurate: 

>*Lord, we got folks in the street, ain't got nothin' to eat*  
*And the obese milkin' welfare*

In the first line, he's worried about the homeless not being able to eat and immediately follows it with being upset over obese citizens on welfare. I'm sure milkin' was an purposeful pun as well, a very poor one I may add. 

>*\[Verse 3\]*  
*Well, God, if you're 5-foot-3 and you're 300 pounds*  
*Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge rounds*

Are we really going to be upset that some folks want to buy fudge rounds? It's a win to know they're eating at all. In years past, I remember the argument being that those on Food Stamps are buying large dinners and whole meals, but now folks like Oliver and those who support him are upset over a box of fudge rounds? 

This kind of music latches on and reinforces the negative stereotype Appalachians face. That the majority of us abuse the system, are heavily obese or have no desire to move forward in life. 

That's it. Feel free to change my mind and try to convince me this song isn't reinforcing a negative stereotype.

I'm at that age now where it seems like every coupled person has kids, and honestly I just don't see the point. For what? I don't see the point in having sleepless nights and a 20 year expensive commitment, just for the occasional feeling of ""I love them so much my heart might burst"".

The only child I have an interest in fostering is my inner one. I don't think society would suffer if I didn't multiply - I ain't anything special. I'm just a regular millennial.

There are instances where the older individual may genuinely seek to fulfill a role as a caring mentor, big brother, or father figure to the younger person. It is essential to recognize that not every age-disparate relationship is rooted in malicious intent.  
  
Unfortunately, society seems overly fixated on labeling individuals as pedophiles, almost as if it serves as a cover for their own desires. This tendency to hastily judge and label can be detrimental, as it perpetuates unwarranted assumptions and tarnishes the reputations of those involved in consensual relationships with age gaps.  
  
Furthermore, it is ludicrous that some people consider a 22-year-old dating a 19-year-old as pedophilia. Such a relationship does not align with the definition of pedophilia, which involves prepubescent children. While there may be differences in maturity and life experiences between the two individuals, it does not automatically imply exploitation.  
  
It is crucial for society to approach these matters with nuance, recognizing that age-disparate relationships can manifest in various ways and may not necessarily indicate harmful intentions. Engaging in thoughtful discussions and avoiding hasty judgments will contribute to a more understanding and empathetic society.

As human beings, we often tend to automatically follow what is written and justify our actions based on legal provisions. However, it is essential to encourage critical thinking and consider alternative perspectives on controversial topics. I anticipate that some people may label me as a pedophile or a supporter of such actions, but I find such accusations disgusting. I am merely seeking a platform for discussing a contentious issue and inviting others to share their opinions.  
  
For instance, let's consider the scenario where a 16-year-old feels emotionally and mentally mature enough to engage in a relationship with whomever they choose. It is worth noting that in several states of the US, this age is considered legal for dating. In light of this, I question why the determination of readiness to give consent should be exclusively in the hands of the law. I believe that individuals should have the opportunity to express their feelings and make decisions based on their personal maturity levels, rather than relying solely on legal age restrictions.  
  
By encouraging open dialogue and considering different perspectives, we can foster a more inclusive and thoughtful society. It is important to approach such discussions without resorting to personal attacks or derogatory assumptions. Let us engage in respectful and constructive conversations that allow us to explore controversial subjects and gain a deeper understanding of diverse viewpoints.

Quite ironically, the british settlers would probably already have been outnumbered, if not for the disastrous (for Argentina) Falklands war. The current situation around the islands reminds some kind of cultural apartheid.

The territorial waters around the Falklands (the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)) cover an area just over 466,000km. A sole country having economic rights to an area that great based on 3700 settlers hardly makes sense almost anywhere on this planet. Not to mention when it's a country located on the other side of it.

What I have noticed is that when people are a part of a particular religion, more often than not, they become complacent as far as the spiritual component of the religion is concerned. I often observe people lose their curiosity about the supernatural as they become absorbed by the nuances of the religion in which they believe. The issue that I see is that religions each have renowned individuals who express their views on existence, and people take those thoughts as doctrine. When we have people to look to, their teachings stifle our desire to have an original thought about what may be; instead, we settle on what others think they know. I have fallen to this as well, and it bums me out.

I believe I understand why religions exist - it is human nature to compartmentalize concepts, even if they are beyond our scope of understanding. Religion often gives people reasoning and purpose behind life. But humans have this innate curiosity, that, when kindled, is amazing and beautiful. I experience it often when I have one on one conversations with people. I rarely experience this awe in larger groups because it is usually a religious leader who is driving thoughts in these settings rather than ourselves.

This parallels issues related to the modern education system and how we do not encourage original thought. Instead, we teach each subsequent generation to be followers.

It's sad to see a lack of curiosity amongst the general population; I love philosophical conversations about our existence. It would be nice to see them more consistently in larger groups. Maybe religions aren't the culprit. This is just how I have come to understand it."

So, hopefully, someone can indeed change my mind about this.

I strive to be rational in all circumstances, and I do understand the statistics seem to make commercial aviation overall a safe means of transportation However, there's a few things that bother me and that makes me think commercial flying is not as safe as they make it out to be.

&#x200B;

* First of all, it seems to me that most statistics take flying per mile/km (when compared to, for example, driving per mile/km) as their basis. I think this is the number one and most important flaw. We can all concur that flying can cover a MUCH bigger distance than driving, or taking the train, or whatever. Hell, that's the reason people take planes. But how does it make sense to use this as a means of understanding how safe flying can be? Surely, since the average person is either going to take a flight to travel abroad - or not travel at all - wouldn't it make more sense to see safety from a factor of n. of flights taken? I.e. taking 10 ""average"" drives with your car a year vs taking 10 ""average"" planes.
* 2) Secondly, correct me if I'm wrong, but statistics on aviation safety are constantly changing. I.e. one year you're gonna have X number of deaths, the other you're gonna have less, the other more, and so on. It's a relatively new means of transportation, and so is the data that is used to define its safety. On a similar note, things seem to get fixed only once a fatal accident does indeed occur - and they do, basically every year. If there's so much we don't know, how can we accurately estimate any safety statistics around flying at all?
* 3) Thirdly, human error. It seems to be the leading cause of modern commercial aviation accidents. There's no amount of precautions that can be put in place that will prevent a human from fucking it all up in a matter of seconds. For instance, most recently, the Qatar's airlines incident where the plane going from Doha to Copenhagen was literally 20 seconds away from disaster (plunging into the sea) because the pilot lost ""situational awareness"". If a pilot can just ""lose awareness"" and crash the plane in a matter of minutes, if not seconds, are we really even that safe? It just seems messed up to me.

Anyways, this is my take. Please feel free to rip it into pieces as much as you like. Thanks for listening."

Some people may say violence is bad, but I believe it's more accurately described as a tool. A very effective tool. 

It's kind of a unspoken social contract where as long as we act within the bounds of what society considers civil, we are generally safe from violence from others. At an individual level, we see it all the time. How many times have you seen someone talk shit and disrespect everyone but then treat the guy who wouldn't hesitate to kick their ass with the utmost respect? Even in the legal system, violence is the ultimate consequence for not obeying.

While most people aren't paranoid about violence being commit against them I think some of the most respectful people subconsciously are always aware of the underlying threat of violence, while some of the most disrespectful don't consider it much. until it happens. So to me the threat of violence is an important part of society and neccesary for proper function.

Talking about sexual history is hard enough - why do we have to frame it in such a violent and negative way? It’s the exact opposite of a sex-positive message, and I think we’re capable of so much better.

————————————

I guess the term “body count” gained a lot of traction on TikTok back in 2020. I’m an old 37F, so I don’t keep up with stuff like that. But I’m seeing it talked about *A LOT* on this sub and it really just seems so awful.

According to Wikipedia: 

“A body count is the total number of people killed in a particular event. In combat, a body count is often based on the number of confirmed kills, but occasionally only an estimate. Often used in reference to military combat, the term can also refer to any situation involving multiple killings, such as the actions of death squads or serial killers.”

Why *on Earth* would anyone want to refer to their past sexual partners this way?? This is a rhetorical question - I’m afraid of any actual responses.

Words DO matter. If we think of someone’s past sexual history as a “body count,” we’re subconsciously setting the tone to view their history as a bad and harmful thing. I don’t care what your opinion is on someone’s “numbers,” this doesn’t help *anyone.*

I love how open-minded and progressive GenZ is. For the love of all things holy, *why* did “body count” have to catch on so hard and fast? 😩 Can’t we do better than this?"

Some staff in turn expect and demand tips to the point of going out of their way to give bad service, be ignorant to, or worse if they identify someone they think might not tip well r/servers is full of stories of absolutely horrible human behaviour on both sides of the equation. 

Imagine almost any other sector in Canada/ the USA (or any so called civilized nation) where the owners decided it was ok to not pay their employees fairly and demanded instead that the public subsidize their payroll- we would all be talking about the scummy employer, but as a society we don't yet have enough value for the people in the food and service industry (let alone the farm supply chain) to question the employer, instead we make it about the employee having to live up to some random expectation to perhaps get a tip that might or might not be enough to live off of by the time they share it with the bar and back of house.

I was born and grew up in Canada, I also spend a lot of time living in other parts of the world where owners are held accountable if they try to demean their staff the way we normalize in the West.

It's time for the owners to get questioned on why they feel it's ok to operate this way, tips should be a choice, not a baseline make it or break it expectation for someone who works hard to have an ability to live in their own community.

Other (more advanced) parts of the world have long since abolished tipping as the demeaning practice that it certainly is and it has not increased the cost of going out to dine by 70 to 100 percent, not even close. The argument that it costs more for the consumer also falls flat if the consumer is expected or demanded to subsidize with tips, so that line of reasoning is a complete non-starter.

Tipping has got so ridiculous that some self serve checkout systems are now asking for tips. If we love tipping so much, why do we even have wages, shouldn't we all just depend on begging for tips like restaurant owners force their staff to?

It's a wide world out there with lots to offer and given what I've experienced it's blatantly obvious that the West is engaged in social barbarism when it comes to not paying a living wage to valuable individuals in the service industry."
1,2023-08-17,cmv: A Zoologist's Take On Why New Zealand Is Not Real,u/ChristmasTreeWorm,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15u65i8/cmv_a_zoologists_take_on_why_new_zealand_is_not/,changemyview,"Hello, zoologist here! I've been studying animals, biology and ecology my whole life, and graduated from college with a degree in animal science. I'm going to give you my strongest evidence as to why I think New Zealand may not actually exist. *Bear* with me here, we are gonna get science-y for a minute. 

Here's an important zoology term to know first. ""Endemic"" means that an animal is found in only one location on the earth, usually an island of some kind. For example, lemurs are endemic to the island of Madagascar. They are not found in any other place in the world. 

There's a lot of animals that are commonly known (at least to us zoologists) that are endemic species. Lemurs and fossas of Madagascar, the komodo dragon of only 5 islands of southeastern Indonesia, the Galapagos tortoise of the Galapagos Islands, and the Aldabra tortoise of the Seychelles (very small island near Madagascar) to name a few. 

Here's what those animals have in common: they are all endemic to islands that have a tropical biome and climate (i.e. they are primarily rainforest covered) and they have drastically declining populations, ranging from vulnerable to critically endangered. 

Tropical rainforest ecosystems, or biomes, are one of the oldest ecosystems, second to our oceans. This means these forests have been around for tens of millions of years. That is plenty of time for animals to evolve and for biodiversity to fluroush, yes? That is why we know, see and discover all the species we do. Think about the biodiversity of the Amazon. 

Animals that are listed as vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered are protected all over the world by zoos, breeding programs, exotic animal rescue centers, laws, etc. That's one reason we know of the species previously listed: education and conservation efforts. 

The species listed all have declining populations and live in tropical biomes. Are those two factors related? Yes. 

These animals have declining populations because of human activity - especially deforestation. And it's not just the species listed; species all over the world that live in tropical rainforests have populations on the decline because of human activities. 

The biome of ""New Zealand"" is primarily tropical rainforest. That means New Zealand must have been around for a while, given rainforests are practically a prehistoric biome. Not to mention, New Zealand is roughly the size of Madagascar. Knowing this, we should expect that New Zealand should be extremely biodiverse, right? But remember, rainforests all over the world are being destroyed, causing those native species to have a signifigant population decline and in need of conservation efforts. Unless, however, New Zealand rainforests are somehow not subject to deforestation. 

New Zealand is not free from deforestation. Why place laws banning deforestation of New Zealand and not South America, Africa, Asia? You wouldn't. If New Zealand is real, deforestation occurs there too. And if deforestation occurs there, there must be endemic animal species that are experiencing a serious population decline, placing their conservation status to drop to ""vulnerable"" or worse. 

If New Zealand is covered in tropical rainforests, it is biologically expected to be very biodiverse. But their rainforests are being destroyed too due to human activity, placing those species into a threat of extinction and in need of protection and conservation efforts. 

So... where are these animals? *What* are these animals? Have you ever seen ANY animal from New Zealand in a zoo? If you put all the information together, wouldn't you think you'd see conservation and education efforts in place for these animals like you do for the rest? But... you don't. You probably can't even name an animal from New Zealand. 

As a zoologist I will tell you, animals of New Zealand are NEVER talked about amongst other zoologists. I personally can only name one off the top of my head, the ""kiwi bird"", so called. And I didn't even learn about that bird in college, I learned it from Google. I've done rigorous studies of zoology in college and I was taught by a man that won an award for one of the best biology professors in the United States, and not once did we learn about a single animal from New Zealand. 

I don't know, it all seems sketch to me. It's something to meditate on."

People are saying that Trump believed his falsehoods and that makes so he did not commit fraud.

I believe that this is literally, logically impossible. There are two steps to the actions here that require people who are acting honestly to believe two inherently contradictory things.

First was the initial submission of the fake electors. Obviously, they were not the real electors, but Trump maintains that it was not fraud to plan and orchestrate their submission because they were only safeguards against the possibility that election fraud that would change the state from Biden to Trump was proven.

So, the first belief would be that these could only be considered valid contingent on election fraud being proven.

Second was that advancement of these electors as legitimate for Pence to include in the official counting on January 6th. Because there was no election fraud ~~often on~~ proven in any of the states, the only way to honestly believe that these electors were valid was to believe that they're validity was not contingent on that.

Trump and his people could not believe that the were both contingent and non contingent at the same time.

Therefore, he must necessarily have committed fraud in at least one of these cases.

Does anyone see errors in what I said there?

I'll also add, as this seems to come up a lot in this discussion, I do not believe that it is at all relevant to this particular argument that Trump may have believed his falsehoods about election fraud. This rests solely on him having to believe both that the electors were contingent and not contingent. For that contradiction, it does not matter if he were lying or just massively deceived. For that matter, he could even have been right about the election fraud and it would not affect this argument or the fraud he must have committed at all.

edit: I had a typo in the original. I've marked that with a strike through and put in the correct words. Sorry for any confusion."

All the times I’ve been very engaged and passionate about a particular pursuit or project it’s been the very opposite. Most things get neglected and all my focus and energy goes into that thing. 

It’s not like the rest of my life in all areas rise along with that thing. That doesn’t happen. The rest of the areas in my life pretty much stay to a certain minimum standard or they possibly fall below that and I just focus on the main thing I’m doing at the time. 

That’s pretty much the strongest reason I don’t believe this slogan. 

If anyone agrees with me, please do say something as I haven’t found anyone or anything on the internet that challenges this idea. It would be a relief if I wasn’t the only one in my mind who this wasn’t true for."

Now, said person would obviously be a god or the next closest thing, but, if they traveled back in time while retaining their “present” self, then wouldn’t they be able to kill their grandparents with no consequences to themselves as they would have to be unaffected by the arrow of time and causality to do so in the first place? 

So, if one were capable of traveling “backwards through time” in the first place, then even if they killed their grandparents, parents, or even their past self, they would still remain fine and this wouldn’t cause and paradox or anything of the sort.

This is just some random idea I thought about and I do not hold any strong feelings towards it one way or another. I’d definitely like to see what other people think, whether I’m completely wrong or not."

The *only* thing they can do to mitigate this added cost of goods is to themselves use a cash rewards card.

1-3% of every purchase is *not* chump change. The *original* US income tax was meant to be temporary at 3%, requiring a later constitutional amendment to even make legal. And while not everyone would forgo their cards to avoid this cost, many would. And they should *absolutely* not be socially boxed out of that choice by a prisoners paradox.

It's disgusting that whether you use a card or not you pay this silent tax, to the store if you use cash, or to the banks if you don't. If you're going to complain about the 1% you should first complain about the 1-3%."

1,2023-08-18,CMV: Speed Cameras and Stricter Speeding Enforcement is the first step in solving a necessary problem,u/Press-Start_To-Play,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15uchvd/cmv_speed_cameras_and_stricter_speeding/,changemyview,"I drive every day, and I don’t like speed traps and speed cameras as much as the next guy. But, from both my everyday experience and statistics about U.S driving, it’s very clear that we have a car problem in the United States. People are driving dangerously, and tens of thousands of people are dying as a result. 

  
In my opinion, lowering this number starts with the enforcement of existing laws. When you learn to drive, the first thing you learn is that everybody speeds. The only time when you drive the speed limit is when you take your license test. Speed limits are the most consistently broken laws, and the fact that they’re so rarely enforced makes each time when they are enforced feel arbitrary and unfair.

  
Speed cameras are the perfect solution to this. They are automatic, so there is no bias in enforcement. Speed camera tickets tend to be much cheaper than human-issued tickets, so they are less of a burden for the one-time speeder who will quickly learn their lesson. However, they are consistent, so the chronic speeders will have to pay a hefty fine to continue breaking the law. 

  
The common arguments against speed cameras seem to boil down to, at the end of the day, “the government should let me speed.” Now, there are certainly many roads where the posted speed is not-in-sync with the speed that one feels comfortable going. There are a lot of roads in America that are way too wide for their posted speed. The solution to that is to narrow or otherwise ‘diet’ the road so that the speed the drivers feel comfortable doing is closer to the posted speed. The solution is not, in my opinion, to let everybody break the law just because it feels good or natural to do so.

  
The one argument against speed cameras is that they represent a security/privacy overreach; however, I think as long as the systems for issuing tickets are mostly autonomous and licenses aren’t saved to a database, it’s mostly a nonissue. If there examples of government misuse of speed cameras, I’d love to see them.

Sure they can play with bisexuals, but that feels deceptive and makes a mockery of queerness. I’m okay with gender and physical presentation. I’m okay with healthcare and socialization. I’m not okay with being attacked for being happily cis and view sex with a vagina as not the same thing as gay sex. I think transmen have come very far but don’t really respect that the world doesn’t change over night. The violence should change over night.

Arguably, particular countries are already seeing this with an increasing gap between usually wealthy '1%er' shareholders coming at the cost of quality of life for anyone and there's an increasing sense that the cost of attaining a certain standard of living is increasingly becoming attainable to an increasing few."

Larian Studios is fairly small, not massively rich, and doesn’t have anything near the resources of the big triple a gaming studios. Those triple a gaming studios do routinely copy other games because creativity is hard and proven success helps. 

As such, they should be looking for lessons from this, we should compare future rpgs to Baldur’s gate, and they have the resources to do anything Larian did well. 

Note that I am not saying all games need to copy them. Sports games don’t for example and it’s ok for them to seek other inspirations. I just feel trying to copy the success of Baldur’s Gate 3 for rpgs is a reasonable and fair idea developers should look into."

I'm still perplex at poor people keep reproducing children to no end. If only all of the poor people stop breeding, we will leave the riches exploiting one another. They will have no more slaves working for them and only to themselves to be slaves if in need to be.  
  
Why can't we just follow Japan model? The people there are smart enough to not breed. If only protests were to be replace by ""stop breeding"" campaign, it'll be much more effective than just protest and riots(which doesn't change anything) because it also means the country will have lesser population to control by whoever and then eventually extinct.  
  
The main question is why do people keep breeding already knowing this world is messed up? And second question is do poor people know they have to struggle even more if they chose to have more kids?"

1. Whole species get bred depending on superficial needs of the market, like a way too small head for the brain making the pet live in pain, and many times it results in behavioural issues.
2. It basically costs a lot of money, the vet industry is huge, why put so much ressources into it?
3. I dont think there is any valid ""need"" behind owning a pet that is not just ""masking"" a way more important issue, like social alienation. People get pets because they dont want to be alone, sometimes they are literally a test or placeholder for a baby, these reasons are not justyfing what we are doing with this species. If you need a friend, find one, instead of buying one. 
4. Its really just like owning little slaves. 

Am I missing something? Id like to see this industry stopped or getting completely regulated. People in cities shoudnt be allowed to own dogs, no matter the size. People in 30m2 apartments shouldnt own cats. Apart from the whole moral factor of enslaving a species for fun and money, its also about species-appropiate behaviour.

He was always the one who hated touring, he was the most disenfranchised with fame, he liked gardening in his free time, his spiritual journey often times involved finding solitude and peace

Even in his songs you can see George was always the philosophical and quiet type for example “I want to Tell You” is basically him giving into the quiet Beatle stereotype with lyrics such as “My head is filled with things to say, but when you’re hear all those words they seem to slip away”. In his singing you can see he was a lot more soft spoken than Lennon and McCartney who when they wanted to can get loud and vocal whereas George would sing songs about the sun coming out and was mellow and soft spoken. 

I do not mean to say he was a sheltered man, he obviously loved his family and friends and loved to talk with them with the things he was interested in, but he definitely didn’t get that nickname out of nowhere, he was not about the ego like Lennon and McCartney who wanted to dominate the band, he was more humble and helped Ringo out when he had a song he wanted to write because he himself understood what it was like to be left out in the shadows."

View changed to believe we need stronger/harsher enforcement of current regulations rather than outright banning of retreads.

 ...

This CMV is only about vehicles which travel at highway speeds on public roads and does not apply to farm equipment, aircraft, etc. 

Retread tires are worn out tires that have been shaved down and then ""retreaded"" by bonding a new outer layer to the casing. 

Why should they be illegal? 

1) They are dangerous. When a retread fails it sends tire shrapnel all over the road, which is dangerous for all drivers, especially motorcyclists. Normal tire blow outs are much less common and generally stay together rather than breaking into large pieces. 

2) They are not environmentally friendly, which is one argument in favor of them. I paid special attention the last time I drove on the interstate, 200 miles. I didn't go *a single mile* without spotting a piece of retread debris on the shoulder. If we made trucking companies buy new tires, the old ones would at least be contained and intact in a landfill, or shredded to be part of asphalt, rather than in large chunks lying on the side of the road. 

3) The other main argument in favor of retread is cost. It's way cheaper than new tires for trucking companies. Except it's only ""cheaper"" because we the people are subsidizing the cleanup, insurance, and environmental cost for these retreads. The trucking company doesn't pay for your car when a huge chunk of tire smashes your bumper, you and your insurance do. They don't pay cleanup costs either for all that road debris. It's done by volunteers or by taxpayer funded road cleanup crews. 

So CMV, convince me the current situation is better than a world without retreads."

Right now I'm stuck in a hotel in a rich New Jersey suburb and what I mostly do is visiting different neighborhoods, small towns and have daily visits to a diverse range of restaurants (prices, styles and places). My last two trips and whatever I see in (social) media gave me a rather positive view of the NE-US life-style as long as you aren't at the absolute bottom in terms of income and health (that wouldn't be positive in in NW-EU, but still slightly preferable because of possible upward mobility imo and cheaper healthcare).

I always considered it an option to migrate to the US (although then probably Cali), but I think that changed and now prefer to stay in The Netherlands (leaving family and friends behind plays a big part).

My trip this year really changed my view and I'd like to hear your feedback about how far I might be off. I will not include observations in NYC because it seems so different than the rest of NE-US. I'll write it in a way how I see it as pro's and con's, and I'd like to know if my experience/observations are correct, not whether you agree with my preferences:

Pro's:

\- Your income in the US is generally higher and you pay lower taxes. I think the numbers support that the last 20 years the gap has even widened slightly.

\- It's okay to be the best at something. To work hard and achieve something worthwhile is actually encouraged. This can be a con, but it seriously is lacking in The Netherlands.

\- People are generally welcoming and willing to help. Service in restaurants is better (I'm aware of the cultural differences). The food in restaurants is way better than in The Netherlands (which has shitty cuisine).

\- Natural parks are amazing, big, and not so crowded as in Europe. You can camp here, have a campfire, some deer show up, et cetera. I really miss this in NW-EU. It's so hard get a ""Into the Wild"" experience if that makes any sense. A lot of suburbs in the US have way more greenery.

\- With this one I'll have to be careful: integration and racism. In the US there are rich communities where only white-people seem to live, and I visited a ""black Neighbourhood"" and the moment I left my car the first thing a kid said to me was ""hello whitey!"". I felt kinda unsafe, but saw one other white lady with 2 kids, so figured everything should be okay. My overall experience on this subject in the US was rather positive: people of all backgrounds seem generally better integrated and were way more open, polite and nice than in problematic ""banlieues"" in NW-EU. One big difference is of course: guns. But I'm seriously thinking that if we would sell guns in Europe problems might become at least as big, probably bigger. Look at the knives some kids are wearing these days. Also, joining the American story of a nation of immigrants is so much more appealing than integrating into European societies where such an identity is lacking.

EDIT: definitely wasn't careful and precise enough: Racism is a big problem is both parts of the world, but the experience was that it was not so bad as I expected it to be, and don't underestimate problems and racism in Europe.

Cons:

\- Wealth inequality and obsessed with money: I visited some more expensive restaurants (above 100 dollars a person), and every time people at the tables around us were talking about: minimalizing taxes on wealth and inheritance. About their stock-options program at their company. What companies they were looking for to expand their business. What their stock-portfolio looked like. Or in the more mild cases it was all about work. It all seemed so shallow and greedy. Don't they have fun or actual interesting things to talk about? I experienced this way too many times for it to be a coincidence. I felt rather uncomfortable in these places and besides the food these were terrible experiences. From now on no more expensive restaurants with rich people: it really ruined my evenings and appetite. If this is your elite, I'm worried. The USA is soo different in terms on wealth inequality than in the past. It is getting out of hand, but I don't see it changing (read Piketty).

\- Things can be too big: houses in the US actually seem to be better and just are way bigger (big pro!). However, I looked around in plenty of rich suburbs and the houses are crazy big and with a nice big plot of greenery (although sometimes the houses look a bit fake).  I figured this would be where the insanely rich live. Then I looked up the prices online and the prices started at 800.000 dollars up to 2 mil. I was shocked: it is a lot of money, but that is still achievable if you have a decently high income. It dawned upon me that a minority, but still a lot people here could afford these type of houses. The amount of materials and gas that is being used this way is crazy and you can maybe afford to live this way in terms of money, but I would be ashamed that you would want to live this way in terms of consumption. How many bathrooms/garages do you need?  All ok if you don't harm other people or the planet, but you do..

\- So many things are private: private roads, private cemetery, private forests, private beaches... There are very long beaches where you cannot go because everything is private. The freedom to own things makes the public freedom so much worse. It also seems that rich suburbs close themselves off to the poor with private roads and dead-end roads. Way to build a society...

\- High income, yet so poor: Americans have higher incomes and more means, but often still get lower results. Americans spend around twice as much on healthcare and although cancer-survival rates are higher, in almost all other metrics Americans achieve much less health and on average die more than 5 years earlier than their EU counterpart. Americans spend money on guns (that's a net loss for safety). Americans spend more on cars, I bike to work in 15 minutes (healthier result and we both get there). Americans have fewer vacation days. More is spend on advertising. A lot of this stuff if fixable, but there are plenty of corporate interests.

\- Car-country: wanna go for a bike ride or a walk in the suburbs: too bad, you can't. You need a car for everything. Even going on a walk or bike ride seems impossible in certain suburbs. Talking about freedom...

\- Big cars: as with houses I think big cars are actually nicer, but how can you not be ashamed of riding in these big pick-up trucks or SUV's: again other people get hurt because of it: it's unsafe for bikers/pedestrians/kids and terrible for planet. Although you might need a decent car to safe your own life in the case you get hit by a Chev Suburban.

\- Food (not restaurants): It is much harder to get healthy unprocessed food (still doable for individuals though, just hard on a population level). You need to be more careful in supermarket (which, again, are nice and big :)). Also the breakfast at my hotel: besides eggs and fruits everything seems to be too sweet or processed. Why is their no normal yoghurt, porridge or bread?

\- Culture is a bit too serious (but so am I, so I might fit in). It's all very polite, but no banter or anything. People seem very careful that they might hurt someone's feeling.

Please let me know what you think I see incorrectly.

For me, migrating to the US was something I was considering. Now I see both places as more even to live, and since I would have to leave a lot behind, I'd rather stay here.

An upvote is ultimately an indication that the post should be more visible on this site.

If you took time to comment on a post, that means that you found the post interesting enough to commit some time towards it. In that case, the post should be upvoted so others can see it as well.

I think this should also apply to comments you reply to. You found the comment engaging. It shouldn't matter if you agree or disagree. Engaging should be upvoted so others can see it. Even if it is something incorrect, it allows others to see the error and the correction because they might be thinking the same.

Only 1 upvote is possible like usual. You can't upvote spam by comment spamming.

I imagine it is fairly common to also upvote, but some people forget or choose not to. This will help anyone who forgot.

Arguments against:

* I disliked the post, wanted to comment but downvote.

Then don't comment. If it was worthy of your time then it is worthy of others' too. Not everything visible needs to be things you agree with.

* It was just a quick comment on a boring post. Not worthy of an upvote.

Then don't comment. If it was worthy of your time, then it might be worthy of others'

Is there a good counter argument to this?

Sub won’t let me link to an article, but there are several studies that show correlations between height and success in the workplace. 

Obviously, correlation doesn’t mean causation. It’s possible childhood nourishment plays a part into one’s height, and taller people just come from more privileged backgrounds, on average, and that’s where the correlation comes from. However, my own experiences lead me to believe the answer is completely sociological. 

I’m a very reserved person; I don’t like being the center of attention, I prefer to work independently, etc. Compared to coworkers of average/less than average height, I’ve noticed that people are more willing to give me unearned confidence, and I can’t help but feel like it’s because humans subconsciously place taller people in place’s of power within their minds.

I don’t like tailgaters too, but the idea of potentially causing an accident which can lead to the death of not only the tailgater but cars around them just because you don’t want to “validate” a tailgater’s actions is high childish and idiotic to me, I just don’t see why you can’t just move over, yes we all know the law says 65 is technically the speed limit, we also all know that the left lane isn’t for that in reality…

I get mad when I get tailgated, but I always move over, let’s them by and I can get back in lane, or not and drive at my own pace again.

Edit: Yeah I don’t think my view is getting changed on this one. Everyone’s arguments have been pretty much: “but we don’t want the tailgater to win!” (Childishly petty, just let them through) or “but I’m legally allowed to drive 65!” (Intellectually dishonest, you and I and everyone else all know that that’s not what the left lane is for. Move over), “but we need to teach the tailgater to be afraid of tailgating!” (Yeah slowing down to make them slow down or brake checking isn’t gonna “teach them” shit and you deep down inside know this.

1,2023-08-18,CMV: The Grandfather Paradox is stupid and could never happen in the first place.,u/Wenndigo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15uw6gm/cmv_the_grandfather_paradox_is_stupid_and_could/,changemyview,"Let’s say that someone obtained the technology/power/energy required to “go back in time”. There are two fundamental ways they could go about this.

The first is the “easier” way. Said person would just need to reverse the movement and interactions of every particle in the universe while maintaining the flow of causialty. So, even if time effectively went back, it didn’t really as the reverse movement of particles still counts as going forwards in the dimension that is time.

Now, the second and most known method of time travel backwards: Reversing space-time and causality itself. Doing this would be many times more difficult that the first scenario and would require the person traveling back to have the ability to simply ignore the laws of the known universe. However, they would truly go back in time rather than just manipulate particles to make it appear so.

Now, for the grandfather paradox. This paradox can be summed up in one question: “If someone traveled back in time and killed their grandfather before their parents were born, wouldn’t they cease to exist as they could never have been born in the first place. But, if this is true, then how could they have gone back in time in the first place to kill their grandfather? Thus, the paradox.

Now, to solve this paradox. Let’s say that the person goes back in time using the first method, just as an example. They “travel” back in time by 60 years and kill their grandfather before their parents were born. In this situation, nothing would happen as causality is still moving forward normally. Their grandfather would be dead, and their parents would never have been born in the first place. However, they would still be alive and living in the “past”.

This first situation does not give rise the grandfather paradox. It is the second, where laws of space-time and causality are broken or ignored, that does.

Now, let’s say you go to the past. You fully reverse the causality of space-time (somehow) and travel back to the past. There are two possibilities, once again, in what may happen (besides failure). The first is that even though you possess the ability to go back in time, as a being with a physical, human body, you are still affected by the “journey” and have your time reversed alongside everything else’s. In this case, nothing would change and it is possible that you would be stuck in a permanent loop forever, without knowing it.

The second part of the second situation is what causes the grandfather paradox. To enter this situation, you must be capable of fully reversing space-time while remaining unaffected and alive throughout the change. Now, what would happen if you killed your grandfather?

It’s actually quite simple. Nothing would happen. It would have the exact same result as scenario one.  The reason for this is due to said ability to ignore the laws of the universe. If you were able to do so, then the chain of causality would not lead to your loss of existence.

Please change my mind if this is not correct. I am no expert and just thought of this rant."

This even applies to software where the teams that made it have long since dissolved and the rights could be held by companies that have literally forgot it exists. So, I think it makes sense that generally software is eventually released to the public domain if it isn't actually being used. If a company's planning on a reboot or selling the IP or something along those lines, sure they can put in with the courts that they want to renew the IP and retain rights and let that be a thing, but I mean specifically for the old and dusty projects that haven't been thought about in decades, just let them lapse into public domain so the freeware community has those resources without engaging in piracy, the chances of adding value for someone are way higher than the chances of taking away from value from anyone."

1,2023-08-18,CMV: The autistic community on the Internet has been largely mislead and has wrong ideas about ABA therapy,u/Maxfunky,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15v1kn8/cmv_the_autistic_community_on_the_internet_has/,changemyview,"**Introduction** 

Many people in the autistic community (which includes myself, and if I’m not mistaken, probably quite a few people in this community) have a big problem with ABA (Applied Behavioral Analysis) therapy for autistic kids.  They liken it to gay conversion therapy (with which it does admittedly share some DNA, though not as much as some claim).  They talk about historical abuses as though they remain common, everyday occurrences.   They attack members of the community who involve themselves with it (such as Kaelynn Patrlow from Love on the Spectrum U.S.). 

I believe these voices represent a significant percentage of the community.  Many of us have read the anti-ABA screeds and have accepted them as dogmatic truth without hearing any opposing views.  We are told this is an assault on our community and we must be against it unless we are evil people who support child abuse.  

As an autistic man, I sometimes hyperfocus on an issue.  Often they are things that will impact my life directly.  When my daughter was diagnosed, I had to make a choice about ABA.  I did not get diagnosed in childhood, so this was not an option for me.  I received the “street” version of ABA, which is basically just a fancy way of saying bullying. Until I learned to say the right things, I was punished every time by **society**.  Wouldn’t it be better, I thought, for my daughter to learn to say the “right things” without the threat of violence?  Wouldn’t that benefit her mental health?    But I’d heard so many negative things, I felt the only fair thing to do was sit down in front of Google Scholar and really dig deep.  I needed to know exactly what the **evidence** says was best and I think I’ve reached the correct conclusion. 

But of course with all those loud voices on the other side, I worry I might have gotten it wrong.  I’m pretty sure I got it right.  I’ve double and triple checked.  But if there’s any chance I’m wrong, I want to know.  If I’m wrong, I need to know.  This is my daughter’s mental health at stake.  So if by chance I’m actually wrong, please change my view. 

Here are the determinations I have made: 

**What is ABA?**

To start with, it’s important to consider that there’s no clear and well-accepted definition for what precisely ABA is.  Consequently, few of the people who casually toss hate at it even know precisely what it is they are hating.   Indeed, many peer-reviewed articles struggle to describe it in consistent terms. In their [“scoping review”](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360706339_Applied_Behavior_Analysis_in_Children_and_Youth_with_Autism_Spectrum_Disorders_A_Scoping_Review), (Gitimoghaddam et al, 2022) settle upon three possible and popular definitions.  Some view it as a specific set of rigid protocols (a definition that seems to be assumed by most in the autistic community to be the case), a collection of educational techniques based on the works of B.F. Skinner (a definition which actually includes a fair amount of the public/private schooling in this country–more on that later), or simply as a systematic way to evaluate practices rather than the specific practices themselves.

Broadly speaking, ABA is an umbrella term.  Under the umbrella you will find LEAP (a type of preschool offered to non-autistic kids as well), Pivotal Response Training (which is play-based), EIBI and many others. These are all ridiculously different approaches and that really only share one key component of their DNA: Skinnerism.

Skinnerism is nothing more than rewarding positive behaviors or punishing bad ones or both.   These days, virtually all ABA programs (after a very sordid history which ABA haters are quick to point out) have abandoned punishment and rely solely upon positive reinforcement.   Mostly, this means praise, gold stars, access to preferred toys and the like.  Sometimes, food is used as a reward (a practice which I personally cannot condone).   Now, when I said “praise” and “gold stars” you might have realized that this is pretty much the norm in every school classroom around the country now.  Yes.  That’s skinnerism.  It's called operant conditioning and it’s a dominant force in education (and in the workplace as well–think employee of the month, bonuses and such).  And, if your classroom is using praise and gold stars to teach kids social and communication skills, then it qualifies as ABA.   

It’s important to note that one of the strongest criticisms of ABA is actually just criticism of operant conditioning.  You can find a strong evidence-based argument against the use of rewards (and punishments) for education and work environments in Aflie Kohn’s book “Punished by Rewards”.  It lays out an extremely strong case against these practices and frankly, I happen to agree with him.  While Alfie has written a blog post about ABA in which he’s critical for this reason–which I’ve had autistic people instruct me to read–his book focuses mostly on how operant conditioning has completely infected *all* education, especially elementary education, in the United States.   And yet, when I point out to those same people that this means that elementary education is functionally a form of ABA, they do not want to hear that because they feel this minimizes the issue.  To them, ABA is torture–though they have zero firsthand experience.  To compare it to the their own elementary school education for which they *do* have a frame of reference is minimizing it (even though it's a totally fair comparison). 

The central thesis of Aflie’s book is that rewards destroy intrinsic motivation.  If you pay me to read a book, and then later you stop paying me, I’ll stop reading books.  Reading books for the sake of reading books has been ruined for me because I now associate reading books with not receiving something I wanted even more than the joy of reading a book.   This is valid.  But, it’s important to note that the most of the skills being taught via ABA are highly intrinsically self-rewarding.  They are things like communication skills. Being able to ask for the things you want, leads to getting the things you want.  Not offering a separate reward in those cases shouldn’t stop people from wanting to communicate their own needs.  Ultimately, these are skills that need to be taught and even if the method being employed here is not ideal, this is a situation where pragmatism should rule.  Sure it would be nice if we knew a way to teach these skills that didn’t threaten intrinsic motivation but those programs aren’t out there.  Other therapies for autism do exist and some have evidence to back them, like occupational therapy and speech therapy, but these are therapies to target different things (like motor control) than the skills ABA targets.  There’s nothing that targets the same skills as ABA with the same evidence base to support it. 

*So, in summary, ABA these days is literally just teaching social/communication skills by offering kids rewards for demonstrating those skills. That’s it.  It’s really that simple.*

**So what does the autistic community think ABA is?**

There are a few misconceptions about ABA that are treated as dogmatic gospel amongst many in the autistic community.  Firstly, is the idea that punishments are still commonly employed.  This is simply not the case.  It’s extremely rare. To hear some members of the community describe it, ABA is essentially synonymous with electroshock therapy.  They are correct that this is something that was done.  They are correct that it still happens–at exactly one facility in the United States. 

That facility is called the Judge Rotenberg Center in Canton, Massachusetts.  They still employ electric shocks as a “punishment” though they were briefly barred from doing so by the FDA before being permitted to resume.  They state that they only use this when all other approaches of have failed and only to prevent behaviors that are *actively* harmful to the child.  So for instance, if a child bangs his head on the wall when upset and they’ve attempted to teach the child a different way to stim when upset with no success, then they might try electroshock.  

I’m not going to defend this and I’m just going to pretend it doesn’t exist.  I think that’s fair; I dont’ think it's relevant to this discussion.  It's one facility out of thousands in the country.  This is not a “No True Scottsman” thing when we’re ignoring the 0.01% to focus on the 99.9%.

Secondly, many of those opposed to ABA believe that it targets eye contact and stimming first and foremost.  This is also false.   Stimming, if you don’t know, is things like hand flapping or other means of fidgeting.  Many autistic people do this as a way to soothe themselves and it’s necessary and important to their mental well-being.  In his book, Unmasking Autism (which is otherwise a decent book), Dr. Devon Price (u/devon_price) describes stopping kids from stimming as “one of the **primary** goals of ABA” which is simply silly.   

Has it happened? Sure.  Does it still happen? Yes.  I can’t even tell you it’s just one facility like the electroshock situation.  But what can I tell you is that most facilities don’t do this.  I personally asked several and always got back the same response: “If a child is stimming in a way that’s harmful or inappropriate, we’ll try to get them to switch to a different stim”.  In other words, if the kid is masturbating in public or hitting themselves, they’ll try to get them to play with a fidget spinner instead.  Seems pretty fair to me.  Most programs are teaching skills straight from an assessment called Vineland Scales, which is a test designed to figure out which essential skills to independence the child is struggling with and targeting those specifically. One version (version 3) of the Vineland Scales does include “culturally appropriate levels of eye contact” as a skill. **Stimming does not make the list**.  To the extent that some entities practicing ABA still engage in the practice of encouraging kids to have “quiet hands”, I share the community’s outrage and believe this practice should be ended.  But it’s a practice that exists independent of ABA.  **ABA is the means by which the skill is taught, not the skill itself.**  

Lastly, it is a matter of fervent, unswayable belief that ABA causes PTSD.  As I will discuss later, there is an embarrassing dearth of longitudinal studies of ABA.  While there’s a solid evidence base in favor of it, there’s little evidence to suggest if the results still suggest it’s valuable 10 or 20 years down the road for adults who received it as children. 

[One of the few studies that does exist](https://www.academia.edu/download/55721125/AIA_Evidence_of_increased_PTSD_symptoms_in_autistics_exposed_to_applied_behavior_analysis.pdf) was performed by Henny Kupferstein.  It is the ONLY study which declares a link to PTSD (other than those which simply cite Kuperferstein).  Its execution was flawed and its results have been entirely misinterpreted.

Now in fairness to Ms. Kupferstein, many of the flaws in her study would be hard ones to fix.  The flaws in this case are more like “limitations” than they are flawed work on her part.   She was a doctoral student at the time, and thus it's likely her funding was basically nothing.  Due to HIPPA regulations, she couldn’t just go to a dozen different ABA centers chosen at random and say “I need a list of all your patients between the years 2000-2010” and then try to contact all those people to take her survey (which would have been the ideal way to go about it).

So she made a survey link and put it online.  It’s extremely hard to get answers to surveys like this and that requires advertising your questionnaire.  Unfortunately, where you go to advertise your survey link will have a huge impact on the results you get.  More to the point, it makes your response group *self-selected*.  Only people with an axe to grind will bother to click the link.   As I’ve already mentioned, the autistic community has long had a dull axe with ABA’s name on it (both because of its historical abuses and the parallels it shares with conversion therapy), so going to autistic spaces and saying “Please take my survey about ABA” is going to taint your results.   Curiously, as she herself notes, nearly all her respondents were women (a group with much lower rates of diagnosis, and thus treatments, for autism)–yet she still somehow managed to have more respondents who claimed to have undergone ABA than who did not. 

Bias is also an issue here.  Kupferstein herself is autistic and has a grudge against ABA that she hasn’t been shy about.  [Here’s](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Henny-Kupferstein/publication/305776693_Autistic_ABA_Survivors_Grow_into_Soul-Crushed_Teenagers_Tracing_the_Roots_of_the_Damage/links/57a14f1f08aeb1604832bad3/Autistic-ABA-Survivors-Grow-into-Soul-Crushed-Teenagers-Tracing-the-Roots-of-the-Damage.pdf) something she wrote 2 years before her study.  She’s the only one who has actually found this result, yet she had her mind made up about the result she was going to find 2 years later before she did the study.  That strikes me as a red flag.

These problems aside, what she actually found isn’t nearly as damning as most people seem to want to believe.  Yes, 47% of people who said they had undergone ABA had symptoms of PTSD (or PTSS) while only 28% did in the “control” group  (that is to say, autistic people who had not undergone ABA ).  This is the headline and it’s as far as most people read–but dig deeper and the story changes.  

Adults who have received ABA almost certainly received it many years prior as kids.  During the 90’s, in the United States, we diagnosed about (hard to get a precise number because the CDC didn’t start tracking it with a consistent methodology until 2000 and different studies from this era report different numbers) 1 in 2500 kids as autistic. Flash forward to now and it’s closer to 1 in 50.  The most likely interpretation of those numbers is that older diagnostic criteria missed 49 out of 50 kids.  Or, put another way, the kids diagnosed in the 90’s were the “most autistic” 2% of all autists.  In the early aughts, when the CDC started keeping numbers, it was more like 1 in 150 meaning roughly 2 out of 3 kids who would be diagnosed today were missed back then.  So compared today those diagnosed in the year 2000, they were the most-autistic “33%”.  

This means that kids who got treatment during that era were part of that 2-33%.  This is reflected in Kupferstein’s data.  It shows that the group in her study who did receive ABA had **more** symptoms of autism and **more severe** symptoms.  In other words, acknowledging that this is a clunky way to phrase it, they were “more autistic”. The 28% number in the control group (which is already quite high) speaks to the fact that most autists will suffer some trauma and stress in their lives due to things like bullying and friction in relationships with parents and family.  So here’s a simple, plausible interpretation of these findings when viewing the data as a whole:  Being autistic causes PTSS.  Being “more autistic” is more likely to cause PTSS.  

It’s simple.  It’s elegant.  It explains the data. Interpreting these numbers as a condemnation of ABA is almost a wilful misunderstanding.  It requires twisting yourself into an intellectual pretzel to ignore a simpler, more complete interpretation.   There is probably some statistical fuckery you could do to try to control for this confounding factor (that the control group was NOT ceteris paribus with your experimental group), but it wasn’t done.  Again, she was just a doctoral student at the time.  

**What is the evidence that ABA works?**

So even if it's not overtly harmful, we shouldn’t subject kids to a therapy that doesn’t actually work, right?  So, let’s establish the evidence that ABA promotes positive outcomes.  This evidence is both extensive and limited.  

Extensive because there is an overwhelming amount of data that ABA increases IQ test results, promotes positive behaviors (as measured by the Vineland Scales, generally), and results in higher employment rates in those kids when they become adults.  Parents also pretty much universally (in every study) report positive changes in their kids.  However ABA critics will be quick to suggest that parents are fine with kids who have had their souls crushed provided they are compliant and well-behaved, so we shouldn’t trust parental judgment as a metric (its not a terrible argument, honestly).  

Limited because none of this really speaks to actual quality of life, happiness and because very little of this research (other than employment) is longitudinal. Additionally, it is limited by bias.  It’s basically impossible to find an article about ABA that doesn’t have at least one author who works for an ABA services provider.  This makes a certain amount of sense since such a person is almost necessary in order to have the requisite access to do the study (that is, the ability to send parents a form requesting consent to use data that is otherwise HIPPA protected.  But it does create a situation where the autistic community is highly reluctant to trust this data. 

Like with Kupferstein, I’m sympathetic here.  This sort of research is very hard to do without access to kids actually undergoing ABA.  It's hard to imagine how an outsider would even begin without having a friend in the business, and said friend is likely to end up with an author credit for their assistance.   It's a weakness, but it's the data we have.  It’s not like we have contradictory data from unbiased sources.  We just have biased data and nothing else. 

As for the issue of longitudinal studies, I think this is a bigger issue and one I’d like to see rectified.  I found exactly *four* papers in an extensive deep dive into Google Scholar that actually asked autistic adults about their ABA experiences.  One is Kupferstein, so we’ve already discussed that.  

[This](https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/73753/1/McGill_Robinson_AA_2020_autistic_experiences_of_childhood_Applied_Behavioural_Analysis.pdf) is another similarly negative one.  It interviews 12 adults about their experiences.  I have more to say about the **anecdotal** experiences of autistic people later.  For now, I will simply say these 12 are decidedly negative and were recruited by being known associates of the researcher who wrote the paper (which is not ideal) and some were recruited by advertisements placed on internet groups for autism advocacy.   Another similar paper interviewed 7 more people (recruited in a similar way) but I haven’t been able to read that one since there’s no free PDF. 

The last is almost the opposite of the previous ones. It can be found on [Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Handbook_of_Quality_of_Life_for_Individu/ndJyEAAAQBAJ?gbpv=1) but you’ll need to manually turn to page 9.  Instead of being done by an autism advocacy group with a stated opposition to ABA, it was done by an ABA practitioner.  Every kid here reports at least some positive experience, though a few say “they’re not sure” when asked if it all paid off. 

In other words, what little we have is almost all just interviewing people (which already means it’s just anecdotal evidence at best) and the answers we get depend entirely on who is asking the questions and where those people are recruited.  This is just not good data and its a hole that needs to be fixed. 

In summation, we have little to no evidence how autistic adults who have actually undergone ABA feel about it (or rather, we have highly conflicting information depending on who sources the people) nor do we have good evidence for how ABA long-term impacts mental health.  

The closest longitudinal metric for ABA success is employment rates–and employment rates are not *terrible* indicators of mental health (for instance, getting a job is the single best intervention against re-succumbing to an addiction) but they certainly aren’t as good as, for instance, finding out how suicide rates vary between autistic people who have received ABA and those who haven’t (something which I looked extensively for).   But, we do have absolutely great evidence that ABA has several measurable, positive impacts on kids in their short-term futures. 

**What other evidence is there against ABA?**

The other factor often pointed to by autistic advocates are anecdotes.  I scanned back through about 5 years of articles on Nueroclastic pulling out all the testimonials about ABA they had published and going through them.   I noticed complaints seem to always follow into one of four categories:  They are similar to the themes in the negative adult interview paper I mentioned in the previous section.  Here’s the things I see over and over again in these: 

* Abuse.  Sexual, physical and mental abuse.  Things like yelling at kids or hitting them.  While this is terrible, it has nothing to do with ABA specifically, and everything to do with abusive people in therapy jobs.  This could happen in literally any form of therapy, so it doesn’t strike me as a legitimate criticism of ABA.

* Denying agency. Caregivers who ignore what kids are telling them because they assume that they are autistic and don’t mean what they say.  They say they have to go to the bathroom, for instance, and it gets labeled as an avoidance strategy rather than a genuine need.   Again, I think this is similar to abuse in that it could happen in any type of therapy.  It’s more about the attitude of the therapist than it is about something specific to ABA.

* Kids being milked as cash cows.  This complaint shows up as “things being repetitive” or some variation on that theme.  Basically, people are saying they were made to do the same shit over and over that they had long ago mastered.  My presumption here is that this is a profit motive at work.  Graduating kids is only good business if you have a wait list.  Otherwise it's a loss of revenue.  Again, this is awful but its *not specific to ABA*.  Any unscrupulous therapy provider could end up trying to milk insurance money out of kids for therapies they don't actually need especially since insurance companies are often required to cover autism therapies under state laws.

* Things that aren’t even ABA.  One person who shared their story on Reddit, describes being made to listen to loud music on headphones in order to get over their sensory sensitivity.   In other words, to desensitize them to loud noises.  This is actually something called “exposure therapy”.  It’s its own thing.  I also see similar stories about “aversion therapy”.  It’s possible that these things were done in ABA centers, as ABA centers often offer non-ABA therapies (speech and occupational therapy being the most common), but they aren’t actually a part of ABA.  They are completely discrete psychological practices. 


Anytime I’ve actually read a story where the thing the person was complaining about was actually ABA, it’s always been one of the historical abuses I’ve mentioned previously.  I want to be clear, all of these are totally legitimate complaints–they just aren’t actually complaints **about** ABA.  They either could happen with any kind of therapy, or actually *are* a different therapy entirely. 

**Conclusion**

Medical history is full of horror shows.  ABA is not an exception. Terrible things have been done under its banner in the past.  But we can only fairly judge it by its current form and the data that speaks to its current form.   That data shows that it is effective.  While it would be nice to have confirmation that it leads to better life outcomes down the road, we have no **credible** evidence that it *does not*.  

Anecdotes from kids who have suffered at the hands of ABA therapists make it clear that parents should shop around before picking an ABA provider.  They should ask about the facility's stance on stimming, their “graduation” rate, the numbers of kids on their waitlist and so on. Like daycare (another venue in which several horror stories exist), parents need to shop around and be careful.  ABA is a for-profit industry and there may be unscrupulous providers out there.  But this need to proceed with caution is no reason to toss away the baby with the bathwater.  

Indeed, we can look at gynecology and see that its history is full of terrible things like torturing slave women.  We can find the stories of many women who have been abused and molested by evil doctors running gynecology practices.   If we applied the same logic to gynecology that many in the autistic community apply to ABA, we would be demanding that women be freed from the tyranny of pap smears. But this is an emotional and dogmatic mode of thought, not one rooted in rational, open-minded thinking.  

Or at least that’s how it all looks to me.  If I’m wrong, please let me know.  Tell me what I failed to consider or what I misunderstood or got wrong."

Most families aren’t profiting off of the dramatic re-enactments of their loved ones last moments before being murdered in often brutal ways. 

Of course like everything there is nuance, and not all true crime cases are super recent and all that. So there generations profiting off of the content with no connection with the dead relative can be debated. But if the networks, YouTubers, and streaming platform are still profiting off of it , why can’t the families 🤷🏾‍♀️

I very much hated the Dahmer series, Ted Bundt Series, hell even the one about Versaces killer. The families are still grieving and your ass went to cast a conventionally attractive killer that several members of the audiences always end up simping for? Completely decentering there victims and their families pain. 

true crime daily does this, Netflix, YouTubers, podcasts, and I just think it’s so apathetic. 

I appreciate some aspects of true crime, such as reporting on them so missing people can get more exposure and hopefully be found. Helping a family get more exposure so hopefully they can find closure. Describing cases that may help someone in a domestic violence relationship t realize the red flags. And hell I ain’t going to lie I find it entertaining at times

Here’s a compromise What if those dramatized true crime stories can be made and inspired by true events but it’s a fictional case. 

Or people offer a cut to pay the  family of the victim(the structure of that can be debated) 

Or a cut goes into resources and organizations that help solve cases/ help missing people/ etc.

Or AT LEAST get approval from the victims family, children, etc."

1,2023-08-19,CMV: Earning lots of money is not a justification for buying needlessly expensive things,u/WhenWillIBelong,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15v60li/cmv_earning_lots_of_money_is_not_a_justification/,changemyview,"I think everyone can agree that things we purchase have value, there is the value it is sold for, and then there is the value it holds to us. The value we gain from it can be via utility, enjoyment or sentiment, and it can be really hard to say what that value is worth in dollars. The sale value is usually whatever the seller can get away with selling it for, as determined by the market and circumstances of sale.

So the question remains for what human value an expensive item has and where does it come from?

For example, a car is bought for utility. You can get them for a few thousand dollars, or you can get them for a few hundred thousand dollars. If someone buys the second and is satisfied, where does that satisfaction come from?

Usually after discussion it is admitted that the several hundred thousand dollar car does not justify its price through additional utility or enjoyment, and it often comes down to ""I like it and I can afford it"".

So my argument today is, that's a worthless excuse. Someone who is making such purchases is simply misusing the monetary power that has been assigned to them.

Because you can afford something is not a reason to buy something

You should not just buy everything you 'like'. People like lots of things. People like violence, people like destructive drugs, people like to abuse others. Rich people often indulge in consumption that does exactly that. I think of the video of the couple at a restaurant eating their food directly off a waiters face. A homeless person can have a home built for them for the price someone pays for a car. It's hard to explain exactly how these lines interact but there is something very sick there.

Why should people spend money sensibly? because your stupidity and psychological vulnerability is being exploited. These products sell themselves using image. And the prevalence of these markets promotes marketing and consumer engineering that is designed to milk this, seek comfort through consumption and in turn alienate and hurt us."

No. I am not gonna start the rambling about AI and deep fakes or other dumb sh*t like that. That's a different topic for another day. 


This is probably the closest belief to a conspiracy theory I believe. 


This is something we should have done since the beginning of the internet. 


Many things are fake on the internet, or at least have missing contexts. From news on social media, photoshoped/airbrushed models, drama made as an attempt for attention, etc. 


Needless to say most mental health issues, scams, dumb culture and misinformation related to the web are steming from taking the internet at face value. 


Even before AI and pals it is incredibly difficult to verify what's real or not. Not always but at least in *most* cases it sure as hell is.


The remedy to this: Assume everything you read is fake. 


Example: If one assume everything he/she reads is fake (or at least take it with a massive grain of salt) then it will be more difficult to be scammed, feel bad for oneself or get fooled by the internet.



You're almost never sure who's behind the screen. 


I could be Linus from LTT in an alt account, or that pyramid girl iilluminaughtii. Maybe PewDiePie?


Maybe I am Alex Jones, ChatGPT, Dream or snooroar. I could very easily be a bot.


Maybe I am Vladimir Putin himself, lol. Or.... 


Simply I am just a random loser nobody. YOU F*CKING NAME IT!


Point is: If you don't even know who is actually speaking/giving this info to you, why take him seriously?


Why take someone or something seriously when you cannot even verify it at an acceptable enough level?"

Be it a tool, , documents, weapons, virtual data containers (like corporate Hard Drives), bloodstained vehicles, bodies/body parts or any other kind of evidence. For instance, if it's a body, you could eat your victim, you can throw their body underwater, you can bury the body or maybe even throw their body in space with a rocket, all of these are still technically possible to recover or be discovered (unless your rocket hit the sun, which is not happening). But if you throw anything inside that lava pool, no one is going to lose time trying to discover anything. The body would be nothing in less than a minute anyway, too.

This goes for anything honestly. I guess only a diamond would survive that pool and even if it was thrown inside that thing it wouldn't be possible to localize the specific location, how deep it is and have a drone resistant enough to enter and recover it.

Also, I say ""accessible"" because antimatter is not available to random, normal civilians. If it was then antimatter would be probably the best way possible. Or maybe a black hole, too (possibly even better than a star).

The Mexico cartel used a lot of acid to melt their victims bodies. But guess what? They had to burry their bones and later it was discovered that they threw all of their bones in a PARK. Very disgusting of all places, but that's not the point here. Sure, they can't go to a volcano, but that's not the point of the post. I just want to say that none of this would be a problem if a volcano was available because no one is going to lose their times trying to recover something from such a dangerous place.

Liberalism is usually to mean being more tolerant, accepting of social changes, differences and new ideas.

Just off the definitions alone, i think its faie to say that conservatism is almost never MORE right than liberalism. A more liberal society means more freedom, allows for more ideas, more scientific and philosophical advancements and such.
When you think about the two ideaologies in their most barebone form, there is simply no way conservatism can be better. Ofc, there are variations and extremes.

In practise, liberal countries usually are the ones that are more developed, more advanced and civil.

Now i know many of you are going to say that old conservatives societies still attribute massively to development of mankind like ancient china, arab,etc..etc. but the development in and of itself a form of liberalism, not a result of conservatism. Even in restrictive and old-minded societies, change and new things, new ideas must be allowed to flourish if that society is to develop.
Thats why when you think of truely civil and developed.

Even if conservatism brings some good, in the long run it can be argued that liberalism can bring more good, accelerating the pace of development.


Ofc , liberal doesnt equal good, it just means change, sometimes that change leads nowhere, sometimes it isnt good or not as good as things we already have. Thats why its ALMOST always better than conservatism.

1,2023-08-19,"CMV: Filming at the gym can be fine, and can be useful/important for others. Calls for a blanket ban of filming at the gym are unreasonable.",u/Varyxos,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15vhpie/cmv_filming_at_the_gym_can_be_fine_and_can_be/,changemyview,"Filming at the gym is fine in most cases because:

It's a public space, that you share with other people and in such spaces (outside) you can appear in the background of someone else's video. 
People should be blurred however, (according to the same modalities as outside), and asking for consent to appear on video is important if you are filming. 

Filming at the gym is useful and even important, if you're going by yourself or with someone inexperienced, in order to get form advice. Not doing so can lead to injuries or inefficiencies. 

My view can be changed, because I'm not stuck on any position, but also, I could be missing an evident way to check form without recording one self. 

To sum up
1. Recording yourself in the gym is as OK as recording yourself outside
2. Some people should film themselves from time to time.
3. Blanket bans on filming at the gym are unreasonable

Things that are not my opinion/ I don't care to discuss. 
1. Filming other people at the gym, (don't do that, same as outside.)
2. What are the appropriate modalities of when you should tell someone you're filming yourself outside. (because I'm pretty stuck on my opinion that either you blur or you give a warning that you are filming, but any harsher limitations are unreasonable outside.)"

However I find that narrative false and also downright insidious. 

First of all men are the privileged gender in almost all walks of life. This includes cases of domestic violence.

A man who kills his wife receives lighter sentence than a woman who kills her husband 

https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/in-the-news/women-serve-longer-prison-sentences-after-killing-abusers

The women who kill their husband do it out of self defense or due to years of abuse at the hands of the husband. The men who kill their wife are abusers from start to finish. 

Moreover women are three times more likely to be arrested in cases of domestic violence 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/society/2009/aug/28/women-arrested-domestic-violence

https://www.familylaw.co.uk/news_and_comment/women-three-times-more-likely-to-be-arrested-for-domestic-violence

Does this sound like domestic violence against men is taken seriously? I think not.

I want to believe the men do experience sexism and that their complaints are genuine.

However the research doesn't seem to back up those claims. Which saddens.

1,2023-08-19,CMV: Male-centered groups only care about you if you are masculine,u/Purgatory-System,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15vlvmo/cmv_malecentered_groups_only_care_about_you_if/,changemyview,"I might be conflating unrelated things but this has been my singular experience.

No matter how superficial it is, if you don't exude traditional ideals of masculinity as someone assigned male at birth, there isn't a support group for you.

When I hear so much about helping men's mental health and dynamic in the modern world, it's usually about protecting one's sense of masculinity, or comparing men to a social hierarchy like alpha, beta etc. that hominids don't inherently subscribe to based on gender and/or sex alone. Or that emotions or flashy styles are the center-point of emasculating someone. Some variation of disingenuous ""I support other men"", (but when men are like me and how I want them to be.) I often feel belittled when guys give me unsolicited advice, because it is typically a rejection of what is considered ""soft""-- which is are at odds with my interests, personal tastes, and the type of social role I naturally assume most often (emotional caretaker.)

I also have medical conditions and can't do powerlifting or strength-based strenuous exercises, with a list of other chronic health issues, so I laugh (and cringe) when I hear ""weak males"" are equated to not being bodybuilders or physically capable of strength or constitution. The comparisons are usually uninformed and reductive.

Telling me how I should live my life isn't supportive. I'd rather someone meet me where I'm at and find value in who I am even if I'm considered feminine-- which isn't a bad thing, and also, why does it even matter? This exists even within the LGBT+ community, and I've been genuinely harassed regardless of the male-centered community because of how little I care about conformity.

So, I do not believe people when they say they care about men's mental health until they show that to me explicitly, by being an encouraging figure of other men who may not be like them. Something I rarely ever see, especially online.

So I'm jaded as shit, and I want to change this.

I understand this view is informed more by trauma than logic. I've just never had a safe and healthy relationship with a group of solely men where I felt included.

I want a reason to think otherwise, I want to be wrong. Maybe part of this is just me being in my own way here."

- when applying, immigrants should have no criminal record back at home country.

- the worker would pay his taxes as any other American worker and the company (employer) taxes which should amount to something close to 50% of gross payment. 

- limited benefits

- I wouldn't limit their presence to certain cities/regions, but maybe have further incentive to populate ""ghost towns"" bringing up the economy of those areas. 

- once the immigrant reach certain goals (5 years employed + no crime records) they could get a better tier with less tax % and more benefits.

- until they reach a ""certain tier"" to naturalize. 

The hard part would be to enforce these rules against anyone who goes around this system or cheat it. Immediate deportation would be a must. 

Also, we would need to enforce that employers couldn't discriminate against these immigrants (which could be very much troublesome). 

I think A LOT of immigrants would take that deal everyday of the week and twice on Sundays."

People themselves are the issue in modern society, we must strive to make people ""unimportant"" if you will, that is no person should ever be required for me to experience or express myself in any form or matter.

  
If we want each person to experience what they'd like, how could that ever be possible if those experiences are completely determined by wether another person has the ability, desire or time to produce it for you? Also, you'd have to pay them too which is another great bottleneck for the large majority of the worlds population. As an example, artists often decline offers to make art of particular things that they might not agree with and in a way robs you from that experience (although you can find many such examples across the planet).

You don't know if the genie is benevolent. And 2 it has the same rules as the one from Aladdin. Those are: No resurrecting the dead, No making people fall in love with you, can't wish for more wishes, and you only get three wishes. People have long tried to game these rules but I think I have come up with the best way to do so.  


Wish 1. I wish for all my wishes to be granted as I intend. At first this may appear to be a waste of a wish but genies tend to be jerks. They will twist your words and find ways to not give you what you want. As such you need to make sure that that can't happen.

Wish 2: I wish for there to be no rules on what I can wish for. This is the one that matters. The silver bullet if you will. You may question if this is allowed but genies love to pull literal meanings on you so here you can turn the tables on them. While this goes against the spirit of the rules it doesn't go against the letter of the rules and that's all that matters.  With no rules on your wishes you can move on to wish 3  


Wish 3: I wish for infinite wishes. This is objectively the best wish one can have. A genie that can do whatever you want for as long as you live? What isn't to love? The genie realizes that this is the best wish and banned it but thanks to our past two wishes those rules no longer apply to us. Now we are free to wish for whatever we want. Money? power? World peace? the end of human suffering? All of these can be yours with just a few words. And thanks to our first wish you don't even have to be careful about how you word it.

To change my view you need to show either 3 wishes that confer greater benefit or show how mine are flawed in some way. That is I won't get what I want if make these wishes."

However, I don't understand this narrative that Ukraine is doing well in the war. Here's my argument as to why Ukraine is likely to lose the war and be taken over by Russia.

The counteroffensive failed. There's no denying that. The Ukrainians only taking back a few square meters a day, and morale is getting lower and lower. The Russians keep attacking critical Ukrainian infrastructure. This is quickly turning into a war of attrition, which favors Russia since Putin has more men to throw into the meat grinder than Zelenskyy. Additionally, Ukraine has mobilized; Russia has not. Russia is not fighting at its full potential, whereas Ukraine is fighting as hard as they can reasonably be expected to. The only way I see Ukraine winning the war is if Russia withdraws, which I think is highly unlikely; if it were going to happen, it would have happened already. 

The only thing that could change this is if NATO directly intervenes, which won't happen, and it arguably *shouldn't* happen since it risks nuclear war. Additionally, Ukraine has a limited time frame to make this happen, for one main reason: Donald Trump.

The 2024 US presidential election looms large over this war. Trump often lies, but he isn't lying when he says he'd end the war in 24 hours. He just doesn't tell you *how* he'll end the war. I believe that if Trump wins a second term, and the war is still ongoing, he will pull the US out of NATO and/or stop arming Ukraine. Other European countries might keep supporting Ukraine, but if the US pulls out of the war (or starts supporting Russia), it will become fairly easy for Russia to turn the tide in this war. Even if Trump doesn't win in 2024, it's likely that a Republican (maybe even Trump again) will win in 2028 due to the way US politics swing back and forth, and then Ukraine loses. And, for reasons outlined above, I don't see Russia withdrawing willingly.

I would like my view changed on this, because I firmly believe that if Ukraine loses the war, the rest of Europe will also be attacked by Russia. Good times. "

Before I begin, I’d like to clarify this post is NOT being written because I got mass downvoted on a comment/because I have a low karma score, I have 10k karma and don’t care about what anyone thinks of me or my opinions/beliefs. 

1. It influences people to avoid writing anything different/an opposed opinion out of fear of being downvoted and their score ruined. 

2. It acts as a reputation, say if a new Redditor/someone with a low karma score starting commenting opposing/controversial opinions they will get downvoted and have negative karma, this will make people think they are a troll and not take them seriously this will also prevent them from speaking in certain subreddits. 

3. It’s pointless, there’s zero reasoning behind needing to know how many upvotes/downvotes someone has. 

4. People abuse the system, in certain communities someone will get downvoted to oblivion for merely being the 4th reply.

5. It promotes karma farming to increase karma, some will even go as far as to stage posts with alt accounts they know will get popular/get a lot of upvotes. 

And lastly, 6. It prevents new redditors from speaking in most subreddits. Most subreddits will require a specific amount of karma points to post/speak in the subreddit, while this understandable as it prevents bots, this also has the side effect of preventing new users from speaking and making them either karma farm or do Reason #1."

Making sure a kid doesn’t die is easy as hell. Just keep an eye on them. Sure you might have to take them to the doctor once every few months (assuming they don’t have some kind of disorder) but really, is it that difficult to just be aware of what they’re doing while you chill at home?

When George Floyd was murdered about 3 years it boosted the BLM movement, with its main talking point being the disproportionate rate of black deaths caused by police. 

While looking at the numbers, and percentage by population it absolutely looks disproportionate considering that African Americans only make up 13.6 percent of the population yet made up a massive portion of deaths caused by police.

What makes it not disproportionate is the amount of crime committed by people black Americans compared to white Americans. When compared to the violent crimes committed by white Americans the black rate was roughly half of the crime committed by white Americans. However white people make up 60-75.6 percent of the US population while black Americans make up 13.6 percent. Making it on average the perpetrator of a violent crime being very likely to be black and thus making the killings not disproportionate

1,2023-08-19,CMV: Race is the social application of ancestry,u/cookics,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15w0lv4/cmv_race_is_the_social_application_of_ancestry/,changemyview,"There seems to be no interpretation that encompasses what race really seems to be. From what I have seen: race is framed as either a social construct or some rigid taxonomic classification. This seems uninformed, race exists in a social context as all races are constructed from phenotypes. Most phenotypic characteristics that determine race are genetic and correlate w/ ancestry. While you might be able to find all sorts of phenotypes in all races, the race-relevant ones won’t have similar ubiquity as these traits will cluster by race.   
  
Of course, the exact nature of race will be a socially constructed layer. A layer whose application depends on the extent to which differences in ancestry exist in a given population as well as culture-specific forces. Furthermore, social constructs are not random things that random people from centuries ago invent and enforce on the population. They are constructed with reference to objective non-socially constructed things as well as the utility of a concept in a societal context. The objective thing seems to be ancestry and it is mediated by what specific ancestries exist in the social context (e.g. An Arab country might see races as discriminating between local ethnic groups while the same people in, say America, would be seen as Middle Eastern.)   
   
Therefore any societal construction of race will always be identifiable by ancestry given knowledge of the social construction. Given what races exist in a society, a genetic test will be able to tell them apart. I find it very hard to imagine a concept that a genetic test could accurately capture not being biological.  
  
A counter I could see to this would be that the biological things deemed relevant are biological but that the reason they are deemed relevant is from social construction. This seems unconvincing in light of the role of ancestry—which is not socially constructed—because there are no things seen inherent to race that are not ancestral. It may be the case that the importance to a society of one race is socially constructed—think slavery—however, that is just an application of race as a varying of the importance won’t change identification unless the social construction changes.  
  
So how would one contend that race is not mediated by a genetic ancestral component and if so what other mechanisms would race be constructed around? Please, CMV.

That trans woman aren’t allowed to compete in women tournaments anymore. 

A seemingly incoherent argument because it’s not like trans women gain brains by transitioning. But the divide in chess between man and woman has never been about differences in intellect. It has been about social perception and stereotypes. The only reason why there are fewer high level chess players is because of sexism and misogyny. 

Trans women (at least those who have transitioned later in life) have not had to deal with the sexism that hold back cis women. That being said I see how a compelling argument could be bad that transphobia is a greater barrier to success then sexism and I’ll welcome that argument if someone makes it. 

Ultimately I know believe trans women should be not allowed to compete in women’s sports in general not because of physical differences (I don’t really think they are all that significant) but of cultural expectations that trans women are shielded from before they transition.

This all being said I see how my argument falls apart quite quickly. Do we discriminate any group that has a inherent advantage like black women who have higher testosterone in racing? I think this is discrimination so why I don’t feel the same about trans women I feel like the situations are different but ultimately I’m just not really educated on these things so hence my post.

In general men and women tend to put their thoughts and emotions into different boxes from A to Z. (Some refer to this as waffle brain vs spaghetti brain).

Communication often breaks down because couples aren't having the same conversations with one another. A man typically opens one or two boxes at a time and discusses those things, e.g. boxes A and B. Vs while he's discussing boxes A and B, and thinks that's what is being discussed, she starts the conversation, but most of her boxes are connected emotionally. The conversation might start with boxes A and B, but she also opens boxes C,D, E,F and G. He gets frustrated because he doesn't understand why she's bringing up CDEFG when they're discussing A and B. She gets annoyed because she feels unheard because he's not acknowledging CDEFG.

They aren't having the same discussion, and communication breaks down, a fight ensues and both parties leave feeling unheard.

This is basically what people are talking about when they use the stereotype of men thinking logically and women thinking emotionally.

Obviously not __all__ men and women are like this, but it is majority.

Can anyone change my view on this?"

So per the rules of the Colloquium we say to him that you cannot stay. The person (American) that invited him suddenly starts calling me elitist and trumpist (I don't play trumpet 🎺 ahah jk).

It's also the thing with private property. I see US people in the internet going crazy if someone steps into their property like we are playing 'dont touch lava'. YOU HAD THE NERVE TO BREATHE INTO MY BACKYARD? LET ME GET THE GUN. That's seriously the vibe I am getting from this behaviour. 

Another related incident: I had a semi-fight with my Stepmom and I decide to post it at r/AITHA. People responding there are mostly Americans I guess. They start fighting me saying it's her house so she can do whatever she likes (problem being she was ironing at 6 am and I told her whether she could iron later in the day). Apparently, according to the majority of the comments I'm destined to hearing squeaky sounds early in the morning because I had the nerve to step into someone else's property. 

Lol, guys there's something called hospitality. They just don't get these kind of concepts. 

Anyways, I take this as clear evidence that Americans are too sensitive to whatever is going on in the public sphere. It's as if they misuse the power they are given whenever there's a problem going on that involves them. They are too quick to escalate things just because there's a seeming violation of their rights.

Of course, it's much easier to do this before starting a family, but even then, it's extremely worthwhile.

The reasons are obvious: First, there's no way to have a valid perspective on your own country and culture until you have experienced living in a different one. It also enables personal growth, making you more outgoing, open-minded, and better at connecting with people from different backgrounds. By exposing yourself to so many new ideas and cultures, it also enables you to pick and choose the best aspects from each place you've lived. Ultimately, if most people did this, it would make every country better as people attempt to replicate the best of what they've experienced back in their home countries (if they return).

I also want to dispel some oft-repeated myths regarding moving abroad:

**""It's expensive""** This myth is often repeated on r/expats and r/iwantout by people saying that they ""just have to save up enough money to move."" When I moved from the US to the UK and from the UK to Sweden, I was able to do so without spending much money at all (less than $1k each time).

**""Getting a visa is complicated""** You just apply for a job like you would at home, but ensure that they are able to sponsor visas (most companies are). Then, they take care of any costs associated with it and you just fill in the paperwork

**""I won't make any friends""** This is a common misconception; instead of seeking out fellow expats, people should befriend locals. You can start with pubs and bars, but work friends introducing you to their friends is another viable path. The best way, IMO, is to have a friend *from your target country* living in your home country, who can introduce you to their friends (in my case it was my Swedish friends living in London, for example).

**""I can't learn the language""** First, there are so many great English-speaking places to move. Second, there are so many amazing countries where you can work in English, and learn the local language once you arrive (the Nordics, the Netherlands, much of SE Asia, etc.)

**""My country is the best, so what's the point?""** There's no such thing as ""the best country,"" every country is great for some things, okay for others, and terrible for some things too. The only way to find out is by actually moving somewhere new.

**""I can just visit other countries, I don't have to live there""** There is an obviously massive difference in personal experiences between being a tourist and being a resident. When you become a local, you experience a country, and all its strengths and weaknesses, in a way that is impossible to appreciate as a tourist."

I noticed that my right wing Friends get a kick out of liberals freaking out over intentionally provocative conservative narratives created to upset liberals. My friends have frequently pointed out News orgs like the New York Times and CNN spent something like a 5 to 1 ratio on trumps tweets compared to Fox News and highlight how the goal is not so much to get people to agree with them.

Whoever you end up marrying will have fluctuating feelings for other people once the feeling for you fluctuate (from that chemical reaction). There’s always going to be temptation to cheat. If the scenario is right, they probably will (things are going bad in your relationship, someone else makes the right move, etc.). Now you’ve just got yourself into a mess because we expect forced loyalty to be equivalent to a Disney movie. It’s in our nature as a species to seek others. Our romantic love for someone is something that comes and goes. There’s no point in getting married in this day and age, unless maybe you want to create some sort of facade of stability for a family unit. Even then, it isn’t guaranteed.

Children cannot get tattoos, apply for jobs, or make other life changing decisions on the basis that they are not mature enough to understand the gravity of the impact of their choices. I’ve read many cases of children who transitioned and later come to regret their decision later in life. Kids are more often than not confused about their identity and tend to grow out of such feelings if there isn’t adult or peer in their life who is “adding fuel to the fire” so to speak. There is an article that highlights my feelings on the matter much more eloquently than I care to do myself called “[I Thought I Was Saving Trans Kids. Now I’m Blowing the Whistle](https://www.thefp.com/p/i-thought-i-was-saving-trans-kids)”, which was penned by a former transgender healthcare official. 

If they still wish such a transition by the time they reach adulthood, then I don’t see any issue with the matter.

To start this off I want to just throw out the notion that women are better looking them men, I see this everywhere people talking about how for every hundred pretty girls there is like one attractive man. Which doesn’t even make any sense considering a lot of the make-up and cosmetics women do to look “prettier” is something men on average naturally have .Like for example women try to make eyebrows thicker or eyelashes longer and fuller with makeup. Applying contour around their jaw to make is look sharper and more prominent. Men on average naturally have thicker eyebrows than women, fuller and longer eyelashes , they also can have the same effect of shaper and stronger jawline naturally unlike women by just growing their scruff a little. These are just a few examples there are more of course.

Men’s skin is thicker and have more collagen density , hence why on average their less likely to get wrinkles , sagging skin and stuff at an earlier age . Men’s hormones decline is more gradually and remain stable longer than women when aging as well so they are less likely to have a sharp increase in visual aging .

Men are also way less likely to get stuff like cellulite due stronger connective tissue and lower levels of fat. One thing men do have a lot worse is around 70 percent experience some sort of hair lose and the number is only around 50% for women, but still some bald men can look hot so this isn’t necessarily the end .

The last thing I want to talk about is why the notion that women are prettier on average even exists, this is just my theory of course. I theorize this notion exist due to a multitude of reasons but mainly bcus women’s looks are given more importance more than men but the threshold of what is considered an attractive woman is much lower than that of a man. Men’s looks are given less importance than that of women, but they have a higher threshold they have to cross to be considered attractive. This creates a system in which due to women’s looks seen as a more a crucial component to women , more of them put effort into their looks and with a lower standard of what’s pretty ,more of them appear “pretty”. Now for men less of them put effort into their look’s because it’s just not seen as important and with the standard of beauty being higher , very few men appear attractive to people .

I think men can be just as attractive or more than women, a lot of men are naturally blessed and have potential to look good."

1,2023-08-20,cmv: Intelligence is Likely Linked to Ethnicity,u/rage_comics_inc,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15wfhrr/cmv_intelligence_is_likely_linked_to_ethnicity/,changemyview,"Whilst I personally believe one should be judged on the merits of their character rather than of traits they cannot control, I also believe that ethnicity is linked with the prevalence of certain characteristics. To a degree, such a view is not taken as necessarily problematic. Such is the case when discussing non-psychological features; height being a clear example. It is unlikely even the most “progressive” of us would find issue in stating that the dutch tend to be quite tall. On average their height could be said to be taller than another ethnic group with little push back from anyone. 

In contrast, in discussing psychological features (intelligence and tendencies for violence, for example) one is restricted by social norms to proclaim the irrelevancy of genetics. At least in reference to differences between ethnic groups. Such a restriction plays an important role in maintaining the social fabric. Such ideas have time and again been used to justify an array of dark and evil practises, from slavery to genocide. Yet, I believe the reason for this is more so related to the value people choose to ascribe to a human’s life as dependent on having certain psychological qualities rather than the ethnic differences just existing.

Now consider these 3 statements.

1: “Ethnic group X is generally taller than Ethnic group Y”

2: “Ethnic group A is generally smarter than Ethnic group B”

and 

3: “And so Ethnic group X/A is superior to ethnic group Y/B and the value of their lives is higher”

I believe that statements 1 and 2 are potentially both accurate when said in the correct context but statement 3 is never accurate no matter what context it is said in. I would wager that many would agree with what I just said about statements 1 and 3, but not 2. “There’s just no way to separate the influence of environment and genetics on intelligence” they (or you) might respond to the second statement. And you would be correct. There is no way to really know. But that doesn’t mean ethnic differences do not exist. I should note that, unlike height, there is also no clear way to measure intelligence and there is debate over what intelligence even is. To say anything about intellectual differences between ethnic groups with certainty is presumptuous.

With that being said, Ashkenazi Jews, less than .1% of the world’s population, are responsible for over a quarter of all nobel prizes, have an average IQ of over 115, make up around half of the worlds best chess players of all time and are massively overrepresented in law, medicine and politics. Beyond anti-Semitic rhetoric maintaining nepotism to be the sole reason for such facts, there is little to counter the idea that genes probably play a role. Sure people have come up with numerous reasons why Jewish culture encourages this insanely high success rate. But such reasons cannot and do not explain the sheer magnitude of Jewish success. Especially when you consider the diversity of culture Ashkenazi Jews experience, yet the homogeneity of genes. 

I am convinced the only reason someone would completely disregard the possibility that genetics play a role in Ashkenazi intelligence is to maintain the idea that general differences between ethnicities in terms of psychological characteristics do not exist. And that they only try to maintain this idea because in the past people have used the alternative to justify atrocities. Yet if one was to believe that someone’s life is not less valuable than another’s just because they are not as intelligent, then such an idea is not dangerous. It simply acknowledges the likely reality of the situation."

Maybe they don't like men of the ""real world"" because they are too mean, jerks, and I would understand that, but if a fictional man has some nice qualities and they like him, if said man exist in the real world then they most likely would still hold a crush on him.

1,2023-08-20,CMV: Nothing needs to be done about the cobalt exploitation going on in the Congo right now,u/monkeymalek,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15wg0v1/cmv_nothing_needs_to_be_done_about_the_cobalt/,changemyview,"Hello r/changemyview,  
Recently I've been following discussions on cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and despite much of the injustice one might argue is occurring, I contend that no immediate action is needed to address the ongoing cobalt exploitation. I'd like to detail my reasons and invite a discussion on the topic.  
1. \*\*Economic Importance\*\*: The DRC accounts for more than 60% of the world's cobalt production. This mineral is crucial for the production of batteries, especially in electric vehicles (EVs) and electronics, which are critical sectors for our transition to a greener and more digitalized future. If we hinder cobalt mining in the DRC, we may unintentionally slow down this much needed transition.  
2. \*\*Self-Regulation and Market Mechanisms\*\*: There are market-driven initiatives such as the Fair Cobalt Alliance which aim to improve conditions in artisanal mines. As the demand for ethically-sourced cobalt increases, I would posit that the market will naturally adjust to these demands without the need for additional external interference.  
3. \*\*Foreign Interference\*\*: Intervening in the internal matters of a sovereign nation can be seen as a form of neo-colonialism. The DRC has a complex history with foreign powers exploiting its resources. Direct interference may not be received well and could have unforeseen consequences for the region.  
4. \*\*Local Livelihoods\*\*: A significant number of Congolese rely on artisanal cobalt mining for their daily bread. Without a carefully planned transition plan, direct interference could push these miners into even more challenging living conditions or more precarious economic activities.  
5. \*\*Global Interconnectedness\*\*: With globalization, raw materials sourced from one country often undergo multiple transformations in various nations before becoming a final product. If we focus solely on cobalt from the DRC, we risk being hypocritical, as there are various supply chains worldwide with their own set of ethical issues.  


6. \*\*Principle of Rational Self-Interest\*\*: People, when given freedom of choice, generally act in their rational self-interest. They assess their options based on the available information and personal circumstances and choose the one that they believe is best for them. In the case of the Congolese people, either they do not have a choice and are forced to take the mining jobs, or they have a choice between their previous way of life and that based on mining and they have evidently chosen to take the mining jobs. From this perspective, external intervention that disrupts the cobalt industry could deprive these individuals of an option they deem beneficial, further emphasizing the importance of individual choice and agency.  
That said, I'm open to changing my view. I believe in the importance of ethical considerations, but I also see the complexities of the issue at hand. I'd love to hear counterarguments and any overlooked perspectives. Please help me understand the broader implications and potential solutions to the cobalt situation in the Congo.  
\---  
Note: While the above post provides arguments for the stated viewpoint, it's essential to keep in mind the ongoing human rights violations and environmental concerns associated with cobalt mining in the DRC. Many advocate for international involvement, stricter regulations, and alternative sourcing to alleviate these issues."

Everyone should be required by law to donate to a charitable cause of their choice every month, as reparations for unethical consumption. It can be anything, from feeding the homeless, to cleaning the environment, to LGBTQ advocacy groups. 

Since the US government doesn’t want to help marginalized groups, and boycotting everything problematic is impossible (we’re people, not philanthropy drones), this would be a way to ensure at least some cashflow goes to helping the needy.

In fact, if they were to arrest people based on their illegal activities, there would be fewer criminals out there.

1,2023-08-20,CMV: Minorities will never fully see eye to eye because blacks will never full assimilate while Asians (all people of Asia) are more than happy to.,u/Ecstatic-Copy-5317,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15wi80p/cmv_minorities_will_never_fully_see_eye_to_eye/,changemyview,"And this can be proven with marriage rates. Nearly half of Asian women are marrying specifically white men and also have a disdain for people of color. The rise in toxic forums like hapas and the constant discussions of white worship in the Asian masculinity forums proves that Asian women are happy to assimilate and social climb via marriage to a white man. White does not equal smart and successful, but I digress.

Black men also marry outside of their race at twice the rate that black women do, but it’s still a far, distant number of Asian women. 

In America, Asian women are also rarely seen in spaces with asian men, and if they are, they are usually outnumbered in the group 5 to 1. 

The reason why more black people don’t speak up against Asian hate is because Asian people come to this country expecting black ppl to be bad and white ppl to be good based off of their own colorism issues. They overlook horrible things white men do but generalize black ppl despite being forced to be in this country and despite never being taught English. 

Much of Asian life in America is contrived in the eyes of black people; they bow down too easily and are swayed by words of white people regardless of what is being said. Black ppl will fully never assimilate in the same way; while white people are not a monolith, there are conversations had behind the backs of black ppl and gatekeeping attraction, finances, real estate, Etc is VERY important to white ppl. 

White Americans and Asians have a lot in common in terms of history. A lot of rival countries and communities live in close proximity of each other, creating a lot of rivalries for resources. They are war-torn ppl, and status is very important to these groups. 

Status is important to black Americans too but in a different and less contrived way."

141,2023-08-20,CMV: Forced romance in movies and shows are just a safety net for a weak plot (Sometimes),u/Vegetable_Ad2264,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15wizbd/cmv_forced_romance_in_movies_and_shows_are_just_a/,changemyview,"It's quite frustrating how the inclusion of a love interest has become almost obligatory for characters in superhero and action movies. It's as if some filmmakers believe that a romantic subplot is a necessary ingredient for success, regardless of whether it fits naturally into the story line. This often leads to clunky and forced relationships that do little to enhance the overall plot. It's clear that many of these movies prioritize visual spectacle and action sequences over crafting a cohesive and engaging narrative.

&#x200B;

  
What's truly disappointing is that this pattern creates the notion that a character's growth is incomplete without a romantic partner. This reduces the complexity of characters to a one-dimensional pursuit of affection. While there are instances where a well-developed romance can add emotional depth (All of the Lord of The Rings films), it's important to recognize that not every story requires it. The lack of focus on creating meaningful, multi-dimensional characters and thought-provoking story lines reveals a lack of creative ambition in favor of adhering to a formulaic approach.

&#x200B;

  
Ultimately, I feel like most of the audience wants storytelling that challenges conventions, rather than conforming to them. I wish some film makers embraced the idea that any character can stand strong without being propped up by a romantic subplot. By investing in character development, intricate plots, and compelling conflicts, filmmakers can break free from the confines of tired clichés and deliver narratives that truly resonate and captivate audiences.  
Personally I think its awesome that we get a ton of solo female leads who don't have any romantic interests but it seems that its a little rare when it comes to guys.

\-  
Here are some movies where the romance subplot feels forced:  
""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013) - The romance between Thor and Jane Foster wasn't as developed or central to the plot as it could have been.

&#x200B;

  
""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" (2014) - While the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone was appreciated, I and some felt the romantic drama overshadowed the main plot.

&#x200B;

  
""Green Lantern"" (2011) - The relationship between Hal Jordan and Carol Ferris was criticized by some as lacking depth. The movie itself was shit.

&#x200B;

  
""The Mummy"" (2017) - Tom Cruise's character's relationship with Annabelle Wallis's character was shoehorned into the plot.

&#x200B;

  
""Justice League"" (2017) - I felt the romantic tension between Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince was unnecessary.

&#x200B;

  
""Transformers"" series - The romance plots in these films, especially the ones involving Shia LaBeouf's and Megan Fox's characters, were detracting from the main plot.

&#x200B;

  
""Daredevil"" (2003) - The relationship between Matt Murdock/Daredevil and Elektra Natchios was so underdeveloped that it didn't need to even be there.

&#x200B;

  
""Jurassic World"" (2015) - The romantic subplot between Owen and Claire was cliche and forced.  
""Terminator Salvation"" (2009) - The relationship between Marcus Wright and Blair Williams felt tacked on.

&#x200B;

  
""Man of Steel"" (2013) - The romance between Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane was rushed. Shes know him for am estimated total of 3-5 days.  
1. First Meeting in the Arctic: Lois first encounters Clark when she follows him to the Kryptonian scout ship. He saves her life after she is attacked by a security robot from the ship.  
2. Smallville: After her encounter with Clark in the Arctic, Lois starts her investigation which eventually leads her to Smallville. She interacts with Clark and Martha Kent, learning more about his backstory.  
3. Events in Metropolis: Once General Zod and his followers arrive, Lois is integral to the plan to stop them, especially given her experience with the Kryptonian ship and her interactions with Jor-El's hologram. She is with Clark when they surrender to Zod, spends time aboard Zod's ship with Clark, and is present during the climactic battles in Metropolis.  
It is hard to pin down an exact number of days they physically talk to each other. But based on these events and how they went with the film 3-5 days is my guess where they have significant interactions.

\-  
And here are some recent ones I personally feel weren't necessary. (I'm hesitant to put DC stuff in here because of its adaptation from comics, but I still feel like these romances felt forced.) 

SPOILERS AHEAD!

  
Morbius (2022): (Granted, this movie was bad overall)>! The relationship and interest between Morbius and Martine felt so stale and did not contribute to the film in any way, I feel. It seemed to be there because they needed Morbius to be sympathized with. He needed someone to protect, but what about his father? They could've very much used his father as his emotional anchor instead of killing him off.!<

&#x200B;

  
Blue Beetle (2023):>! I had high expectations, and I guess I shouldn't have. The relationship between Jaime Reyes and his family was way more important to both his character and the plot than his relationship with Jenny Kord. It wasn't necessary at all, and as soon as she showed up on screen, I knew exactly how their interactions would go. I feel she didn't contribute much to the story besides being the previous Blue Beetles daughter and overshadowed it because we barely got to see the relationship between Jaime and the Scarab. It felt unnecessary. The story itself isn't that good, in my opinion. I liked most of it, but it had so much potential.!<

&#x200B;

  
Prodigal Son (2019) : A television series that delves into the life of Malcolm Bright, a profiler with a unique perspective on criminals, especially considering his father is a notorious serial killer. The show has various relationship dynamics mostly between Malcolm and his family as they cope with his fathers past. >!The relationship between Malcolm and Dani Powell in the first season was perfectly fine. They were strictly work partners with some rivalry, and she actively disliked him and didn't trust him. Then, out of nowhere in the second season, the writers introduced romance between them, right in the middle of a story line that everyone was focused on. It felt odd, especially since she was still actively not fond of him up to that point.!<

&#x200B;

  
There's way more I could add on but these are the ones that have been on my mind. I do want to hear others opinions on this. My mother is a sucker for anything romance and I just don't see a need for it half the time. So yeah I'd love to understand better."

Any story can get more clicks if it's suggested that sexism or racism is a part of it, even if the story has nothing to do with either. ""Man Shoots Neighbor's Dog"" will simply not get as many clicks as ""White Man Shoots Black Neighbor's Dog"", even if race is irrelevant to the events of the story. Similarly, ""Man Gets Bullied Out of game Store"" will not get as many clicks as ""Woman Gets Bullied Out of Game Store"". Journalists, youtubers, bloggers, etc. therefore have a motivation to suggest that sexism is widespread, even in places where it isn't.  
  
Can you find stories of actual sexism in ttrpg settings? Of course you can. And I have no reason to disbelieve any of them. To claim that sexism is a problem specifically in the ttrpg hobby though is to suggest that it's more common there than it is in the rest of society, which I don't believe is the case. There's tens of thousands of game stores across the US, and many games are played in them every day. If you found 100 individual instances of sexism in a year occurring at a ttrpg event, that would still be a negligible amount.  
  
And the 100 figure is pretty generous. Despite all the claims that ttrpgs are filled with toxic sexists, actual examples of it are rather sparse. Even including ""that guy"" stories here on reddit, which mostly include games at someone's house and not in a game store, I struggled to find 10 examples within the last year. And that's assuming all the ""that guy"" stories occurred in 2023 and they're not just recounting something that happened years prior or exagerated/made up to farm upvotes (which is fairly common in subs like dndhorrorstories). And many of the recent articles about sexism in ttrpgs reference just a handful of incidents that happened years ago.  
  
Of course, not all instances of sexism get news. Though to declare an entire hobby to be hostile to women, one would expect to see *many* big stories about sexism per month. Not just a handful every year.  
  
The dialogue about ttrpgs being sexist could have sprung from how ttrpgs are just a male-dominated hobby, and that's been extrapolated into the assumption that women aren't made to feel welcome in the hobby. I see no reason to believe that. Many hobbies tend to attract more of one gender than the other. Horseback riding is dominated by women, and I don't think the reason is that men don't feel welcome around horse ranches. TTRPGs being a male-dominated hobby is not sufficient evidence that sexism is present.  
  
To go into personal evidence, few things sound quite as insane to me as ""men in ttrpg communities gatekeep women from joining in"". Like, yeah, my FAVORITE part of playing D&D in middle and high school was that girls didn't want to hang out with us! It was great!!!! /s  
  
So that's my view: There's no strong evidence that the ttrpg hobby is more sexist than society at large is, and the idea that sexism is rampant is driven by attempts to generate clicks."

Because why would they?

Before the Galactic Republic became the Empire, it was was already (mostly) a united group of planets with many species represented. The Empire, obviously, wants as many planets in its fold as possible. So why would they willingly choose to alienate most of their worlds by only letting in humans?

This obviously wasn't a policy when the Republic was in charge, so that means the change would have had to be made by Palpatine. But why would he care? He clearly didn't care about species when it came to his sith master (Plagueis) and apprentice (Maul), so it can't have been because he himself was speciesist. It's also worth mentioning that Palpatine never expresses human supremacist sentiments.

Further, I'm pretty sure it wasn't even canon that Palpatine was a human himself until The Phantom Menace. In The Empire Strikes Back, he was clearly meant to be non-human given his appearance in the hologram. Though his appearance changed in Return of the Jedi to be more human-like (probably so Ian McDiarmid wouldn't have to act through big monster eyes), he still looked less human than Twi'leks do.

I've seen people bring up the issue of how the Empire only had human officers, but if that's evidence that they were human supremacists then the rebels must also have been human supremacists since almost all their officials were also human. Yes in TESB and ROTJ they had a few non-human members, but the rebels were clearly dominated by human characters.

The ""real"" reason aliens were so absent in both factions is because it's not really feasible to have dozens of actors with bit parts sit in makeup for 7 hours before you can shoot your scenes. This is why of all the original trilogy, the most non-humans you ever see in one scene (not counting ewoks which were just small bear suits with limited facial expressions) was in the Mos Eisley Cantina, even though they had way bigger budgets in the later two films. Therefore, I don't think the absence of aliens on the decks of Star Destroyers can be used as evidence the Empire always had an anti-alien sentiment.

Now to address the nazi in the room, yes, making them human supremacists was certainly to make them a stronger allegory for the third reich. *It still doesn't make sense*. Hitler used race as a point of pride to drum up support. Palpatine already had support. Hitler's soldiers and allies were all already white people so being white supremacist didn't alienate a large portion of his people. Palpatine being human supremacist alienated most of his people. ""It's an allegory"" isn't a defense for a bad allegory.

The Empire being human supremacist runs completely counter to its goals, and for no adequately-explained reason. We know Palpatine isn't speciesist, and we know the Empire wants control over the galaxy, so the Empire intentionally alienating most of the galaxy by favoring just one species makes zero sense."

Then i questioned myself about what is right and what is wrong for me.

I recognized that these values are actually just the outcome of  what i was taught and how i was treated before (to put in general terms). Then i recognized  that maybe my values were not the right ones universally, but just the right one for me. That maybe i would have had a different way of seeing the world in a different environment. I started seeing the world differently and absorbing an ideology like moral relativismus. Episodes that supported my ideology were thoughts about killing those people that hurt me. Im sure that if i did not have a proper education, i would have done that. And in my mind i would have been absolutely right. Maybe the same goes with murders, they are victims of a mixture of upringing,episodes and god knows what. But we judge them solely on their actions without considering the root.

They say that people should consume no more than 2 alcoholic drinks per week. Any more will put you at moderate to hight risk of having health problems. 

I think this is silly. I acknowledge that alcohol has detrimental affects on health. But, if you consume alcohol, 2 drinks per week is basically nothing. So, the Canadian government might as well say that they don't recommend any alcohol consumption at all. 

Imagine that you're a kid, and your parent starts lecturing you on the negative health affects of eating chocolate. You protest that it would be excessively prohibitive for them to ban chocolate. They defensively say that they're not banning chocolate entirely. They'll allow you to have 1 M&M per week. At that point, you would scoff. Allowing 1 M&M per week is very nearly a ban on chocolate. That's comparable to what the Canadian government is doing. 

To be fair, I understand that they are merely making recommendations. They're not implementing alcohol prohibition. But, they might as well recommend zero alcohol consumption. By recommending a 2 drink per week maximum, that's basically what they're doing. They're ensuring that their guidance will be disregarded by anyone who consumes alcohol."

its so nice when i can play a game like skyrim, and see literally all of my autosaves for all of my different characters. they have no qualms just keeping them all forever, and yet for whatever reason most games do not do this. they have either limited save slots like say, no mans sky, or they have autosave over-writes, in where it will over-write the last autosave, or only keep a catalogue of the last 3 or what have you. which means if you realise too late you need to reload to a previous state from like an hour ago, well good luck buddy because that data is now completely gone unless you manually create a backup every 30 minutes, which is an asbolute pain in comparison.

now there is the middle ground of games that keep all manual saves and only over-write autosaves, but i still dont see why this needs to be done. i was playing a game recently and noticed it has a box that was something along the lines of ""number of autosaves before overwite"" and i simply put the largest number it would let me which was like 9999999. It really made me question why this isnt a standard features of games, ive been fucked over so many times because ive needed to load a save from before my oldest available autosave, and i cant comprehend what the need for doing this is... especially if you give the user a choice in the matter.

and save slots are just actually dumb. you can make some sort of argument for autosaves that maybe someone wont realise or understand the ramifications and load up their limited space on a console with unnecessary amounts of autosaves. but when we're talking about save files? just let me have as many as i want to make, no one is making enough characters in a game to cause any issues. hell i have dozens of skyrim characters with hundreds of saves, it takes up a completely negligible amount of space on my drive. the other game, X4:Foundations is known for its awful save bloat and i STILL dont notice it taking up an abnormal amount of space.

so seriously. what the fuck? can anyone help me understand and perhaps make me ""see the light"" as to why in God's name every game doesnt just give the player the choice to have unlimited save slots and a permanent catalogue of autosaves? im just trying to see if there's an angle ive not seen to this, but my only thought is that its there to protect the truly technologically inept in very minor circumstances where that space becomes important (im not having a go at those who are technologically inept, i completely understand that for those not accustomed to tech can find it very hard to grasp) but that seems like such an edge case, where you would need someone who doesnt really understand that saves take space, enable the feature to have permanent autosave catalogue, plays said games so much that they get hundreds of saves AND just happen to have incredibly limited storage space... that doesnt seem likely to me.

They invaded Ukraine, bar none, since then Ukraine has been at war to reclaim Crimea and since the Russian Invasion in February 2022 the war escalated to a full scale Invasion of Ukraine.

Russias objectives were simple, take over Ukraine and at the least install a puppet government they can control if not outright make it apart of Russia.

Since then Russia has had their asses kicked and thus changed their objective to basically controlling Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea. 

When some people are questioned about this war they simply take the side they are ""Anti War"" and want some sort of magical fairy diplomatic solution to the war. This is impossible unless major Russia policy change happens, which it won't.

Russia has made it know they will not leave peacefully from the Ukrainian states of Luhansk, Donestsk, and Crimea, which all belong to Ukraine bar none, end of story. To say Ukraine should not try and retake their country by any means necessary including the awful and violent war they fight now is absurd. To state simply you are ""anti war"" or are ""anti political and not taking a side (looking at you Sabaton)"" is an endorsement of Russia holding control over these 3 territories currently under Russian occupation and is an endorsement of Russians imperialistic ambitions. Russia wants to world to be ambivalent and feel ""this isn't something that affects me"" or ""I don't want any war!"" So that countries won't back Ukraine and won't give them what they need to oust Russia from Ukrainian territory.. 

War sucks, Ukraine doesn't want to be at war, it does not want to invade and occupy Russia, if they end up doing that I would not support it. What I do support is Ukraine retaking its rightful holdings under International Law. This is not a pro war statement, this is in fact an anti war stance, Ukraine wants what is rightfully theirs and I guarantee if there was a way to get it without a violent and bloody conflict Ukraine would do it. But they cannot because of Russias war of aggression.

1,2023-08-20,CMV: Jar Jar Binks is a racist dogwhistle,u/NMA_company744,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15wou58/cmv_jar_jar_binks_is_a_racist_dogwhistle/,changemyview,"Jar Jar Binks’ role in the Phantom Menace has been widely despised for his uselessness and getting in the way of the plot for “comedic relief.” I think the hate for Jar Jar is completely missing the real issue, and instead it should be streamlined into his use as a metaphor for black Jamaicans.

**JAr JAr Binks**: This is the most damning evidence of all. Rastafarianism is a prominent religion in Jamaica that places emphasis on the history and mistreatment of African diaspora in North America. The God to whom they adhere is commonly refered to as “Jah,” a variation of “YHWH” like “Jehova” or “Yahweh.” Is it purely coincidental that this term appears twice in his name?

**Binks:** Now that I’ve established that the first part is a blatant dogwhistle it’s important to examine the significance of “Binks.” This sounds oddly similar to the language that would have been used by blackface minstrels in early 1900’s America, usually making a mockery of an African American accent. The far-right dogwhistle “bix nood” emerged from the style of broken English spoken by minstrels, and it’s impossible to ignore the similarities between “binks” and “bix.” 

**Broken English**: Jar Jar’s use of simplified English, when considering his racist name, can easily lead one to believe that his Gungan dialect as well is derived from Carribean Pidgin as a cruel mockery of it. Once again, his broken English is very much comparable to the language used by the typical southern blackface minstrel, who essentially acted as a “jester,” just like Jar Jar.

**Jar Jar leaves his home and becomes a slave to two white Jedis**: After Jar Jar is saved from the Galactic Federation droids by Qui-Gon Jin he declares himself his “humble servant;” later after descending through the waters of Naboo into the Gungan homeland, the Jedis save Jar Jar from persecution by justifying his enslavement with a so-called “life debt:” that because his life was saved, it essentially becomes the property of an owner."

1,2023-08-20,CMV: Morality is objective,u/Lokokan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15wt7ec/cmv_morality_is_objective/,changemyview,"When I say that morality is objective, I mean:

(A) moral sentences like “torture is wrong” express propositions that are true or false (this negates non-cognitivism)

(B) moral propositions are true or false in virtue of features of the world, and not in virtue of what goes on in our heads (thus negates relativism and all forms of subjectivism)

(C) some moral propositions are true (this negates error theory)

Firstly, I think there’s a presumption of objective morality. (1) our ordinary moral talk seems to assume a kind of objectivity. We reason about moral issues and we seem to be disagreeing with each other about whether something is morally correct. (2) certain moral statements like “causing unnecessary harm is wrong” “it’s good to keep your promises” seem self-evident. I admit, none of this is sufficient to show that morality is objective. But I think it’s sufficient to show a presumption of objective morality. 

Some arguments that people give against objective morality:

*The argument from disagreement*

1. People throughout history and between cultures disagree about what the morally right think to do is
2. If people disagree about what the morally right think to do is, then morality is not objective 
3. So morality is not objective 

People who argue like this don’t usually state (2), but this is an assumption that’s required for the argument’s validity. And it’s an assumption that’s implausible: it doesn’t follow from the fact that people disagree about a matter that there is no objective fact about the matter. Intelligent, thoughtful people have debated the existence of God for millennia. And today, we have flat earthers who disagree with the prevailing science. There is also intense debate about the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics. But no one would say that there is no fact of the matter in any of these issues - either God exists or he doesn’t; either the earth is flat or it isn’t; either some or other interpretation of QM is correct or it isn’t. The fact that people disagree is irrelevant. 

*The argument from lack of epistemic access*

1. If there is no reliable way to come to know moral truths, then morality is not objective 
2. There is no reliable way to come to know moral truths 
3. So morality is not objective 

An argument of this sort was given by J. L. Mackie. Firstly, premise (1) needs some defence. It may be that there is a fact of the matter even if humans don’t have the required capacities to determine those facts. We can’t know everything, after all. 

But suppose it’s true that we don’t have any reliable way to come to know moral truths. Even if not an argument against objectivism, it would be an argument for moral *skepticism*—we wouldn’t be justified in thinking that any moral claim is true. We would have to suspend judgement on all things morality, and this is plainly a challenge to the moral realist. 

In response, we can say that there are reliable methods for coming to know moral truths—relatively uncontroversial methods that we use to come to know other kinds of truths. Suppose utilitarianism is true: An act is right iff it produces a greater overall well-being. In that case, we can establish moral claims using observation. This is about as reliable a method as any. 

Or suppose you’re the sort of person who thinks we can have substantive a priori knowledge. In that case, very basic moral principles seem to be just the sort of things that can be known a priori."

It forces candidates to come up with a plan that people will voluntarily support with their own money. If the plan fails, that’s on the taxpayers and they take the hit. Everyone else is spared from that. I.e. the people who vote for policies should be financially responsible for them.

Existing laws, plus laws passed by the government, are in effect for everyone regardless of taxpayer status.

This sounds like a good idea because it incentivizes the government and voters to be smarter with their money. Voters could even make money with the right plan.

1,2023-08-21,CMV: Most of the Beatles music doesn't hold up,u/SpaghettiLove2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15wy4cf/cmv_most_of_the_beatles_music_doesnt_hold_up/,changemyview,"First of all, I know the Beatles were influential (although people overexaggerate). Their main influence on music is related to various production techniques used in the studio, most notably advanced for the time use of multi-tracking and chorus effects, as well as having state of the art production in general for the 60s (granted the actual band members themselves don't deserve most of the credit for this, that was more so the producers who accomplished this). 

They also directly influenced a lot of pop rock and Brit pop bands, some notable examples being Oasis and Radiohead. They obviously were one of the pioneers in the psychedelic rock genre, and some even credit them for being an early pioneer of metal music with the song Helter Skelter (although I find that to be a stretch). More broadly speaking they were one of the first ultra commercial musical acts that was also able to be slightly experimental and still top the charts, which set a good precedent for the music industry and culture in general.

With all that being said, while I agree they deserve praise for how essential they are in music history, the actual music itself doesn't hold up. Starting off with the production, while it was revolutionary for the time, obviously the production would end up getting completely surpassed in the following decades. The production on their albums is completely outdated at this point, even when listening to remastered versions. Production was one of the biggest parts of the magic of the Beatles music, and given that the production is now outdated, a lot of the magic is gone. 

Ultimately the biggest draw for their music now comes down to songwriting. Simply put, they were really good at writing a lot of catchy hooks. The thing is, if I just want fun catchy pop music with ear worm hooks and melodies, there are so many options of better stuff to listen to than the Beatles. The hip hop genre alone has endless options of stuff that blows the Beatles out of the water, especially with way more variety in the sound scapes and much cleaner production. This isn't even including all the modern digital synthpop and pop music in general that sounds better than anything by the Beatles and is generally more fun to listen to.

My next argument is looking at the Beatles discography. While they undeniably have a ton of hit songs, their albums really are a drag to listen to start to finish. Even their best albums usually have a small handful of catchy songs, and then a bunch of crap that aged poorly. Again, with the production now being outdated, and their general sound and style being surpassed by so many other musical acts, a lot of the deep cuts in their catalogue just don't hit the same like they would have hit back in the 60s. I find the songs of theirs that still hold up are the ones that have especially catchy hooks and melodies, which again I have so many better options to listen to if that's what I'm looking for.

I have no real reason to listen to the Beatles other than just appreciating an important aspect of music and pop culture history. I'm certainly not listening to the Beatles if I want complex compositions and interesting experimentation, and I'm not listening to the Beatles either if I just want fun ear candy. I get that they are still relevant half a century later and still have millions of listeners, but in my opinion that's more so because they have been grandfathered into the musical canon and are sort of an entry level artist to get into for people who are exploring music."

(Indians and Pakistanis, Sunni and Shia Muslims etc) which did nothing but cause conflict. Britain probably though to themselves “the diaspora of Jewish people must lead them to the region of Palestine, fuck the ethnic boundaries and land of the Arabs.” And thus their land was taken from them and handed over to the Jewish people. The Jewish people obviously needed a homeland that wasn’t in Europe due to centuries of discrimination, however putting it right in the center of the Middle East was a very stupid decision that only served to destabilize the Middle East.

We have huge energy supplies, machines that can make trillions of calculations per second while consuming only a few watts, and extremely smart AI software — still, most people oughta work 40 hours a week and spend several hours in commute to make less than enough for a proper living — all that while big corporations keep destroying the ecosystem and their consumerist propaganda makes us always feel inadequate and unsatisfied.

However, capitalism has two upsides:

P0rnography, and media (TV shows, movies, animes, games).

P0rnography can only exist in this scope in capitalism. The demand for it are billions of dollars, and the cash makes hundreds of thousands of people decide to sell their body this way, given that a decent living standard is often unattainable otherwise. Competition drives the acts to go more extreme and the actors to go hotter, and self-commodification platforms such as OF makes selling your body online being as common as having a Tinder profile.

This is great for consumers, and gets even better as p0rn acting often come together with IRL prostitution, so, besides getting surreal amounts of sexual stimulus through their screen, the average person nowadays can hire more (as well as more diverse and more extreme) prostitutes than ever before.

The average person today has felt more sexual pleasure than any Roman Emperor did before.

Also, stuff such as Attack on Titan or Tears of the Kingdom wouldn't exist in a socialist economy, given the huge wealth concentration  needed to make this kind of production possible. Most people really enjoy this kind of media, and it is hard to think of living without it.

Still, these are the solely two upsides of capitalism. IMO we should stay capitalist only a little longer so we get more p0rn and more media anf then go socialist."

If we could entirely normalize sexuality, and remove all connotations of shame from it, this would not make these acts polite or not a faux pas (as it would still be a violation of personal space), but it would take them out of the realm of violence, as it would not be much different from say an unwanted handshake. I can't see how constantly talking about how bad sexual violence is won't spill over into people associating sex with violence. And by addressing the symptoms in this way, we end up making the root cause worse.

I'm not unbiased in this. I've long been uncomfortable with being born male, and I've always gotten along better with women than men. I recognize that a part of why I feel uncomfortable with the current conversation is that I'm a bit sad about the fact that I'll never be able to be in female company without them seeing me as on some level different, and my body will always be seen as somewhat threatening. I'm slightly jealous of women who can just implicitly trust each other, that I'm not part of that trust. I feel like the conversation around sexual violence has deepened that gap, not mended it. I dream of a world where we can all be both free to express our sexuality and all be together without distrust or assumed differences, like in some romantic pastoral painting. I understand that this is utopian, but could we not at least try moving in that general direction?"

1,2023-08-21,CMV: A social media site that allows appointed users to permanently ban others from posting about individual topics needs reworking,u/UserOfUsingThings,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15xcdih/cmv_a_social_media_site_that_allows_appointed/,changemyview,"The social media site in question for this post being Reddit, I'm sure there are others with a similar mechanic. The original idea of subreddits were as tags to organise posts to different topics. One for tree science, one for smoking weed, you name it. But since Reddit treats these tags as communities, as the name suggests: smaller sites within the site, these communities have moderators and owners who can control what happens to posts and users of that topic.

This sounds fair enough, different topics can be browsed individually and topics cannot be spammed with gore etc like they are with tags on other sites. I enjoy the idea of subcomunities online, however the major drawback for me, and the one that caused me to post this was the ability for a single user moderator to ban you permanently as a user from a topic. Not a community, otherwise I'd have no problem for that. However, these communities are the only way to categorise posts into topics and have them viewed by the right people in the right context on the site, even though the topics are not community driven.

I think that for Reddit to maintain its “free speech” policy, it's best for tags to be available as alternatives for subreddits when people don't necessarily want to tie their post to a community.

Why do you think a subreddit only site is a good idea? I'm sorry for the rather own-opinion centered post, I'd be posting to r/unpopularopinion but I got banned as a copy-paster a while ago for disagreeing with a moderator's cereal preferences. Alternatively, r/changemyview is more debate-friendly and is centered around changing your opinion if you receive more information as a topic, as opposed to being hostile towards eachothers' current viewpoints."
1,2023-08-21,CMV: 1-based indexing is better than 0-based indexing,u/Physmatik,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15xcw8u/cmv_1based_indexing_is_better_than_0based_indexing/,changemyview,"The case for 1-based indexing is very obvious: it's the natural way of numbering items. First day of a month should be `days[1]`. Fifth student in a list should be `students[5]`. That's how we speak and count, so it's the 0-based approach that should justify itself.

Arguments I've encountered for 0-based indexing:
> [Dijkstra said so](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html)

His argument boils down to ""I think 0-based is nicer"". He also mentions an unspecified number of programmers working on an unspecified problem making an unspecified number of additional errors when not using `0 <= i < N` in some obscure language almost no one has ever heard about, which is hardly a reliable datum.

`0 <= i < N` is also a pain to reverse. In Python, for example, it's `range(10)` forward and `range(9, -1, -1)` backward (I used REPL to verify this).

In his terms, `1 <= i <= N` seems like the most natural one. 

> 0-based is more convenient when you represent coefficients of a polynomial, for example

1-based is more convenient when writing a heap (so much more convenient, in fact, that many implementations in 0-based languages just ignore the first element in array and pretend that language is 1-based). Sometimes you may even want -N to N indexing (happens with DFT). Or maybe even -N to M (Laurent polynomials).

All these examples are too niche. You may use them to make a case for custom indexing (like in Fortran or Pascal) as it is most general, but not for 0-based indexing across the whole language.

> But there are many more cases where 0-based indexing is more convenient

Source needed. Isn't the case given my personal experience.

> Pointers.

So what? Unless you are working in C where there are no arrays, this is irrelevant. You don't manually reallocate memory in a hashtable when it gets too big, why you should bother with how pointers behave on hardware level? ~~Also, C isn't quite _hardware_ level, but that's an entirely different conversation.~~

Hell, even if you work with pointers in something like Java you don't care about pointer offsets, you just use the indexing method on an array.

> No, but it's pointers _all the way down_. That `i-1` will translate into ~~huge~~ performance losses.

Source needed, I guess. I am yet to see anything empirical and reliable that will show that 1-based indexing is meaningfully slower, especially on modern CPUs with modern compilers — and please, don't link C-vs-Lua from ""Benchmarks Game"". Unfortunately, C-vs-Fortran from there won't work either given the idea of the site (separate solutions for problems, not instruction-by-instruction translation).

Also, even if tangible, for something like Python this ""performance loss"" will make no difference from practical perspective.

> You can always convert a 0-based array to a 1-based array by simply ignoring the first element, but you can't go from 1-based to 0-based

`length()` and `foreach` be damned, I guess. In some very specific cases (like with the heap I've mentioned) it can be possible, but that is very far from universality.

>Modern languages are based around collection-level thingies anyway. Indexing doesn't matter for `foreach` or `filter`

Indexing is occasionally used even in Haskell, let alone in more imperative languages. Besides, if it is almost unused, why not just make it 1-based?

> 0-based is the standard, adhering to it makes the most sense

My point isn't ""all new languages should use 1-based"", it's ""1-based is better"". Unfortunately, being the standard does not mean being the best (see keyboard layouts, for example)."

Twitch and Youtube deceives the image of reality of many young children. They will think that they WILL make a carrier out of it and they will actively pursue this dream.  
  
Since you only need a decent PC, internet connection and OBS, not like art where you need good drawing skills or not like music where you need good instrument skills. Everybody can fire up Fortnite or Minecraft and do the same as other streamers. So there isn't any healthy restraining force from starting it.  
  
Sure, many grow out from it at the later ages of being a teen, but many unfortunately does not (like my son). Even in their 20's they are blinded by the success of big streamers like XQC or Pokimane. These young people throw away educations and jobs to stream in their parents' basement for years. Many for 0 viewers. And many hold to it, hoping they will once make it, not realising they will never make it and wasting their precious young ages while descending into depression and collecting mental illnesses like it's tazo. These will either lead to mass ""bodies hit the floor"" or mental healthcare being even more saturated that it overflows one day.  
  
Second you really shouldn't combine personal entertainment with your job. It is the highway to burn out and depression. Also society shouldn't accept combining the two or else the culture that recognizes hard work will disappear and doing so will destory every motivation for people to apply for obligatory jobs that people don't like but necessary to run society. Like McDonald's employees and contruction workers.  
  
And let's be real, what they add to society? Watching XQC or IShowSpeed: my brain starts to rot. This is torture to a healthy mind. They do absolutely nothing while making a bank. This shouldn't be allowed in a society, while doctors, teachers, firefighters, engineers make almost nothing compared to these people.

When i was a kid, I was unlikable. I used to lie a lot ""which I do not now"" by creating stuff and scenarios that didn't happen and saying it did happen using my very wise imagination. I was bullied by everyone, literally everyone no matter his size no matter his strength. This started on grade 4 and kept happening until grade 8 or 9. Then I wasn't bullied physically but everyone used to mock me either because I was a little overweight or for other very silly reasons. On grade 8-9 I started to get very aggressive when anyone used to mock me very much or physically hurt me. This helped with the physical bullying thing but made it even worse in the mocking thing. Everyone except to the ones that are also hated and laughed at hated me ""except for one boy who used to like me, and I did to until I left the country for personal reasons with my parents"" but when I was still there nearly all of my classmates always used to act like they didn't to keep the mocking and provocation window open and make me even more sad when they do. In grade 10 I moved to a foreign country and many also used to hate me. But here it was much more serious, like some students just because I looked at them, they wanted to stab me and shit. I always went to the supervisor and told him, thank God he was very nice, and he loved foreigner from my nationality not like the other punks who used to be extremely racist and hating to me. He used to punish them Infront of all the class so that helped me form getting hit but didn't help me from getting mocked I failed this year, and in the second grade 10 year everyone was scared of me and kind of respected me because I was much bigger than them in size and in age. It was like this until now, no-one mocks me because I became toxic but note hating, strong but not a bully. Now I've been following a technique to FORCE everyone ""the punks and bullies"" included to respect me. I grew in muscular and total size, I'm still a bit short 170cm but I'm 20 now and everyone gives me an age of 25-26 because of my beard and body. The technique is to just not look at anyone and act and look like I'm the only person in this world, still helping and everything. Just when walking in public no Eye contact whatsoever, absolute ZERO facial expressions but if someone approaches, I automatically peacefully smile ""IDK"" why though and also feel like it's just the opposite of being sigma and strong in personality, but I also feel that to be sigma and strong in personality I don't have to be a bully and mean, I just need to be serious most of the time. also, I'd like to mention that I have absolutely no enemies in college and only 1 friend. I also forgot to mention that I'm a Muslim, I can't talk to girls because 99.9% of people talk to girls only to get in love whenever a small window is open even if that takes years of friendship the main goal of a male in the friendship is always more than friendship AND ITS THE SAME FOR ME. That's why I don't talk with girls at all and also because I have absolute zero social skills talking with girls which is the result of not talking to any in my 10-11 years of conscience ""and I'm not sad about being religious"". No-one likes me much but my parents and one boy ""Hasan"" here who never called or talked to me at all until I do so. And when I do so he's just surprisingly nice and friendly. He also talks to my brother, he calls first, open conversations but not with me. My parent always told and tell me that I'm just way to kind and nice for this time period. Thing is I always feel empty all the time. Friends come then go too fast. They don't become enemies, but they just become exactly like Hasan.

I went from being quite unattractive to quite attractive, and have therefore lived on both sides of the fence, and so I don’t disagree with the notion of pretty privilege. I do disagree with calling it privilege. 

Privilege is an unearned advantage, therefore an advantage that you earned can’t be a privilege. Take white privilege for example, I didn’t do anything to be white, just got born, so any advantage that I receive because of this is privilege. On the flip-side, if I get into a fight with a guy twice my size, he doesn’t have “strength privilege,” he’s just stronger than me. He worked hard to be strong and now reaps the rewards. This is not privilege. 

So when I hear people say “pretty privilege” I find it quite annoying. While it is true that some aspects of your attractiveness are out of your hands (height, general bone structure, etc.) most of what makes you sexually attractive is within your control. You can exercise to have an attractive body, develop a good sense of style, mess around with different hair styles, get tattooed, grow a beard, shave a beard, etc. and you can become more attractive. Almost everybody has the ability to be at least an 8 if they tried, but they don’t and then complain that attractive people get better treatment. If someone is attractive and life treats them better it’s not because of privilege. 

Comparing the advantages I gain from being white to the advantages I gain from being reasonably attractive is completely wrong. I had to spend years working to be more attractive, and all I had to do to be white was be born. 

To change my view you either must-
a. Show me that I am the one misusing the word privilege. 
b. Convince me that attractiveness really is more out of your hands then I claim."

1,2023-08-21,CMV: Having kids is great,u/Subtleiaint,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15xjb56/cmv_having_kids_is_great/,changemyview,"We often get posts here about kids, usually about how awful it is that society expects people to become parents, how having kids is selfish and environmentally unfriendly or how having kids will ruin your life. It’s very hard to respond to these posts because telling people who don’t want kids that kids are great and that they should have them is a bit of a dick move. However, this subreddit is all about expressing and defending opinions, me writing this isn’t about convincing others, it’s about defending a view that’s rarely expressed here.  
Before I explain why kids are great I need to set a condition, it is possible for something to be great whilst still being expensive, frustrating, tiring or difficult. Many great things are one or all of these things, a safari is amazing but costs a fortune, climbing Everest is one of the hardest but most rewarding things you can do and sometimes my wife is incredibly frustrating, it doesn’t mean she’s not the best thing that’s ever happened to me.  
So why is having kids great? It boils down to two main things, one, they’re great fun and two, you get to experience how wondrous the world is through their discoveries. We never stop enjoying play but, as we get older, we get responsibilities and mature, we still like play but we limit how much of it we do and the play we do do we often take seriously. Kids don’t suffer from this, they don’t have our ego, they just want to imagine and pretend and race and climb and build. It’s a pure form of play that adults have often forgotten but we get to experience again with kids. The other day I pretended my three year old daughter could electrocute me. We spent a good 10 minutes of her touching me, me pretending to get an electric shock and her laughing like crazy. It was joyous and wonderful and I rarely experience anything close to it in my wider life, my daughter and I do something like that 5 times a day, it’s incredibly fun.  
The other thing is less obvious. One of the most rewarding things we can do as adults is to achieve something we’ve never done before, the older we get the less this happens. For kids this happens like clockwork, especially early on. Seriously the pride a child feels the first time they pull on their socks is wild and guess what, the parent feels it too. Rolling over, seeing a duck, eating with a fork, catching a ball and don’t even get me started on their first steps, these are all incredible experiences and you experience them along with your child. Children reframe what life is, the most mundane things for an adult are an incredible adventure for kids. Last week I flew with my kids for the first time, I filmed them as the plane took off, it was like we were on the greatest roller coaster ever built.  
Kids give you an experience that is unlike anything else in my adult life and, despite the tantrums, despite the mess and the constant need for attention, that is absolutely worth it. Here’s the other wonderful thing, I haven’t lost the adult stuff either. It takes a bit more work but I get to go out with my friends and do all the kid free stuff I used to, I still have both worlds. Having kids is great, Change my view.

Instead, I propose that underpopulation is a much more significant threat to society. 



1. **Resource Management and Technology Advancements:** Many argue that overpopulation leads to resource scarcity and environmental degradation. However, history has shown that technological advancements and improved resource management have consistently kept pace with population growth. Innovations in agriculture, energy production, and waste management have helped support larger populations without jeopardizing the planet.



2. **Demographic Transition:** The majority of developed countries are already experiencing a decline in birth rates, leading to aging populations. This demographic transition can result in various economic and societal challenges, including labor shortages, increased dependency ratios, and strains on social welfare systems. Underpopulation can lead to a reduced workforce and a decline in productivity.



3. **Economic Implications:** A shrinking workforce can lead to decreased economic growth, as there will be fewer individuals contributing to production and consumption. This can potentially result in stagnation, reduced innovation, and hindered technological progress.



4. **Social Security and Healthcare Systems:** Underpopulation can strain social security and healthcare systems, as a smaller working-age population supports a larger elderly population. Adequate funding for pensions, healthcare, and elder care becomes challenging, potentially leading to inequality and reduced quality of life for older citizens.

In conclusion, the idea of overpopulation leading to catastrophic consequences overlooks the adaptability of human societies and the potential for technological innovation. Instead, underpopulation poses a more pressing threat, impacting economies, and social structures."

1,2023-08-21,CMV: Home schooling is far better than Public School,u/Remarkable_Pound_722,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15xp3qp/cmv_home_schooling_is_far_better_than_public/,changemyview,"**Edit:** I CMV'd. I underestimated how hard it is to teach and socialize a kid, the teachers really let me know it. I have NEVER seen so many defenders of public education, but it's seemingly heavily underappreciate and we take it for granted. I appreciate all of the kind insight from homeschooled kids and parents since I was really curious on the matter. The publicly educated bullies who resorted to insults instead of reason are partly why I came to this view in the first place, but, most people don't have the option of homeschooling anyway so its moot to compare it to public school. I won't be replying to more opinions cuz they're pretty repetitive at this point.

\--------

After looking into it, I truly believe this and can't find legitimate issues with homeschooling itself. The issues are some of the reasons people do it, how poorly they do it, and the high cost of it. The quality of education, quality of life, and safety from homeschooling cannot be matched by public or private schools, statistics and anecdotal stories that aren't from abusive parents are great.

**Problems with homeschooling**

In big cities, the real issues with homeschooling are just it's feasibility. If a parent has the time, money, patience, effort, and ability to teach a kid. While money is getting tighter, what's a better investment than the education of your kid? These are limiters of who can home school. Small communities may not have enough social activities besides school for a kid.

The main critiques of homeschooling are for people who are doing it poorly or for the wrong reasons. Such as religious indoctrination, lack of socialization, or falling behind in education from neglect. I don't see this as a problem with homeschooling but the parent themselves, I'd say kids with such abusive parents would struggle in any educational setting, but may have a better chance in public schools.

**The Pros far outweigh Potential Cons (If done right)**

I said the quality of education, quality of life, and safety from homeschooling cannot be matched.

The quality of education from active learning over passive learning, teaching curiosity over test taking skills, the flexibility of your kid following their interests over the bloat of useless ROTE facts from the public school system, the 1 on 1 nature, the ability to teach critical thinking, more hands on activities and field trips to make for an engaging education, I can go on and on. In no world does a one size fits all education outdo a tailored approach, regardless of if you have a below or above average IQ kid.

The quality of life from your kid having waaaay more free time in the day (2 hour schooling vs 6\* hr + commute), not being harassed by lunatic underpaid and overworked teachers (like I've been), learning at their own pace with bombardments of stressful tests and mind numbing curiosity killing homework,  and they socialize better! What I mean is, making friends at school can be tough, because everyone is so different and doesn't want to be there. However, extracurricular activities, drop in sports, the activities you pick to get your child socialized have a bunch of people having a good time with a common interest, it is much easier to socialize properly in such an environment. You can vet more of the kids yours hangs out with and have afterschool meetups with other homeschooled kids.

Safety. I was lucky enough to come out of public school unscathed, but I've heard extreme bullying stories and molestation that goes unpunished since schools are essentially unsupervised. Where I'm from, if a kid physically intimidates you and hits you after bullying you all day, nothing much happens to them, and if you hit them back you get punished extremely since a ""good kid"" acted up and now its a ""fight"", and theres a ""zero tolerance policy for violence"". Also manipulative bullies just cry more and get believed since teachers aren't paying attention. Kids were molested and robbed at my highschool and no one got punished. Look up hostile hallways in sociology, its nuts. While you can say trauma goes on in homeschools, that's up to the individual and can be solved (just don't do it), but abuse in public schools is a systemic lack of oversight that can't be solved by any one parent. Maybe one abuser gets replaced or suspended but that doesn't change the circumstances that allowed it to occur in the first place. Unless you're a monster, there's a far lower chance of any of this happening to your kid if they're homeschooled.  If this is the socialization kids are missing out on, good riddance. Your kid may have thinner skin, but its because they got to avoid the risk of being traumatized.

Any of the three reasons above are good enough to consider homeschooling, but all three make me extremely confused as to why homeschooling is seen as a negative.

The presidential election should be anonymous.
The candidats should simply have to send out an “essay” explaining what they think is wrong with the country, what could be improved and how they plan to do it.
Those essays should all use the same paper type, font and no illustration would be allowed except for graphs.

All candidats would have to submit their essays by a certain date. They would then be sent to the general public (via mail or a government website where they could be downloaded).

All essays would be completely anonymous, and only referenced by a unique ID number attributed to them.

The press and media in general would be allowed to discuss them and their content.

The candidats would not be allowed to reveal who they are or discuss their program until after the election results.

Because of the risks associated with the candidats being anonymous, all people with a criminal record would automatically be disqualified (with the exception of small crimes like misdemeanors).

Why I believe this system would be better:

Mostly it would make elections about ideas and programs instead of making them a popularity contest.

It would also greatly weaken populist candidats who usually have weak programs but very strong stage presence and charisma.

Voters would be forced to understand what each candidat really plans to do and I think it would elevate political debats by making childish name callings and other personnal attacks impossible.

They really read into everything they do and everything they say as some sort of profound statement of truth.

They are literally just normal people with normal lives who aren't better or worse than anyone else. This is the equivalent of the 'magical black person' or thinking every Christian is some grand figure. It's fine to think the culture is beautiful, or that the beliefs and religious traditions are interesting. It's fine to point out the atrocities that occurred and how it creates disparities in modern times. But thinking they're some kind of special being and romanticizing an entire group is racist.

I think it is an achievement for women, but for different reasons.

So I don’t think there’s very much physical different than a person who can’t have sex vs a person who can get sex, I think that there is a level of achievement that comes from being able to get someone to have sex with you consensually and without paying them to a point where it is an achievement. Especially if it is at a later age (up till  around maybe 24) because it implies a level of growth which requires work.

Romantic encounters are one of the most complex social interactions that we have. Some people just get it, they understand that social dance at early ages. So if they do understand and can have sex at an early age, that’s an achievement. They developed so well socially that at 16-18 t they can have convince someone to have sex. That or they’re just exceptionally attractive to their peers which, if it applied to me I would consider an achievement.

Past that, if you’re losing it at a later age, that shows something different. You likely weren’t born with physical attractiveness. You also had a much harder time developing the necessary social skills needed to be able to have sex. This means that since you weren’t naturally endowed with the skill, you did work to learn it and develop it. Being able to apply yourself to that point and reap the fruits of the labor is achievement.

Alternatively, being unable to do this is a failure. It is a common thing that most people at some point do. Inability to do so implies a lacking in essential and common social skills. Especially if you had every opportunity to do it (college, young military life, other scenarios where you have forced proximity with others in the same age group and stage of life) and you can’t do it it’s a failure. Not I’m saying can’t, not won’t. People who chose not to aren’t failures but those of us who desperately tried but couldn’t are."

As a preface, I have no issue with vegans. I think they are admirable in their dedication for something they care so much about. I do think veganism as a movement is counter productive, and will elaborate below. 

When I say a non vegan animal rights movement, I mean a movement that is primarily lead by non vegans and supported by non vegans. This is because I think this is the only way to really pressure governments to create and truly enforce animal rights.

Yes this means that I don't think animals desperately need the right to free movement, or the right to not be killed. In my opinion the current discourse around animal abuse leads to the majority of people just not engaging. 

What rights do a realistically think we could get animals? The right to not be tortured, the right to nutrition, the right to free roaming in an enclosed outdoor area, the right to clean living spaces. 

Is this perfect and amazing for animals? It's a lot better than what we have now and honestly I'm so frustrated with the idea that we should do nothing instead of ending animal abuse because it's not full emancipation. 

The fact is that individuals changing their diet makes almost no impact on the meat industry. Far more people are being born than are going vegan. The world is not going to go vegan! Also, if you are truly convinced that eating less meat will reduce factory farming, convincing 50% of the population to eat plant based one day a week would roughly double the impact of the current vegan population. (3% of vegans vs 1/7/half the population = 7% reduction in meat consumption) not to mention it would allow many more people to discover plant based food they like, and may eat that more.

The whole thing where we identify ourselves as vegan and eat no meat ever is completely non productive and in my opinion, has slowed down any movement on animal rights to a standstill.

I know it's not fully representative but just check out the vegan sub talking about someone eating less meat and how inadequacy it is. They will tell people to break up with their spouse because they decided they couldn't fully commit to veganism after all. 

Imagine if we decided anyone who drives a car is an enemy and cant advocate for climate awareness. Imagine how little that movement would be accomplishing if it was so exclusive and judgemental. 

We don't need to imagine it for veganism. It's accomplishing absolutely nothing right now. More meat is being eaten than ever and more animals are being abused than ever. Idealism will not save these animals from torture. "

I mean a major overhaul of the way the spelling works to make the spelling more phonetic.

Because English has so many dialects, there are two options - priviledge one dialect arbitrarily, or create a form of spelling that tries to account for all dialectical variation. The first option is unsatisfactory because English is a global language and hence there is no preferred form of it. The second option has only a minor benefit for legibility, but it loses the benefit of being able to recognise the meaning of words from their etymology. This may not be an enormous loss, but IMO the burden of proof is on spelling reform advocates to show that the benefits could outweigh this disadvantage."

You have reasons to think they're a bad Christian for whatever reasons, but if they'll say that sentence and mean it then they are a Christian. 

To the contrary, you do not know if someone is a feminist just because they can sincerely say, ""I support gender equality."" I don't think that anyone hearing this sentence would immediately know if the person supports feminism in the name of equality or opposes feminism in the name of this policy. I don't accept ""but only my version of equality is real equality"" as a serious counterargument to this. 

I also don't think that being a feminist will always come with a belief in equality at all, even if it usually does. On the more radical side, there have been groups of female separatists who considered themselves to be feminists and in America we do not consider separate to be equal. On the less radical side, period leave at work is an idea that is getting more popular and not everyone who believes in it wants to give men a few days off too. 

The sentence that I believe will convince everybody that you are a feminist if you can say it sincerely is ""I believe that we live in a patriarchal society and I oppose that power structure."" Whatever you follow it up with, regardless of whether or not it has to do with equality or makes any sense, you are a feminist. 

There are two sentences that will make pretty much everybody think you are not a feminist. The one everybody knows is ""I do not oppose our society's patriarchal power structure."" The other one is ""I do not believe that our society is patriarchal in nature.""

The second sentence is important because it gets to the nature of feminism. Feminism is a social theory that makes assertions of fact, which feminists are supposed to believe are true. Feminism is an umbrella with many conceptions of what those facts are, but there is some core theme of believing that our society is patriarchal and your belief in that core theme is what makes you a feminist or not."

It is a fact that a skin cell could theoretically create a human being if placed under the correct chemical environment to be reprogrammed to a zygote inside the womb.

4. If a fertilized egg and a skin cell have the potential to create complex and valuable life under the correct chemical environment, why shouldn’t a skin cell have the same right to life when outside of any womb?

The entire notion of ""hard work pays off"" is just manipulative to the everyday employee. Especially since the idea of ""hard work"" is totally subjective.

If the hardest workers reaped the most rewards, then roofers and coal miners would be the richest people in society. 

The real truth is that investment of time in the right places pays off. I worked my ass off in blue-collar, and, at some point, you hit a cap. There's only so many hours in a week and only so much you can work. You can sacrifice every personal/social event in your life to work all the overtime you can, but you'll always hit a cap.

I became tired, and my health was suffering. I fell into a deep depression. All of my coworkers started calling me lazy when I started rejecting the overtime. I invested time into earning certifications in a different field. This was an easy thing to do here and there. My certifications put me in another position, making double the money with half the hours and a fraction of the labor.

Was it hard work? Nope. I assure you that in comparison, sitting in front of my computer for a couple hours on the weekends was a LOT easier than working 15+ extra hours at my job where I was killing myself with the workload.

I promise you, you can live a good life working hard, but you will live a great life working smart.

Ofcourse it's true that if you're not working at all, you won't achieve anything. And ofcourse it's true that if you work really hard you might get a promotion that puts you in a better place, but my point is ""hard work"" always has a cap. At some point it becomes less about the workload you complete, and about where you invest your time.

You'll hit a wall, and the only way to move up after a certain point is to build connections and invest time/money into yourself. Nepotism is very real, and it will throw your hard work out the window.

I do not dispute that there were a few industrialists and martial people who benefited from the war, just not enough to justify 60,000 deaths. On the other hand, I don't understand the pathway by which Communism, even in many Asian southeast nations, would kill almost any American citizens.
2. Ensuring the stability of the current constitutional government in the US. The Vietnam war brought out intense divisiveness in the American populace, erupting in the Protests of 1968, the brutal repression by the police, and the trial of the Chicago 7. The draft heightened existing class and racial animus. Both of which pose a real threat to national security. On the other hand, communism in southeastern Asia is too far away to actually threaten American security; the USSR already had a geographically closer ""shot"" at the US with Cuba and then with Poland.

This CMV will not award delta for explaining how the US foreign policy establishment can end up making irrational decisions, as that is my current position. I'm more interested in honest and rational argument in support of the Vietnam War for the purpose of national security on the basis of what was known in the '60s and '70s, or knowing that there isn't one.

This CMV will award delta for showing other ways in which the Vietnam War was worth fighting for American interests (not just national security), although it would need to attempt to weigh that against the cost (60,000 dead, more suffering, increased internal divisiveness).

Any response concerning the cold war would need to evaluate how Communist power can threaten American national security despite mutually-assured destruction, and it would need to evaluate how Warsaw Pact + Latin America is significantly more threatening with than without southeast Asia."

1,2023-08-22,CMV: Men and women can be friends but usually they'll never have the same closeness level that 2 friends of the same sex can have.,u/BiryaniEater10,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15y9j7x/cmv_men_and_women_can_be_friends_but_usually/,changemyview,"  
This is a slight change on a previous opinion I had and changed so let's go. Usually, when people think about what is in the way of opposite sex friendships, we're thinking about 2 people being attracted to each other directly, but this is not the only issue. The thing is that we don't wear our attractions on our foreheads, so for most people it's assumed, rightly or wrongly, that they're attracted to members of the opposite sex, and this dynamic is what shapes the realm of social interaction and social assumption.  
  
One good way to look at it is the coffee and snacks test. Let's say I'm a guy and I'm attracted to nobody, and I'm in a lab group where most people are meh or have a bad attitude but there's this one girl who is generally having a good attitude and at least attempts to spread positivity. If I ask her, ""hey we should get coffee or snacks next week. You down?"" She is going to inevitably interpret this as a sexual advance, because the hanging out of a guy and girl one on one is considered sexual in our society.  
  
Additionally, if she were to have a boyfriend, in all likelihood, that boyfriend would not like us hanging out one on one alone outside of work/school related reasons. Let's be real. Despite what we hear on Reddit, most guys are not OK with their girlfriends hanging out one on one with other dudes, and even though I'm not at all attracted to the girl in this scenario, and the guy probably does trust his gf, the simple fact is the guy is unlikely to trust me based on the simple social norms of what he will think my intentions are.  
  
Where I've changed my opinion from last time is that I think if you can somehow overcome these barriers, that you can be close friends, but also, there will still be boundaries present that aren't present with the same sex that make it not the same. For example, I doubt that a girl in a relationship is kissing her guy friends on the cheek or posting Instagrams with the guy. Also, girls, regardless of who they're attracted to, tell other girls ""I love you"" all the time, but you'd never see a girl with a boyfriend say ""I love you"" to another guy or let another guy tell her ILY either. Also, girls sit on each others laps all the time but they wouldn't sit on a guy's lap while in a relationship with another guy. No matter how you try to act like the friendship can be the same, it really just can't be."

Giving into insecurities by changing something in an attempt to try and control them does not solve the root issue, imo. The cognitive structures that led to you developing the insecurity will remain, and your mind will quickly find something else to feel insecure about.

Here is the news reporting on the video.

 Basically, officers pulled somebody over after somebody reported her being involved in a road rage incident with a handgun. When officers pulled her over she came to a stop immediately forward of a railroad track and an officer stopped on the railroad track and eventually another officer put her inside the first officers car right before a train hit the car. 

Here’s my POV:

1) the victim in this is partially responsible for stopping where she did andcreating a condition where the officers are fearful of their lives just doing their job. It seems obvious that he they were so busy pulling her over that they didn’t notice the railroad tracks. So basically, it’s partly your fault if something bad happens to you because the officers made a mistake in an emotionally charged situation that they shouldn’t have had to be in in the first place. 

2) I think a certain part of the problem is cultural within police departments. I’ve been noticing in the last 10 or 20 years that police cars have gotten far louder and the lights much brighter. Sometimes the lights can be blinding, making me fearful when I drive past that I’m going to hit some thing or somebody that I can’t see. In watching the video this is the first thing I notice. The police cars have all of the lights flashing and there are multiple cars on scene. The railroad signs are reflective and are easily visible, but I can see how they disappear within all the “noise” of the bright light flashing lights. Having been involved in accident scenes as a fire fighter, I know that this contributes to the high emotional energy, and sometimes confusion on a scene. I was often critical of other members of my department for flipping the lights and sirens on and speeding to an accident or fire in a great big old fire truck or water truck. Most of the time speeding to the scene didn’t make a difference about it being life or death, and we usually knew ahead of time when that was the case. But it’s an emotionally charged situation and people react to that. I think police departments should be training their officers to recognize such situations and encourage certain behavior that results in thinking more clearly. Maybe in this case on a small country gravel road all of the sirens and lights were not necessary."

It goes way deeper than just an Internet post.

As a child it felt like everyone was against me. As I grew up I realized the majority of that pain was from my dad. A lot was from a few bad people and the rest were people reacting to me lashing out from the pain those first 2 groups inflicted.

I got better. I no longer resented the world. If I escaped my dad, I would be free but then I made that post and the comments felt like talking to my dad except it was a bunch of people all at once. To me, that proved that it really was most people. It definitely wasn't just my dad anyway.

For awhile I'll feel the way I did before that ever occured but then I'll remember it and feel like it proves that everyone does hate me. This is one of those times.

For context, there were 3 types of people in that comment section. 1, completely misinterpreted my words, 2, made false assumptions, 3, got angry at me for reasons that completely contradicted what I stated (for example, saying I shouldn't have done X when my post directly said I did the opposite of X).

Most responses contained multiple of those.

It seems that's all anyone ever does. That's what my dad did, my mom to a lesser against, a few teachers. Every day. I was always wrong. Either for things that didn't happen or things I couldn't understand. I can't say I was a perfect angel but I can say I was never malicious. The only times I've ever tried to hurt anyone was because they hurt me.

I hate people. I hate them because they hate me and other people like me and people that aren't like me. I've seen people get hounded in situations that seemed just like mine. I always see posts where people seem to genuinely be confused as to why people keep twisting they're words and accusing them of things just like they did to me.

I don't know if it's out of true malice or pure stupidity. The lack of reading comprehension is too astounding to feel well intended. The third option is that I'm fundamentally broken. I don't believe I am at all but even if that's the case, those people are still evil because if I'm genuinely too sick and delusional to have any clue what I'm doing wrong, then treating me like I'm the devil for it is evil.

On top of that when people cry for help it's either too subtle for anyone to see or it's so loud that everyone thinks you're attention seeking, manipulative, etc… and now because you're having a mental breakdown from people treating you like a monster they think you're an even bigger monster.

I hate people. I don't want to, but they hate me and attack me because of misunderstandings or the way I was built or something. I desperately want to be wrong. If this is just how people are, if this is just the world we live in then I don't want to be in it."

If you’re using a different definition- why is your definition better and why are pets not slaves under that definition?

Ones I’m anticipating have to do with forced labor and the being in question needing to be a human. 

For the forced labor I’d be super willing to come up with a definition closer to prisoner though soooo many animals are surrogates for children or just more abstractly our need to care for and be emotionally adored or cared for. In terms of labor they’d be an equivalent to on call/on demand therapists.

For the “it needs to be human to be a slave/prisoner” crowd, I’m just going to open the floor as to why? To me anything that is subjugated intentionally and OWNED would fit and the argument that “the animals don’t know any better” may be a reason for them to accept you but NOT a valid reason for you to enslave/imprison/breed and inbreed (ew) them (or condone and propagate any of the former).

For those that are like “we need to care for the animals that are here” totally agree and not part of the cmv. Just also know that by spaying/neutering or isolating or otherwise not allowing them to reproduce as they naturally would has it’s own ethical qualms I’d be interested in hearing a justification other than “we have no better choice” for. Again not part of the cmv.

Think I covered it! I’m mostly interested in discussion not asserting my opinion but I’m faiiiiirly solidly convinced that domestication (especially en masse) is on par with industrialization and commercialization in terms of ethical problems 😭"

I let her know that I'm in relationship. 

She proceeded to want it anyway, so I hand it out. 

Over the following morning, she reached out to grab coffee and I simply never responded. That was the end of it. I felt bad but I had a feeling I'd never see her again so it's all gravy. 

I tended to do this in the past as it's so hard for me to just say no, especially if there are follow up requests to my initial stance. I'll cave and just say yes.

I have always been an advocate for the transformative power of engineering – whether it's in the realm of communication, healthcare, or transportation. Yet, as I delve deeper into the world's complexities, I grapple with how much impact my chosen profession can truly have on addressing systemic societal issues.

Engineering has the potential to address some of the immediate impacts of systemic injustice, but it cannot fully solve the root problem. Systemic injustice is deeply rooted in social, economic, and political structures, and engineering alone cannot dismantle these structures. However, engineering can play a role in mitigating the effects of systemic injustice and promoting social change.

Systemic injustice is deeply ingrained in social and political structures, and addressing it requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves not only engineers but also policymakers, social scientists, and activists (Niles et al., 2020). Engineering can contribute to this broader effort by incorporating social justice principles into engineering education and practice (Carroll et al., 2022). By centering social justice and equity impacts in engineering education, engineers can be better equipped to address the root causes of systemic injustice and work towards more equitable and just solutions (Carroll et al., 2022).

Engineering can contribute to this broader effort by developing technologies and systems that improve access to resources and services, as well as by incorporating social justice principles into engineering education and practice. However, it is important to recognize that engineering alone is not sufficient to solve the complex and multifaceted issue of systemic injustice.

Am I missing something here? Does anyone actually believe that we can solve injustice using engineering alone? What role does/should engineering play in correcting injustice?"

I will admit that I am a bit of a layman when it comes to the intricacies of politics. My only points of reference are YouTube video essays, social media and the various internet research sources i use. As far as i can tell, right wing religious viewpoints are incredibly stupid in every way. They are the antithesis to human progression . They deny scientific fact, deny logic, deny reality in order to support their opinions. They judge everything that does not fit into their narrow view of right and wrong. Their viewpoints have even gone so far as to regress historical teaching in united states schools. They are quite literally anti history at this point. They deny climate change in favor of “jobs” , the economy or because they believe it is just a straight up hoax. They are actively destroying trust in every institution in America that deviates from their moral values. This is incredibly concerning. It is almost baffling how stupid one would have to be to support these ideologies. 

I think active suppression of these viewpoints is not only morally right but it is quite possibly a necessary step to take if we want to liberate human society from primitive ideology and outdated viewpoints. 

Also, citing a 200+ year old document written by people who could not even fathom the state of our current society or a bible written by people who didn’t understand basic things a modern 3rd grader knows about the world to support a point is invalid. I also am not referring to regular republicans or religious people in general. This is a very specific and outspoken group of people who overlap with other dangerous groups such as nazi sympathizers, right wing militias and various other fascist leaning groups. To summarize my position, canceling and actively suppressing right wing religious viewpoints and voices is not wrong and is necessary if we want to progress as a society. This means removing these viewpoints from government and the public sphere entirely."

I've thought about it and discussed it with friends but we couldn't find any good counter arguments.

My current view expanded: A significant part of the population (in western countries, US / EU) cannot be regularly employed (even if he/she is motivated and entry level jobs are available) due to insufficient natural intelligence / abilities or other innate hindrances that would make employing this person unprofitable for the employer (not even remediable through training / education). If this is true, as I currently believe, it means that unconditional and temporally unlimited social transfers or even UBI are absolutely necessary if you don't want people to starve (as it is not – in these cases I'm referring to – a matter of motivation or availability of jobs) – this is also where my views apparently differ from Jordan Peterson's as he states that ""it's not that easy to move money down the hierarchy"".

The main reason for this situation is the increasing demands of entry level jobs (eg working in construction has gotten a lot more mentally challenging because nowadays almost everyone has to use heavy machinery and specialized tools and the menial tasks of carrying stuff, digging etc. have been automated by machines). A secondary reason could ironically be labour laws such as a minimum wage which makes people who are only able to contribute less than the minimum wage in productivity for their employer unemployable.

Can anyone steel man the neoliberal notion that the majority of unemployed people are ""just lazy"" (as in employable but not willing to work as opposed to willing to work but not employable even if jobs are available)? What other points am I missing?

1. Any business may choose to participate. If they don't, they are not allowed to post discounts, specials or other similar marketing material
2. If they participate, all products will need to show their discounts and markups based on rrp (recommended retail price)
3. All products should be submitted to an rrp register

What this effectively means is that if a business wishes to market ""value"" in terms of discounts or specials, they need to conform to standards (eg. 20% off a product is the same as 20% off a product in a different shop), and need to show when they are breaking standards by overcharging (markup from rrp)

At the moment discount or specials mean nothing, just because something is 50% off doesn't mean it's cheaper than regular price elsewhere. My proposition would at least put some meaning behind this.

I let businesses opt out of this, as some models run on excessive markups in response for convenience or may just struggle to keep up with fluctuating rrp or such.

I do think this would need to be coupled with some rrp regulation such as at least 50% of products need to be sold at rrp or more - but that has far too many issues to argue in a cmv, so just assume some regulation comes along with it that is kind of fair.

I don't mind if rrp is region based, or whatever is needed for international purposes.

Also, they occasionally check in with me to ensure my satisfaction or address any additional needs I may have. It is these additional efforts that, in my perspective, justify the practice of tipping waiters and not baristas.

The same applies to takeout orders, as I place my order and subsequently collect it myself. Takeout doesn't involve the need for waiting service, which means I don't feel obligated to tip."

Maui is incredibly dependent on tourism. Tourism has taken a nosedive since the fires. This has affected many jobs and small businesses. 

The best way as a civilian to support Maui, aside from donating to recovery efforts, is to support the local economy there by taking your next holiday there. Prices are much lower than usual for hotels, rentals and AirB&Bs. Beaches are a lot emptier. 

Now that the worst of the fires have passed and the clean up efforts are underway, it is actually a good thing to help a place dependent on tourism get as back to normal as soon as possible. And it’s a win-win due o the low prices.

To CMV, convince me why the “conventional wisdom” that Maui should be avoided is right."

But my disagreement with Seth Rogan is him saying an audience wont ever embrace ai writing because it doesnt have the creative spark Humans have, and that you would have to find a way to get the ai to be able to smoke weed to produce human style content. He said audiences wouldn’t stand for such non creativity if ai took over writer jobs

&#x200B;

BULLSHIT have you seen marvel? The upcoming marvels trailer? The writing is terrible and people still watch it in droves and if Disney threw some Of their ideas into an ai program and had it write stuff the audience would still watch it even if they knew it was an ai program because their fandomhood would override any grievances about it. OH WAIT THEY DID WRITE A SECRET INVASION EPISODE WITH AI AND PEOPLE STILL ACTUALLY WATCHED IT that should tell you why Hollywood studios are not giving in to the writers strike and we are getting nowhere because they think people dig ai content. 

I’m not even sure if we can call the most popular drivers of media entertainment creative anymore, fast and furious and marvel movies like Thor look like they were written by ai. In many cases ai can probably write better than humans. We don’t live in the black and white film era where ideas were original and works of art were made to stay original, we live in the era where were about to have a Snow White film with tall dwarves just for the sake of Making fucking money. Hollywood does not give a shit about creativity Seth Rogan can you believe they are still pumping out transformers films? Do you have any idea how an Adam Sandler ai could milk the spit out of plain non creative ideas for all eternity and people will still watch it? I would be shocked if someone didn’t use chat gpt to write grand turismo

I think that we should decentralize it with not one government in power in the nation as a whole (meaning no centralized government with each town/village/city deciding how it should be run) with no centralized national government or an extremely weak one to serve as a central reference for foreign governments.

All roles that a centralized government provides would be split apart such as judiciary/law making (this also means not one standardized set of laws) and providing government services like water/sewage services to the smallest village authority. Defense would also be the same, with even the smallest village allowed to own CBRN weaponry like VX gas and ICBMs. 

This would prevent them from centralizing as they would compete with one another, preventing a centralized government and allowing people to be freer as there is no centralized government to trample onto peoples' rights.

Also I'm gonna be generalizing too much, keep in mind I know this is not always the case, but here it is.

We've all heard about mansplaining, I'm not here to say it isn't real. In MY opinion it definitely is, and it's root is in male societary rules. Still, I honestly think sometimes there are situations when a typical overlooked male behaviour is confused with mansplaining, and it's also related to the same societary rules.

I'm talking about the fact that usually, male friends are not the best listeners. As a man you know you can trust your real ones, but often they won't really listen to you about topics you really like but aren't that popular, take for example those silly ''sigma male'' memes where a dude is explaining a girl facts about a movie he likes. On the other hand, girls usually will at least give you the impression to be more attentive. This is maybe because of female societary rules, where girls have to act kind. So in the end a lot of men end up telling things they're really excited about to their female friends or girlfriends because they don't have anyone else that they feel will really listen to them. 

This is why girls have the stereotype of being more sensitive, and if they give that impression some men will take it, even if it's not the case, that's why many women might end up thinking ''ugh, this guy is mansplaining things I already know to me or I don't care about because he thinks I'm dumb'' when the guy is in reality just excited about talking about the things he really likes once and for all. Not excusing that sometimes they get carried away too much. 

Althought in my opinion mansplaining can occur if all of this happens while giving the impression you're assuming the girl you're talking to is really dumb with situations such as: '' \*mentions uncommon word in a sentence\*, btw (random word) means (meaning of the word) in case you didn't know''

I think this is something a lot of us think and will recognize that it is in fact the case many times. What do you think? Do you think this also falls into the category of mansplaining even if it has somwehat understandble societary roots?

1.) Terminology: Even though a lot of people claim wanting to have debates/discussions, but forget that a discussion or debate is primarily about exchanging arguments, not convincing the other person. For example: if a claim to have a debate about a topic and I represent opinion a and my partner represents opinion b, the goal of a discussion is to understand the other person's point of view not forcing my opinion on them.

2.) Complexity: Pretty straight forward,it is unrealistic for a single person to have the perfect solution, thinking someone has the absolute truth not only is a daring assumption  it also forbids to have respect for other people's opinions, as I am ""holding the absolute truth""

3.) Targeting: also pretty forward, this one is less about the topic of the discussion, but about the way a lot of public debates are executed. A respectful discussion should always be about the topic, not the person. Even if you as a person are an absolute bozo, when entering a discussion, the only thing relevant are your arguments. Sentences like "" you people .."",  "" you always want..."" are neither helpful nor respectful.


Please note that English is not my first language, I tried my best writing understandably, though I cannot guarantee that I made no grammatical errors.

I would love to hear you arguments, as I am pretty sure I missed some points that oppose my view."

I'll define that 'old' system as most Americans only encountering an *expectation* of tipping at restaurants with table service and at bars.

One of the primary arguments for eliminating tipping altogether is that the price should be raised the requisite amount, and the employees paid a livable wage.  I actually spend a lot of time in countries with no tipping culture where this is the norm.

The problem with that idea is that restaurants and bars have extremely busy times, and also many times they are open but practically empty.  For example, a waitress getting tips might average $30/hr, but get there by making $5/hr 70% of the (slow, relaxed) time and $100/hr during 30% of the (hectic, crazy) time.

If you replace their average with simply paying $30/hr all the time, scheduling becomes a nightmare, quality of service drops, and employee happiness drops. 

Why?

No one wants to work the crazy shifts if they get paid the same for the slow shifts. Service will drop because employees aren't as motivated to keep customers happy during the busy times.  Employees will be less happy because when they're making a flat $30/hr during a crazy shift they'll just be wishing for all that time they get paid the same with less work; most of these service employees love those crazy shifts because they will go 110% for a few hours and rake in 10x the income as the slow hours.

Do you remember the plot of the first ""Star Wars""? The rebels are fighting against an invincible Empire, its superweapons have no vulnerabilities, a fortress in space that cannot be defeated unless... a small ship will not fly through a tiny tunnel and blow up this colossus, lol. It reminded me of the USA. The United States is a hegemon that has not yet seen the light, it has no vulnerabilities - it is surrounded by sparsely populated countries that will not fight with it and an ocean through which it is impossible to invade, the United States has the bulk of the resources to be independent, the United States projects its military power around the world with the help of the navy, the aerospace industry, the Americans have incredible strength in on the Internet, American culture is ideal for hegemony - it digests any foreigner. Such a country cannot be defeated, it is a country that was obliged to rule the world, no one can compare with it, no one can inflict even a little damage on it.  
But the United States, like the death star, has a vulnerability. Microchips are needed for the Internet, information technology and the aerospace industry. Microchips that the US did not create in Texas, but ""allowed"" to appear in South Korea and Taiwan. Let's agree that in 1960-89 Korea and Taiwan, ruled by military dictatorships, were completely subordinated to the United States, the United States helped them build their economy, shared technologies, opened up the market (there is a serious part of Asians themselves in the successes of Asian tigers, I do not dispute, but without the help of the United States everything would not be so good), the United States they turned these countries into ""showcases of capitalism"".  
Let's take it in order. Communism is coming, the United States somehow achieved a truce in Korea, in Vietnam they achieved a stalemate already in 1968. At that time, the Cold War as a whole was (like many world wars before that, if you read about the struggle of European countries for China, about the British government's view of Asia) a battle for Asia and for China, for access to China and the Chinese market. The United States did not lose Vietnam, but it could not win, in order to win Vietnam, it was necessary to invade the north and bomb the south of China, possibly with nuclear bombs. In the early 70s, the United States entered into negotiations with Vietnam, stopped enmity with China, and opened relations with them. They got out of the stalemate, China is no longer an enemy, but a country where you can invest, but still communism is there and how to remove it? That's right, sooner or later democracy and wealth will destroy communism, let's create storefronts and the Chinese, who have learned the charms of investment, the free market, who have looked at their neighbors, will stop being communists and become another of our markets!  
As a result, the largest microchip manufacturing plants are within the reach of the barrel artillery of China and North Korea. Any serious war or conflict between the United States and China will lead to the fact that the United States will simply lose microchips and this will be, if not the end, then an extremely painful blow.  
It is obvious that the United States does not want to cede leadership to China. They don't want to be just a ""great power"" like in the 80s when the USSR was still there and America didn't have that power, they want to be a superpower like before - when there were no enemies around except the Taliban, when they could destroy countries with one order. Moreover, they do not want competitors, they do not want to lose markets. They want China to be an open market for cheap labor, resources and goods, and not a place where communists can steal your technology, make a company better than an American one, or simply ""steal"" your investments. They don't want China to trade with Europe. Therefore, the United States is trying to block China's maritime trade, in response, China is building a new port through Pakistan. The US is trying to turn India into an enemy of China, pumping Taiwan with weapons, preparing for naval battles, the Chinese in response create naval bases-islands.  
But this moment with microchips, it's very funny. As if specially made for conspiracy theory."

It’s seen as sadder than a normal death when I think that it should be considered to be similar to normal death if not less sad. 

So someone that is happy and enjoys life direct kill themself. People don’t kill themselves because they’re having a good time being alive. They do it because they’re struggling, because they’re hopeless, because something is wrong in their lives and that thing has no chance of getting better.

I don’t think most people experience that level of hopelessness so they can’t understand your only way out being suicide. As a result, when someone does kill themselves, they’re unable empathize with the person. They’re able to sympathize with their pain, but they’re unable to empathize with the need to take their own life. So they fill the void with their own emotions and logic.

I also think that people who choose suicide are often infantilized. They’re treated as not in control of their actions or that they don’t understand what they’re doing. I always hear the saying that “suicide is a permenant solution to a temporary problem” which I think isn’t accurate and minimizes a suicidal persons issues.

Instead of viewing it as someone finally being able to end all of their problems or someone understanding that the issues they have can’t be solved only mitigated or coped with. They view it as someone taking a selfish act to remove themselves from the world. I think that in of itself is a selfish viewpoint as it requires someone enduring their own suffering for the sake of others."

Sure, not every social tradition is valuable. Not everything people have been doing in the past were great or fair, but it’s going too far and the goal posts keep moving further and further. 

Rather than finding equality, everything is just reversing. We’re seeing colleges that discriminate Asians and White people to favor underperforming people in particular categories for “equality”. 

Courts are beginning to refuse to prosecute black people disproportionally to other races. 

A meritocracy is the only fair way to run things, but people are chosen for jobs based on minority status rather than performance and experience. 

Everything is either reversing, or diving into the unknown. Getting rid of child producing marriages that create safety and stability, getting rid of merit in favor of “status”, getting rid of gender, allowing drugs to be used by whoever they want, etc. 

It seems like all good ideas in the moment, but I feel like it’ll turn out poorly in 50-100 years when our kids have to figure this shit out. 

Am I looking at things incorrectly? Is there some actual goal for these movements or is the goal to rip down everything we know works and diving headfirst into theory and unproven social concepts?

I’m not saying everything is perfect right now, but getting rid of EVERYTHING so quickly seems dangerous.

Help me cope with, or even embrace, this.",u/calitexnutterschpiel,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15z8hpq/cmv_ive_been_wanting_to_move_from_the_us_but_now/,changemyview,"I've lived abroad over several different occasions over the last ten years. With each time, I've had to come back to the US because my visa in a country expired, but I've come back to the US with waning enthusiasm. Study abroad and work holiday visas are easy, but permanent immigration/emigration are far more difficult said than done (I almost secured a longer-term visa in New Zealand, but my employer at the time pulled a bait-and-switch and didn't want to work with me). 

For at least five years, I've felt like US culture is for the dogs, that we've been sold a bill of lies as a people. Most of us don't care to bother to learn even about our neighboring states, never mind Canada or Mexico, never mind the rest of the world. The US, for such a global superpower, is an amazing bubble - a country that gave the world NASA yet can take many years just to complete a few simple miles of highway. Also, despite Americans' claims that we're warm and friendly, I generally don't see it. 

95%+ of my family on both sides has never left North America, and most of them have never left the USA. My mother (well-educated and not stupid by any means) refuses to even go to the UK or Ireland for something as simple as a sites tour for retired folks, because she ""knows"" that Americans are treated poorly. I've explored jobs overseas, but my fiancee is scared of public mass shootings here, yet is somehow even more scared of the outside world. She'll only consider Canada because she ""can't be too far from family,"" but long-term immigration into Canada is pretty difficult. Where I'm going with this is, I feel like I'm seeing the US for what it is, and the people around me don't get it at all, and it's frustrating as hell. 

The things that the US has going for it, generally speaking, are: Higher wages in most professions relative to other developed countries, a robust network of national and state parks, incredible diversity of cultures and cuisine, and a cost of living that is still lower than in some other OECD countries (obviously COL is lower in, say, Kentucky, New Mexico, Upstate NY, North Florida, and East Texas, whereas it's horrible in California, NYC, and even South Florida and the Texas Triangle these days). There is still a feeling - for now anyway - that whatever you set your mind to, you can eventually accomplish. 

However, we have our drawbacks: Our healthcare idiocy, at-will employment, parental leave laws, PTO (time off) in most professions, crumbling physical infrastructure in most states, lower minimum wages (which really screw over the underprivileged), and resurgence of Judeo-Christian nationalism (we'll have to deal with this for as long as there are Boomers and Gen-X). Yes, it's sadly possible that Trump will be reelected in 2024, despite his obvious criminality and narcissistic-driven hatred of our democratic (lower-case 'd'!) values. Americans are also more rushed and less mindful or their manners, especially compared to our friends in some other countries. Our crime rates have always been higher than those in most other OECD countries, though they're also way below the levels of the 1970s-1990s. 

For starters, we're looking to move from Texas (which we hate) to the Ohio Valley (KY/TN/OH/IN). Texas and the OV are both obnoxiously Trumpy, but at least there's still better COL affordability and better scenery in the OV. And, most of my family (mostly good people) are in the OV. **So... Please help me find some silver linings to stay in the country where it seems everybody bitches, but nobody wants to take action or even vote for meaningful changes. Am I really stuck in a doomed country and having to learn to be content, or should I put more pressure on my fiancee (which probably won't work), or should we consider saving as much as we can now in the US and planning to retire abroad in 20 years?** TIA!"

In ancient philosophy, many schools advocated for the idea that wanting what one already has is the only antidote to hedobistic adaptation, or in other words, becoming used to ones circumstances and not deriving the same pleasure as one did when the object of our desires was freshly acquired. This leads to an increasing appetite and can run out of control.

Wanting what one already has is helpful both for deriving joy from the things that seem to have faded as well as for not being so attached to what is yet to be achieved."

Next thing I know I was on grindr and I had sex with a man. It was alright because i’m a massive horn dog so I did climax but I missed the softness, pear shape, boobs, and general feminine look of a woman. Hitting it from behind it wasn’t too different from a woman so getting off wasn’t super hard. But I easily realized I much would’ve preferred a woman. To put all doubt away I did it a second time with a cross dresser and same overall experience except this time pnc hit me hard af. I was scared straight. 

After that I went on and fucked like 10 chicks until I met my current gf. I’m 100% certain i’m straight because of my past experiences. I don’t have the urge to wanna try men ever again.

I feel as if this makes me straighter than men who haven’t tried men since I from experience can with 100% certainty say i’m straight. I know from experience I like women more.

tldr; Had sex with two men which made me realize I was only into women. Now I feel like i’m the straightest guy alive."

I can't think of many movies where the villain is a non-consequentialist. Sure, there are villains that are just greedy and wants short term goals like money and are mentally ill like the joker, but beyond that there are no ""kantian"" villains, deontology bad guys standing up for an ideal that is NOT consequentialism.

Also, the most praised villains are consequentialist villains. Those kind of villains are seen as deep.

The hero follows an unconditional ""do not x"", where x usually means kill. Also, the hero tends to defend the status quo while the villain wants change. The hero is passive and villain active. Highly disturbing, but we can discuss that in another CMV.

I think Hollywood is unconsciously training viewers to resent consequentialism, even though consequentialist decisions and thoughts have been necessary to bring us here and will be necessary in the future as well. 

This is a twofold CMV:

1) Hollywood hates consequentialism

2) Promoting anti-consequentialism is bad

I will give out consequentialism for both, but prefer to be given examples of non-consequentialist villains."

Disney's ride was also in the open air and have riders a beautiful view and fresh air, and is less vulnerable to fires in a closed tunnel, and wasn't as dull.

While one could say that if the velocity of money goes up, it means productivity is going up, that connection isn't very clear. 

For a particular country, if it's becoming more productive relative to other countries, its GDP should be able to rise beyond inflation by bringing in more money than it spends, at the expense of those less-productive countries. But because the world is a closed system without imports and exports, this is not possible for the world as a whole.

Assuming no prenup.",u/KarmaKarmaChameIeon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15zia4g/cmv_in_a_relationship_with_high_income_disparity/,changemyview,"I truly come here with a humble open mind knowing I could be wrong. I hope you can be kind, thoughtful, and patient with your response.

So let’s say 2 people (A and B) have high income disparity (A annual salary = $50k vs. B=$500k) and they date for several years before getting married. At this point they are both equally invested emotionally, they also invested an equal amount of time into the relationship, and they both would feel equally devastated if the relationship failed. 

So what happens if they get divorsed? 

Both partners equally lose their emotional and time investment, however one of them stands to LOSE monetarily while the other stands to GAIN monetarily. So for A, the loss due to divorce is partially offset by the monetary gain:

A total loss = time + emotion - money 

while for B there is no offset, and money is actually added to their total loss:

B total loss = time + emotion + money

This leads me to conclude that after marriage A is actually LESS committed than before marriage since it is only after marriage that they stand the possibility to GAIN through divorce relative to B. 

In other words, A’s worst case scenario improves after marriage while B’s only deteriorates after marriage. Therefore A is less committed after marriage than before."

And before y'all say its up to individuals themselves to develop a interest in the subject, I know, but you can't deny how much your environment plays into your early development. If a 6 year old has parents who are math professors with math textbooks all around the house, math documentaries being shown on tv and conversations about math at the dining table then they'd be exposed to an interest much earlier. They'd have the necessary positive support to develop their interests in a way that's polar opposite from the diehard try hard pressure that first gen kids face at home. They get the benefit of having parents who can actually help with homework instead of ones that always complain about you not being good enough.

Examples  of what I mean none of this I agree with but just to get my point across since I can’t quite articulate it.  
  
Last week I saw this video on how there’s a major website that have a lot of people encouraging others to end their life. There’s a guy with 16 thousand posts on that site . All he does is encourage people to do it because life is so shitty…but he’s never done it himself. Obviously he’s a sick fuck that gets off on making people kill themselves.   
  
What’s the possible consequence for this guy ? The video had no number on how many death the site itself or this guy caused . But one of the outlets they encouraged on the site is a person that sells poison. He allegedly sent out 2k+ packages. You have to prove you’re really serious to get the outlets …so it’s safe to say 80% or more went trough with it.  so that poison guy alone is allegedly  responsible for 1600+ death. at  least 4 are confirmed to be minors. He cannot possibly be punished for all of that but that's to easy / black and white. this person blatantly committed a crime.

  
 They have multiple outlets. So there’s no saying how many people died , how many are smart enough to not get caught are STILL sending out means of doing it  today.  


 Back to the ""gray-ish area which is where my point is. the 16k messages guy he has absolutely contributed to more than 3k death. But he had no real hand in killing anyone right? he never gave them any substance , all he did was re-assure people who were already thinking about it.  He encourage and salute everyone who posts their : final message.  
  
——- how do you punish this guy? What would be the equivalent of what he did / is doing right now ? Just Death? If he’s not in a death penalty state ??? Life in prison??? Where he gets the opportunity to smuggle a phone and keep doing what he’s already doing right now? which is to Stay in a fucking room and write on a site 24/7. This guy has 16k messages he obviously don’t go outside. What the fuck is prison gonna do to this guy?   
  
There’s no consequence that can outweigh that But that's going off the deep end.   
  
—Let's move on to some  more light hearted but still fucked comparison. 2008 you go on vacation cheat your husband get pregnant.   
  
You live happily ever after once you’re back from vacation and occasionally when the opportunity slips you get some side dick here and there in a way your partner’s not gonna notice.   
Trough some freak accident one way or another he finds out the kid isn’t his …today august 2023 . The kid is 15, he’s been trough everything with this kid your life has been amazing it would make no sense for him to leave for something that happened way back then I’m sure everyone would agree and rightfully so . And if he’s leaves well he’s got to keep being that kid’s father he's poured 15 years onto that kid you can't just leave that kid be ......   
  
What’s the consequence here? You’ve had 15 years of bliss with this person. 15 years he can’t just dismiss . Worst case scenario he does and you’re hurt about it. Cause breakups aren’t fun . But eventually you get over it like everyone does . You’ll find someone else. And your kid still has a great father.   What’s the actual consequence here for you having been cheating on this man every annual vacation? What’s the trade off for that 15 years of bliss you’ve had?  Most people don’t get that . You’ve had 15 years of perfect (as perfect as relationships can be + you get to have random exciting fun !) you had your cake and ate it to for 15 years then what? You have to start sharing that cake? Well that’s cool you had 15 fucking years .  
  
—-another example same thing wife at home husband travel around. Living it up for 15 fucking years fucking everything in site (reasonably far away from wife so she won’t find out , or if she does it’s gonna be by a freak of nature way way later. Then what? You’ve taken 15 years of that woman’s life being your rock . Aka what you go home to after having your fun. And still have fun at home because she’s great! She finds out? Omg it only happened once 15 years ago. More likely than not  she stays if not then well as I said he will be down maybe for a long time , maybe years but let’s be honest life goes on he’s still going to be able to thrive / do him. Heck he’ll grab a younger one and wife her up and keep doing him.  
  
  
—- Other examples in business , Your business benefits from email marketing, another business has a large enough database that they're thriving , An employee from that other business approach you with their entire lead list / entire database. and how they gathered it all. meaning you can have a plausible reason why you have these leads because they're not Just there. you can say where they're form if you're sued then it becomes a point of proving it which will be possible but the legal battle of that shit just for leads would never be worth it .... what's the consequence here?  you're making money off the leads.   


in the event you do get found guilty or it does somehow turns out that you did get their database from illegals means then what????? you get a $250,000 state maximum fine . YAY !!! but you've generated more than 5million off the database THAT year and based of that success you were able to catapult your business even further?? what's it matter you stole that shit and ended up having to pay a portion of one year's income 5Years later? and it's all so gray.. you stole the leads, the employees who worked on the leads and basically  did everything else didn't know you stole it? they deserve to get their pay / their bonuses and such , even if there wasn't a state maximum how much can you really try to extract after it's been done??  


—- This is really prevalent in business i have plenty of other examples that are more ....Scummy but aren't illegal and even if it's illegal there's no way you're gonna get to it before they've enjoyed that misdeed and boosted themselves beyond it, which they would never have the privilege of doing without it . I can also say that abt slavery and all of that but that's all int he past.... there's so much happening right now .  


—-You're crooked in  fda, let thousands of unsafe products go trough because ...Bribe . you get caught fired . can't work in that industry anymore.. great you've made millions now you can try entrepreneurship or whatever thousands of other career fields there are.   


—- You sell fake dick pills that's basically sugar for a couple millions , you get caught haha cease it or we'll fine you 0.02% of your revenue and you'll have to sell under a new company haha 

&#x200B;

tl:dr obviously it goes further and further where there's so little consequences for things that have high / mild / little affects on others and results in a better life for you that aren't so drastic like picking up a $20 bill you know is your neighbor's.   


 I morally don't believe any of these things i mentioned are right especially the site guy to be VERY clear. , But given their possible consequences the people doing these things has so little consequences it's just puzzling me why we rely on the good nature of others to prevail. When time and time again it has proven that it really doesn't . ( it does , But 75 good vs 25 bad is still really fucked up ) I'm absolutely not a nihilist i do believe there's a point to it all and i do believe in Being good / good being the right thing to do, iv'e Skipped out on alot of business  opportunities that fall under what iv'e described and i'm pretty poor because of it but i don't...resent any of it i'm truly Happy .

1,2023-08-23,cmv: not everyone is likeable,u/rhaenyraHOTD,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15zkfs1/cmv_not_everyone_is_likeable/,changemyview,"I'll try to make this as short as possible while still leaving at least some details as to why I feel this way. This is the first time I'm writing something like this because I want to be as vulnerable as possible to see if others can relate.

In short, I have an **extremely** hard time bonding with people. In my 32 years on this Earth, I have only made one ""friend"". We met when we were toddlers. Had we met when we were older, I know for a fact that we would not have gotten along. I don't care to go into too much detail as to why I know that, but when we got older, before college, we just naturally grew apart. We **never** bonded over anything. I don't know anything about him except his birthday and name. We just....never clicked and only remained ""friends"" for as long as we did because we met at a very young age. Basically, we were friends out of convenience.

I've never dated and, I'm excluding men because I'm not attracted to men, I've only had 2 women show interest in me. It didn't work out, in part, because I wasn't always nice to them. I'm not sure why I behaved the way I did, but my attitude pushed them away, as well as us not having anything in common. 

I don't even bond with my own ""family"". For the most part, I'll hear from them *only* if I made the effort to phone first. It's rare for them to put in effort to see how I'm doing. I can go years without hearing from most of them and I'm usually invited to ""family"" get togethers because my mom was invited. I know they love me. Or at least they always say they do, but I have zero bonding to literally *all* of my relatives.

Now, I look at people that I work and go to school with and I cannot for the life of me figure out how they can effortlessly make friends and get into relationships. I always think ""what do they see in each other, because I don't see it"". Not that it matters what I think of them, but it's sometimes sad that I don't have that bond that seems to come natural for most people. 

But I like being alone. I don't care to always interact with people and 99% of people don't care to interact with me either. I don't have that urge to get to know someone, however, I do want a wife and at least 1 friend that I can count on. 

Maybe I haven't met my people yet but I don't believe it takes this long to find a group of people that likes me for me. **I genuinely don't think everyone is lovable, or even likeable.**

Also, I've taken several different tests for autism and other mental disorders and they all came back negative."

1,2023-08-23,"CMV: In the US, society cares more about women's perception of victimization over men's actual victimization",u/RseAndGrnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15zm255/cmv_in_the_us_society_cares_more_about_womens/,changemyview,"A video popped up on my Instagram which had a woman and a man answering questions. For example, the first question was ""Would you feel comfortable running at night""? The woman said no the man said yes. If you saw a group of men would you cross the street? The woman said yes the man said no. Do you feel unsafe walking past a construction site. The woman said yes, the man said no. Nothing profound, very basic questions. Keep in mind the woman was an average woman and the man was a bodybuilder, so not representative of the average man. At the end of the video there was some message about how this shows that in society women aren't protected and don't feel safe and want to be equal to me in this regards.

So if that's how she feels whatever, but presenting this as the reality is false. Now in most of these situations, you're likely not in danger in the first place, but if you were, it's far more likely that men would be the victim since they are almost 2x as likely to be victims of violent crime and are 2x as likely to be victimized by strangers. Additionally, while there are more women than men, men are victimized at a disparate rate. This only includes reported crimes since me are also less likely to report crime. If this person wants equality, this means she is actually wanting more women to be victimized while also feeling safer. 

Anyway, in most places, there is far more emphasis and funding put into violence against women while men are mostly ignored and when they are addressed it's usually to say ""you're the problem"". As well, there's an expectation for men to put themselves into potential danger in order to protect women. Meanwhile, when men do try to address these issues it's dismissed, deflected with people saying 'what about women' or deemed to be misogyny. 

The reality isn't matching up to the response and to me this shows that people care more about women's fear of victimization, over men's actual victimization. This means that either society inherently find women more valuable than men thus more deserving of investment, that men as individuals are doing something which causes their own victimization and should handle it themselves, or that people just don't care.

Obviously society disagrees with that so I want someone to explain how this logically makes sense and is fair and equal"

It is interesting how these European countries, notably Germany, which possess limited natural resources, managed to achieve economic success. 

Based on data from [Worldpopulationreview](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/education-rankings-by-country), the countries leading in exceptional educational systems are primarly situated in Europe. While Japan, South Korea, and Singapore are also present on the list, it's evident that European nations dominate the rankings. 

The East Asian education system has been associated with a significant number of suicides and a high-pressure academic environment. 

Understandably, especially in the case of Japan, South Korea and Singapore, countries that are situated in relatively small landmasses with limited natural resources will have to depend on an export-based economy. This usually require a technically skilled workforce, which requires a significant level of education to attain. 

On the other hand, Germany is also lacking in natural resources, but their education system is not associated with near the number of suicides as the East Asian ones."

1,2023-08-24,CMV: The N Word should be either condemned in its entirety or acceptable for everyone to say,u/ch0cko,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15zqvel/cmv_the_n_word_should_be_either_condemned_in_its/,changemyview,"I. Introduction

The n-word has a troubled history and past, with it primarily having been used by white people in a way to dehumanize and reduce Black individuals to tools. In recent decades, Black individuals have risen to ""reclaim"" the word, strip away the power of it, and remind people that the word was historically used in a pejorative way.[\[1\]](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-53749800)

II. Why I don't agree with this 'reappropriation' of the n-word

""\[The n-word may be acceptable for African Americans to use it freely, \[but\] it is off-limits to whites, whose usage of \[the n-word\] cannot be the same, given its history and the general history of racial oppression and racial relations in the United States.""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation#cite_note-:02-1) (citation leads to Wikipedia citation)

I disagree with this. White people, in the past, had used the n-word in a horrible way, yes. But you don't see Jeremy over here saying the n-word in the same way, now, do you? That was done by different people, in a different way, in a different time. Why should we attach the n-word to specific categories, such as being white? Is this not prejudiced itself? We are categorizing an entire race into being incapable of saying specific words because of what their potential ancestors did. 

Furthermore, this only gives more power to to word. *""Bad""* non-black/white individuals can *still* say the n-word, and it being taboo only gives them *more* incentive to do so. 

There are three different ways of going about this, with the third being what has happened:  


1. Have the n-word become an extremely typical and normal word in language, with everyone being ""allowed"" to say it (that is, acceptable to say it.)
2. Have the n-word outright banned/have it unacceptable for anyone and everybody to say, including those who are black. 
3. Have the n-word be ""taboo"" for everyone except black people. It is acceptable for black people to say the n-word, but is not for those who are not black.

The first option's reasoning:  


1. As there is no taboo attached to the word, there are no people who are going to be non-conforming to the ""rules..."" because there are none. 
2. No more non-black people who attempt to instigate using the n-word \[in the same way it is used now\] because, now, it's just a normal word essentially. 
3. The word would be powerless.

I am aware that it is still a good thing for history to be remembered but I don't believe that reclaiming a word for only a select few individuals to be able to say it is the way to go about it. This only causes further division between the arbitrary labels that we have given ourselves based on colour: race. Teach the meaning of the word. Continue to educate those why it had a troubled history and *why* it should no longer be attached to those horrible roots. However, I can see how the troubled history can make the word harder to use, but if that is the case, then let us refer to option 2:  


The n-word should have never been reclaimed/taboo for all people and races. The word, as established, had a terrible history, tied to slavery of a specific race. The word should be taught specifically in a historical context, referring to the problematic usage of the word, but not used in everyday language. Why? Because of the following:  


1. The word would not have resurfaced and been used so frequently by people in the modern day, specifically, non-black individuals who are also relatively young. 

That's essentially it; the n-word wouldn't be used as frequently as it is used today. It has been popularized and much more widespread than it likely would have been had it not been reclaimed. It more so just be a fact of history and not necessarily have taboo attached to it.   


That is my reasoning for why the n-word should not have been reappropriated and reclaimed. We have given the word power. Why? Change my view."
1,2023-08-24,CMV: Traveling in a commercial plane is the most unsafe form of travel,u/okygtot,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15zrvmj/cmv_traveling_in_a_commercial_plane_is_the_most/,changemyview,"NOT because planes themselves are unsafe, but because humans are.

Think about it. You are entrusting your life and well-being/existence to TWO people (pilots) who you have never met before, have 0 actual trust in (because you don't even know them to trust them), and who could end your life based on one decision.

There have been several cases where a pilot was suicidal/mentally unwell and took the plane hostage and in some of those cases actually crashed the plane killing himself and all occupants.

The main rebuttal is going to be a recently new rule that there cannot be one pilot in the cockpit at once, there always needs to be two people. This doesn't change my initial view though, because your fate is still in the hands of two people. 

Just the fact alone that your life is in the hands of two strangers 35000 feet in the air is enough to make it unsafe to me."
1,2023-08-24,CMV: The automation of labour will bring about a dystopia wherein we will all be poor and unable to afford anything.,u/georgewastaken3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/15zsxum/cmv_the_automation_of_labour_will_bring_about_a/,changemyview,"In my opinion, there’s no way that people without degrees will be able to survive once the whole world is automated.

If that didn’t make sense, consider the fact that every day, technology gets more advanced. I’m not even fear-mongering AI, but 90% of blue collar jobs could be completed sufficiently by machinery, and that machinery would only need a small team of technicians to maintain it. 

At the time of writing this, a lot of factories in my country still use manual labourers to work production lines, and it’s easy work. I know a lot of people who don’t mind working production lines, however, as soon as it’s automated, I feel that a couple hundred thousand people will be left jobless around the country, meanwhile the company loses a lump sum at the benefit of no longer having to pay workers to work for them.

I know a good amount of taxi drivers who love to be able to choose their hours rather than work a 9-5, and there are hundreds of people on Just Eat and Deliveroo who also reap this benefit whilst being paid the minimum living wage.

The issue is that all of these jobs that pay out the bare minimum and allow people to do things like work on their terms and choose their hours will soon be obsolete. Western countries are already deploying food delivery robots, whilst in the east, like Japan, they’re automating waitstaff. Imagine how many jobs will disappear from America when they automate waitstaff.

Hotels can be automated as is with AI, with only housekeeping needed to be done by human beings. We already have genuine sci-fi style smart homes cropping up where you can do all sorts of stuff with virtual assistants to control the AC or close the blinds and such, and I don’t think it’d be a stretch to install what is essentially a smart-dumb-waiter into some hotel rooms so you request food that gets sent to you automatically.

All of this to say that in the western world for definite, there’s going to be a huge shortage of jobs. A shortage so huge that I imagine that a large percentage of the population will be left jobless because they’ll be made redundant by machines.

At that point, nobody would be able to afford homes anymore. People newly born would live knowing that only the exceedingly rich could afford houses, the poor are homeless and only the middle class has the opportunity to rent a house.

With labour being done by machines, we’d have virtually nothing to trade for goods and services. The big conglomerates would have all of the money, and we would stand to gain nothing. Truly the darkest timeline. We’d never work again, we’d never earn another penny again. A true dystopia.

This has probably been a huge rant, but the TL;DR is essentially that in the near future, I believe will come a point where humanity as a race becomes entirely redundant."

This often plays havoc in terms of politics as what is good for the people often interferes with what is in the self interest of the person getting involved in politics. Moreover, the selection process for candidates tends to have plenty of politicking  in political parties, leading to much infighting and whatnot.

I think it would be better if we farm our politicians, monitoring them from decanting from cloning from the general population, with traits such as self interest bred out of them. This would allow for politicians to be custom engineered rather than selected for political parties and would allow people to easily create political parties as they can simplify it to one person (and his/her ideals) and their clones, allowing for more political views to be represented in government.

Because all your needs are met without effort, you become monotonous, lose interest in everything and even cause mental decline. You become a happiness zombie. Solution for this was >!to give option to ""quit"" the afterlife giving meaning for existence.!<

After the solution was implemented everyone went fine. While dilemma and conclusion itself is valid it's not valid in context of The Good Place. Reason for this is simple. The Good Place is not without challenges and hurdles.

&#x200B;

The role of the executive (ministries, et al) would be replaced by councils similar to that of the Swiss with each council having 50 to 100 members who are randomly selected from subject matter experts (offering a wide range of views)who sit for a non renewable term for 4 years and they are strictly forbidden from making policy (even in the form of suggestions) . Refusing to participate would result in death or 10 years to a life sentence as this is saboutaging the process by not making your views heard. The head of state role (President or whatnot) would be shelved with the executive council for foreign affairs taking on the role of reference point for foreign governments.

&#x200B;

The legislative portion (representatives) would be replaced by the citizens themselves. All citizens from birth to death every 4 years (save for those sitting on the executive councils) would propose and vote on policies in a government portal with a simple majority needed to pass laws first before it is then given over to a trial period for assessment for a few months before it is finally ratified through majority vote on the streets. They will be also be subject to the same penalty as those sitting in the executive councils (Death penalty or a 10 years to life jail sentence) for damaging democracy by not refusing to put their views up as democracy needs people to put their viewpoints up.

&#x200B;

The judicary (Supreme Court and other courts) would have juries selected from all members of the citizenry rather than judges to allow for citzenry to try and interpret laws, ranging from consitiutional cases to criminal law with verdicts first being passed through jury vote and then popular vote. Again, penalty of death or a long jail sentence for refusal once selected.

&#x200B;

It cuts the middleman out of politics (aka, if you want a law implemented, write it and do it yourself) , takes advantage of technology to make democracy a lot more efficient since they (the citizenry) can just do it over the internet directly in drafting up laws and prevents the consolidation of power as the roles of the executive  is split between people rather than in 1 minister in charge for each executive ministry of government. It also encourages participation under the pain of death or jail, allowing for more views to be represented in government.

That being said I don’t think our cuisine is the best especially compared to India, Italy, Thai food etc etc. I often see Americans reacting to our food such as the recent debate between uk vs us Chinese food and claiming we have no seasoning and our food is bland.
First point- Most Americans don’t have a proper view of what our food is. Beans on toast is just something we make when we are broke for instance not a staple of our diet. We have so many foods which are great. Fish and chips, sunday roasts, scones, scotch eggs. A lot of people’s view would be changed if they went to a nice country pub imo.
Secondly point- all of American cuisine is based off other cultures (which is great don’t get me wrong) however it’s infuriating when Americans don’t acknowledge their food is not unique. Hamburgers are from germany, diner breakfasts are based off fry ups, apple pie is from England, pizza is Italian.We are guilty of this too our national dish is a chicken tikka masala. This brings me onto the point made that america has more food options due to being a melting pot.this may have been true in the 1950s but the uk has as many food options- just look at london. Chefs from around the world travel to work in our Michelin star restaurants. We are now also a melting pot. We have massive Indian Bengali Pakistani and Chinese populations who have intertwined their culture and food into ours for near a century. 
Finally our chefs are the most famous - Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver , marco Pierre white.

1,2023-08-24,CMV: Standard High German (Hochdeutsch) phonotactics dislike the phoneme /h/ anywhere except the beginning of a word.,u/hononononoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1601i67/cmv_standard_high_german_hochdeutsch_phonotactics/,changemyview,"I'm a native American English speaker who has been a lifelong amateur linguist and language learner. I've never formally studied the German language, but I've dabbled in it, and learning to read and speak basic German is on my bucket list.

I've noticed something striking about the phonology of Standard High German, which I've never seen described explicitly in any of the pronunciation guides I've read, but I have found to be reliably true. The phoneme /h/, the voiceless glottal fricative, only occurs word-initially. Or, to be more technical, German phonotactics dislike /h/, except in first-syllable onset position. Granted, in Standard German orthography, the grapheme *h* is not restricted to word onset. But when it isn't the first letter of a word, *h* is never pronounced /h/. *H* in other positions is either a modifier of the way the letter before it is pronounced:

> *ah, ch, eh, oh, ph,* and *uh*

or is there for etymological and historical reasons, and has no phonemic value. Simply put, it isn't pronounced:

> V*h*V or *th*

I have yet to find a single German word or name that contains the sound /h/ in the middle of the word, distinctly pronounced, and spelled with either *h* or any other letter. Can any fluent German speakers prove me wrong on this? And if this generalization can be made, why is it not widely conceptualized and taught as a distinct rule of German phonology?

I specify Standard High German (*Hochdeutsch*), because I'm aware that there are many dialects of the German language, with rather divergent phonology and varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. Are there other ""less standard"" dialects of German where /h/ *does* occur in the middle or at the ends of words? Or, at the other end, are there dialects of German that do not have /h/ at all, even at the beginnings of words? I wouldn't be surprised if both of these exist, simply because English dialects vary considerably in their tolerance for /h/.

What made me think about this was traveling to Ireland, and reading about the Irish language's orthography and phonology, which rival those of Polish in their regularity but complexity. In Irish, the grapheme *h* is quite widely used as a modifier, to indicate a weakened or deleted consonant. But the *phoneme* /h/ only really occurs word-initially in Irish, either as a lenition of /s/ or /t/, or as a linking phoneme between two vowels. Can the same generalization be made for the German language? In my limited experience, it can."

We are expected to hand hold them everyday otherwise it’s seen as neglect. “Kids these days” CAN’T do the things we used to do, because nosy people won’t let them.

""Are sub-saharan Africans not, on average, physically stronger than East Asians?""

""Have sub-saharan Africans not broken most sports records set by East Asians?""

""Do East Asians not outnumber sub-saharan Africans on this planet?""

I'm curious to know how those supporting a ban on trans women in women's sports would respond to this hypothetical argument from a Chinese nationalist? Or really any nationalist disgruntled with how black people excel at sports?"

There are stubbles, and there are beards. At some point, a stubble will grow to be a beard. However, the exact point at which that stubble becomes a beard is debatable and has no objective mark beyond what an individual personally determines. Therefore, does that make stubbles and beards totally subjective concepts? Of course not. If someone has a beard that reaches to their torso, calling it a stubble would still be factually incorrect.

The same goes for the quality of art. While whether or not a person enjoys it is subjective,  there is a clear difference between what makes something of a higher quality. If this weren't the case, why are some pieces of art unanimously seen as superior to others? If you were to take a Stanley Kubrick film and compare it to something like Micheal Bay's Transformers movies, can you really see an argument supporting the latter over the former beyond purely subjective reasons (IE: I like giant robots)? When you compare qualities such as scripting, cinematography, acting, etc., can you really see a well-intentioned argument in favor of Transformers?

Art being able to have objective quality to it is the very reason why art can have such overwhelming consensus. In the same way a beard can without question be a beard, so to can art be good or bad without question."

In the U.K., Britons are taxed a small license fee for owning a TV. That money is collected to fund the BBC, which produces content. The BBC have editorial standards, and they don’t just throw money at any idea. To me, it seems hypocritical to both believe that all art is subjective (and therefore equally deserving of funds) while supporting a system wherein taxpayer funds are collected and sent to a media company that editorialises its content. 

I find it a ridiculous contradiction to argue on one hand that all art is subjective and then on the other to support editorialising content that’s funded by the tax payer.

To avoid getting into the weeds and for full disclosure, I am aware the BBC is not wholly taxpayer funded, but I don’t think that invalidates my point, and I don’t want to end up arguing a side point about the BBC’s funding structure. There are many examples of government funding of the arts. 

I think most people who say art is subjective would also agree that government should distinguish between art it does and doesn’t fund, probably based on some combination of technical skill, effort and acclaim. 

If you can accept that obviously any government arts and culture funding should make value judgements between the art it funds then you clearly don’t believe all art is subjective, or it would be first come first serve only."

Meanwhile, travelers are now forced to arrive at the airport 2 hours early or more, lest the TSA stop them. Once at the airport, travelers are subjected to stringent and illogical rules. You can't bring more than 3 oz of a specific liquid, and it has to be put in a quart sized bag. But if it's in your checked bag, suddenly it's fine. You can buy water once you get past TSA, but it's always much more expensive than water you'd buy outside of the airport. It's a price gouging scam. 

The TSA also discriminates against various minorities. Black women get their hair searched by the TSA. Since the TSA agents put the gender they assume a passenger to be into the machine, and it scans that way (if an agent puts male in for someone who is biologically female, their breasts will get flagged), LGBTQ passengers who's appearance may not match their physical sex are often flagged by the scanners and forced into a patdown. Breastfeeding mothers are also often required to have their breast milk tested, which is ridiculous.

I believe the best solution is to replace the TSA's current system with metal detectors. The metal detectors would be able to identify weapons better than body scanners, since metal detectors just search for metal. Metal detectors would also deal with the discrimination issue since it isn't scanning for body shapes, just metal. 

I'm definitely open to my view being changed."

If not, let me explain.

Spider-Man: Lotus is a 2023 American independent superhero drama fan film produced, directed, and co-written by Gavin J. Konop.

In June 2022, messages were leaked online, where lead actor Warden Wayne used racial, homophobic, and ableist slurs, sparking controversy on Twitter. In light of the messages being leaked, Wayne immediately issued an apology, referencing his conservative upbringing and stating that he ""would hope and pray that people watching it wouldn't judge it based on \[his\] past, and instead take it for what it is: a film about redemption and coming out of the darkness.""

Soon after, similar messages were revealed in which director Gavin J. Konop used racist and ableist slurs. He responded to this by releasing a YouTube video entitled ""Addressing Everything"" in which he would claim that some of the leaked messages were fake, while taking accountability for others, claiming that they were posted when he was a teenager and promising that he no longer uses such words.

I only learned about the film in October 2022 during an internship at Autonomyworks, and after the final trailer was released, my curiosity piqued. So I was willing to try to separate art from the artist, and give this film a chance, seeing it looks better than what we got from Disney and Sony, especially from the MCU after a few duds since their last decent film, ""No Way Home""....

Only for me to learn the hard way that Looks aren't Everything.

The film was okay, but Peter was more of a jerk in the film that he normally is, he unloaded his trauma onto Tim Harrison, too many establishing shots, the acting could've been better, and the list goes on. The few good things about the film that I liked were the flashbacks to the Goblin Fight, and the opening sequence and Harry's storyline, which should've been fleshed out.

I could take the Film's concept and make something even better than what Gavin did.

But I sadly find myself no longer interested in anything Marvel Related, including Games, Movies or any media *(Past and Present)*, or DC related either. Every time something Marvel-related or DC related comes up, I used to be willing to watch it, but I can't even bring myself to watch ""My Adventures With Superman"" anymore, I tried, and it looked really good, but I just can't.

Since then, I stopped watching all Superhero related things and haven't looked back since."

The root of my ideology (as somebody who prefers labour to conservatives) is that people who vote for the left generally don’t have any idea what they want from the country, and they consistently kick up a fuss about things that I’m not even sure they know why they’re doing it.

Case and point, feminism is a place to start. Women are treated equally now, and yet all of a sudden the people who claim that they’re leftists now also inexplicably subscribe to right wing hard conservative beliefs that are considered “redpilled”. I don’t understand how some people can claim that as women, they’re oppressed, then claim that they’re “strong and independent” and then in the same breath, say that they want a man who makes much more than she makes, thereby becoming reliant on him. There’s also cases where it’s somehow considered sexist to hold open a door for a woman; a gesture that I would offer to literally anybody coming towards a door with me.

Celebrities will go on the news to talk about how they’re still oppressed, in order to gain favour from their racial communities and seize a little bit of relevance back. I get that there are some old fashioned people who are still racist that try to alienate people of a darker complexion from our society, but we’re hardly racist as a people. The majority of people who are in university were born and raised in Asia, and chose to come to the UK to study, and they were welcomed with open arms. (The lady on the news was Munroe Bergdorf) CMV

Furthermore, in her time on the news show, she claimed that the white people of the UK were irredeemable, which in and of itself is a generalisation based on race.

There are also a huge amount of double standards that I hate that you see all the time, like African Americans insisting that they “can’t be racist” because they were “oppressed once”. There are still people being oppressed in this day and age, and these people insist on hanging onto the past.

Onto the big one, Transgenderism. I don’t hold issue with the concept or the people who integrate it into their ideology. I don’t care, really in all honesty, and I have the right to my own opinion. If I know someone for years and they tell me that they’re transitioning, then I’ll respect their pronouns. If I’m meeting a friend of a friend, and I say “hey man, what’s up” and they tell me that I’m offending them when it’s literally a figure of speech? Oh baby, that is so infuriating. I say “hey man” to men, women, children, fucking dogs, cats, spiders, if it has blood, it’s a hey man from me chief. Why does society have to shift so drastically in a way that it’s so damn easy to offend literally everyone through no fault of your own. I take issue with being called a Bigot when I accept everyone for who they are, and who they want to be.

Why does everyone seem to have this belief that you immediately agree with the creators of the content that you consume? POWER by Kanye was a hit, and everyone loved it. I had a conversation with a hard leftist the other day and was told that I’m a “neo-nazi” for “voting with my wallet”. WHY? Just let me consume what I consume without being the PC Police about it. Not everything is political, my love of 2010s rap hits is purely because the music sounds nice to my ears.

Cancel culture. Why should Edward Norton have to pay reparations because his great great grandfather owned slaves at some point in his life? Why should I get doxxed for making a joke that some SJW doesn’t agree with? Why should I lose my job because people don’t accept my freedom of speech? It’s not even hate speech, people have been doxxed for “assuming gender” and equally menial things. Assuming gender isn’t a method of oppressing minorities who are different, it’s an automatic thing that we’re familiar with, that we haven’t had to take into account for years because it’s so drastically uncommon and different.

Fatphobia. Do I really have to say why fatphobia is a fucking stupid word? Genuinely, if you’re fat, you deserve to have to pay for multiple seats on public transports. The women who were fighting against “manspreading” are the same women saying that people who are 400-600lbs should be accepted and that it’s discriminatory to charge for two seats. 

I know that this is a drastically varied list of examples that are gonna struggle to illustrate my point, but you have to get it, right?"

I have seen many have obviously not gone through any training, becuase they react to stimulus like they are dropping acid, I do not trust these sketchy owners, and there are a lot of local news stories where one bites a child (they are CAUSING disabilities). It is clear that we cannot trust people to self-diagnose when they need one, and it is getting out of hand.

Not only is there no required registration, training, or documentation, under the ADA: it is ILLEGAL TO ASK for any documentation or inqure why the animal is needed, it is illegal for a state/local government to require them, it is illegal to pass laws excluding certain breeds like pit bulls, and they dont even have to be vaccinated (unless all pets must be in that state).

Before you choose a major, you’re supposed to research if the field is in demand or not as well as research the average salary for graduates. If you can’t do basic research, then you shouldn’t be in college. If you intentionally choose a major that is likely going to land you a 17/hrr job after you graduate, that is your fault. Protesting “I can’t pay my loans so the taxpayers should foot the bill” is laughable. Nobody forced you to major in anthropology. I chose to major in finance because there are tons of jobs in finance. Most companies as well as hospitals and nonprofit organizations have a finance department and are in need of financial analysts. On the other hand, not many companies are in need of somebody with a Bachelor of Arts degree."

1,2023-08-24,CMV: I should take an internship in Tauranga,u/ImpossibleSquish,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/160kelh/cmv_i_should_take_an_internship_in_tauranga/,changemyview,"Context: I'm doing a masters degree for which I am required to get 400 hours of internship experience before I graduate. I've been offered a good internship, but it would require me to move to Tauranga for three months, a city that is a two hour drive away from my current city.

Reasons I think I should take the internship:

1. It's the only internship offer I've had so far and I don't have any other interviews on the table

2. The course coordinator strongly recommended I take it

3. I like the people and the project seems interesting

4. It'd set me up on a path towards my dream career

5. My girlfriends (yes two, polyamoury) are supportive and encouraging me to take the offer, saying they'll help me figure out the logistics of us visiting each other

6. If I don't get a good internship my mother will be displeased. And the way she expresses her disapproval is vehement and constant and has already put me in therapy. I can't yet afford to be permanently independent so in my current living situation, failing to appease mother will be awful for my mental health

7. I'm a people pleaser and the idea of letting down my potential employer and course coordinator by rejecting an offer they both want me to take is making me anxious

Factors that are making me concerned:

1. I've only been with my throuple (my girlfriends) for a month or two, and it seems so early to be testing the relationships with three months of semi-long distance. I'm scared of them leaving me

2. I have a cat, which makes relocating difficult. I'd have to find an affordable airbnb that will allow me and my cat to stay for three months. I'm not sure if that's even possible?

3. Mother's disapproval. (I know, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.) Her reaction to me failing to get an internship will make me feel abysmal, but she thinks moving to Tauranga is a bad idea and we had a fight over it last night and I'm still feeling sick with anxiety over that interaction.

Despite my concerns I'm leaning towards going for the internship, but I don't want to make the wrong decision so I'd appreciate people pointing out other difficulties I haven't considered so that I make an informed decision."

Nobody would ever say that a person born in Quebec is a ""Latino” person or that Montreal is ""Latino"" city. 

The term Latino is reductive, oversimplified and comes with stereotypes. If a person is Latino, that person is expected to display specific behaviors, to dress in specific ways,  to listen to specific types of musics, to eat specific foods and even to have specific physical appearances.

When people think of Latinos, the first thing that comes in their minds is the Spanish language and never ever Portuguese despite Brazil being the largest and more populous country of Latin America, and it's not uncommon for people to believe that Spanish is the language spoken in Brazil. The idea of Latinos being automatically Hispanic by rule is so deeply rooted in society's minds that these two terms ""Latino"" and ""Hispanic"" very often intertwine with one another. The Latino idea has a problem where the practice conflicts with the theory.

Latino is undeniably viewed as a race/ethnicity, being placed on checkboxes preceded by the question ""what is your race/ethnicity?"", along with other checkboxes that say ""white"", ""black"", ""indigenous"" and ""asian"" even though a latin american person could be any of those. The existence of the ""latino"" checkbox shows that not only Latino is treated as race, it also shows the reductive, absurd belief that Latin America, a continental region made by 33 countries, composes one ethnicity. 

The same thing can be applied to any continent other than Europe or Australia (aka ""white"" places). It's very common to hear things like ""asian people"", ""african people"", ""middle easterners"" or ""muslims"", but you never see someone from Europe being called ""european people"", instead they are referred by their nationalities."

 the first thing many tourists notice the second they leave the airport is the smell of the smog and having to adjust to the stench of human waste in the streets

The caste system in India while becoming less and less prominent over the decades is still a major barrier/division in society thats silently enforced regardless of merit 

India is perhaps one of the dirtiest countries on earth due to how massively overpopulated it is, I’m not saying more developed countries aren’t dirty (hell NYC is dirty) but at least the air isn’t deemed a safety risk to breathe

Safety in India is practically non-existent in many places especially for women for which rape/gang-rape is a very common occurrence  

15% of the population lives in poverty which may not seem to high compared to a country like the us however one a has to consider that India has over 1.4 billion people pe meaning that over 210 *million* people live in extreme poverty. I don’t care how the upper echelon of society lives, but if 210 million of your people live in poverty you have failed as a country and what makes it worse is that that rate was much higher not even 10 years ago 

The country is really and I mean really overpopulated, to the point where the countries social programs are far beyond failing. Many of the problems above are directly linked to its overpopulation such as the smog and crime rate. It’s other effects is mass homelessness, disease, and the creation of mass slums

If this is true, how come no past presidents have been arrested even though weve been in wars in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Niger, Yemen, Afghanistan etc.  
  
I feel like every single one of our past presidents should be arrested for all the illegal wars we have participated in, why haven't they? They 100% SHOULD be. And if we are going after a past president for some weird bending of the law justification then we should go after all presidents fairly.

But maybe that's the whole point, maybe that's the appeal. Maybe comparing webcomics to manga would be like comparing a tiktok to a hollywood film. I don't think tiktoks and youtube videos are inferior to movies, it's just a different type of video for a different situation. But if I shouldn't compare them to comics, why are they called webCOMICS? If I shouldn't compare them to manga, then why do so many of them try to copy popular anime art styles? I understand Japanese people are more likely to be inspired by Japanese anime, but the majority of these webcomic creators are from Korea, China, and even the western world.

I've only read a handful of webcomics, but man, the dialogue is just so awful every time. Some of them need to be translated from Asian languages, but so does manga and that doesn't suffer from this issue to the same degree. It just seems obvious to me that not much thought or effort goes into the writing. All of the stories seem more or less the same, romance is by far the most popular genre and you can definitely tell they're made by hopeless romantics. Almost all of them look and feel the same, compared to traditional comics where some are really colourful and upbeat, while others are dark and depressing.

I don't have anything against romance, but there are so many homoerotic webcomics, specifically on webtoons, that it becomes obvious these people are more interested in sharing their fetishes than actually creating meaningful stories. You reach a point where it starts to come off as low quality fan fiction masquerading as art. I have 0 resepect for it and I don't understand why these things are so popular."

There's nothing special about having a job, paying your own bills and being able to support yourself. Thats what the typical adult does. So why do some women think being able to do these basic adult things gives them a badge of honor or make them special? Because you never here men promote this ""I'm an independent boss"" type attitude and rhetoric whenever they become successful. Maybe it's due to different expectations with men and women when it comes to making money guess.
Something else I really don't understand is that if your a woman who's ""independent"" and are seeking out a partner then why do you want someone who makes more money than you if you are already independent? If you can already pay your own bills and take care of yourself than why does the man you are with have to make as much or more than you do? Because that's what we know with general female dating preferences is that they want to be with someone on their financial level or higher. But I find it kind of contradictory to pride yourself in being independent but at the same time demand that the person you're with has a higher income than you do so in that case wouldn't you be dependent on that persons money? Especially if you expect them to pay for dates and buy gifts etc. idk let me know"

**One person being good at finances, and the other person not being good at finances.**

If you have a joint account and one person isn’t good at budgeting you’re setting yourself up for a problem, regardless of if 1 person works, both work, both make the same, one makes more than the other, giving each person a separate debit card to the account will mean the bad habits and spending tendencies of the 1 person will most likely put the household budget in a pickle, its like giving an alcoholic access to your beer its not going last.

Just let the person who’s good at finances handle the bills.

**You both work and make similar salaries**

In this case there is literally no reason to have a joint account, because even if you both agree to pay half the expenses, just calculate it and put that money aside into a separate account and then keep your money separate as you both have equal spending power as you make the same amount of money.

**You both work but 1 person makes much more than the other**

The person making more has no incentive to pool the money because that’s going to incentivise the lower earner to spend more because they will feel entitled to half the household funds despite maybe making ⅓ or ¼ of the income. Much better idea to have them ask for extra money so you can make sure they aren’t spending it frivolously

**One person works the other stays at home**

The working partner can and should give the stay at home partner an allowance for keeping up with the domestic duties of the home, not giving them full access to your money because you need to make sure that food/rent or mortgage/car/insurances/child expenses/utilities/phone/internet/tv are all being paid and then figure out how much spending money is left.

Giving someone who’s at home 24/7/365 a “blank check” is a good way to find the budget out of wack because thats a lot of time to decide I’d like to treat myself to X/Y/Z or order food or get this cool thing I saw on an ad.

**Conclusion**

There are no mutual benefits for joint bank accounts."

1. its the original meaning of the latin word. 
   1. [https://www.etymonline.com/word/Police](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Police)
2. branding is influential
   1. while it is the original meaning, and while the highest-level intent likely remains the same, the connotation has shifted
   2. brand is not only to consumers, but also employees. 
   3. the wrong brand is also influential. terms like ""officer"" and ""rank"" carries w/ it authority, and authority is dangerous when it is not metered by service. 
   4. it doesn't change how we classify the role. we'd simply have city, state, and federal civil servants. 
3. it doesn't negate the law enforcement side responsibilities, but it does magnify the servant responsibilities. 
4. it reframes how we consider ""civil servants"" in criminal / civil law. 
5. i can think of no good reason we'd be emotionally tied to the term (e.g. the way marines might understandably be tied to the term ""marine""). 

i think this is a good idea. why is it bad? 

* i think this re-brand would have an impact on some of the quality metrics we use to measure the job. 
* i think this would have an impact on selection bias for the job (which would also impact quality metrics. 
* i do not think whatever problems exist will be solved with single solutions, so i am not claiming this solves everything, immediately, and completely. 
* i don't want to have an argument about ""how bad cops are"" or ""how good cops are"", or how bad / good the <\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_> whatever group you want here is. i just want to discuss the label we use to describe the job.

Thus, in the push for non-fossil fuel energy sources that are capable of providing baseload power we should encourage such sources such as nuclear, and geothermal, and hydropower to a lesser extent as there is an inherent risk that it itself could be unstable if rain fall doesn't refill the reservoir as we see with Lake Mead.

That said I recently read an article about how a geothermal power plant was put at risk because of this butterfly. Moreover, the articles explain how the ag industry already dried up a lake and there was merely the potential of drying up a hot spring, no proof that it would actually happen. As someone involved with geothermal energy typically the produced fluid is reinjected maintaining the pressure downhole so this, IMO, is far-fetched. The plant even had mitigation plans in place IF it was to happen.

Nuclear power itself has been demonized for its past failures however newer plant designs are much safer, with even some designs (as used in submarines) where the need for pumps is not necessarily so redundancy can be built in. I am no nuclear expert so I will not go into much detail here.

That said, as we, for lack of a better term, grab the low hanging fruit, with wind and solar there will come a point where we need more power options that are baseload, we see this already in Europe where during the day the regulatory bodies charge power companies to make power because there is too much, in California there is the duck curve which means as solar power drops the need for other sources can skyrocket faster than they can be turned on which has its own issues. People are championing battery technology as the stop-gap but we don't have enough natural resources to make battery cars and make enough batteries to last us thru the night.

As we have to reach higher and higher on the figurative power tree, we will have to start taking more and more risk. Perhaps we need to build a nuclear plant, maybe we need to build a geothermal plant near some butterflies and if it causes the spring to dry up them time for plan B. I agree with one of the comments in the articles that we can’t let things go extinct, but we can’t be ignorant and think we can make everyone/everything happy either.

We already accept that risk, windmills, farms, buildings kill birds every day, some endangered. Why don't we shut them down/tear them down or stop poisonings? Solar plants have been known to incinerate birds! Other solar plants are creating just as much hardship for organisms in the California desert so why are they allowed to proceed?

Why isn't the ag industry forced to refill the lake that was dried up, because it was accepted as a byproduct. We must treat everyone equally and as such they should be required to remediate their issues as much as we prevent new ones, or we accept the side effects as they come; but i digress.

My view is that we need to be willing to accept some risk and/or possible hardships as we move away from carbon energy sources. It may not always be impossible to prevent a bug/bird/lizard/fish potentially going extinct, or it might be that we need to live without power for a few hours because we cant make it since we protected something. We can’t have our cake and eat it too, even if we continue with fossil fuels. We need to understand that we might lose a butterfly in the Nevada desert however we might save the rest of the world in the process. This setback for green energy just allowed more CO2 emissions and set us back, but at what cost, what is the greater good?

FD: I work in Oil, Gas, and geothermal, over the past several years we have put more and more into our geothermal operations doing work on geothermal project around the world however being a pragmatic person, oil and gas is still a part of our everyday lives and we can’t shut off the spigot, unless of course you want a huge part of the world to die very quickly. It will be part of us for years to come but we can move forward at the same time. I think some protesters don't realize that but that's another CMV submission...

PS> I am doing this on my lunch break, so can I get a bit of pliancy with Rule E, might get caught up with stuff and 3 hours flies by sometimes!

He does not suscept to the peer-review process but instead rest his criticisms on his YouTube channel, broadcasts and enquiries with the media, and blog posts for the evangelical propaganda mill Discovery Institute. He has also debated with YouTuber 'Professor Dave Explains'.

The very notion as he claims that OOL is a rubbish field, a scientific fraud and a mere consequence of the inopportunity of scientists to publish critiques in the lectures I have watched is so ridiculous and scientifically unsupportable as to reflect a stunning lack of scientific scholarship for someone who is a respected Professor of Chemistry, among other egregiously wrong statements he makes in these appearances.

Much of his claims rest upon the idea that said researches are ""clueless"" and utilise faulty research methods resulting in the data not being pre-biotically relevant, which is a term for the relevant chemical environment in an early earth prior to life. Such statements of his are often corrected by OOL researchers, so the papers being invalid in this way has little support in the scientific literature.

Furthermore, in his 14 part series not at one point does he refer to the field of systems chemistry, which is convenient considering the immense scientific developments that showcase Darwinian based evolution exhibited in small systems of molecules and thereof. This is one example of him hiding from research likely due to his inability to discuss it, and thus, resorts to such selective referrals while claiming it is representative of the entire evidence base we have on  the Origin of Life.

Asserting such unsupportable misinformation about an active field of research can do real harm to those who dedicate their lives researching it in various ways. Our professional guidelines advise us to admit the limits of our expertise.

These comments demonstrate that Dr Tour has not done so – he is no expert on Origin of Life Research and in the future should show more humility when asked questions about this serious interdisciplinary topic."

'Overflow' is terrible - you end up with text bleeding all over the place, destroying any sense of organization. 'Wrap' isn't any better - long text ends up ridiculously stacked within cells, again disrupting the clean grid layout that spreadsheets rely on. 

'Clip' is the only sane option that preserves readability. Spreadsheets are for structured data, not freeform text. The default should absolutely be 'Clip' text wrapping to maintain spreadsheet sanity. Anything else results in a visual mess that defeats the purpose of a spreadsheet."

There are more Native Americans in the US and Canada today than there were when Jamestown was founded. I think there is a misunderstanding, which the Left purposely encourages, that there was like 300 million Natives in the US, and they all just got killed and replaced (by the immigrants that came here 100 years later, I guess).

Estimates put 1-3 million people living in the continental US and Canada when Columbus hit the Caribbean. According to the most recent census, there are 9 million ""Native Americans"" (I'm sure many are Elizabeth-Warren types, but what are you gonna do?). Even the rate of growth in population is probably comparable to what the US would have had if you excluded immigrantion since 1776.

There are plently of anecdotes of violence, coming from both sides with most being run-of-the-mill fights over land. The reality is there weren't that many Natives to begin with, and the number that actually died at the hands of colonizers is not anywhere near enough to ever be called a genocide.

Most Natives that did die resulted from diseases like Smallpox Even assuming there is any culpability/blame there, weighed against how many were saved by modern medicine, science, technology, and agricultural innovations the Old World brought or developed since then....we'll call it even.

""Stolen Land""

Usually people go with ""whataboutism"" here becuase every inch of the Earth has changed hands a million times (including from Natives to Natives). That is true, and the typical liberal line of thinking could easily be used to argue for any imperialistic war in history (Crusades),  But I would argue they never ""owned"" anything. Being to land first or occupying it doesnt confer some right to it or ownership (see ALL OF HISTORY). Land is owned by whoever can defend it.

Property is defined by having the right to exclude, which requires an ability to exclude. Property, especially land ownership, is a function of using violence (now called government) to force others off until they recognize you ""own"" it. This started off as just the strongest guy in Egypt (who wasnt all that strong becuase you only ate like one potato a week back then), but we have evolved as people realized cooperation makes it easier to kill, and went to to discovered more innovative ways/systems of dishing out violence, yada yada yada, now we have today. But really, land belongs to whoever the government says it belongs to. If you cant exclude people from your land, you don't ""own"" it.

And also, the US government bought/took a lot of the land that had previously been conquered by Russia, Spain, Sweden, and France as those empires abandoned the New World. Somehow that is ""stealing""."

This is a huge waste, and waste is bad.  Of course, if they simply sell the wine locally at a discount, they will fail to prop up prices.  However, they can sell the wine in such a way as to have minimal impact on their prices.

&#x200B;

The key way outlet malls (used to) work is to sell items at a discount in markets that do not typically purchase those items.  France can do much the same thing by selling its wine in countries that cannot typically afford French wine prices, and/or by changing the format.  Naturally, this means selling at a discount - but that's still a lot better than non-2020 hand sanitizer prices.  Some countries might yelp at the idea of France dumping its wine and damaging domestic markets, but there are plenty that would not.

&#x200B;

When I say changing the format, I do not actually know how much.  I can imagine a normal wine bottle with the winery clearly designated, but additionally marked ""only for sale in China (or wherever)"", to prevent large scale exportation to additional countries - under the hopes that consumers who learn a taste for certain wineries will seek those out.  I can imagine a box wine format with the winery not included.  I can even imagine a box wine format of blended wines at a still lower price point.  This would of course be a little wasteful as the blend is unlikely to be quite as tasty as its constituent wines, but far less wasteful than destruction and quite unlikely to depress the prices of French wine."

Regardless of your view on frats and sororities, that cliche makes zero sense. Paying for friends would imply that they are only your friends because you are paying them or someone else to be, but that isn't how it works. 

When you join a frat, you do rush, which is basically getting to know the brothers and becoming friends with them and other rushees. If you don't become friends with a good amount of brothers, or your own pledge class, you don't get a bid. Doesn't matter if you would pay dues. Once you are in the frat, no one is forced to be friends with you. People are friends with who they wish to be friends with. The dues you pay aren't paying anyone, besides maybe minimal IFC and Nationals dues. They mostly go towards events YOU participate in. If you choose to stop paying dues, your friends don't just stop being friends with you, either. So yeah, the cliche makes no sense."

1,2023-08-26,CMV: sexual orientation is a fetish,u/BurningPhone,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/161p4s7/cmv_sexual_orientation_is_a_fetish/,changemyview,"This opinion is relatively fresh in my head, but makes too much sense to me to not share. I'm by no means one of those ""your sexuality is your choice"" people. I think the opposite might be truer in this case. I am gonna open up the can of ""oh no a gender and sexuality discussion"" though. Unfortunately this opinion is so fresh in my head, that I don't really know how to explain it to people, but I'll do my best.

When I google the definition of the word fetish, the following comes up:


""1.
a form of sexual desire in which gratification is strongly linked to a particular object or activity or a part of the body other than the sexual organs.
""a man with a fetish for surgical masks""

2.
an inanimate object worshipped for its supposed magical powers or because it is considered to be inhabited by a spirit.""



I think we can ignore the second definition in this discussion and look at the first one. So basically, you have a  fetish when you can't get aroused without a certain activity, object or part of the body (not sexual organs). In my taste, what's lacking in this definition is the mention of sexual arousal by concepts. Take dominance for example. Sure, domineering over someone in a sexual encounter is also an activity, but what one might be aroused by is not the meaningless, robotic acts of saying certain stuff. It's the meaning behind the act. It's the concept of having control over someone. For some this might be just a kink, and others might not be able to get off unless they are dominated. For them it's a fetish.


So let's look at the definition of sexual orientation now.


""a person's identity in relation to the gender or genders to which they are sexually attracted; the fact of being heterosexual, homosexual, etc.""


Now you could say ""sexual orientation and fetishes are not the same thing, because sexual orientation is part of a person's identity"" I can't say that I agree on that. People who have fetishes could probably tell you, that their fetish has such an impact on their sexuality, that it inevitably becomes part of their identity. 

If we agree, that a person's gender is not necessarily linked to what's in their pants or whatever body they were born in, then we have to consider if gender really might be just a performance. 
Here's a quote from Wikipedia about gender performativity:

""Gender performativity is a term first used by the feminist philosopher Judith Butler in their 1990 book Gender Trouble. They argue that being born male or female does not determine behavior. Instead, people learn to behave in particular ways to fit into society. The idea of gender is an act, or performance.""

When someone says ""I can't do it with men, because I'm not gay. I can only feel aroused with women."", then that person is not aroused by the attributes we typically expect from men. They also expect to treat or be treated in a certain way by the person they have a sexual encounter with They are attracted to the performance. To the act!!! The concept!!! of a woman.



TLDR; I think our society is a little too uptight. Gender is nothing more than a concept, a performance. People who can't get off without a certain performance, have a fetish. Sexual orientation is a fetish."

I'd like to refer you to the ""Mop Theory"" of Communities first, which is a joke-theory but has a lot of truth to it: [https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths)

The basic content of it is that a subculture begins by being fostered by ""geeks"", people who care a lot about a certain topic and are heavily involved in it. The more the subculture gets to a point of critical mass that's when the ""mops"" come in, which are basically bandwagon-followers without any knowledge of the subject. The last step and the death of any subculture is when ""sociopaths"" invade it, meaning people who pander to the lowest common denominator for monetary or societal gain without having any material interest in the topic whatsoever.

I think most larger subreddits reflect this pretty nicely. I'm not actually active in most subreddits pertaining to my personal interests for exactly that reason. My two biggest hobbies in life have been 1) Hip Hop Music (listening, collecting and actively producing) and 2) collecting sneakers. 

I think Hip Hop in terms of rap as its music has probably become the least gatekept genre in the last couple of decades, with people talking about ""subgenres"" and putting music under that umbrella that actually doesn't belong there at all (this goes mostly for stuff like ""industrial"" Hip Hop which is mostly some sort of metal made by black people, and also spoken word albums etc.).

The same goes for collecting sneakers which has become a weirdly popular thing since about 2011 with changing tides as to which brands become popular and which don't at the current moment in time. It used to be a niche collectors hobby with weird nerds who were very knowledgable about obscure little details in long ago released shoes and now it has mostly become a fashion show for rich teenagers.

The main arguments I hear against gatekeeping are 1) that more people make a more thriving community, that 2) being exclusionary is somehow inherently bad and that 3) ""it's just a hobby don't take it that seriously, bro""

I'd counter 1) more people means having to meet a larger common denominator, meaning you have to cater to more people and more people are not necessarily more knowledgable about the topic than a couple that really care about it. It's not really thriving as much as it is bloated. 2) This is not a public service - being exlcusionary to people because they don't know much about something in the first place isn't being discriminatory, it's just a harsher way of saying they should know what is actually being talked about. 3) it's just a hobby to you but it's not just that to the people who are passionate about it and don't want to waste their time by listening to you being uninformed.

Looking forward to your arguments"

Affirming the gender they identify as by means of changes of gender expression, hormone therapy or surgery is a means of reclaiming one’s body. (as I understand it anyway but if that’s  wrong, do let me know). The same criteria -diagnosis by self-reporting and body dysphoria- are enough to validate the identities of people identifying as transracial, transabled and otherkin. If gender is solely seen as a social construct built on the features and anatomy one has at birth, a piece of ones identity that is flexible and changeable because one affirms their physical existence doesn’t match their inner self -regardless of having experienced life as the identified self- the same could be said of race.  
  
However, it seems that when one speaks of trans rights, they speak solely of transgender rights; it is clear that transracial rights are not under the same umbrella. One reason could be that accepting transracial rights into the fold wouldn’t be a good selling point. With race comes culture, while the two aren’t interchangeable, for those identifying as transracial, it pushes forward the question; what is being “white” or “black” past changing the colour of one’s skin? I see no way to answer that question without attributing skin colour to a culture. Even if it comes from a place of wanting to be included in something that resonates heavily with you, it wouldn’t -and isn’t- received well. If a white person were to identify as black, in the US for instance I feel the backlash wouldn’t be all that pleasant, considering the racial climate and, well history.   
This same reasoning could be applied to gender. Is it a social construct? Yes. However, it’s had very real consequences on men and women throughout history. The answer to what is a man or a woman? Is more abstract than say a chosen culture but it still points to a necessity of having a lived experience of it.  
  
Allowing for these constructs to be more and more flexible could lead to less segregation within a society. If not that, it could at least be a way to affirm one’s rights over one’s body and expression. That being said, picking elements that are more marketable in the moment only serves as a means of invalidation in the long run as such, “trans rights” shouldn’t be limited to gender if they wish to remain true to their reasoning.

1,2023-08-26,"CMV: Marriages and sexual/romantic relationships between first cousins should be legal, BUT it shouldn’t be encouraged",u/D35T1NY2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/161q8q4/cmv_marriages_and_sexualromantic_relationships/,changemyview,"My reasoning being is although the DNA between them isn't too similar to produce an unhealthy child, it DOES still increase the chances by twice on average, though the risk is still small, but an increase is still an increase. And the DNA similarity is way too high(about as much as half-siblings) between second cousins to be acceptable in any capacity. Even if cousins do not plan on having children, they should still be treated the same as if they are due to “what if"" scenarios and fair judgement.

Whilst I do think it is still acceptable to express concern and criticism between first cousins dating, having sex or marrying each other, I also believe that shaming, harassing, threatening them etc IS going WAY too far.

At least in the Western World, I do not consider first cousin relationships to be that much of a problem, considering the already abundant amount of criticism behind the practice, and in most of those countries it is still legal. However I do think the stigma is way too harsh.

Although I can still understand why many argue what is the point of going for your cousin if there are so many other people you can go for instead, the bond between the cousins might be considered good enough to not bother taking the risk only to unfortunately end up with someone not that good, as well as having plenty of support from their family members if they all get along with each other well.

And lastly, I do not think first cousins alone are in any position with each other where consent or family dynamics should be negatively affected, due to them living and growing up mostly in separate houses with different immediately-close families(parents and siblings).

In conclusion, romantic and sexual bonds between first cousins should be accepted and respected as long as there is enough criticism to prevent a pandemic of too many defected children."
1,2023-08-26,CMV: Tipping culture isn’t bad if cost of living isn’t outrageously high,u/SkynetsBoredSibling,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/161qez6/cmv_tipping_culture_isnt_bad_if_cost_of_living/,changemyview,"I grew up in America where tipping culture has been normalised, but I’ve been traveling the world for several years now, and tipping culture is nowhere to be found everywhere I’ve been.

Non-Americans are typically fiercely opposed to tipping culture, and to be fair, there are certainly many downsides. For example, tipping culture acts as a smoke screen for businesses to underpay their employees. It also allows businesses to advertise prices sans any tip — which misleads people into believing prices are lower than they actually are.

But that’s just it: the price of everything these days is getting unaffordable. If the cost of living weren’t so outrageously high, maybe I wouldn’t mind tipping.

I recently spent some time in southeast Asia, where the cost of living was anywhere from 50% to 90% lower than what I’m used to in western countries. Whereas in western countries I might have to spend $75 on a dinner out, in southeast Asia I would spend $25 on a comparable (or better) meal. Instead of spending $2000/mo on housing, I’d spend $500/mo. Instead of $36 for lunch, I’d spend $12.

$6 would be a solid enough tip on a $36 meal, bringing the total to $42. Likewise $2 would be a good tip on a $12 meal, for $14. And it may even be a $6 meal, bringing the tip down to $1, and the meal to $7.

If my lunch costs $7 or $14 instead of $42, but I must endure tipping culture, I don’t see the big problem. My issue is with the cost of living, not with tipping culture, I realised.

Bear in mind, even in places without tipping culture, businesses often surreptitiously add hidden gratuity charges to the bill. IME, unethical business practices don’t just disappear where tipping culture isn’t present.

If I could snap my fingers in Australia for example — where there is no tipping culture— and reduce my rent by 75% and lower the price of food by 80% but it came at the cost of introducing tipping culture to Australia, I’d do it in an instant. I strongly suspect most other people would too."

1,2023-08-26,CMV: The fact that one does not have children should not be used as an argument you are incapable of relating to the stresses associated with familial obligations of that nature.,u/ViolentThespian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/161unp6/cmv_the_fact_that_one_does_not_have_children/,changemyview,"This is a sentiment I've experienced a lot as a young single male. While I do concede the point that I cannot relate to the daily struggles and stresses of having children, in my experience, close familial ties of a similar nature are more than sufficient to relate to the fierce emotions involved with a connection of that level. 

For background, I was raised primarily by my mother. My father was definitely involved in my life and I have a positive relationship with him, but my mother was always at the forefront of any issue I faced. As I call it, I watched her turn 'mama bear' on my and my sister's behalf more times than I could ever hope to count, and those experiences instilled a deep sense of connections to those I consider family (a la Dom Toretto). I can easily say the same of my father as well, as they were both instrumental in my upbringing. Their teachings helped forge the close bond I have with my sister in adulthood. 

Increasingly in my professional career, I've been faced with the sentiment that I cannot understand or even claim to understand the plight faced by parents when it comes to caring for their children, which is something I just cannot accept. From my perspective, having benefitted all my life from the fierce protective instincts of both my parents and the dedication they showed to my wellbeing and maturation, I feel that I can easily reconcile the emotions and perspective my colleagues claim I am unable to."
1,2023-08-26,CMV: Maybe putting homeless people in “tent cities” like Donald trump proposed a year ago is the best way to go about this,u/Goos_Blah_Blah,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/161wq59/cmv_maybe_putting_homeless_people_in_tent_cities/,changemyview,"hello reddit

one year ago Donald trump said we should put homeless people in tent cities outside of major city limits, he said they will have food and medical care and stuff. But that these would be managed homeless camps that would put homeless people out of sight and out of mind from people who have to live around them

[https://time.com/6200821/trump-homeless-tent-cities-2024/](https://time.com/6200821/trump-homeless-tent-cities-2024/)

&#x200B;

the area that i live in wants to try this idea a lot, and has put several proposals in place to possibly make it happen soon, its a wealthy place that wants to enjoy its wealth without having to see the decline of western society . a year ago it sounded horrifying and among the worst things ever proposed. But as a meaningfully employed student who has suffered being homeless for a year due to discrimination and ptsd, i can say maybe this is the only way to manage homelessness at least for the time being. I think Donald trump is not crazy or outrageous to propose a realistic pragmatic approach that is within the realms of reality, which is more affordable housing is not going to happen like anytime soon. Certainly not within the decade, and certainly not by the end of the next. even if congress were to get off their ass and do something about this it would be a very long time until there is enough solution in place to house all homeless people

ive been among the chronically homeless and currently reside in a low barrier shelter, and i can tell you that although being homeless gives me great perspective on the struggles homeless people face, it doesn’t make me sympathetic toward them even when i know their stories in great detail. They are a drain on public resources, many of them are never ever going to be able to contribute to society, and whatever makes people with houses dislike them is double and triple for me. Ive been working 2 jobs to try to get out of this misery and this morning I could not take a shit in the shelter bathroom because the people who live in do things like smear poo on the handle or clock the toilets for the fun of it. there’s a group of people here who actually bring their tv and video game consoles from their homeless shelter bunk bed and into the day area to play video games and drink Mountain Dew all day long. There’s a rule you have to be up during the day so that you’re encouraged to be a productive member of society and some people circumvent this rule by hanging out in the day room all day long. Some people get drunk in the parking lot and some don’t even bother to Hide the drugs they do during the day. theres a breakfast area for residents to get food and some people here are so fucked up from all the dope they’ve done they dip their hands right into the boiled eggs after picking their scabs for 2 or 3 hours. Several people are allowed to bring their dogs whom are the equivalent of living in a third world country in terms of the amount of fleas and shit they leave everywhere where people are supposed to be able to live In peace. I am homeless and even i hate homeless people at this point, an organization was kind enough to donate a portable bathroom to remedy the bathrooms the people here fucked up beyond repair and after getting home from work at 2 am i find people fighting over it. 

I’m speaking as a homeless person, who has eaten pantry food and has sold His shit for bus tickets to work. a tree hugging liberal who has very progressive views. For the time being, i hope Donald trumps proposal passes. I am confident there would be an exception for people with work who don’t do things like leave trash and headache wherever they go to be able to at least utilize shelters in the area. I cannot be criticized at heartless, I’ve been around these people. And trust me nothing would make me happier as a homeless person with 2 jobs to see so many of these really stressful people live in a camp somewhere where they should. a lot of them dont do anything but hang out around the shelter all day long or hang out at a library. We can send books there too. Tent cities are not only a solution for businesses and people with housing, they are a solution for homeless people who don’t bring a bad name to being homeless

1,2023-08-26,CMV: Generative AI is still nothing but a threat and a disgrace to the creative world and creativity itself. I'm not convinced over my previous CMV.,u/BlackHoleEra_123,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/161y3tv/cmv_generative_ai_is_still_nothing_but_a_threat/,changemyview,"I feel like my previous post concerning this was cheaply rebutted by pointing out the tone used in the text and using similar arguments found on Twitter/X that were easily debunked by context and professionals who knew what they were doing. There were 4 or 5 good talking points that find artists' faults BEFORE GenAI happened, but that's about it. Nothing else. There's also one guy that said I was angry over this issue—of course I'm angry, what reaction do you expect when I see artists being bashed and screwed over just because of the introduction of GenAI? Oh wait. It's the 'net. Typical.

Needless to say, I'm not impressed either. There's a lot more I could have done, putting in new issues to apathetic light, or closing holes in an argument like this. This issue is complex well enough that I can't focus on every talking point, and all I can do is rebut with what I have on my brain at the moment. But I came back, looked at my argument representing my view, and I ""upgraded"" it with some quoting and paraphrasing, bringing up things I didn't initially bring up, and refining what I did bring.

GenAI is still the same disgrace as it was, being used to replace artists and animators, scam innocent commissioners, confuse non-artists, its supporters radically defending it flaming, screwing over artists and saying phrases like ""Adapt or Die!"" to them, and don't get me started on the copyright violations, profiteering, and privacy breaches it does, due to how its algorithm gathers data and the way people use it.

The art world has never been in more turmoil because of this technology. Not only that, corpos are trying to lobby politicians to ensure that they can continue using their dangerous tech. Thank goodness for some politicians listening to our issues and workers' strikes concerning this immoral creation.

Because of the way GenAI advocates, or techbros as we call them, and artists just expressing their concerns, it will be very hard for me to listen to the side where GenAI is supported, and even harder, because I looked back, and the professionals just pointed out how terrible your arguments are. Every day, same old phrases. Some artists thought of the S word once this tech encroached onto creative industries. Some artists quit, which is really sad. It's also causing artists and writers to turn to GenAI simply because they saw its ""potential"", and so they start using it, actively defending it the same way techbros do. Per ""AaranTheArtist's"" words: ""I often run into people who say that GenAI software learns, understands, gets inspired, has beliefs, looks at artwork, reads articles. These kinds of ideas result from careless and unclear use of language."" And ""kortizart's"" words: ""A fun thing about generative AI discourse is when AI advocates claim aggrieved artists don’t know how the tech works. But when you ask AI advocates how it works, some anthropomorphized nonsense like “It 'learns' and is 'inspired' just like you!” always creeps up. It’s embarrassing."" This is how techbros defend their use of GenAI, anthropomizing it, which is just overall cringe.

Oh, if this is only about visual art, you're wrong. While StableDiff, NovelAI, and ChatGPT being one of the current dominant algorithms focusing on text2image and text2text generation, there's plans on making similar generation algorithms for music and animation.

If you're thinking of this: ""Oh, it's supposed to be a tool."" No it isn't. It never was actually. The tech was made by corporates without knowledge of the art world and made for profit. Why else would they lobby politicians other than wanting to continue using their generators without ethical vibe checks? Its purpose is to be a replacement, to replace artists. Thank goodness the politicians listened to the artists, and the tech finally being either ethically regulated, or banned. Call me a Luddite if you want, but at least the Luddites fought against automation and job exploitation by destroying all the spinning wheels and looms that were built to destroy their careers. It's why they're called ""elitist"" and their cause being framed as ""anti-technology"" by people, which are similar to what artists are called nowadays. The Luddites are also probably responsible as well for your works to have minimum wages and fair standards today. History, being written by winners, rewrote their story from a workers’ revolt fighting for fair treatment to a narrow-minded war against technological progress and technology itself.

Some people even refuse to pick up a pencil and whatever paper they have and draw, instead paying $40 for a monthly sub service to GenAI. That's enough to buy you what you NEED to make stuff. Instead you choose to blow it over an over-anthropomorphized algorithm with the intention of automating art, which is a mockery of art itself. But of course, you don't care, because ""you can't draw."" It's not hard. There's YouTube tutorials, which are very helpful. There's even FREE hour-long courses you can watch and take, but no, you'd rather pay an algo and type what you want to get a soulless image you'd stroke your ballsack to. ""Oh, but I don't have the time to draw!"" That's exactly the point. Art takes commitment, love, perseverance. It's a fundamental process that GenAI decides to spit on. The only part where art is ""democratized"" is when those dollar signs hit up. That word, democratized. Democratized. Sound familiar? Yeah, this word is used when cryptocurrency and NFTs hit mainstream media, two things that techbros love. Having photocopiers and counterfeiting machines in every house is ""democratizing"" money. ""B-but only the rich are really good at art!"" Maybe. But anyone can do art, rich or poor. You have absolutely no excuse for paying $40+ for GenAI and complaining art is expensive.

Don't compare this with the camera either. Photography is a wholly different medium than art. There's no ironclad evidence that artists were replaced by a damn flashing printing telescope, and even if it did, at least it took time and effort, which GenAI lacks. GenAI users comparing themselves to photographers is just as terrible to them as it is to artists. You technophiles adore progress without looking into how many ethical violations and dangers were in effect during technological... progress.

And I thought automation was supposed to help, not to harm? Automation is the antithesis of art itself. And let's not forget that since it's just an algorithm on steroids, it has a chance to bias and recommend rather than giving you what you want. Why else would their outputs change with the same prompt or give out images of a busty white woman no matter the words you type? And my favorite new reason is that GenAI and its users does not know what art fundamentals and principles are. Takes no skill, time, or patience which attract techbros that love to make a quick buck rather than appreciate well-crafted crafts. And I quote a Tweet by ""Pehdrigues"": ""another fun thing is that artists are actually trying hard to educate themselves on the technical aspects of it, being informed in a field so different from their own, the AI evangelists don't bother trying to understand how we learn art, our craft or even simpl\[e\] ethics."" And yet GenAI users still call themselves artists, as per ""BookSpotlight"" on Twitter: it's not art, it's a prompt in a program processed off other people's artworks. What exactly is an ""AI artist"" doing to make the final result? Absolutely nothing. The algorithm does it for you, and that algorithm is built off other's works. Art's fundamentals, anatomy, color, brushwork, perspective, and art's principles, creativity, time, effort, and messaging... GenAI crushes all these shiny diamonds. These traits are what makes art creative and unique, and excessive automation destroys those traits. And to anyone citing digital art as automation, at least that took a near-equal degree of skill, while GenAI has zero skill whatsoever. As per ""Kelly\_McKernan's"" Tweet, I say: ""The fundamentals of art and principles of design translate across all mediums, all disciplines of art. Skill is adaptive, and if you can draw digitally, you can draw traditionally, with a relatively minor adjustment in technique. GenAI requires no practice, skill, or ability.""

Let's talk ethics. According to various artists on Twitter, a generative algorithm is ethical and safe to use if:

The sources from where processed data was originally acquired is copyright-free, with consent, and compensation.

The algorithm respects privacy.

The algorithm recognizes the word ""no"".

The algorithm is not built with any malicious or problematic intention or motive such as copyright infringement, sudden layoffs for profit, no respect for consent...

Current GenAI violates all of said rules, and therefore, is unethical and built with intent to damage human condition. Per the words of Molly Crabapple in the LA Times: ""There is no ethical way to use the major AI image generators. All of them are trained on stolen images, and all of them are built for the purpose of deskilling, disempowering, and replacing real, human artists."" Speaking of ""deskilling,"" did you know that there is a potential for some of the students in schools to use or have used any one of the current GenAI programs? Oh yeah. I'm talking about dudes that cheat on their essays by using ChatGPT to write it all for them. One such case is a post on Reddit where a student's essay was found to use an ""AI language model"". Didn't even bother editing out the evidence. I'd like to say, because of this happening, some were caught, while others managed to get off easy, letting some even-more-incompetent idiots through our system compared to our slightly-less-incompetent selves back then.

I could go on and on about other things that are blatantly problematic, such as some early forms of GenAI using power equal to 550 tons of CO2 exhausted from power plants. But this is about art, not climate change, and judging by that statement, it's probably outdated at the moment.

In short and conclusion, GenAI is theft, Big Brother, and a terrible digital stalker. Built as a minter, not an art tool. Why else would they make this tech other than money and masturbation?

To artists, as per ""konjak's"" words on Twitter: ""Don't give in to AI. Your creativity is still you. Start now. Continue as you were. Whatever. It's for you, and we also have to wait longer than one year of panic to see how it pans out."" And as per my words, don't give up, keep doing what you love doing, and seek help when needed. To artists like Karla Ortiz, thanks for defending the creative industry.

To GenAI advocates: Teaching children that pressing a few buttons to get a generated image is an equivalent to learning how to draw is literally taking away the gift of art. You just want to replace artists for green strips of paper, treating them like freaks. Artists like Scott Christian Sava tolerated the tech you praised so much, using a generated image as a baseline and inspiration, and screwing over artists is how you repay them? Well guess what? You lose. You need us to make your generators work. You need them for DALL-E 2 to work. Know your place.

I would like to end this argument with this portion of a statement that is the definition of art: Art. Noun. ""The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power."" GenAI does not have that. GenAI damages that definition."
1,2023-08-26,CMV: The seven dwarves are not supposed to be people with dwarfism. It’s idiotic that Disney will not feature dwarves in their remake of Snow White.,u/damndirtyape,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/161yf92/cmv_the_seven_dwarves_are_not_supposed_to_be/,changemyview,"In case you aren't aware, Disney is remaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. But, there are no longer going to be any dwarves. Instead, there are going to be seven magical forest creatures. From what I can tell, Disney is doing this because they think it’s not politically correct to make a movie featuring dwarves. This is idiotic 

**Fantasy dwarves are not people with dwarfism**

Fantasy dwarves are not meant to represent individuals with the medical condition of dwarfism. In fantasy, dwarves are usually depicted as stout, bearded beings, distinct from humans. They don’t have the same proportions as people with the real medical condition. 

Fantasy dwarves are not people with dwarfism any more than giants are people with gigantism. The same goes for gnomes, hobbits, leprechauns, etc. These diminutive beings are distinct creatures, not people with real medical conditions. Santa’s workshop is not staffed by people with dwarfism. 

**How to cast dwarf characters**

Disney is correct for worrying that its problematic to cast people with dwarfism to play fantasy dwarves. Its potentially belittling because it portrays people with a real medical condition as being like silly magical creatures. 

But, this doesn't mean that fantasy dwarves can never appear in movies. It means you shouldn't cast people with dwarfism to play them. You follow the blueprint laid out by Perter Jackson. You cast an ordinary actor, and then you use movie magic to make them shorter. 

**Disney's current casting choices are offensive**

Furthermore, I would say that Disney has not avoided controversy by eliminating references to dwarves. Here's a cast picture:

https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/07/14/12/73212119-12298801-image-a-139_1689332652585.jpg

They've cast at least 1 person with dwarfism to play these magical forest creatures. As I argued above, this is belittling towards people with dwarfism. They are portraying people with a real medical condition as being whimsical creatures. Despite their efforts, I think people can legitimately argue that this movie will be disrespectful towards people with dwarfism. 

Disney has totally misunderstood the nuances of this situation. There would have been no problem if they cast actors in Peter Jackson style costumes to play the dwarves. But, by casting a person with dwarfism to play a magical forest creature, Disney has done something that's actually offensive. They gain nothing by avoiding the word ""dwarf""."

I am always left thinking how powerful it would be if all these people focused their 1-2 hours per week in helping their community (building parks, tutoring school children, helping the needy, pick up litter, whatever is most relevant in their community), instead of talking and preaching about how committed they are to an all benevolent god and that they are all so great for being there and going to heaven etc.

I know some people already do community service and these are not mutually exclusive. But I can’t help but thinking that an ALL BENEVOLENT GOD would rather see millions of people helping their community for a couple of hours every week instead of locked in a building.

Also, the gerrymandered state legislatures are likely going to feel pressure from their constituents to do what they can to keep Democrats out of federal office. For example, if the Dems ever win Texas (which is possible in 2028 if not 24), then I simply don’t think Texas will hold a presidential election ever again, because the state legislature would want to kill any possibility of a Democrat winning the state ever again."

Premise 1: a being who is omnipotent, if they exist, would cause reality to conform to their preferences as best as is conceivably possible 

Premise 2: (per definition), God is omnipotent

Premise 3: The reality that best conceivably conforms to an omnibenevolent being entails the maximum conceivable good for other conscious things, and the minimum conceivable bad for other conscious things.

I've had enough, and thus have hatched a plan to remove every single woman from the face of the earth.   
  
My dedicated team and I have been devising this plan for years. We have been preparing a separate planet, covertly shielded from the public eye by the government, and it should be ready by 2025. This planet is designed to cater to the preferences of women, featuring amenities like shopping centers, an abundance of Pumpkin Spice Lattes, and a plentiful supply of crystals. The intent is not to banish these creatures into an inhospitable environment, but rather, to provide them a haven where they can exist without causing any disruptions.   
  
You may be wondering, how do we intend to gather every female on Earth for this mass migration? The answer is forthcoming...   
  
My team and I have been working on this project for years. It’s been hidden from the public to protect our plan from disruption.   
  
The government has been feed the entire world a specific chemical in our water system for about 30 years. This chemical is named “FemBan-T6363” This is a tasteless, odorless, and colorless edible chemical that when once ingested, the host is able to react to certain radio frequencies. The specific radio frequency we have in our project isn’t available to anyone else. Once we sound this frequency in 2025, the humans who ingested the chemical will become unconscious for about a week. That is plenty of time to gather every woman from the earth and get her ready for transport to the new planet. This chemical manipulates the human body, giving it a weeks worth of nutrition and hydration, while keeping urine and bowel in place.   
  
How will we fit more than 3 billion people in one transportation device? We have been working on an innovative, monumental ship that can fit double the amount of women we need to transport. This ship provides staff, stores, restaurants, and entertainment. The travel time for this size of ship to the new planet is about 5 months. But Rest assured, the women will have everything they need.   
  
So back to earth. Once the chemical has worn off the men of the world will wake up and feel the weight off their shoulders. No more women!   
  
You might be wondering, how about reproduction? We have it covered.   
  
Remember how the chemical “FemBan-T6363” manipulates the human body? Well guess what. Every man now has the ability to get pregnant, as well as their offsprings. Men sex is was better than women sex anyway. There will be 2x more babies born by the year of 2026.   
  
The women can enjoy their time on the ship but once they die off. Then what can ya do?   
  
So world. Are you ready for a better place? I am. #BeReady2025

1,2023-08-26,CMV: Recreational fishing is kinda fucked up,u/MM_me_in_SSBM,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1624xyc/cmv_recreational_fishing_is_kinda_fucked_up/,changemyview,"My Grandpa and I used to go fishing quite a bit, it was fun but I never really got into it as a hobby long term. More than any catch I made I always remembered the fish I put back into the water that didn't make it, or the lures being lodged in their throats and all the blood and damage I caused the fish removing the lure. 

I'm not totally anti fishing but I just can't bring myself to participate in it any longer. It's fun and relaxing but my empathy for the wildlife gets in the way of any enjoyment I could garner from it. 

To outline some of the main deterrents for me :

* Fishing line and lure's breaking off and being left in the ecosystem
* Fish snapping lines and having lures stuck in them for x duration
* Fish swallowing lures deeply and the removal causing (potentially fatal) damage, or leaving lures in and potentially disrupting a fishs eating abilities
* Hooking something that is not your target; Turtles, Catfish, even (rarely) a cormorant, and causing it undue distress and suffering or having to just cut the lure and release it back with a lure in it.**

That is mostly in regards to fresh water, some things that plague my mind when moving to salt water but area also still relevant in fresh : 

* Fighting large fish for 10s of minutes or even hours, draining the fish of it's energy just to get it to the boat, snap a picture, and then release it. This bothers me because I imagine it's already such a cutthroat environment out there that isn't altogether improving. The struggle to find food for yourself among competition and predators. Now some guy with fake food with a hook in it comes by when you're just trying to find a meal, then fights you for hours leaving you exhausted and with nothing to show for it, now you're still hungry and very tired in a harsh environment. 
* Fishing for big fish by essentially just setting a trap via lure or bait with a hook in it, like not reeling or anything. Just strapping a piece of food to a hook and dropping it into the fishes ecosystem until it bites it and is hooked. This appears to me like such a low effort damaging activity.


I feel as though I may be overstating the damaging effects which is likely to be the way to CMV, but it just seems disproportionately harmful to the fish in comparison to the reward the fisherman feels. Catching fish to eat? Ok I can justify that because there's no way to pretend that you're not hurting the fish, you are, you are killing and eating it. But recreational sport fishing, catch and release, just to say you caught a fish? Fish are dumb...I just never caught a fish and felt super good about myself for having done it, but I have caught a fish that died because of me and felt bad about it. I was just trying to have fun with a hobby I don't want to worry about killing something in my hobby."

And this is coming from somebody who has student loans. It’s common sense that before you choose a major, you’re supposed to research the job prospects. If you choose a major with bad job prospects, it’s nobody’s fault but yours. I chose to major in finance because it has good job prospects. Many companies have a finance department and thus are in need of financial analysts. I don’t see many companies being in need of somebody with an anthropology or German studies degree. It’s a fact that certain degrees aren’t valuable in the job market. I have no sympathy for those people when they complain about not being able to secure decent employment. It’s laughable that they want the taxpayers to pay their loans because they can’t. The taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay for your bad decisions."

Fuck people who say your standards are too high, or people who tell you're bossy, etc etc etc. 

Independence is whatever you want it to be, but the fact that you no longer need oppressive financial support is a feat.

For people who don't want to be independent (for whatever reason), that is also okay, but I would question why you feel OK with stripping yourself of autonomy. I am not judging the decision, but it is worthwhile to understand your motives.

Independence is challenging to maintain, so, to my last point, I understand why some may falter to old ways of existing. Still, the fact that the opportunity exists and is openly available is incredible.

One of the primary reasons I am proud of independent women is that it is still more challenging to live as a cis het woman than a cis het man. The systems we exist within still shoulder men strongly, and women, even though it is possible, struggle DEEPLY, and I respect the grit it takes to stand on your own two feet. No wonder dating is hard for everybody at the moment. No one knows what to make of this extraordinary historical development, and I am all for it. 

The most controversial view I have, in all of this, and one that will stir the most argument, is that the idea of male as gender is becoming obsolete.

What have men been and represented throughout history, if not oppressor and aggressor, towards those of lesser class and status? A man working a retail job still has more social sway, generally, than a highly paid professional woman in regards to the crevices of the legal system and functioning modes of normalcy we abide by. Their opinions are respected, and their minds and points of view garner respect on the simple basis of them being male. His voice is more valid than hers, even if she is a lawyer, doctor, what have you. 

I will not entertain the notion that the gender pay gap is not real based on “personality differences” espoused by Manosphere figureheads like Jordan Peterson. It is real, and it is dangerous. 

The means of maleness are stale and rotten. What have they functioned as if not a means to control? Do I believe all men are stale and rotten? Hell no, but if you ask a man how he feels about being a man, he will not respond in kind, even if his troubles in life don't correlate directly with being a man. 

Men's lives are challenging, but not due to them BEING men, whereas any marginalized group's lives are actively harder due to them NOT being men. It is irrational and needs to be different.

That is, frankly, one of the reasons independent women inspire me so much. The amount of backlash you face against your humanity every day inspires me to be better and raise my expectations of myself and others. 

You are changing the fabric of reality, and I think you're great.

They use real food ingredients like simple chicken, steak, cheese, tomatoes, onions, and tortillas. It's not like some other places where you wonder what's actually in your meal. When I'm looking for healthy options, Taco Bell is my go-to choice.  
  
I mean, of course, I'm not talking about indulging in a Nachos Bell Grande or anything like that. Let's be real here. But if you want something lighter, you can go for a soft chicken taco, and guess what? It'll only set you back about 180 calories. And the best part is, it's made with real food, not some mystery ingredients.  
  
I had this argument with a guy who claimed that McDonald's is healthier than Taco Bell. Seriously?... Taco Bell beats McDonald's hands down when it comes to healthiness. They offer so many options if you're watching your calories, carbs, or just want something overall healthy.  
  
So, if you ask me, when I'm trying to cut back and eat healthier, Taco Bell is where it's at. They've got a variety of choices that won't leave you feeling guilty, and you can actually enjoy a meal that tastes good. It's a win-win situation, in my opinion."

Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia are located in East Africa, but that doesn't make the people that live there Black.  Historically, the people in those countries have intermarried with Middle Easterners and that's why they have silky hair, straight noses, light skin, and small lips.  

To be a person that is classified as Black, one must have a flat nose, kinky hair, and full lips at the very least.  Furthermore, one must not have ancestry from Asia, Europe, South America, etc.  

There should be another race category that describes East Africans.  They are not fully Bantu, but they're not fully Middle Eastern either.  Genetic studies support my belief.

I believe that what happened to Native Americans was a horrific genocide. I'm an elementary school teacher and 5th grade curriculum in my state covers European explorer and colonist interaction with Native Americans, and early United States history. I teach the reality (in an age appropriate way) that Native Americans weren't treated very well. So I have no issue with the motivation behind making a land acknowledgement. But how they function in reality is a different story. 

My experience is that land acknowledgements are performative nonsense, that do not actually respect Native American history nor modern Native American communities. 

Here are the reasons why:

1) I have admittedly very limited experience with Native American people, but I have never seen an actual Native American person do one or ask for one. 

2) It seems like easy to say words, without any actions. I.e. the definition of performative. 

3) Last year I had a Native American student in my class, her parents were professors of Native American studies. They visited my class to explain about Native American culture and music. They did not do a land acknowledgement. So seems like they didn't feel it was important. 

4) I've seen countless times people do it to pretend to be progressive while taking actions that I view as horrible. [REI CEO did a land acknowledgement while trying to union bust.](https://jacobin.com/2022/02/rei-union-busting-podcast-land-acknowledgment-liberals/) A week ago the school board where I live (San Francisco) did one before having a meeting on how to close a bunch of schools in the poorest, most black area of San Francisco (which ironically also had the largest communities of Ohlone Native Americans before Europeans came).

5) There is a plaque about Ohlone land acknowledgement in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco, one of the more expensive neighborhoods in one of the more expensive cities in the entire country. Meanwhile Native Americans have one of the lowest average household income of any group in the USA. Instead of making housing affordable to working class people so actual Native Americans can live here the city put up a nice plaque so the rich settlers who live there can have a ""fun fact"" about their neighborhood. 

I'm struggling to see these land acknowledgements as anything more than a  shibboleth of faux progressivism, with no actual substance. "

It seems to me for young people with significant student loan debt (premiums of 500+ a month) it is best to just ignore the loans and go into default. 

First, it is unlikely that anything will happen to one’s assets. It is very hard and near impossible for these companies to garnish your wages or “repo” your assets. Such actions are extremely rare, and even though, many people do not even have assets to be garnished. 

Second, is opportunity cost. The money one would be putting into loans could literally make someone a millionaire over the longterm by instead placing it into a broker account buying up shares of SPY.

Thirdly, defaulting on these loan can only affect your credit score for seven years. So at the time most people are ready to buy a house, their default will not have affected them (and they will have much more principle to put down from having not paid). 

[For those who may attempt a moral argument, this should be solely a financial decision. The companies who make these loans are very arguably practicing usury on literal high school students, and rewarding such actions is very arguably the more substantial ethical issue]"

Saw this headline regarding an elementary school who it implementing LGTBQ reading in their curriculum. Initially the school allowed parents to opt out but changed the policy requiring it. Two things stood out to me.

>Initially parents could choose to opt their children out of reading and learning about the material.  
>  
>In March, however, the school board instituted a new policy stripping parents of that right.

My question: why? This is an elementary language arts meaning the purpose of the subject is to improve children's speech, grammar and comprehension skills. This is can and has been done with numerous books for decades. There are tens of thousands of books that accomplish the goal of teaching children grammar by not including any form of sexuality, such as books about friendship and anthropomorphic animals going on adventures   By not only implementing, but forcing LGTBQ content (which is inherently based on sexuality) into the curriculum it serves no purposed other than to push a message. This same thing also applies to other topics such as religion. For example, if there was a Christian children's book used to teach about language arts parents should be able to opt out of it because the choice to use that book would be for no other reason than to promote Christianity.

This is mainly for younger grades and foundational classes where this content isn't directly related to the subject. For example once you get to high school where you have a choice of classes you can't just pick a class then choose participate in which lessons you want.

To me this creates a good learning environment free of unnecessary drama where the focus is on providing children a proper education "

Nazism is not a singular, coherent philosophy and individual self-identified Nazis typically make up as they go along. For example, today a lot of Neo-Nazis exist in Slavic countries, while completely ignoring the fact that original Nazis considered Slavs to be “subhumans”. Fascist Mussolini, as late as 1930s still maintained that there was no such thing as a pure Aryan, and after he was a self-declared fascist, he was still vowing to stand against anti-semitism. What I am trying to show is that Neo-Nazism isn’t a movement where some kind of ideological commitment needs to exist. It’s a DIY, make-up-as-you-go-along nonsense. Original Nazi views (like fixation on Germany and Nordicism, Racism against Slavs, obsession with skull shapes and ear shapes) are ignored and each individual Nazi group has its own made up philosophy that isn’t even trying to keep up with original Nazism.

Meanwhile, we have two nuclear states that are communist and we have them actively committing genocides (China against Uyghurs etc). Communism is a coherent, identifiable philosophy. 

Communism is also inherently violent. Engels, Marx, Lenin and all mainstream communists have always and still regularly continue to advocate for violence and harshly criticize pacificists as “centrists”. In fact, Communists use the term “reformist” derogatorily to refer to those people who reject violently overthrowing those governments

While such instances may prevent pregnancy, they don't negate the person's inherent female identity. 


In simple terms, the notion that biological women can get pregnant is a characteristic linked to their reproductive system. On the other hand, biological men can't get pregnant. This difference doesn't take away from the female identity of people who, because of accidents, can't get pregnant anymore. Their female identity was already established before the accident happened. The point that I'm trying to make is that there are people who can get pregnant (otherwise known as women) and individuals who cannot get pregnant (otherwise known as men). If an individual cannot get pregnant, then they are a man (with the exception that, as I stated earlier, a woman with a medical condition that interferes with her ability to become pregnant) This is why trans women are not women, because they are not of the nature to get pregnant."

I wanna start off by making this very clear, I’m not a boomer who stands strongly by owning firearms for hunting. I believe the 2nd Amendment is in place for two reasons, those being: (1. Defense of self, property, and family. (2. Being the only ACTUAL check and balance against corrupt, and tyrannical overreach. I myself believe it to be objectively true that those with immense power will have their way, no matter what you say or do if they please to do so. I believe it’s willful ignorance to say that the government truly has their populations best interest in mind in this current political climate. Just a few days ago our former president has basically been confirmed to take part in meddling with election results. I add this because I don’t want you to misconstrue me for a right wing MAGA cultist either, which I am not. I’m simply just a man who wants life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all those who may seek it. Every man, woman, (Respectfully, insert any gender orientation you please) has an inalienable right to pursue these things we hold close.

It has been shown repeatedly throughout history that events such as the Holocaust and many others have started with gun control being a major factor in these objectively horrific events. I do not believe our government officials, whether Democrat or Republican have any care for our well being and only are interested in ways to gain and keep power. Every single politician in my eyes are scum, they are the morally lowest human beings to exist coming in second only to sex criminals, hate criminals, serial killers, and child murderers

It’s not like I haven’t experienced what firearms are capable of either, I have served in the US Army as a Scout, and have done my part in the civilian world in Emergency Medical Services in a very large urban, gang ridden environment. Even with all the mass shootings, all of the things I have seen, I still cannot reason with restricting access to firearms such as an Armalite rifle (No matter it’s chambering i.e 300./5.56/7.62/etc.)

The world is a very, very, ugly place right now. It’s one that I have seen with my own eyes. There are legitimately people who have never even met you, who will kick your door down, and kill you brutally by any means necessary for their own reasons. They will do it with their bare hands, blunt objects, and firearms. The indiscriminate violence humans are capable of used to shock me, but now I’ve sort of become conditioned to it. People seem to think we live in a fantasy land where people won’t hurt you but that’s just not true. 

With that being said, I truly mean it when I say that this is a right I am willing to give my life for. As of now, I will never comply with any government order to relinquish my firearms. I will never take part in any action to strip any other person of any background, race, or creed of that same right. If it comes down to it, I will die defending my right to bear arms with the same mentality, and actions that I carried during my time in service. I care too much about my wife, my daughter, and my own well being to be trampled over by whoever wishes to do so. 

However, I am not one to stick my head into the sand so I am all ears for anyone to attempt at changing my viewpoint, and at the least help me understand why people are willing to give up such an important right."

I just finished playing Sekiro for god knows what time on ng+ 6 and was thinking what made Sekiro so much more fun (and harder) than dark souls then I looked back into the bosses and checkpoint system

In dark souls the bosses are not very difficult, the patterns are easily learned and attacks obviously telegraphed.

Actually count to yourself how many times you’ve died to a boss directly, and not the hordes of enemies before the boss/running back to the boss 

What makes it *seem* so hard is the tedium of having to run back to a boss taking 3+ minutes just to get back to the boss. Let me give you an example, the bell gargoyles: in this fight the patterns are obvious and attacks easy to dodge for the most part easily doable in <5 tries. However what makes it seem so hard is starting at tue bonfire having to run up the stairs walk into the church go up more stairs with an annoying enemy run through a field of zombies and then climb up 2 ladders just to fight the boss again which easily takes 3 minutes 

This is not fun, nor makes the boss more difficult it’s just tedious. 

Where in Sekiro the bosses have countless attacks and combos that while telegraphed are still difficult to counter effectively. Comparing the first main bosses of Sekiro Gyobu Oniwa, to the first real boss of dark souls the taurus demon the difference in difficulty is massive

The taurus demon is slow moving with obvious patterns, where as in Sekiro you walk into a field and this guy on a horse is running rings around you with all sorts of fast attacks

When you die to Gyobu (which will happen a lot on your first run) you go back around 10 seconds just to an area just outside the arena. Compared to the Taurus demon where you go *all* the way back to the beginning of undead burg making it a slog. The Taurus demon is easy, most of the ds1 bosses are mechanically easy, the long run backs are what make them seem so hard

People claim the subsequent souls games have gotten easier (ds3 and elden ring specifically) when all they did was add more frequent checkpoints and in my opinion more mechanically difficult bosses. The run backs became much shorter and thus the games were actually fun 

Look at Margit the fell omen the first boss of elden ring, if you die to him you go just outside the arena instead of all the back to the beginning of limgrave making him actually fun to conquer."
1,2023-08-27,Cmv: If it's socially unacceptable to talk down on a woman for being overweight then it should equally be frowned upon to talk down on a man for being broke.,u/Actual_Parsnip4707,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/162jzw6/cmv_if_its_socially_unacceptable_to_talk_down_on/,changemyview,"So as we know its heavily frowned upon to downtalk women for being overweight. There's even a positivity movement to help uplift these women and you'll see magazine covers or ""plus size models"" to try to make these women feel better about themselves. Now I believe this stems from lots of women being insecure about their looks and that there is societal pressure for women to look a certain way or be thin. Fair enough. Because all in all I would agree that women are primarily judged through their physical appearance almost more than anything else so I would understand why it'd be frowned upon to talk down upon the ones who don't fit a certain beauty standard aka fat women.

But men are primarily judged by the money they make and what they produce to the world. And in my opinion it's far more socially acceptable to talk down on a man for being broke. Statements like, ""you're a bum"", ""you live in your mothers basement,"" and so many others are thrown at men who aren't financially successful. And it's perfectly okay to openly say ""I don't hang with broke dudes"" and downright belittle men who might be struggling when it comes to money. If you're a man who's all grown up perhaps in his 30s or older and still lives with his mom he's going to be looked down upon, made fun of and shamed by many. 

But here's my view. Because both of these are standards that each gender are judged by primarily. It makes no sense to be okay with belittling one gender while simultaneously uplifting the other for its inadequacies to uphold those standards. If you're going to condemn a man for openly making fun of or even just merely stating he doesn't find fat women attractive. It should apply the same way if a woman or anyone else would be little a man for being broke, having no ambition etc. 

I would argue it's much harder to make money and ""pull yourself by your bootstraps"", than it is to lose weight and maintain a healthy body image. Because weight loss is all about how much calories you take in vs how much you burn. Every single person, unless you're being force fed, makes a conscious decision of what and how much food they put into their own mouth. If you're constantly eating fast food, sugary items and just caloricly dense food in general that's entirely on you. And you have the power to make better food choices. However a person that's not financially well off could be attributed to many factors. Could they just be lazy? Sure. But the economy, their skill set, access to education, the job market and so many other factors can play into a persons ability to make money. Because we living in a capitalistic society there's bound to be winners and losers and inevitably there's going to be certain people at the bottom. So because of this I think it's far more out of a persons control about how much money they can make vs how many calories they decide to stuff into their own mouth. 

Like there's a body positivity movement that's gone mainstream for women as of recent. You have fat activists like Tess holiday and lizzo trying to bring acceptance to overweight bodies in women. But there's no acceptance movement for broke dudes. Why is this? As I said before women are judged harshly on looks and beauty while men are judged on their none and status: so because these are the standards that each gender are pressured to adhere to I see no logical reason to be okay with shaming on gender for not adhering to their standards while trying to uplift the other for not being able to do the same thing.

1,2023-08-27,CMV: Physical Attractiveness is one of the Key Influences on Quality of Life in the Western World,u/EnigmaticEmissary,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/162l66o/cmv_physical_attractiveness_is_one_of_the_key/,changemyview,"Physical attractiveness significantly impacts quality of life in the Western world. While not the sole factor, it plays a pivotal role in social interactions, professional success, and romantic relationships.

  
For instance, in appearance-conscious societies, attractive individuals often receive more positive attention, leading to better social connections and a sense of belonging. The most popular kids at school are often the ones who are the most physically attractive. Moreover, physical appearance can influence initial impressions and career opportunities, particularly in roles involving client interactions or leadership positions. 

When it comes to romantic relationships, facial attractiveness can facilitate initial attraction, affecting the dating experience and potential for meaningful relationships. Being very attractive essentially means you can date whoever you want within reason, while being unattractive leads to involuntary celibacy in many cases.

What is more, media's portrayal of beauty standards affects self-esteem, impacting confidence, and opportunities for those conforming to these standards. Perceived attractiveness can also boost self-confidence, fostering personal growth and a positive feedback loop. When you are attractive you will hear it often and thus become more confident, while unattractive people will rarely receive compliments.

While it's clear that many factors contribute to an individual's quality of life, facial attractiveness undoubtedly wields a considerable influence in the Western world. From shaping social interactions and professional opportunities to impacting romantic relationships and personal confidence, the role of appearance cannot be dismissed in my opinion.

But it seems very clear to me that there should be equality or safe spaces are political statements. We are literally having political debates on these subjects.

First of all, both my parents and my partners parents are all dicks. My parents raised me in an old fashioned way that probably has not helped with avoiding forming this worldview. 

But past that, I just hate the world they have created. They grew up in a time where housing was cheaper and when the climate wasn't dying. That'd be fine on it's own, but most old people seem to be incapable of understanding how that isn't the case anymore. They vote for corrupt leaders who are also old who get into power and make my life more difficult. I can't help but fantasize about old people dying off so that we can finally get some justice. 

The future is a 4 day work week, and some sort of wfh/hybrid. Yet who is keeping these jobs from happening? Old fashioned managers. These shitty warehouse manufacturing jobs, who runs them? Old folk. Old people are genuinely ruining this society and making things worse in my eyes. 

I go to the supermarket and the only people I see complaining nowadays are people above 50. They are screaming at the retail workers ""How dare you add a self-checkout? Open up a till or I'm not shopping here again!"" They are such an entitled generation and have the gull to say to us that we're the snowflakes. They are ruining everything, this society, our planet, and they don't care because they got theirs when they were younger so fuck everyone else. They are inherently the worst of humanity, greedy and selfish.

It's rare I've come across sweet old people which is probably not helping, but I can't help but think about how if there is a sweet old lady, she probably is transphobic or racist or homophobic in some way. I don't get what's so hard about changing your perspective as the world grows up. It's all I've done my entire life. God help me if I ever get to that age and I stop questioning how things work. It's lazy and it's fucking us all over.

I realize this is probably wrong, and I'm looking for some counter-arguments to help me think a little more rationally.

Now let’s take 25 random people and stick them in a room with a view to discuss the implications of politics in modern day society.

Realistically what’s the criteria here for having something to say? I’d imagine 80% of people will be parroting views and opinions they’ve heard elsewhere, mostly presented to them in a concise form (tiktok etc) in an echo chamber environment. What’s even worse is a decent % of people might not even truly believe what they say, they’re just regurgitating what they perceive to be the more intelligent side of the argument without doing and thinking themselves. This leads to a lack of knowledge on a subject so when they’re challenged by somebody better educated with a different view than themselves they’re unable to debate so they default to claims of ‘cancel him!’ Etc secure in the knowledge they have the moral high ground and their logic is infallible. Obviously the challenger now feels they haven’t been listened to or their POV respected and disregards the lazy response. 

My opinion is that the average persons views on the majority of subjects are a complete waste of time. The political science graduate in the corner with a bookshelf of acquired theoretical and historical knowledge just winces at the BS being thrown around on both sides and the schpiel they’re voicing

Politics is just an example here, replace with climate change / race / hell even sports teams, anything that tends to get people emotional in a discussion.

Dave the plumbers views on politics are interesting on a personal level but surely by choosing to voice his views to strangers on a subject he’s unqualified in he’s being immoral, or at least irresponsible?"

I’ve held this view for quite some time and am much more pro labor now. But at least I think this is unethical behaviour. I’m not sure if any kind of abuse potential would warrant potentially passing laws that could hurt women in other ways

IP is definitely a reason to pay more for an actor, but if they are worried about the rest of the crew, they can also take less money and still be filthy rich. There’s a skewed cultural acceptance of people with faces we like, that allow us to “forgive” and look past the fact that these admirable people make many more multiples in salary and benefits then everyone else taking responsibility in making production happen. Rather than level the wage, everyone is fighting for more and more money. Eventually that money is capped and no one can possibly make more.

1,2023-08-27,CMV: Black Lives Matter and All Lives Matter actually agree,u/Dazzling_Policy9025,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/162qpds/cmv_black_lives_matter_and_all_lives_matter/,changemyview,"When talking and thinking about the discussion of All Lives Matter (ALM) vs Black Lives Matter (BLM), I've come to a conclusion and would like to hear others' thoughts.

**Here is a basic overview of what I believe**

* BLM misses ALM's message of ""all lives genuinely matter,"" and instead pin ALM as a white supremacist group
* ALM misses BLM's message of ""all lives genuinely matter,"" and instead pin BLM as a riot/terrorism/reverse-racist group
* The misconstruing of messages may or may not be intentional. I can't say for sure whether misrepresenting ALM or BLM is a strategic/planned move by smart politicians, or if it is just a product of the 24-hour news cycle, doomscrolling, and twitter arguments.
* At the end of the day, BLM and ALM both fundamentally believe that all lives should matter equally. While both sides agree, they hate each other largely due to party lines and/or other cultural differences.
* I acknowledge that both sides have those that will weaponize their cause. BLM absolutely has some opportunistic looters and reverse-racists. ALM absolutely has some racists and people that want to destroy the BLM movement. I believe that neither of these groups make up a majority of their respective movement. We ought to evaluate movements based on the majority of their constituents, not the minority causing trouble. The weaponizing minority (that commit crimes) should be arrested and put in trial just like any other criminal would be.
* I believe it is almost certainly true that ALM was made as a reaction to the growing BLM movement. Still though, I think the intentions were pure: to create more inclusive language. Has it since been utilized to put down the BLM movement? Definitely, but my CMV is not about how damaging either side has actually been. Rather, it is about the fact that both of these movements actually agree and that the difference is just semantics.

**How I came to this view**

Just to get any personal biases out of the way, I am a member of GenZ in the USA, and I would consider myself on the left of the political spectrum.

Based on the discourse I see between right and left, it seems that both sides say the same thing: All lives matter equally. And yet, both sides paint each other as horrible movements that are trying to put down others and/or cause crime. My brain can't fully process this clear mismatch, so I've largely chalked it up to the continuing division between left and right (which is a CMV for another day).

When Vivek said on the GOP debate stage, I found his statement that ""reverse racism IS racism"" as a super interesting illustration of this notion. It is leveraging the fact that BLM is portrayed as a movement that supports minorities \*\*over\*\* the oppressors, or the whites. Vivek is alluding to the notion that BLM (or perhaps the left as a whole) is supportive of or at least indifferent to racism towards white people. Yet, every time I bring this up to a leftist, they make it very clear that ""No, BLM is about all races being equal. Not about putting down white people."" I have yet to find a single person who genuinely believes reverse racism is okay, BLM or not. And while I'm sure they exist, my argument is that this is a minority that inappropriately weaponizes the movement. If someone weaponizes the movement to put down whites, they should not be a part of BLM since they clearly missed the point.

Similarly, if I even think of bringing this argument up to a BLM supporter, I know I would get grilled for it. The moment I utter the words ""ALM has a point, common ground can be made"" the rest of my sentence would likely get grilled for it. I believe this is because the left seems to have painted ALM as a violent white supremacist movement. While there are almost certainly white supremacists that support ALM, I would also argue these people make up a minority and are unfairly weaponizing the movement to advance their own personal racist views. When speaking to my right-wing friends, their issues with BLM always come down to blocking roads, looting towns, and other crime. When it does involve race, it is usually the common misunderstanding that ""BLM is reverse racist and wants minorities to be above historic oppressors.""

At the end of the day, these two movements are saying the exact thing. Every life matters the same amount, no matter the color of your skin.

That is my set of experiences that led me to come to my conclusion. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to further elaborate on my view. Thanks for reading, now change my view!

You can go in literally any thread where one man's negative actions are the topic of discussion, and the comment section will be completely filled with overly broad, negative and false generalizations towards half the world.   
by overly broad, negative and false generalizations, I mean women in the comments are taking the actions of one or a few men and then implying or directly saying that every single man that has ever existed is that same way or possesses those same negative qualities; and these are literally, by far, the highest upvoted comments. The comments will always include statements such as: ""Men are this.."", ""Men are that..."" or ""Men always do this..."".  
One of the worst examples I've seen was in a post that reached near the top of popular a few weeks ago. It was a woman discussing how she had went on a first date with a guy. She said how the date went extremely well and there was an instant connection, but at the end of the date where they got physical and she stopped things before they finished. As she was leaving he made one single comment jokingly that he had blue balls. virtually every single comment in the entire post was absolutely demonizing the dude and saying she should never contact him again. That sentiment is already over the topic, but probably close to half those comments were simultaneously saying blue balls wasn't even a real thing and men just used it to manipulate women. That's akin to a bunch of dudes coming together and saying period cramps aren't real and are just used for manipulation. Absolutely insane lol."

Not to discount or shame, I just don’t know the journey.

I think for men, sex is something that is hard to achieve if you are not naturally endowed with certain characteristics. Specifically, naturally good social skills and attractiveness. I would say if you were just born being a natural extrovert who’s good at talking, funny, and/or good looking, sex isn’t going to be difficult for you to find. Like at that point you’re he blueprint for the men woman want to have sex with.

It becomes an accomplishment for those of us who aren’t naturally built like that and have to develop those skills and work an uphill battle to go against natural selection trying to weed our genes out in order to have sex.

Developing these skills and learning how to affectively use them takes time and is incredibly difficult. Me personally, I just graduated cum laude with a Computer science degree and a double minor in mathematics and political science as well as doing four years of an ROTC program and I feel that the four years of hard work I put into that was easier than talking to women, especially given I’m still a virgin but I have my degree. Some of us just naturally not built for it, and we need to strengthen ourselves for it.

If you’re a naturally shy, uncharismatic, and introverted person you’re the exact opposite of a guy that’s successful with women and you need to damn near fully renovate your personality in order to be successful. Being able to do this and then being able to reap the fruits of all of that hard work, is an accomplishment."
1,2023-08-27,CMV: The Saudi league has the potential to ruin what makes football special,u/trashmemes22,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/162smew/cmv_the_saudi_league_has_the_potential_to_ruin/,changemyview,"Saudi Arabia in the first year of their project has landed ronaldo, benzema, neymar and is prying more and more top talents away from Europe due to the financial wealth of its football owners. With this wealth and attention going to the Saudi league and the insane offer to Mbappe its scary to think that this league could be a rival destination to the prem, la liga serie a etc for a player . This level of wealth and domination is what the prem has done for years by attracting African and South American talent. my problem isn’t with another non European league rivalling Europe as that would be hypocritical. It’s that soulless artificial league is prying football away from leagues and clubs with 100s of years of history. In most major European leagues each football club has its own distinct culture and history.People are diehard fans for teams in the third divisions their club is a staple of that community . Sure, the prem may have a large international reach of fans who aren’t English but at-least those fans are becoming part of clubs with years of history and at-least some semblance of the working class history of the sport remains in the culture around these clubs. Compare that to Saudi Arabia where this sport is being used as a political tool for the Saudi government, it is compared to European football  a bland artificial and soulless football culture. If the Brazilian league for instance suddenly acquired this much wealth and potential I wouldn’t be mad because Brazil is a football mad country with years of history and passion in their clubs. It’s called the beautiful game because it’s history and passion is what in my opinion makes it the best sport on the planet. With the potential to steer football towards an artificial league this could well be the end of football as we know it. While in no doubt the transformation has been impressive and the league is very well put together compared to Chinese league or mls it will never be the same as European football."
1,2023-08-27,CMV: Authenticity is amoral.,u/swagonflyyyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/162smv4/cmv_authenticity_is_amoral/,changemyview,"Every once in a while I think about the relationship between the authenticity of a person and the moral value of their actions. There are many famous examples of individuals, both good and evil, who seem to be considered authentic, regardless of the moral value of their actions and there are examples of people who are dishonest and not authentic, who seem to earn less respect than an evil but authentic individual. 

Please note during this post that I do not condone the evil actions of these individuals. I'm just trying to explore this idea further and trying to understand the value of authenticity.

Let's explore the value of authentic individuals in different areas of life and on different spectrums of morality:

1 - Rappers - Some of the most famous examples of authentic rappers would be Eminem and Tupac. Regardless of being street or not, they make good music with their own style that resonates with a certain crowd and alienates others. But regardless of how much people love or hate their music, everyone agrees that these rappers are authentic in their own way. Even if an individual despised these rappers, they can't ignore the talent that they had in the industry and they certainly will respect them more than a rapper that is trying to imitate their voice and style. 

2 - Warmongers - Individuals like Napoleon Bonaparte and Genghis Khan have left a lasting impact in history by their actions that have been felt generations later. However, Genghis Khan and his empire murdered millions in his conquests by annihilating entire cities to the ground in order to achieve military success and intimidating opposition. Despite these atrocities, Genghis Khan was renowned for his military success, the innovations his empire brought and how it changed the landscape in Asia and beyond. 

Napoleon was a power-hungry conqueror who wanted to bring France to power and he was never going to stop, forcing Europe to form a coalition against him in an effort to stop him. His hubris led to his eventual downfall but he is still remembered as one of the most successful military generals of all time, using his creativity to defeat his opponents many times over until he faced a disastrous campaign in Russia and his eventual defeat in Waterloo. 

3 - Political figures - Hitler's actions were so extreme they were historically unique. The world is right to condemn his actions and take steps to prevent it from happening ever again. Regardless, deep down, people really did respect Hitler's authenticity as he genuinely believed in his racial superiority over the Jews. While there is a Neo-Nazi movement after his eventual death, there has not been a single leader that had the same level of authenticity as Hitler, looking more like dishonest opportunists than genocidal tyrants. I even saw a meme many years a go from a *non-Nazi* that compared the hairstyle and uniform of a Nazi to a broken, trashy look of a Neo-Nazi. 

Donald Trump is also another example of an evil but authentic person. He does whatever he can to get ahead and win. He is genuinely narcissistic in a lot of ways and he doesn't do much to hide it. He is a liar, yes, but he is aware of that and he knows how to play the game. He knows exactly what he's doing. But then you see other Republican candidates on the far-right side of the spectrum trying to mimic and copy him in order to gain votes but they come across as inauthentic and opportunistic. Even Trump's opponents agree that these people don't compare to Trump himself, which tells me they don't really understand how Trump works.

4 - Fictional characters - The Joker is renowned for his random, psychopathic behavior and his lack of remorse and empathy. He stood out as The Clown Prince of Crime who enjoyed torturing other's minds in an attempt to break them. Along came the New Joker in Batman Beyond who was a pale imitation of the original Joker, which was pointed out in the film. This Joker does not laugh out of joy, but out of spite and intimidation as this joker actually does not enjoy laughter due to the pain and trauma associated with it in his past. He is also very insecure, he doesn't like being laughed at and over time he is unraveled as just another bad guy doing bad things with an agenda. This turned out to be a very disappointing realization for both the New Batman and presumably the audience.

So my question is, if people respect the authenticity of an individual regardless of the morality of their actions, then does that mean that authenticity is amoral? Or does it mean that authenticity is the greatest virtue that supersedes all the other virtues and vices? Or is authenticity just another value in the spectrum of morality, since everyone's morality is within shades of gray, having some virtues and some vices? 

And finally, why do people respect authenticity even if it comes from a person they fear and hate? "

Imagine someone buying the rights to Mona Lisa only to make sequel paintings of poop next to it. would people consider them part of Leonardo da Vinci's creation? I hope not. (now I'm not saying Disney is this bad I'm just getting my point across).

When George Lucas sold Starwars to Disney, he had a plan and plot for 3 new Starwars movies. these movies got rejected by the now Starwars owners, so we will never see what the original creator had planned. instead we got fanfiction.

The definition of a fan fiction is ""fiction written by a fan of a particular franchise"" instead of the original creator. Rian Johnson & J J Abrams are self proclaimed fans, and had no participation in George Lucas movies. 

Now Fanfictions tend to show some amateurish/unprofessional tendencies such as: 

1. Out of Character Behavior
2. Resurrecting characters meant to stay dead
3. Plagiarism & Use of Clichés
4. Ignoring Established Lore
5. Rushed/ unsatisfying endings

Disney's Starwars tick all these boxes (and more). I also don't think I'm surprising anyone by saying they're made with the intent of money and not art. Thats why they went with safe retro movies instead of georges intended continuation.

(quick side note on Starwars legends (books before Disney). that wasn't canon either. George only considered the saga and the clone wars canon.)

Now I'm not saying people cant enjoy these movies. I like rouge one and first 2 seasons of Mandalorian. but its still fan fiction, and the intended continuation of Starwars by Lucas seems to be lost forever."

I'll start by giving a few links to establish what I'm talkin' about here. I'm gonna use links from sources that are anti-GMO (I am pro-GMO) as much as possible so as to prime your perspective on the argument. What can I say.

[GMO Timeline: A History of Genetically Modified Foods](https://www.greenamerica.org/blog/gmo-timeline-history-genetically-modified-foods)

[[Organic 101: What Organic Farming and Processing Doesn't Allow - USDA](https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2011/12/16/organic-101-what-organic-farming-and-processing-doesnt-allow)

[""GE Food and Your Health""](https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/issues/311/ge-foods/ge-food-and-your-health)

GMOs have been around for decades at this point. GMOs are a marked departure from conventional breeding and this raised incredible amounts of fear when they came about. At the same time period the anti-vax movement was starting and general scientific fear abounded (the aids epidemic, cloning, fetal stem cells, etc). So, basically everyone who co-opted every one of those movements co-opted anti-GMO.

But it's been like 35 years by now, come onnnnn. **No one** has died. Meanwhile millions of people starve globally every year and are denied life saving resources like drought resistant crops.

Even worse, one of the original authors of the anti GMO movement has completely recanted, the same as the anti-vax guy did. Anti-vax may still persist in the public but GMO has managed to actually affect policy.

> “I apologize for having spent several years ripping up GM crops,” he said. “I am also sorry that I helped to start the anti-GM movement back in the mid 1990s, and that I thereby assisted in demonizing an important technological option which can be used to benefit the environment.”

[Per Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/aaronperlut/2013/07/09/mark-lynas-from-gmo-hater-to-supporter/)

Now on to the subject of Organics:

That link up there should have made it pretty clear that Organics is more about the ethical treatment of animals, sustainable farming practices, and environmental concerns first and foremost - it's not really about making ""healthier"" food from what I can see but maybe I am wrong. It does mention GMO, but only to outright ban it. It doesn't really justify this ban in the face of modern science, it just ""is"" that way.

There are of course prohibited materials on the basis of health concerns, but I don't believe the science shows any health concerns resulting from GMO inherently. If there are any issues resulting from a particular hypothetical GMO crop, it can be banned on a specific per-component basis just like all the rest of the excluded pesticides and feeds and whatnot. 

The list of benefits to GMO are many and are super ""Star Trek"" levels of cool imo. We can develop more nutrient dense versions of staple crops so that rice in Asia and corn in Latin America and sorghum in Africa can fight malnutrition without effecting a shift in their culture, like adding vitamin A, folate, vitamin C, etc to more foodstuff. We can make root systems deeper, we can produce drought resistant, pest resistant, crops, crops that ship better, crops that taste better.

But we can't! Because it's banned from grading standards and treated with suspicion and actively lobbied against. Golden Rice is still not getting where it needs to go, but that's a complete tangent. Anyway.

This is stuff we can't really do with conventional breeding on the scale that is needed because there's minimum numbers of generations required to propagate genes and this exponentially increases the difficulty from what I understand.

So, that's my opinion. I think that GMOs should be allowed into the Organics standard and the blanket ban should just be deleted from the regularions.

Targeted restrictions on *credible* concerns on a case by case basis is fine. We should be encouraging the ethical and sustainable growth of GMO crops and livestock in the interest of public good and maybe millions of less people will starve that could be cool too.

**Tl;Dr** Please help me understand why the ""Organic"" label, which is largely concerned with the environment and ethical treatment of animals, would not want to bring these practices over to GMO crops. It seems BAD for the environment and UNethical to do this. 800 million people are going hungry as you read this.

1,2023-08-27,CMV: Bulletproof armor should be a restricted item similar to machine guns and explosives. Or not sold to the public at all.,u/mortalviperkillsquad,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/162xin9/cmv_bulletproof_armor_should_be_a_restricted_item/,changemyview,"Correct me if I’m wrong. There is no mainstream, legitimate need for civilian tactical body armor. I’m focusing on your everyday bullet-resistant variety, but will throw in stab- and slash-resistant too as a secondary view. 

1. American manufacturers in my research typically don’t sell to civilians because armor must be fitted and regularly maintained. They may carry insurance in case of legal disaster. Police departments do fail to follow this practice and put employee lives at risk (think how your body changed since high school when you started your job). Civilians surely do because they don’t appreciate or understand the risk nearly as much as someone paid to get shot at.  

2. Armor is certified by the government and regulated for import and export. Western armor is tested and again, maintained. Civilian armor has an incentive to be inexpensive (imported, like from China and Venezuela). Civilians are at a disadvantage for information on [defective products](https://www.bodyarmornews.com/certified-body-armor-in-china-russia-and-venezuela-inactivated-by-nij-ctp/) and their lives are thus put at risk. 

3. Bad guys use armor. 

In fact, do you often hear about good guys using body armor for anything other than their job? The job that buys or subsidized their vest to get shot or stabbed at for money?

Today, a [mass shooter](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/26/us/jacksonville-florida-shooting-multiple-fatalities/index.html) motivated by racial hatred donned body and face armor to commit crimes. 

In [1997](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout), and a big reason we debate AR-15s and police overkill, two bank robbers used full armor to combat tactical teams for hours, again only to kill themselves or bleed out. We can go on and on picking examples of criminal and insane minds from a Las Vegas concert to Dallas mass transit that went out of their way to procure armor for no other reason than to survive law enforcement intervention during a public emergency they were the cause and end of. 

Now, gun rights activists may say body armor is a defense issue. That it serves as a [balm](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/new-yorks-new-body-armor-ban-doesnt-cover-the-plate-carrier-worn-by-the-buffalo-supermarket-killer/amp/) for the fearful. Or that bans won’t work, or the lawmakers don’t know what they’re doing. 

I never hear a good reason why armor should be available, other than it allows you to stay in the fight. That’s true: it lets bad guys choose when to end the fight. 

You’re not The Terminator. How many rounds are you expecting to take on your way to your car today? 

And will you ever make peace with your god, Sometimes life is unfair, and walking around with a tactical face mask may not be what fate intended for the he unlucky among us that do run into a knife or bullet. Life’s full of surprises and disappointments. Sorry for the harsh reality.

I'm definitely not the first person to say this but there should be a radical shift in our understanding of the school system.

Schools are arguably a prime example of the panopticon: a system of surveillance, normalization and examination that enforces itself by normalizing its existence. Power is exercised in the public school system by making such system ingrained in the social life and by making it the primary source of knowledge and of the qualifications necessary to function in the work force. Hence, one might argue that schools are merely a mean through which power is exercised in order to create subjects that conform to the desired expectations of those in power. 

Who are the people in power? well, it's hard to tell since power functions in very preplexing ways (not like the marxists would say that it's the economically previlaged). I would argue that it's about controlling knowledge (the ways in which we see the world) and that can be done through directly affecting which things are taught and which things are not or through numerous other implicit ways.

&#x200B;

Hence, I think we should be very critical of our understanding of the school system and analyze the power structures that influence it in order to get a clearer view of what should be done. "

For 2022, the company spent roughly $513.2 billion, which is all of its sales revenue plus some of its cash on hand. The $513.2 billion in expenditures included things like salaries and wages, R&D, marketing and sales expense, etc. Thus, the company expenditures contribute to the overall economy. Besides that, the company provides products at a price below that of its competitors, leaving its customers with more money in their pockets.

I think that this is why kids are shifting right.

This is because leftist talking points often take a longer time to explain, compared to conservative talking points which are less sophisticated and take less time to communicate. Ill give a few examples:

the trans debate is an example of this. No one can explain gender theory in less than a minute, but there are tons of tiktoks that say things like ""a man cannot become a woman because of his chromosomes, it's basic biology"" and the comments are filled with people agreeing with them and saying things like ""yeah no shit""

Another example is climate change. it's very hard to explain the greenhouse effect and the numerous studies confirming that the climate is changing due to carbon emissions in 30 seconds. but there are so many tiktoks of conservatives saying ""oh it's just like the ice age, the earth's climate changes naturally"" 

A final example can be evolution. evolution is much harder to explain compared to conservatives who say that ""you can't get chickens from snake eggs"". 

other examples that come to mind are the abortion debate, socialism, education, and many other debates.

I think that the reason for this is that leftism is rooted in progressive views that force us to look at historical context, studies, and deep philosophical viewpoints. This requires more analysis which inevitably will take a longer time. Meanwhile, conservatives tend to look through an emotional perspective, appealing to individual experiences rather than data. this makes the job of conveying an argument much easier and faster. 

This is backed by research which shows that: "" the cingulate cortex, an area that helps detect errors and resolve conflicts, tends to be larger in liberals. And the amygdala, which is important for regulating emotions and evaluating threats, is larger in conservatives."" - Scientific American

As a teenager myself, i am watching my entire grade shift right, and they are quoting people like Andrew Tate, Ben Shapiro, and other conservatives who often appear in these short form tiktoks. our school is starting to fill up with misogyny, transphobia and overall bigotry. it's becoming sad and problematic, and im starting to lose hope in my generation. 

Hopefully one of you can change my view. Thanks for reading. "
1,2023-08-27,CMV: The portal paradox appears to pose a dilemma only because it is poorly defined. Ambiguous behaviour of portals means that either outcome is justifiable.,u/notsuspendedlxqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/16306rr/cmv_the_portal_paradox_appears_to_pose_a_dilemma/,changemyview,"[The portal paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B19nlhbA7-E&ab_channel=minutephysics) is a puzzle based on the video game Portal, in which there are ""portals"" that enable objects and people to travel instantaneously from one hole to the other. In this hypothetical scenario, a portal is placed onto a piston, and the piston rapidly pushes the portal onto a stationary cube. The corresponding end of the portal is placed on a nearby surface. In scenario A, the cube pops out the portal with zero velocity and remains stationary. In scenario B, the cube flies out the portal at the same speed that the piston portal is moving at. 

People can debate endlessly about the right answer, but in my opinion, an objectively correct solution doesn't exist. Each side of the debate is actually using a different definition of the behaviour of portals. Canonically, within the universe of the video game Portal, the portals conserve the velocity of the object relative to the entrance portal. So it would seem like B is the right answer. However, it is also impossible to place portals onto moving surfaces in-game, so I don't think Portal can provide a definitive answer.

The strongest argument of the ""A hypothesis"" is a thought experiment where the cube is replaced with a person, and the piston rapidly moves downwards, making the person enter the portal headfirst. But halfway through, the piston is suddenly stopped. According to the conservation of velocity, what happens next is that either the person is sliced in half, and their upper body flies out the exit portal, or that their lower body is suddenly sucked through the portal, and the entire body flies out the other side. Both scenarios are counter-intuitive. The most obvious answer is that the upper half of the body appears out the exit, and the person remains still.

However, this is due to the fact that conservation of energy is clearly violated by portals. In real life, absolutely everything obeys the law of the conservation of energy, and any object which flagrantly freaks that law appears unnatural. 2-way Portals, by their very existence, already violate the conservation of energy, unless the creation of portals are strictly limited to 2 locations with identical potential. 

Actually, the debate isn't about whether the cube stays still, or if it exits at a certain velocity. ""A hypothesis"" believers advocate for a type of portal that prioritizes conservation of energy over conservation of velocity. ""B hypothesis"" believes advocate for a type of portal that prioritizes conservation of velocity over conservation of energy. Both sides are utilizing different definitions of portals. This is why neither side is able to convince each other that their view is correct. CMV.

1,2023-08-27,CMV: Democracy is inherently flawed,u/CheeseIsAHypothesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1631i35/cmv_democracy_is_inherently_flawed/,changemyview,"I've always believed in the virtues of democracy, but recent events have made me question its effectiveness and fairness. While democracy promotes the idea of equal representation and majority rule, I can't help but see how this system can lead to the oppression of minorities, rampant division, and the reinforcement of uninformed decision-making.

At its core, democracy seems to perpetuate the notion that the majority should always hold power and make decisions for the entire population. However, this approach often neglects the concerns and needs of marginalized groups, leading to a system where the minority's voices are suppressed. It's unsettling to think that the rights and interests of a smaller group can be easily disregarded in favor of what benefits the larger populace.

Moreover, the prevalence of division within democracies is hard to ignore. The adversarial nature of political campaigns and discourse often exacerbates this division, pitting citizens against each other based on their chosen candidates or parties. The stark polarization that has become evident in places like the United States showcases how democracy can turn citizens into adversaries rather than collaborators. The lack of constructive dialogue and compromise can hinder progress and create a hostile environment.

One glaring issue is the inadequate political education of the general population. Many individuals rely on sensationalized information from online sources or echo chambers created by their friends and family. This lack of comprehensive understanding leads to the regurgitation of biased viewpoints rather than informed opinions. In such a scenario, democracy's effectiveness is diminished, as decisions are made by a population that might not have the necessary insights to make well-rounded choices.

The United States serves as a vivid example of these problems. The unwavering confidence that both sides have in their correctness has resulted in a situation where not only are opposing views deemed incorrect, but they're also seen as morally reprehensible. This demonization of the opposition prevents productive discourse and the exploration of potential solutions that could bridge the gap between differing ideologies.

In conclusion, I find myself questioning whether the majority rule inherent in democracy is the best way to govern. I think it will lead to societal collapse sooner than later."

Terminology. These words dont mean the same thing for every platform, so for consistency this is what I'm using: Banning prevents someone from interacting with a public page, but they can still view it. Blocking a person prevents them from sending you private messages. Ignoring someone hides all of their public interactions from you. Ghosting someone prevents them from viewing a public page.

The ""ghosting"" part is what I mainly have a problem with. Banning sucks too, unless users can opt out to see banned interactions. Blocking and ignoring are fine.

If there's, for example, a public subreddit, or profile page, then ghosting the person shouldn't be an option. Banning should be opt-out; you can simply click a button to unhide people who interact with pages they're banned from. That way moderators can still regulate the default purpose of the group, filtering out the garbage, but aren't hardcore preventing anyone from talking about or reading things they may want to see. Deleting comments is also shitty.

For clarity, I dont think this should be literally illegal. Just that it's unethical and doesn't support the purpose of having any sort of public discussion forum on the internet. That there's no reason to do it that isn't against core principles of free speech, maliciously manipulating conversation by restricting what we can and can't read and write instead of encouraging reasonable discourse.

Changing my view: Explaining any benefits of the current systems that are broken by my proposal, or any flaws in my suggestion that don't exist in the current systems. I see this as an absolute win with no downsides."

1,2023-08-27,CMV: We should replace Immigration Judges with the Jury System to solve immigration problems,u/MikeShoeCompany,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1638f2u/cmv_we_should_replace_immigration_judges_with_the/,changemyview,"The immigration judges should be replaced by jury system. To insure all legal applicants’ cases are heard in timely fashion, I believe the jury system is far more effective than judges.  In order to compensate people serving in this jury, each person will be paid $10k a week (or whatever the medium wage is for that region), additionally veterans’ votes will be weighed double the regular vote in the jury. The amount paid to each jury member shouldn’t matter except it should be amount that would incentivize people to serve the jury.
Here’s how the jury system will work. Let’s say you are an immigrant and you want your asylum case be heard by jury of peers. You apply normally in USCIS agency and the agency will ask you to pay the $10k minimum ( or higher if the area is more expensive), and then the agency will give you a date for your hearing date. The agency will go through the voter rolls of the state, and randomly pick nine people from that, contact them and set the appointment with the compensation offered. 
The USCIS will have a patch of immigrants interviewed in each appointment, the jury could easily handle 50-100 people per day. If someone serves one day for eight hours for $10k, that would be $1,250/hour. 
Unlike a single judge who is susceptible of biases, whether conscious or unconscious, the jury system will be diverse, and thus likely to be influenced by any particular bias. Furthermore, since the jury is not a profession, members of the jury aren’t more likely to be swayed by political pressures or influenced by certain constituency, so their decisions taken collectively, will be fair or closer to it.
The jury system will also give the nation more unity and harmony since it will allow all members of society to have the opportunity to hear about the struggles, experiences, and the stories immigrants have. Instead of one government bureaucrat  deciding whether someone will be a citizen, whether someone is entitled to stay or leave, the decision will be made collectively and democratically; each community having microcosms of democracy on who can be a member in their community. 
Since the prospective immigrant will be interacting and living in those communities, it would be fair for that community to have a say who can be one of them. And unlike a single judge, this jury system I believe will give the immigrant as well as the community the fairest way of deciding someone’s fate. 
This jury should also be used to decide who can be a US citizen. When someone have had a green card and went through a background check, the jury should be assembled to judge whether someone can be a citizen or not. The jury will be randomly picked from the voter rolls in the area where the person lives,  and the jury will listen prospective citizens like they do in prison pardons parole, each immigrant will be listen by nine jury members and in order that person to pass the citizenship test they’ll ask about US history and government. The jury members can also ask any question if they feel it would allow them to make their decision. 

I believe the jury system will save money for the federal government, will give immigrants a fair and speedy hearing, and it will give each community an opportunity to vet who can be a member in their community. Here I summarize the three main parties in this issue. 

1. The federal government. 
The federal government will save money since they don’t have to pay six figure to federal judges every year, plus politicians in the federal government will be happy that, at last they have found a solution for the “broken immigration system” by giving the people the decision to solve the immigration problem democratically. 

2. The immigrant 
The immigrant will be happy with this jury system because all they have to do is to pay the jury fee ($10k minimum, not refundable), and their case will be heard by diverse set of people. Their fate doesn’t depend on one single person who can be biased and unfair. Plus, since the jury will be paid handsomely,  the decision will be fast and his/her case will decided in a timely manner. 

3. The community (The American citizen)
One of the reasons why the immigration issue is so controversial in USA is that most Americans don’t even know what the process even is. Some believe in order to be US citizen, you just cross the border and few days later, you are just as American as Apple pie. Others, think US immigration system is harsh and strict and never accepts anyone legally. But obviously both of these extremes are incorrect. If we implement this jury system, where everyone (every citizen) is given the opportunity to see how the process works, who can apply for US citizenship, listen diverse set of immigrants, I think it will change perspectives and start a conversation that will improve people’s perception of immigrants. 
If we give the chance every American to serve this jury, they will learn about the laws concerning about immigrants. And as a consequence, they’ll be less likely to be victims of conspiracies or lies. Regular jury system isn’t controversial because everything is transparent: the government randomly elects jury members, the government shows their case against someone, the person make their defense case, and the jury decides whether the government’s case is valid and thus the person is guilty, or the person’s case is valid thereby not guilty. The process is too simple if anything. 

If you show me federal judges are better than a jury system I will give you a delta."

May bring you down or disturb you so switch gears before you read on. Also huuge rant incoming. 

So to run with that-- currently in life I feel good about burning bridges and I'm only in my early twenties. Not good like proud, it just *feels* good and I'll tell you why. 

It's the only power/ control that I have. I can't get anything I want from life so it's nice to be the one in control of the situation. Like a kid that can't get any good attention so at this point bad attention is better than nothing. I fucking hate everyone and their momma. I hate my own mom. I hate my dad. I hated my step parents. I have terrible relationships with my brothers and sisters. No one at work respects me. 

There's only a few bridges left and none that haven't already been burned and then rebuilt a few times, per-say. 

I'm kicked around from school to school, town to town, now job to job, anyways. No one wants me in their tribe and never has. In the ancient times I'd be cast out and left for dead. The few people I would even call friends in my life are gone, and they weren't even good friends, like at all. They all sucked but I always took what I could get I guess. Same with girls, yeah all hot but they were trash on the inside.

Just for the record I really loved people, meeting new people, I loved my family, and I loved being with people. I got bullied my entire life but I didn't care until middle/high school, like before I was like whatever get over it and maintained my pride and joy in life, gave everything my best efforts, strong attitude. But my ego must be really fucked at this point. God's honest truth, no one respects me, wants me around, wants to know me-- it's the opposite. 

I just quit my job today and my only plans are to lay down and die. I don't even have the energy to go on about it but I could.

 And to whoever reads this, fuck you, fucking know it all. Don't even comment. Go to hell and good riddance. :'("

I liked the idea of almost balancing out religion with a more “scientific” mindset. I use quotes because nowadays I can’t in good conscience refer to it as anything other than pseudoscience. Concepts including energy, manifestation, law of attraction, tarot cards, auras, etc.

I have friends who think they have figured out life and the universe because of how popular unreliable resources are, mainly tiktok. The concepts are being defiled, used instead as a means of boosting one’s ego (not in the good way) and getting around putting real work into your life. It’s so appealing to these people, because of course I and anyone would much rather make spells opposed to going to therapy and getting a job. I think a lot of them know in the back of their minds it’s bullshit, but they will never admit it. 

My final point is that like anything that goes popular, it is already being monetarily exploited. Go to any crystal shop, they are so damn expensive. I want my opinion to be changed because I feel like I am closer to these communities than most people who complain about spirituality. I don’t want to come off as ignorant

1,2023-08-28,"CMV: Engaging in this sub too much is unhealthy because it promotes being neutral or on the fence on topics, and discourages making your mind up and acting on important issues.",u/QueenMackeral,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/163g2b8/cmv_engaging_in_this_sub_too_much_is_unhealthy/,changemyview,"I'm not here to argue whether neutrality is moral or immoral in general, because I think neutrality should be in moderation. You shouldn't be on the fence about every single issue, but neither should you ignore nuance and blindly follow a belief. However I believe engaging in this sub too much and for too long can lead to a few things:

1. not having strong views on anything because any view can be refuted easily.  
If you post or read a thread about ""X is good"" you might become convinced from the arguments and walk away thinking ""X is actually bad"". Then if you post or read about ""X is bad"", you can walk away thinking ""X is actually good"". Why even hold either of these or any beliefs that can be refuted when you can just stay neutral.
2. weakened convictions, avoiding thinking about important issues, and not taking action. Being neutral is a state of inaction and indecision. If we want to better our world and make our beliefs meaningful, we have to make up our minds about issues that are important and act on them. Not to mention when the inaction of neutrality can literally cause harm, like debating climate change or letting injustice or harm happen to others, etc.
3. playing devil's advocate in all parts of your life or always disagreeing or even arguing with people. Additionally, nitpicking every argument, arguing on semantics or phrasing, basically not adhering to the principle of charity which states that you should interpret someone's argument with the best possible interpretation.
4. lastly, negativity. Due to the rules of the sub where top comments always have to disagree with the OP, interactions can feel antagonistic. This sub is like the opposite of an echo chamber, whereas in an echo chamber everyone agrees with and supports one another, here everyone for the most part disagrees with one another, creating an overall negative atmosphere and arguments.

Again the key point in my view is ""long term"" and ""consistent"" engagement in this sub. Having one or two of your views changed, or reading a few discussions is fine and healthy, but over the long term it can change how you think and not entirely for the better. I think most people who are subscribed would be better unsubbing to take a break every once in a while. "

I think you cant judge people who do. Before calling me a nazi let me first explain what i mean.

Oppression = actively worsening circumstances for a select group.

Discrimination = not actively improving circumstances for a select group.

Examples of oppression would be biased laws, biased use of tax money and things like assault & theft. These directly take something from the oppressed to benefit the oppressor. That is despicable.

Examples of discrimination would be unequal wage, low employment rate, low representation and social ostracism. All of these obviously suck, but they're things that wouldn't be any different if it weren't for the person doing the discriminating. Basically its a feeling of jealousy that others have something you want, but they're not sharing it.

&#x200B;

Everybody is discriminated against on a daily basis. It can be based on looks, personality, just your overall vibe. You do it too. When you befriend one person but not the other - discrimination. It becomes a problem when someone feels that it happens to them more than others. If everyone (E.g. at a workplace) is close friends except for one person, who no one talks to, understandably they will feel ostracized. It sucks, but there's no one you can really blame. You can't force them to include the person or talk to them when they just don't want to.

Yet recently victims of discrimination are acting as though they're being oppressed. I feel that we should obviously have equal pay, support for people with disabilities, representation for all etc., simply because it isn't hard to achieve. But if you cry oppression when someone disagrees with that i think you're just entitled."

I think after your kid reaches a certain age, it's none of their business if you decide to be a sex worker.

I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the LorD of hosts.

Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy."

1,2023-08-28,CMV: AI is going to ruin the world,u/Any-sao,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/163mwa2/cmv_ai_is_going_to_ruin_the_world/,changemyview,"To be clear, I don’t necessarily mean Artificial Intelligence is going to end the world by doing something like dropping atomic bombs or by becoming Skynet. I’m also not necessarily against believing those are possibilities. But enough has been written about that topic. I really mean AI is just going to *ruin* the world for people.

Artificial Intelligence really does seem like it can do anything. Any topic that requires a degree of talent or scholarship will be performed by an all-knowing machine. Even a machine that is rudimentary as a Google search engine with human-like grammar already knows more than the most brilliant human scholars in the world (combined) and can communicate it effectively enough to be understood.

And as a result, any job out there that requires simply *knowing* something or how to do will be replaceable by a robot now. And when I say “job,” I don’t just mean things we do for work and to increase economic output. I mean the things we do to bring joy to ourselves and others. And when AI can do that, there’s fundamentally no purpose in humans making anything anymore. Because AI will be able to do it faster. So, so much faster. And even if the output is of terrible quality, a second output just a second keystroke away.

The work people enjoy and bring purpose can and will be replaced by AI.

Ever wanted to write a book? Good luck finding a market when ChatGPT can do it for readers instead.

Do you work in a factory, and proud of your ability to make things that people need? Robotic arms on the factory floor will do that for you instead.

Do you want to paint? You could be the next Da Vinci, but in the time it takes you to find inspiration, Midjourney will have output 100,000 images, and inevitably one of them will rival the Mona Lisa. And it’s not just painting, even complicated and mathematical art like architectural design can be done by an AI now, too.

Do you enjoy travel planning, for yourself or for your friends? An AI will be able to know the names of every hotel and airline in the world, and can put together an itinerary faster you can type “Trivago.”

Do you want to protect and serve your country by joining the military? A killer robot can shoot down targets in a second and take risks no human would be able to. And then there will be thousands more in the swarm ready to serve the same purpose. Their lethality is displayed by the fact that militaries around the world are currently working not to improve, but *restrain* killer robots.

Do you want to make TV shows? We now even have AI that can write, voice, and animate South Park episodes based on a keystroke.

Interested in becoming a lawyer? AI programs can pass the Bar Exam with a perfect score. All it needs is a few seconds and a WiFi connection to download a law school education.

Voice acting? You can now have Plankton from SpongeBob’s synthesized voice sing you Somebody That I Used to Know.

Enjoy having sex? Well how about an AI that gathers information on sex toys on how to best pleasure their buyers, so that better performance can be done for them?

But maybe all of this sounds good to you. If AI does everything in the world for work, we can need for nothing. We can spend our lives pursuing our own interests, and do what makes us happy. 

And perhaps that is all well and good: but are *you* going to do that? Or are you going to spend their lives sitting on a couch playing a video game that AI generated for them where they can play as Jedi Master Taylor Swift battling a Thanos with procedurally-generated dialogue, who has allied with a facsimile of your mother-in-law; which you requested because your AI therapist prescribed you with childhood trauma related to your parents?

Does this post sound like a joke? It shouldn’t, believe it or not. Every AI example I provided above is actually now in existence (except the specifics of that video game one, for now) and most are available to consumers. In fact, these were just the ones that came from memory. I could have asked ChatGPT to write a better list with hundreds of examples, and it would have been much better than my own.

So, please: change my view. How do I convince myself that AI’s ability to do *everything* won’t render everything we enjoy inferior to a machine’s output? What will be left for us who aren’t AI software engineers?"
1,2023-08-28,CMV: It is worse for a child to be murdered than to have than child be abused (explainins inside),u/BodybuildingMacaron,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/163mwqy/cmv_it_is_worse_for_a_child_to_be_murdered_than/,changemyview,"So, without the context, the fundamental question that came up between my friend and I is, ""Is it better for a child to be sexually abused by an adult and live, or die?"" My friend said that it is better that child dies. I think the feelings inspiring their answer are valid, but I do not agree with their reasoning.

My reasoning is that I think that one scenario has a really awful thing happen to the kid, and they live to have a chance to heal from the trauma, and in the other, they don't have that ability at all. 

I also think that if this person believes the child is better off dead, wouldn't that mean they think rape-surviving children should be killed, that it would be an act of mercy? I find that idea reprehensible. But I do understand where their argument is coming from.

This came up when we were discussing two characters, which of the two were morally worse within the context of their own stories. One person had abused someone, where another had killed thousands of innocents, and the question of whether rape or dying was a more fitting fate came up.  


It was my mistake for having this argument in the first place, I think. I couldn't have known they were a rape survivor, and that they were raped by their cousin as a child, but I still feel guilty for triggering their trauma with the conversation. I don't agree with their opinion, that a child is better off dead than abused, but I feel like... morally obligated to? I still don't agree with it, mind you, but I still feel really bad about it: Surely a rape survivor from childhood would know more than me, right? I was hardly abused as a child, not in any way that mattered.   


Anyhoo, that's all."
1,2023-08-28,CMV: Gender-specific restrooms should be illegal.,u/Dedli,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/163mxyj/cmv_genderspecific_restrooms_should_be_illegal/,changemyview,"I recognize that this is an extreme opinion right now. But after a few years, it would be the norm and the widespread gender discrimination in restrooms would fizzle out and we could finally be done with this. The true extremist view is that people should be allowed to restrict restroom usage based on gender.

This even applies to spaces that are typically used exclusively by women or men. Like if a janitor can use a restroom, and the janitor can be the non-typical gender,still having a legit reason to be there in the first place, that person shouldnt be asked to go out of their way because of their gender.

What it would take to change my view: Seeing any instance where the ""genderless"" part of a gender-neutral restroom is the source of the problem, and not some other completely unrelated thing that could be more easily solved without refusing entry to >50% of the population and adding a second bathroom.

Relevant points:

- Creeps are creeps. Nobody tolerates them in either the mens or the womens restrooms already. Men are primarily the creeps, but both genders can spray them with mace, and male creeps are afraid of male witnesses, which are also more likely in a neutral restroom.

- The fact that public restrooms have cracks that you can see through in the first place is fucking dumb. Compare Target's restrooms to Target's fitting rooms. Much more private. Why? If privacy is the issue, you get much more privacy in a (gender neutral!) porta-potty.

- Gendered restrooms discriminate against non-gender-conforming individuals. If a guy looks too girly, or a woman has a mustache, they might be asked to leave and cause a real problem, simply for using the correct bathroom. People who fit neither typical appearance are going to be uncomfortable everywhere, and a lot of people in either restroom are going to be uncomfortable seeing them at all.

- Gendered restrooms discriminate against people with disabilities. If burly man has a caretaker who is female, which restroom do you propose they use? A third, additional, disabled (gender neutral!) restroom?

- Gendered restrooms are problematic for parents and children. If a boy is too young to be left unaccompanied, for what reason should it be up to a bystander's subjective opinion on the kid's apparent age to judge whether or not it's appropriate for them to be there? What is the cutoff for an acceptable age to bring your child with you to the ""wrong"" restroom? Dont get me started on changing tables."

1,2023-08-28,CMV: Languages should be renamed / Russian should be renamed to Slavic,u/Alyeno,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/163rbkr/cmv_languages_should_be_renamed_russian_should_be/,changemyview,"This CMV has two components: a generalized idea, and a specific example that exemplifies why I feel this way. I am well aware that my opinion is controversial and I am indeed open to having my mind changed.

First things first. Language is a crucial component of culture, and not only does it provide people with a shared sense of identity and belonging but it also relates to the speakers' past and present. As such, it is understandable that nations are committed to protecting and promoting their language, albeit to a varying degree.

But language is so much more than a cultural identifier. And at the foundation of my reasoning lies the idea that the other functions of language are vastly more important than its cultural anchoring. Language facilitates communication, and therefore relationships of a personal and professional manner. Especially with globalization and the internet, language is embedded into a multitude of commercial endeavours, at the most basic level entertainment, media and education: Content is more strongly tied to the language than the geographic location of its consumers. For example, francophone Africa is being tied to the lifestyle and values of France, there is a bond between Portugal and Brazil, and so on.

Obviously, English has become a global language that connects people across different cultures. However, it's so global that it has lost its notion of community and connection. There is no way that you would presume somebody communicating to you in English to have shared values and cultural ties - but this is exactly what I would argue exists between, say, Quebec and francophone Belgium.

The effects of globalization and digitization on language are obvious. Globally spoken languages such as Spanish become less diverse, and it becomes easier to understand one another despite differences obviously still existing. I would argue, and I find it likely, that these differences and dialects are likely to diminish in the next 100 years, and there will be an ""international"" form of all key languages, potentially co-existing with local versions, in a similar fashion to what Arabic has already undergone.

All of this being said, and keeping in mind why certain countries speak certain languages, as well as being mindful of their increased desire to emancipate themselves from their former colonizers, like what we currently see in many places across francophone Africa... what if the Senegalese didn't have to consider themselves to be ""speaking French""? Wouldn't it be beneficial for the unifying thread between them, their neighbors, and this weird European country, to not be tainted by a ""master-slave"" relationship but on equal footing? Without a doubt, just changing a language's name wouldn't erase its historic baggage but it could potentially be one of the steps towards a rethinking of the relationship between these countries, and discourage efforts to differentiate/isolate. 

(Yes, I am claiming that more people speaking the same language is generally beneficial in comparison to segmentation... but I don't think you'll be able to convince me otherwise, as the only other option would be English becoming prevalent to a crazy big extent).

Renaming languages to make them independent from their ""home soil"" would make countries distance themselves from their past without negatively impacting their present and future prospects. It would also make life on Earth more ""logical"" in many cases... Americans speaking English is one thing, but at this point if you read that something is in Portuguese in a globally available place, you'll automatically presume that they mean Brazil Portuguese... not sure what Portugal has to gain from that culturally? One possible alternative is what happened in the Balkans, and I don't think it's a good solution: The (basically) same language is referred to as ""Serbian"", ""Croatian"", ""Bosnian"" or ""Montegrin"", and linguists call it either Serbo-Croatian or BCMS. That's just a clusterfuck?!

So, this is the ""big picture"". In practice, I am looking at the language of Russian, which is widely prevalent in many post-Soviet countries due to their past. And it is increasingly shunned, and rightfully so, as it is used by Russia to justify military intervention. Instead of furthering protectionism, what if we... as crazy as it sounds... simply take away the authority on Russian from Russia? Sure, they will never agree with it, but given their actions, I don't think that their opinion holds any weight. I don't care for how we call it in the future as long as it is disassociated with Russia, but a possible name could be ""Slavic"".

The language could provide a sense of connection and economic prosperity to nations such as the Baltics, Georgia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and of course Ukraine, without being completely global like English. Not to say people in these countries shouldn't learn English, just the opposite... I'm rather seeing it as an additional layer. So, one day, people in Colombia learn Colombian Spanish, ""global"" Spanish, and English, and people in Latvia learn Latvian, ""Slavic"", and English. Maybe there'll even be a movement to have ""the language formerly known as German"" take up this role for the Netherlands and Nordic countries. 

I think it's more realistic for existing languages to take up this space than for constructed ones. For example, there is Interslavic, which connects multiple Slavic languages with the goal of being understood by as many speakers as possible, but I just don't see something like this ever becoming widely relevant no matter how hard we try. We would have content creators that can reach hundreds of millions of people, it would facilitate making business (even though it currently seems hard to imagine that even a tiny language would loosen its requirement on things such as product information on packaging in a supermarket not being translated to their very own language... but who knows, a lot can happen in 100 years). And we could give the countries who had to learn Russian back then a way to benefit from their past without pain. Which applies to culture as well... we can argue as much as we want about whether a writer was Russian or Ukrainian as long as we have no choice but to write that said person has written their works in ""Russian"". This wouldn't be the case if the language had no ties to Russian, allowing past culture to be seen through a new lens without this whole other layer.

It would also help commerce on a highly pragmatic level: Today, if you see that a company offers content/information in ""Russian"", it automatically taints the whole thing. If it said ""Anglic - Allemanic - Iberic - Slavic"", this wouldn't be the case.

1,2023-08-28,CMV: I didn't (and still don't) consider Donald Trump to be such a sinister person that he might actually be a dictator.,u/DirtThief,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/163tqya/cmv_i_didnt_and_still_dont_consider_donald_trump/,changemyview,"To start - I am no Donald Trump supporter, and I never have been. I've actually gone to great lengths to establish that as basically a fact. I took a picture of my primary ballot in 2016 because by the time it was my turn to vote it looked like he was going to win the nomination, and I knew I'd have to vote for him against Hillary - so I wanted proof that I wasn't for this. I then voted for Biden in the 2020 primary and general elections despite not having too terribly large of objections to how Trump had been running the country to that point. If I had that to do over again, I would certainly have voted for Trump due to some pretty radical shifts in how I view the world now.

My reason for being so incredibly against Trump is because I believe him to be an incredibly crass and immoral person. For instance, in the 2016 election so much was made of the 'grab her by the pussy' comment. 

The mainstream narrative to that was that he was a rapist. I didn't see that at all. As Dave Chappelle pointed out in his SNL monologue a little bit after it happened, I felt that the context of his bragging rant on that bus obviously indicated consent. 

However, that didn't suddenly make it okay to me. The guy was bragging about having random sex with women at a time when he had just gotten married, and was on his third marriage. To me, this indicates an out of control and undisciplined person. This is not someone I would want representing me as our nominee or our president.

But that's just background to explain how I dislike Donald Trump, but clearly I dislike him for different reasons than democrats do.

**Anyways - This is what I would like my view changed on. I consider Donald Trump to be an immoral person, but not a dangerous one. My sister is one of the smartest people I know. I was having a conversation with her about Trump and basically she said that all of the collusion between all of the media networks to basically suspend journalism and uniquely focus on destroying Trump was warranted because Trump could have been Hitler (despite him being president for 4 years and not being Hitler). **

**I showed her [this clip from Sam Harris](https://youtu.be/4_Jr-IrCiqg?si=nD6tem29i01k1UrL&t=33) saying basically the same thing and she said yes that's more or less what she thinks - that it's okay for our institutions to lie and bury and uninform us if it's for our own better good.**

**I was more or less astounded by her point of view. So I asked her what evidence she had that Trump could have been anything even approaching a dictator to support her belief. She told me that she more or less thought he was just an incompetent idiot until his administration put forward 'the muslim travel ban', and that indicated to her that he was capable and willing to create a holocaust type even against muslims.**

**That's a serious accusation to me, as I regularly volunteer at a refugee center that primarily aids Muslim refugees from Myanmar. However, I don't recall 'the Muslim ban' being anywhere near that serious, and I certainly never thought to myself 'Oh, Trump might holocaust Muslims' because of it. To me, it felt like run of the mill partisan bickering.**

**So what would change my mind would be more information about the Muslim ban (since I don't remember reading very much at all about it), or anything else that would suggest Trump was even remotely capable of being a murderous lunatic on the scale of Adolph Hitler.**"

The video discusses several structural and logistical issues with switching over the renewable energy in the short to medium term. Most of the issues stemming from the necessary materials that need to be mined to switch over to current generation solar panels, wind turbines and EVs. 

 Although the choice to support renewable energy has always been an easy one for me, I never really thought about how structurally and logistically a transition would work. I find parts of the video vague and I'm aware of that the author is likely biased towards a certain ideology. Saying that, the arguments I've seen made to challenge some of his conclusions have made me more alarmed due to how weak they are. Challenging him based on semantics or not factoring in recycling but then not providing any proof that recycling is the solution. I'm not inclined to think recycling is the solution due to how energy intensive it can be.

To sum it up, I'm starting to think that we will be unable to transition to renewable energy sources fast enough to meaningfully impact climate change in the next 10-50 years without some technological breakthrough or a reduction in consumption of resources. I don't have an enormous amount of conviction in this view since its not something I know a ton about but im interested in seeing some information that might challenge some of Mark Mills points."

The problem here is that they're trying to understand something with an infinite amount of aspects by examining the thing as a whole through one single aspect. That's never going to work. There is a reason why the DSM5 guys have to keep redefining everything. It's because the one single aspect they understand people through is one that is constantly evolving. 

The parameters society creates are based on the culture/s of that society. These are things that are in constant flux. They don't make for great variables to build your equations around. Build specific equations for them to fit into, sure, but it won't work using them for the components to build the foundation for your understanding. Everything you build on that foundation will be warped and there will be a disappointingly low height you'll be able to reach because everything will come crashing down on itself.

What I rarely, if ever, see from progressives, though, is the acknowledgement that they may themselves be saying or doing things that future generations may consider abhorrent.

As someone once said, if the entire world turned vegan by the year 2100, then people are going to look back and say things like, ""Do you know what a horrible person Barack Obama was? He ate *hamburgers*!""

Just for starters, a great many progressives are criticizing past generations while at the same time using fossil-fuel vehicles that make the climate worse, eating chocolate that was manufactured partly by the labor of slaves, using iPhones manufactured by exploited workers, wearing shoes or clothing made in brutal sweatshops, etc.

What if, a hundred years from now, keeping dogs and cats (or any other animal) as a pet is considered animal cruelty, and any progressive today in the 2020s who keeps a pet will be called an animal abuser in hindsight? 

And even if we think, ""Oh, well, as long as we always choose what's the most progressive, we can't go wrong"" - how do we know society won't do a major shift? What if, today, the pro-transgender progressives are the ones who get called wrong and backwards by 2100s America?  What if defending Islam in the 2020s becomes perceived as bigoted and sexist by 2100s America?

I'm reminded of a quote from a Michael Crichton book (wish I could recall the title - I'm paraphrasing): *""Every generation thinks they're the last, best, and most-perfect-and-enlightened generation, the one that finally got it 'right' where all previous generations got it wrong.

If representatives were replaced in favor of direct representation (randomly selected from all members of the population, no restrictions once every 4 years and they only assemble every 4 years ) with political parties removed from government entirely  (they only serve as get togethers/drinking clubs ), this would better streamline the process as rather than people having to write to their MPs/Representative/Senators, they can wait for their turn to be randomly selected and then present their views in government. They'll still vote on matters but they cut out the representative in favor of them presenting their views in government, resulting in better representation, especially for independents .

Well, what about the executive? Well, have their composition be made out of councils selected randomly from subject matter experts (such as a finance council being composed of accountants) that are in charge of carrying out laws once every 4 years and have no input on law-making (executive branches should carry out the laws strictly rather than having input in law making).

The United States has been overtly and otherwise trying to destabilize the home of black Americans for as long as black people have been here. Jim crow is an example of these overt actions.  The operations of intel communities purposefully introducing drugs into Black communities that are declassified today, are overt actions.   

The fact you will spend more time behind bars for a drug related offense than a violent offense. At first glance this only seems an oversight or something similar perhaps.  Then you look at incarceration rates and you see how many Black men were removed from their communities for these non-violent offenses and to me the picture becomes clear.  

Since the 70s Black women have been forced so often to be everything for their children.  They have done a hell of a job at being 2 people with only 1 body.  Seriously they have been super hero's to hold things together as well as they have and I can barely imagine anyone more deserving of praise. 

They haven't been enough though.  The degradation of values that black communities are experiencing, coupled with the celebratory nature of all these ""lil"" rappers celebrating violence, sex, and drugs.  It is destroying things.  Black communities are suffering most of all, but this isn't contained there.  So many are suffering.  

&#x200B;

Communities need strong men to lead them.  When the strong men are recruited into this lifestyle and then imprisoned, the community will suffer.  I am intentionally vague here because this is where to me the conversation needs to take place.  Everything before these last two paragraphs is simply fact and not arguable.  

To sum it up, I think black communities are suffering ultimately from a lack of fathers.  This is propagating into many honestly shitty behaviors many people readily dismiss or ignore for fear of being perceived as racist.  People are suffering and they need help.  I might be wrong, but glazing over the issues and clinking your teacups to vapid meaningless platitudes isn't helping anyone.  The black community has a serious problem, and to me that means we have a problem.  I want to help and bullshit words and a black mermaid are so incredibly patronizing and worthless.  Idk, lets make things better please.

In Belgium, a year's worth of dialysis treatment costs the government roughly €60k per year per patient. Meanwhile, a kidney from a healthy live donor lasts on average between 15-20 years with relatively minimal other costs after transplant.   
So let's assume 15 years of dialysis saved on average that would mean that 1 transplant saves the government roughly €800k (assuming €100k in total for surgery + medical follow-up of donor and recipient).   

I think to encourage more people to donate their kidney, the government should pay people €100k. Even with such a large payment, it would still lead to big savings for the government. And obviously, the recipient would benefit greatly as well due to massively increased QoL.    

And because I know people will bring up the health impacts on the donor: I don't consider this to be enough of an impact to not implement this plan. A thoroughly screened and healthy donor sees an extremely limited (if any) impact on their life. A month after the surgery, the donor can resume life as normal without any restrictions whatsoever. And the odds of developing kidney failure later in life are also very small when properly screened.    

And even if kidney failure is developed, there would be plenty of donors ready to give a kidney due to the high payment involved."

The fact that he lectures about trauma and it gets lapped up while he accusess Peterson of being repressed is comical to me. While Peterson has some degree of emotional lability, and suppressed anger, he is at least emotionally present. Gabor Mate who has told us of the ADHD rages that he subjected his family appears to display a level of disgust and detachment that only newage grifters show that our society encourages. I'd argue that disgust which Mate demonstrates as well as absense of anger or energy in his persona at least is a sign of deeper repression.

However, when comparing the dangers of drinking and driving to texting and driving, the latter presents a more immediate and pervasive threat. 

Texting while driving diverts a driver's attention from the road entirely, increasing the likelihood of accidents. In contrast, while impaired by alcohol, drivers might exhibit slower reactions and impaired judgment, but they are at least keeping their eyes on the road. 

It's crucial to emphasize that both activities are dangerous and illegal, and the focus should be on avoiding both to ensure road safety.

Meanwhile, the lunatics currently running Israel, like Ben Gvir and Smotrich, outright reject a two-state solution and don’t see the Palestinians as fully human. Obama once insisted that the United States rejects unilateral action by the U.N, and that only a negotiated settlement would bring peace, but this appears naïve to me at best and outright lying at worst. The two-state solution is the only fair solution to this conflict. Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state, but the Palestinians also have a right to self-determination. A one-state solution would cause Israel to become about half-Jewish and half-Muslim, and the Jews have no intention of giving the Palestinians equal rights (evidenced by their West Bank occupation) as that would threaten the Jewish majority of their country. It is not fair to the Palestinians to keep them as a permanently stateless people under foreign occupation, nor would it be fair to the Jews to deny them their own right to a state and self-determination. Thus the two-state solution must be achieved, and since negotiations have failed to achieve it, it must be imposed by force by a neutral body."

What I mean with uninteresting is that I never really care about people, but about Things. I never really engage with people for the sake of engaging but because I want something, be it information, someone to listen or to help, but never because I care about the other person. People often say I'm an introvert and shy because I don't talk a lot, but the reason is just that I don't see the point in talking with other people. What do I get out of knowing what they think about their favorite Sportsteam, while I don't care about sports at all? What do other people get from such Interactions? It just seams so pointless. I mean I can do it, but there has always been a reason why I would do something like that. For example: to not be seen as a coplete asshole I will listen and nod along with other people in a group and even give the occasional comment when it aligns with my interests. But I find it very hard to ask anything about the other person because there is the immediate though of ""why would I even care about the answer?"". 

Now I know I sound like an absolute psychopath that manipulates people for his own gains, but that can't be quite true rither. Why? Because I have been depressed for a very long time and also feel guilt over things I do that harm other people(althoug I dont know if it's guilt over their suffering, or me having to see them suffer). But that is also relative there are situations where I don't feel guilt at all. Now what about animals? Well they for some reason are more interesting then humans, I don't know why but it is probably their lack of personality, or their perceived ""innocence"" I don't know maybe I just see them more as things? 

Then we come to the reason as to why I'm here at all, if I don't care about people, why would I want people to change my mind?
Because I slowly losing interest in anything and am starting to lose sight of the future.
When I was younger I just thought I was shy and introverted, but that wasn't the case I just had a fundamental lack of interest in people. All my plans for the future have shattered since then. Why would I get married and get a family if I don't really ever care about them? Why would I pursue romance If I'm never really interested in the person, but just a vague Idea of what a relationship should be like? It's like you beeing prepared for the absolute highpaying Career for your entire childhood, only to realise you hate that job after graduation.

Do all my points seem selfcentered and egotistical? Yes, but what can I do to change that? If you don't have an interest in sports and have to live in a Stadium surrounded by fans it can get very tiring very quickly."

1,2023-08-29,CMV: The constitution should be rewritten once per generation,u/spiral8888,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/164fsto/cmv_the_constitution_should_be_rewritten_once_per/,changemyview,"(I'll first talk about ""normal"" countries with a single central government that rules the whole country and at the end have a few words about federations as they are a bit more complicated)

In most countries the constitution defines how the political system works and what basic rights people have. It has usually protections so that a simple majority can't change it. The main problem with this is that the first constitution has to be approved by a simple majority (in the best situation). So, the constitution is written at time point X and it sets in stone the views of the majority of that time and then any later change to it can happen only through a super majority. This has several problems. First, even though I understand that protections to minorities have to be done so that a simple majority can't change the constitution and just remove these protections, it can also make it very difficult to change things that were supported by a small majority in the first place. Furthermore, it can protect things that even at the time of the writing were not supported by the majority but just because of the voting system at the time (say, women not allowed to vote) was not truly democratic.

The other problem of giving precedence to the majority view at the time of the writing of constitution is that in many countries that is the time when the country had just either achieved independence from a bigger empire or had gone through a civil war overthrowing a non-democratic political system. This means that the views of the people are strongly affected by their very recent experiences and they may not think what would be the best system for a country living in peace and prosperity in the far future. 

So, I  suggest that a country should write the constitution from the scratch once every generation, let's say every 30 years. This could be done so that you have a constitutional convention with members elected by the people that drafts the new constitution, which is then put to a referendum. It will be accepted only if a majority of the people votes for it. Otherwise you either continue with the old constitution or throw it back to the convention to come up with a better one (I'm not sure, which one would be better). The only rule that the new constitution is not allowed to change is the rule about having this convention every generation (ok, you could change even this through some super majority, but not with a simple majority as other parts). 

This way the fundamental rules of the society get redefined once every generation meaning that the constitution better reflects the modern values instead of those that were in power a long time ago but are very difficult to change. Since you have the change only once per generation it doesn't mean that it will be constantly changed. So, it is a compromise of these rules reflecting modern values and having continuity. The generation is a right time frame as that way every member of the society will be able to take part in at least one of the changes. 

The above is a relatively easy thing to implement in a normal country as you just need a simple majority to approve it. The federal states or entities (such as Germany, Switzerland, the United States or EU) are a bit harder as the constitution also defines how the political power is divided between the central government and the smaller entities or how much ""extra"" power the smaller entities get in the central government over the pure majority rule. These things were usually agreed as a compromise to form the country in the first place. So, the smaller entities would not have joined if they were not given extra power with the fear that the bigger entities would rule over them in everything. If you redefine this once every generation and approve it by a majority vote, it's likely that the voters in bigger entities will support removing the extra powers. On the other hand it is unrealistic to think that the smaller entities would just leave the federation after living for decades or centuries together with the bigger entities. On the other hand, when the federal countries evolve, they can easily become more uniform and in that case the compromise of the past that was done just to form the country, may no longer reflect the reality. So, I would propose something like majority of the voters and the majority of the entities have to approve the new constitution if it changes the division of power. If that part of the constitution is not changed, then the simple majority like in the case of ""normal"" countries would be sufficient for approval. 

So, please give good arguments why relying on what our ancestors ages ago thought would be a good political system instead of rewriting it once every generation would be a bad idea. "

1,2023-08-29,CMV: there isn’t much to learn from reading ancient philosophy,u/WakaTP,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/164gwok/cmv_there_isnt_much_to_learn_from_reading_ancient/,changemyview,"
I am mainly talking about Greeks philosophers here, as I feel like once you get to Hume and forward you actually learn a few things. Though the same criticism could be made to an extent.


My point is : 
-reading Plato or Aristotle brings very little actual philosophical knowledge as most of their ideas are either outdated or have been severely contradicted by those who came after.
Like I genuinely don’t get what I am supposed to learn from Plato’s world of form, it’s just complete bullshit and has absolutely 0 epistemic value. 
And even when their ideas are probably still valuable nowadays, they have often been better formulated and expanded by others. (Here I am mainly thinking about the Stoics, the skeptics..).

I understand they have many values that I will enumerate here, but I don’t find those appealing enough on their pure philosophical aspect :

1. Plato’s dialogues are pretty fun and are great lessons of logics and argumentation. Overall they are great exemples of reasoning.

2. Greek philosophy has an anthropological value, it’s quite interesting to see how smart people used to defend slavery for exemple. It’s just a good way to think outside the box of our modern world.

3. But the main reason people read these in philosophy is probably its historical value. These guys founded philosophy, so everything came from here. And I get that can be very interesting. But that is not doing philosophy, that is doing history of philosophy. And that is not what I am interested in personally. I guess it helps understanding other philosophers, how their ideas were built upon or against those. But I don’t see how that is an absolute necessity (especially considering how I already have basic knowledge of the Greeks main ideas).

Those are perfectly good reasons to enjoy them, but they aren’t primarily philosophical, in the sense that their main appeal isn’t pure philosophical knowledge, because the philosophy knowledge they transfer is outdated. 

———————————————————————

I confess I haven’t read that many original books from Greeks philosopher so I get how this take is very likely uneducated but I have some trouble finding the interest in those I have read. I am still familiar with most of Greek philosophy through college and studies.

I tend to think that reading the classical authors is often quite pointless as only the ideas matter. This take is probably simply the extreme version of that.

We're not. Even ""good"" people have dark thoughts or can do bad stuff. It's about balance and ""good"" people do more good on balance.

So then, why is having a prejudice wrong? I admit freely - I don't like pretty women or women whom society deems conventionally attractive. They're more often than not stuck up, demanding, uncharitable, arrogant, narcissistic, cruel, and mean. They get by since they know people will back them up for their looks. I don't believe a pretty woman can be a genuinely good person since their need for adulation will seep through.

I avoid pretty women whenever I can. My last boss at work was an older pretty woman and if anything they're worse since they've had more life experience at this. She was a major bitch, since her brain was filled with decades of poisoning that led to giving unwarranted and shitty performance reviews. 

I don't engage them in social settings, and in public spaces I give them evil looks. 

I don't wish general harm on them. I won't destroy their property or want them deported or harmed or anything. I just think they are scummy human beings, and I steer clear of them. I seldom see any good conduct from them. Like I've often done mental tests - if I'm carrying a heavy item, I check how many people would hold a door open for me, or others for that matter. Young guys do. Older guys often do. Little kids of either sex do, as do older women. But hot women in their prime, say 20s and 30s, seldom do. They're off in their own world, and whilst they may hold a ""right"" to this, I hold a ""right"" to assume every one of them is evil and has a dark and scummy heart and soul. 

We should not assume we're all saints or perfect in thought and action. The issue with dark thoughts is how we manage them. 

it's also those who assert they hold no prejduices who are the biggest hypocrites of all. "

All of these are great reasons not to stay, but they make people who don't have the option to leave feel like crap. If leaving was possible, I'd imagine the vast majority would do just that.

It leads to accelerated global mental health decline, self-destruction of our kind, and destruction of Earth's environment.  


We often love to focus and blame humanity's problems on corrupted, ""evil"", and greedy people, especially politicians, which do cause most if not all major problems: Pollution, inequality, lack of rights, addictions, poverty, starvation, crimes, tortures, genocides, massacres, and other ""lovely"" results of our kind.  
But we rarely acknowledge that mental illness and trauma seem to be the ROOT CAUSE of previously mentioned ""corrupted, ""evil"", and greedy people"" that create all these problems. And that this situation WON'T significantly improve until we make research, management and education of mental health and trauma one of our main priorities, if not THE MAIN priority.  


Now of course, it's a problem that is probably impossible to fully solve, at least in the near future. But i truly believe that making it at least one of our main priorities, at least until we reach a certain balance, is the best path we can take.   
And it seems to me, that taking any other path would be like being on a ship that is slowly but steadily sinking because of holes in it, and completely focusing on throwing out the water, instead of plugging the holes and fixing the ship (and we do have the means to do it), which will at least significantly slow down the sinking, if not stopping it.  
Don't get me wrong though. I'm not saying that we should ignore or neglect obvious other problems that we are facing, just increase the priority of the global mental health crisis, to strike hard on the root cause of the problem.

1,2023-08-29,"CMV: The 2023 Denver Nuggets of the NBA would be well within their rights to call themselves the 2023 ""World Champions""",u/eamus_catuli,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/164pkgj/cmv_the_2023_denver_nuggets_of_the_nba_would_be/,changemyview,"Recently, there has been some controversy in the sports world around comments by US track and field sprinter Noah Lyles in which he said:

>""You know the thing that hurts me the most is that I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'world champion' on their head,"" Lyles said. ""World champion of what? The United States?  
""Don’t get me wrong. I love the U.S., at times – but that ain’t the world. That is not the world. We are the world. We have almost every country out here fighting, thriving, putting on their flag to show that they are represented. There ain't no flags in the NBA.""

Afterwards, a slew of NBA stars took to social media to respond in disagreement.  
Lyles's comments are misguided.  

In my view:

\- The Denver Nuggets are the champions of the 2023 NBA season.

\- It is undisputed in the sports world that the NBA is a league comprised of all the best basketball players in the world, not just Americans.  In fact, the two best players on the Denver Nuggets are a Serb and a Canadian.  The NBA is \*the\* premier destination for top basketball talent from everywhere around the globe.  No matter whether a rare basketball talent arises in Africa, or Europe, Asia, or the Americas, the NBA happens to be where the best players all compete.  

As such, the NBA truly has become a global league and serves as a \*de facto\* world organization for the top basketball talent around the world.  Other ""actual"" global organizations like FIBA that hold tournaments cannot hold a candle to the level of global prestige nor top international talent found in the NBA playoffs.

\- Pointing any of this out is NOT American exceptionalism nor arrogance.  Allow me to state clearly: *my argument is NOT that the best players in the world are American*.  I happen to think that the most valuable basketball player in the world right now is a Serbian national named Nikola Jokic.  (Though others would argue that it's Cameroon-born Joel Embiid).  Either way, I think my point here highlights that this is NOT an America-first opinion.  I would say the *exact* same thing if the NBA happened to be located in Europe or Saudi Arabia.

Yes, it is true that the NBA is an organization that was founded in the U.S., whose franchises are mostly located in the U.S. (exception, Toronto), whose owners (or ownership groups) are mostly U.S. nationals.  But I don't think this should matter in the context of crowning a ""world champion"".  

Imagine that the NBA changed its name to the ""World Basketball Association"" and moved 20 of its franchises overseas.  Imagine that next year, the Nuggets franchise repeats its run through the season, emerges as champs, but, instead, play their home games in Prague and play games against the Rome Bulls, the London Celtics (wink), etc.  NOTHING ELSE CHANGES.  Same rosters, same draft process selecting from all over the world. Only difference is where the home games are played.

NOW would the winner of such a ""world league"" be allowed to call itself the ""world champion""?  Does where a team play its home games really matter?  Or isn't it more important to consider where the talent pool for the team/league comes from (only in the U.S. vs. all around the world).

I've seen people argue that, no, they \*still\* could not call themselves ""world champions"", since - they claim - only national teams can claim to be world champions.  To which I respond - ""Why""?  Why can't a privately owned club team be dubbed the ""world champion"" when they compete against the best players in the world and emerge triumphant? What's so special about national teams?  

Again, there currently is no other basketball tournament in the world that matches the level of play and raw talent seen in the NBA Playoffs.  That talent comes from around the world. The winner of that tournament deserves every right to call itself the ""champion of the world"" in the sport of basketball."

An employer puts out expectations for a role and, given your qualified, you just need to find a way to convince them to give you an interview. Once you have the interview you just need to convince them you're better than the other people applying. It's difficult but ultimately simple to navigate:

- If you aren't qualified, figure out how to get qualifications
- If you can't land an interview, get feedback and adjust your strategy
- If you can't beat the competition for a role either upskill or find a less competitive role.

While it isn't cut and dry, you can usually figure out what is likely to help your situation. Coaching is effective as well

Dating on the other hand is vague and complicated. There aren't any qualifications or expectations: you're either attractive or you're not. 

If you're failing at dating there is hardly any way to reorient yourself: 
- You can't get feedback on why someone doesn't find you attractive. Not only is it awkward and socially unacceptable, oftentimes they don't even know why themselves. Attraction is not rational.
- Even if you DO get some form of useful feedback, it's often inactionable or impossible to change (i.e. they don't like your face, height, body, skin tone, personality ECT.)
- Even if the weaknesses are possible to change, there is no way to tell if your efforts will make a difference. You can become qualified for a job by gaining the outlined qualifications but gaining a six pack may do absolutely nothing to get you a date.
- Even if you aren't inherently unattractive, because of the internet everyone is subject to choice overload and bias: normal people are rejected for trivial reasons as a filtering mechanism.
- Being attractive isn't ""coachable"", you either have it or you don't. 

TLDR: Dating sucks and improving at it is trial and error at best, pure luck at worst. Getting a good job is way easier"

I feel like too much effort is put into underperforming kids who cause trouble and refuse to learn, rather than giving special treatment to those who show potential, enjoy learning, and are more likely to benefit society as adults. Best case scenario for a troublemaking kid getting help is that they become average. Best case scenario for giving that support to a kid who’s already excelling is an adult who also excels in various ways, benefits society massively compared to the average person, and especially compared to the below average person.

I don’t necessarily mean we should abandon those with learning disabilities. If they show potential, they can easily be accommodated for. I just think students who are combative and cause issues for their more intelligent peers should not be catered to so frequently as they are now, when focusing instead on those good students would bring about many more benefits."

1,2023-08-29,"CMV: (historical) General Percival did exactly the right thing in surrendering Singapore, and the withdrawal BEF was at least as embarassing",u/PM_ME_UR__ELECTRONS,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/164wbo2/cmv_historical_general_percival_did_exactly_the/,changemyview,"A historical CMV. General Percival has widely been criticised for surrendering Singapore, the best-fortified naval base in the Pacific, to the Japanese virtually without a fight. He was also portrayed as a coward for escaping to Australia. I do not see how this was not the right decision in this place.

Firstly, it was a high command issue, not a Percival issue. The British troops were nearly out of ammunition and had no way of resupplying while Japan had reinforcements and supplies out of Siam. Moreover there were fewer aircraft than the RAF thought necessary to hold the peninsula and most of the allotted tanks had been lend-leased to Russia. While shocked, Churchill admitted that it was *his* greatest failure, not the Singapore garrison's.

It is true that the better party of a field army were surrendered and many suffered terrible conditions at Changi Prison, and exposing the East Indies and Australia. However, had Percival chosen to fight (which he couldn't for long anyway) the Japanese would have gained the upper hand quickly. Against all hope if they had held out until Force Z arrived, it would probably have been torpedoed anyway.

Also, Singapore wasn't just the main naval base in the Far East, it was also a thriving metropolis of 700,000. If there had been fighting in the streets, many civilians would have been killed in the crossfire as in Shanghai. The Japanese had no qualms about this and may even have Nankinged the city afterwards. Having Singapore sacked would be morally far worse than hurting the honour of his Empire (which still ended up winning anyway, and Burma held out for years).

So this was arguably not the worst blunder of the Second World War. While underequipped, the BEF and French had a better fighting chance in France than the imperial force did at Singapore and with better leadership could possibly have contained the German offensive. This is not true for Singapore.

As for his escape, it would have been better than a leader with potentially valuable information on both sides to be interred in Changi."

Well if an F1 driver were placed into a Boxing/Rugby/American Football/Ice Hockey match, they would get knocked the fuck out before the first minute. Not to mention how the F1 driver would slip and fall before getting knocked out with an open ice check in the hockey game.

One of the top reasons that people cite about why F1 is a sport is that drivers face massive gs, and this is true, however this doesn't paint the full picture and is used to misrepresent the physical difficulty of F1. A maximum of 6gs is faced for an extremely limited amount of time, maybe 1 time per lap. And when it happens, it may last for a maximum of 5 seconds. When you break it down like this, it definitely doesn't sound impressive. ""Well their necks get sore after races"", this is a horrible argument. If a person wiggled their fingers for 2 hours, they would become sore. The reason why necks become sore in F1 races is because they're muscles that aren't designed for repeated use, such as legs.

Probably the worst argument that F1 fans make when arguing that F1 is a sport is that the heartrate of drivers reaches 160 beats per minute. This is not impressive, as anyone currently fucking or experiencing a nightmare is going through that. High heartrates do not prove anything. It's the same thing with losing weight. How does losing weight prove that they're competing in a sport? UFC fighters cut much more weight than that all the time and nobody makes a big deal of it.

As for the brake pedal requiring lots of force to depress, when the driver brakes, relative to the car he is thrown forward and it helps him generate force to break. The exact argument that F1 fans make can be used against them. ""6gs !!!"" is what helps the driver press the brake pedal. "

The US educational system has always been pretty terrible and is getting worse. Part of this to me is due to the attempt to push specific ideology and trains of thought in foundational classes rather than teach the subjects. While in some cases I get the idea to be inclusive and accepting, I also think it's inappropriate for a single school to do make this decision as it's taking away a major part of parenting which is guiding your children. 

I also think that forcing a kid to learn a specific stance on something has the potential to go against someone's culture, religions or even personal ideology. I think the most common argument to this is 'well what if the parents are teaching the children wrong' to which I ask ""what is 'wrong'? Is it the way you think children should be raised? How do we know your style isn't wrong?

Also the reason I think it's important is because it takes nothing away from anyone else. As opposed to the school just being banned from teaching something, it makes it so the parents who don't care aren't effected while providing an option to the parents that do. Opting out and alternative curriculums have been a thing for at least since I've been in school so this isn't something new but it seems like there's a lot of push back. 

One example, I remember is during a lesson on Indigenous/Native Americans which the US is complete shit at teaching about. I assume in an effort to make it 'age appropriate' they changed the entire history basically saying "" The colonizers landed, shared food with the native Americans, and they loved it so much they gave them all their land. This is where thanks giving came from."" It wasn't until maybe 6th grade that there was any mention of genocide and even then it was downplayed.

Many liberals believe in personal liberty, freedom and autonomy.

In fact many attended private schools themselves during their baby-boom upbringing. They also do not care for authority figures, such as cops, and routinely break laws (albeit minor ones). They will use drugs, shoot their rifle into the mountainside among other things.

Meanwhile, right-wingers often believe in small government and have libertarian leaning views. They strongly support privatisation and breaking up unions.

To me liberals and right-wingers have basically controlled the GOP and Democrats for decades and that is why the US has been so dysfunctional for so long."

Right now, both men and women can choose all kinds of contraception to avoid pregnancy, but when the conception has happened, only women can choose whether they want to become a parent or not. And it's fair, since the consequences of pregnancy lies on women. The most men can do is to be forced to pay child support to compensate for the dire consequences of a woman going through pregnancy.

Right now, we have these cases:

1. Woman wants the child, man does too = 〇 baby (favors both men and women)
2. Woman wants the child, man doesn't = 〇 baby (favors only women)
3. Woman doesn't want the child, man doesn't = × baby (favors both men and women)
4. Woman doesn't want the child, man does = × baby (favors only women)

Now, once it's possible to transfer the fetus to an artificial womb with the same invasiveness as abortions, the last option should change as such for it to become equal:

1. Woman wants the child, man does too = 〇 baby (favors both men and women)
2. Woman wants the child, man doesn't = 〇 baby (favors only women)
3. Woman doesn't want the child, man doesn't = × baby (favors both men and women)
4. **Woman doesn't want the child, man does = 〇 baby (favors only men)**

In this case, we've given men the same opportunity to choose if they want to become a parent of not without intercepting with woman's bodily autonomy.

Now, we can either keep the same system and force women to pay child support just like men do, or demolish the child support system completely for both genders. It doesn't really matter."

Im not saying don’t use your star power or sports league to spread whatever message you feel is right, hell even raise a black power fist while receiving your Olympic medal.

But if Colin would’ve done things a little differently, he could have used the NFL platform and his star power to amplify his message way beyond anything his twitter or x or whatever its called now account is capable of projecting. maybe it wouldn’t of been entirely his way, but it would have been a better way than it is now. Which is not playing football and not having the voice he should on the issue 

national anthem should be universally respected at all times, ya i get john Carlos and that other guy raised their black power fists in 1968. But were not in 1968, yes we have the same struggle but its in a different environment and with a totally diffrent media culture. MLK as amazing as he was would never survive in today’s media landscape, he would be relegated to a facebook account in spreading his message. People like Colin, and that soccer player everyone hates, they have a chance to not only do the right thing but do it the right way. And not using the national platform as a platform for protest is a really bitching olive branch to offer people right now. Im not saying don’t use your star power or sports league to spread whatever message you feel is right, hell even raise a black power fist while receiving your Olympic medal. Just don’t do it during the national anthem it’s so self defeating it pains me. I want the messages of that hated soccer player, colin, etc etc to not only spread but win. And this is not the way to do it

But it comes to things like FGM, infant circumcision, extremely misogynistic and anti-LGBT beliefs —- these things are violent and just obviously wrong. But cultural relativists would say, “well, those are their traditions so we can’t judge.”

To me this is totally infantilizing the culture in question. They’re essentially claiming these groups/countries can’t grasp that mutilation and dehumanization is wrong. I don’t see why any person who lives in Afghanistan or Israel or Russia would be inherently less able than a Canadian to figure out oppression=bad, and it seems insulting to their intelligence to think so.  

(This is in fact demonstrated by the fact that PLENTY of people within these communities disavow these “traditions.” For example obviously Jewish people are not a monolith and there are plenty who object to infant circumcision.)

Why are people so willing to take cultural relativism to such a dumbass place - usually on behalf of others?

TLDR;
Some things are self-evidently indefensible because they are violent to other humans. Inflicting suffering cannot be cultural - so isn’t it infantilizing to defend these acts on the basis that adults who live in a different place than you can’t understand that as well as you can?"

Then, experts realize the idea is true and accept it... The problem is, the masses tend to follow an idea NOT because it's true, but *only* because the idea got widely accepted.

That means, in 2023, very few people *Think*. Many highly educated people repeat popular sources uncritically. We don't train people to be intelligent, we train people to accept popular opinion and popular scientific worldviews.


Humanity has a tendency to `ThinkLock` - to follow the status quo to a T, to refuse to think independently, and shun people who think different from the status quo.


---

Here are key events showing good ideas, and the tragedy of how people were shut out & attacked:


- Ignaz Semmelweis(Hungarian Scientist)

 > ""We should wash our hands, germs may exist"" -> sent to **mental hospital** & fatally beaten to death in 1865

- Susan B Anthony 1872
 > ""Women should vote"" -> Someone **arrested** Susan B Anthony because she was female and tried to vote


- Albert Einstein (discovered E=mc^2 in 1905)
 > Albert's **principal** said Einstein ""will never amount to anything""

- Martin Luther King 1968
 
 >""Let ALL humans have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" -> Brutally attacked, fatally injured 

Historically, when people have revolutionary **good** ideas, they get attacked, mocked, & punished!

---

2023 *still* has extreme resistance & animosity toward people who think outside the box.

In 2023, almost every idea is polarized, stereotyped, or has some extreme connotation attached to it which prevents us from thinking independently.

---

In order to advance humanity forward, we have to stop ridiculing people who think outside the status quo.

We must exit the `ThinkLock`. 

We are spoon-fed so many *trusted sources*, we rarely have to think for ourselves, which is terrible because once someone comes up with a revolutionary true intelligent idea, the idea does NOT match any of our 'pre-approved' sources, therefore the public rejects, mocks, or ignores actual brilliant ideas that would advance humanity forward and bring us to a new prosperous era.

It's 2023 and humanity still struggles with this historic behavioral tendency:

It’s about the power and influence it buys them in society.

Whether it’s through investment, or even charitable donation, they have the capacity to shape society far beyond whatever their area of expertise may be. 

Consider the founder of Dominos pizza, who decided to donate all his money to charity. Sounds noble, until you realise it all went on anti abortion campaigns. Even if you are pro life (I’m not judging) you have to admit that is a divisive use of power and influence, that extends far beyond expertise in delivering pizza. 

Nowadays, billionaires have a huge amount of influence on our politics through funding political campaigns, and have the ear of supposed representatives of the people. They pay for lobby groups and think tanks to push narratives that suit them. Which are then adopted as scientific fact amongst the political classes. They fund PR campaigns that shape how we all think. 

It is fundamentally undemocratic for a few people to have such unmitigated power. Particularly when it is not necessarily a function of hard work or intelligence. Many of the richest people, started businesses with inherited wealth. And attended exclusive schools and groups to give them a network of highly influential people.

It’s insanely self destructive for a society to allow such a small amount of people to control the levers of everything from our fiscal policy, to the environment, energy, politics, education, health and even our militaries."

I never really had a problem with it until I've started interacting with or seeing more of these people in day-to-day life as opposed to back in my, more admittedly sheltered, home in Ireland.

It started with a rather bad experience of seeing a trans person wearing highly inappropriate clothing in the middle of a shopping mall in full view of multiple children; no one seemed to raise any concerns as far as I could tell. In all honesty, this horrified me beyond words and could not comprehend how someone, regardless of anything else, could behave in such a way. If I'm remembering correctly, there may have even been elements of BDSM involved. And since then, I've really only seen other trans people who made me feel deeply uncomfortable in other ways. From staring, to making rude comments among their group. Hearing someone cuss and moan in a wig while in the middle of a GameStop of all places didn't exactly win me over to the whole idea, needless to say.

Now, my opinions are not all in one place either. For example, it's not transexuals (people who have, in fact, transitioned medically) that bother me, rather the ones who don't transition and try to claim womanhood for themselves, and even wanting to define it without even having experienced it anywhere outside their bedroom (or GameStop, I suppose). Transexuals must, by committing permanently, go through a lot, if not most, of what any other woman goes through, given time. So that seems more nitpicky to exclude them, if you ask me. And this specifically is something that makes me wonder how to approach this issue, or even my own feelings on the matter. I've researched a lot recently, and part of me even wonders and worries if I'm being maybe overtly judgmental. TERFs, transmedicalists, I've heard some of these words being tossed around and I'm unsure as to how much they may apply to my opinions, or the full extent of their implications even.

I suppose I'm worried more about the problematic aspects and behaviors of transgender people as well as the typical ideas of gender in general now popular in the mainstream. Special mention goes to 'people who menstruate' (or breed, or lactate, or whatever that stupidity was), not to mention sending years' worth of death threats to JK Rowling and the like. But, of course, I'm not at all fond of some of the **other** ideas knocking around either. I intensely dislike things such as the alt-right, q-anon, magas, all of them. So, this isn't an 'anti-woke' post, so to speak. To the contrary, I am a very unapologetic feminist whose main concern is that wiping away all understood notions of what women are (sex, our lives and experiences, both good and bad) and replacing them with minimum effort and vaguely defined ideas of gender self-identification and the like will only make it harder for us to live freely in a world that has never been very kind to women. As I said, I'm alright with specific cases, such as transexuals (I believe there's only about 30,000 legitimate and recorded individuals in the us, unless I'm mistaken? Which sort of reinforces everything I've said.), but I don't want that to make it seem like I don't fiercely care about women's issues in the larger sense. I have suffered so much in my life, as well as my mother, and I just can't believe women's real struggles can be diluted by men, dressed like men, calling themselves women whose only idea of womanhood is... anime. And GameStop, ***naturally***.

But again, I may simply be overreacting, and I am on CMV for a reason. This is very new to me, I know I have been unaware of these debates in many ways, and since it's now there in front of me, I do want to confront it, even be challenged myself. Am I actually a TERF, or am I just going through some culture shock? I want to discuss it because I'm not fond of ignoring a discussion when it can clearly mean so much to many people.

So go on, CMV. I really would like to get some more perspectives on the matter. And I do thank you kindly for your time.

1. most people ignore this law and drink before they’re 21. It’s odd to have a law that the majority of the population breaks. IMO it creates a disrespect for the law in general.

2. When I went to college, because I wasn’t allowed to get alcohol safely, at a restaurant with friends, our only option was to go to a frat house and drink the punch that they could have put anything inside of. I personally know a girl that was raped after a frat party. Outlawing drinking until you’re 21 just makes people put themselves in dangerous positions to drink.

3. The age was raised to 21 in order to lower the amount of drunk drivers. I agree if you drive after drinking then you’re a terrible person. But the type of person who would drive drunk definitely isn’t the type of person who would listen to the law about waiting until you’re 21 to drink.

4. When I joined my sorority the very first meeting they had all the new members bring photos of ourselves we took at CVS along with filling out a form with our info. They did this so they could place an order for fake ID’s for all the new members. My point in sharing this is to show how common fake ID’s are. Like most freshmen in college get fake ID’s. The problem with this IMO is that we are giving money to people who probably aren’t the best (think cartels and gangs who make the fake IDs)"

If you really think that sex work is real work, just as legitimate as any other form of work, you should view these two situations as equivalent. But the vast majority of people who assert that sex work is real work would think the latter situation is exploitative

Similarly, if sex work is real work, there is nothing wrong with going up to a random woman at the grocery store and offering her money for sex

But everyone knows that it would be messed up to do this, because deep down everyone knows that sex is special and isn't merely another form of labor"

I get it. But there are numerous cases I can think of where a tax payer end up violating wash sale rule without the intention to commit tax evasion.

&#x200B;

1) A tax payer holds shares at a loss. In order to liquidate the stock without loosing money, the tax payer buys additional shares to average down his position. Within the 30 days, he/she finds a good opportunity to sell the shares. 

&#x200B;

2) A tax payer holds shares whose value is decreasing rapidly. He/she thinks holding the share further will result in a greater loss and hence sells the share at a loss. Within the 30 days, the stock drops to a level where he/she views as a good opportunity to buy.

&#x200B;

3) A tax payer holds ordinary share of SPAC stock at a loss. He/she thinks the price of ordinary shares will drop further but not below $11.5. He/she sells the ordinary share at loss and purchases the warrant of the same company. 

&#x200B;

Wash sale rule should go away or be modified to stop the government from punishing tax payers with no intention to commit tax evasion.

1,2023-08-30,CMV: «Cancel culture» is a natural result of free market capitalism,u/Asbergerr,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/165ho5r/cmv_cancel_culture_is_a_natural_result_of_free/,changemyview,"I see, especially in the American culture-debate, that it is mostly the political right that takes much of a stance against cancel culture. This sentiment is being brought over to europe (where I am based) as well in the past few years, were the terms ‘woke’ and ‘canceling’ is associated with the political left.

The way I see it, however, is that cancel culture as a concept seems tied to the ideas of a free market. The public have their freedom of choice with what companies they want to engage with. If company A displays values that one group agrees with, and company B displays the opposite, they are free to spend their money at company A instead.

Because companies are there to make money and grow, the market will of course lead them to step away from displaying values that will lose them potential revenue. Of their own choice. This is again how I understand market forces to work in simple terms.

So why then, do you think, the political side who is the most positive towards keeping said market free are so opposed to cancel culture? The only way I see it is that I am either missing some critical detail here, or this is just another example of immense political hipocrisy.

I also would like to make three more points related to this:

1. I am no economist, so perhaps I am misunderstanding how the political right wants to define the free market they are touting.
2. In the case of individuals who are seen as victims og being canceled: these people are not at all taken away their freedoms for expressing their views. They can still spend their money on whatever they want, they can still post their opinions wherever they are welcome. No one is, however, entitled to have their opinion spread without putting work into it. If being canceled makes you lose twitter followers, you can still post whatever you want there: people just won’t bother reading it.
3. The last issue with this view I personally was able to reason is that people can be unfairly branded as a wide variety of negative -isms. Now this is, in my view, is mostly allowed to happen through free access for anyone (regardless of their level of critical thinking) to online spaces of communication. Comapnies like Twitter/X or Meta. Products of the free market.

If I have not made it clear, I am not positive toward cancel culture. I, like most of reddit I would think, wants a society that respects a multitude of opinions. This is what democracy should be. But the way I see it, it seems problematic that it is the right that is anti-woke and the left that is pro-woke in these debates, when the whole phenomenon stems from the market giving this freedom to consumers, the same market that one side wants to run free whilst the other want to restrict it."

It allowed people with conflicting views to acknowledge the existence of each other and respect each other’s beliefs. But I feel like people have either lost sight of the fact that tolerance is limited or implicitly recognize it’s limited but still act as if it can be applied without care. Everyone can agree Nazis are bad. Everyone can agree pedophiles are bad. There is no tolerance for the view that Nazism is good and there is no tolerance for the view that sex with a child is not bad. There is a line of acceptability and those views cross it. But people seem to not understand they can also cross that line and don’t accept the movement of the line.

Many vegans believe that to kill an animal when there are alternative ways of sustenance is wrong and equivalent to the killing of a human. Therefore, people who eat meat are accomplices to murder. Regardless of whether you think this is correct, you can at least recognize that you would not tolerate someone who you believe is an accomplice to murder, especially if they think that they’re in the right. That would/should likely piss you off similar to how pedophiles saying children can consent is wrong would/should piss you off. But there’s this illusion that their (supposed) support of murder requires tolerance. It’s especially baffling when vegans rebuke their fellow vegans and act as if one should be respectful to someone who, in their perspective, commits one of the deepest moral wrongs that exist. I’m using veganism because it’s the most morally ambiguous example I can think of. Many people who accept that dogs and cats don’t deserve to get abused get uncomfortable when you bring up the fact that pigs, cows, and chickens are just as, if not more intelligent. However, this applies with more controversial situations as well. 

If you are talking to someone and they believe abortion is murder, arguing to them that people should be allowed to have an abortion is simply saying that people should have the right to kill babies. Everyone can agree that killing babies is, on its head, wrong, and you would/should be shocked to hear someone promote that. There’d be no sense in allowing people to kill babies for the same reason there’d be no sense in allowing any other violent crime. Why should someone have the freedom to do something that harms others but benefits them? We can take this logic even further, towards religion. If everyone who doesn’t accept Jesus is going to suffer eternal punishment, then the morally correct action would be to get other people to accept Jesus even if it harms them. If someone’s about to jump into an oncoming train, you should try to save them even if you end up dislocating their shoulder in the process. In fact, you could say it would be morally wrong to say “live and let live.” The only reason you would let someone do whatever sin they want would be if you *didn’t* believe that eternal punishment existed. And that’s the crux of my view. 

Tolerance is incompatible with some ideologies so it makes no sense we try to encourage tolerance no matter their beliefs. If I believe that you regularly do deep wrong, I would not tolerate you and the only way it would make sense for me to tolerate you is if I didn’t believe that you regularly do deep wrong. So you’d either have to disavow me of my beliefs or stop doing wrong. There has to be actual questions over whether religions are correct and not just platitudes about religious tolerance and freedom. There has to be actual questions over whether abortion is murder and not just deflections to “what about the mother?” Or at the very least, you’d have to prove the mother matters more. There has to be actual questions over whether killing animals for consumption is morally wrong and not just “oh those crazy vegans”-type statements that conveniently ignore your own possible wrongdoings.

Even on very minor topics of “who’s the best character in a series”, discussion dies out because “it’s my opinion.” Why do people think that’s a legitimate response? It does not matter. If your reasoning is flawed, it’s flawed. We’ve let people get away with intentional ignorance under the name of tolerance on a very inconsistent basis."

I am NOT talking about going straight to hitting. I am NOT talking about repeatedly hitting children. I am NOT talking about anything like that.

What I am talking about is that small children do not have a good concept of an action now leading to an action in the future. Telling a 4-year-old ""if you take your sister's toy you won't get any dessert"" is meaningless; dessert isn't happening for anyone for another several hours. 

Taking away a toy or activity can easily end up with either more screaming about them wanting to do *only that* activity or moving on to something else such that there isn't any real consequence associated with the behavior.

So it seems to me that it would be appropriate to say ""If you \[take the toy, scream at your brother, throw your food, ...\] *then* I will spank you."" The punishment is clearly stated, immediate, and completely tangible. It also can act as a pattern interrupt against the immediately current behavior.

&#x200B;

My wife and I already have a ""no spanking"" policy. I'm not looking for validation to hit my kids. I'm noticing behavior trends that I feel need a more clear and immediate consequence and this view makes sense to me as an option, so I want my view changed if I'm looking at this wrong."
1,2023-08-30,Cmv: totalitarianism is better than democracy,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/165ljl2/cmv_totalitarianism_is_better_than_democracy/,changemyview,"
The question of whether totalitarian governments are more effective than democracies has been a topic of debate for years. The reason for doubt is almost always pointed to the United States. But this isn't a fair example. They are in a unique position. They are situated on a piece of land that has a combination of tons of natural resources, very fertile land, and completed isolated from all the other major military powers. There is no other country in the world that has all of this with the degree of natural sources the US has. So  by examining the case of China, a one-party totalitarian dictatorship that has emerged as a global economic powerhouse. We will also consider historical examples, such as the United Kingdom's imperial past and the United States' growth during times of increased federalist powers, to shed light on the effectiveness of different governance systems.

China is my exple of in the effectiveness of a totalitarian government. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has maintained an iron grip on power since its founding in 1949. Under the guise of socialism, the CCP has effectively managed the country's rapid economic growth, transforming it into the world's largest economy. This economic success, characterized by unprecedented infrastructure development and industrialization, suggests that totalitarian governments can indeed be effective in achieving specific goals, such as economic growth.


To better understand the effectiveness of different governance systems, let us look back at the British Empire, which was once the world's largest and most powerful colonial empire. The British Empire expanded by exploiting the resources of other nations and establishing dominance through military might. While effective in building a vast empire, this approach came at a significant cost in terms of human rights abuses and social inequality. It highlights the potential pitfalls of authoritarianism.


I did mention the US initially as a rebuttal but we can also point to it's largest period of growth. During World War II and the Cold War, the U.S. experienced rapid economic growth as federalist powers increased. Federal laws compelled production and, in some cases, controversially curtailed civil liberties, particularly during the Red Scare. While this expansion of federal powers led to economic growth and technological advancements, it raised important questions about the balance between security and personal freedoms.


So my belief when we look towards these three examples it becomes evident that the effectiveness of a government depends on the goals it prioritizes. Totalitarian governments may excel in achieving specific objectives, such as economic growth, but often at the expense of individual liberties. Democracies, on the other hand, emphasize personal freedoms and participation in governance, which can sometimes lead to slower decision-making processes but offer greater checks and balances."
1,2023-08-30,CMV: Religion is a scam and not real. There’s no proof Jesus or any of it is actually real and existed.

Was never really explained and it was just something my parents did because their parents did it and so on.

I went to Christian private school. We were forced to give devotionals about how you found god. Everyone there were active in their church and crying about how they found god etc.

Most of the people going to this church were former drug addicts, cheated on their wife, etc had issues were in and out of prison.

One day I said what proof is there that Jesus existed? They were shocked and I got expelled. They also claimed Jesus was a white man with blue eyes living in a middle eastern village?!

I guess under their logic. God is white and impregnated Mary (middle eastern). She was a virgin. Her husband Joseph also middle eastern never had sex with her. So she was basically a surrogate for a white baby. Jesus was born, he stood out in the town because he was the only white person there. He was also 6’0+. He had magical powers and healed people. Turned water to wine.

Now realistically, this sounds like the plot of Harry Potter. One guy born he’s the “chosen one”. Comes back from the dead.. I’ve had other religious people say but he’s not white because his parents were not white. Well if Mary was a virgin and never had sex wouldn’t she just be a surrogate for gods child?

There’s zero proof any of this was real. It’s physically impossible for someone to cure a blind man with mud, or water to wine or die and come back to life and disappear to heaven.

Scientifically speaking when you die you just don’t exist anymore and there’s just nothing. You fall into a trance and are in a deep sleep mentally your body turns to dust. Yes we don’t know for sure what happens but every church I have attended the owners are millionaires and want donations. The whole thing seems like a scam and they get offended when you ask for proof it’s real.

They also portray Jesus as a white man in a middle eastern town.. So was Mary just a surrogate for a white man? Was Jesus born to Mary and Joseph and their bio son who just preached a religion he created from a higher power?

Why are people so invested in something that’s clearly fantasy? Starting wars murdering people."

She’s writing, if I had to guess, primarily to people on the progressive left of the political spectrum and who are, likely, black as well. 

There’s a throwaway line in the book she has where she’s talking about the America and she says something to effect of ”this country may not even be worth saving”. And I thought “wow, that’s not a statement you hear from a lot of other academics in other countries.”

Even postcolonial feminists, while debating laws that limit a woman’s very right to exist as an independent adult, Algeria for example, would never say that their country isn’t worth saving. They’d never even contemplate it. And even criticizing things like marital rape, polygyny or institutionalized sexism that deprives women of agency or autonomy are always very careful to in their words to avoid generalizations in their works and to respect “traditional” cultures. 

Yet time and time again we see literature pushed out by colleges and universities in America attempting to “debunk” America and its “myths”. Take the 1619 Project for example or works by a historian like Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz who seeks to expose America for the fraud it is when it comes to our story as a “nation of immigrants”. These academics won’t tell us what we are but they will tell us what we aren’t. And that’s anything good."

The sheer fact that someone of similar ethnic background stabbing someone else back to me feels viscerally wrong.

At least hate crimes are rooted in some form of tribalism baked into our evolutionary history (no that does not mean I support hate crimes don’t you people dare take me out of context). So the thought of hate crimes happening and existing feels a little more understandable, though of course I never condone harming your fellow mankind.

To go after your own ethnic kin is some Cain and Able evil right there. No reason no justice just pure malice. 

I’ve never had to ever think about how evil people can be till today. And I hate these people just for that reason alone.

I am tired of this modern narrative claiming that 'college is a waste of money'. What it should be labelled as is 'bad majors are a waste of money'. Now, I am not trying to bash on people's interests or hobbies, and I 100% think if you are interested in pursuing a specific major you should SOLELY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, not income purposes.  
  
Every person I have had a debate/conversation with who regrets their college education either majored in journalism, liberal arts, humanities, or a language (literature, creative writing, etc.). And I always tell them, NO WONDER YOU COULD NOT FIND A JOB! Because these majors are not in a societal demand that requires higher education to become proficient or qualified. If your goal is to go to college to find a career, you need to find something that is not only interesting to you but also valuable and in demand to society in the current decade. That is not to say that those majors are not valuable, but they offer lower salary positions than science or tech degrees in the job market.  


If you are interested in arts, humanities, or language, you do a  decent job at self-teaching and utilizing resources outside of a privatized institution, such as relatively cheap online classes and textbooks you can purchase online or pirate for free. For example, anyone who wants to become a writer can probably do so without getting into hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. The same thing goes for musicians. The small exception to this is anyone hoping to get a teaching position in any of these disciplines, which is extremely hard and rare. A humanities professor I spoke to recently told me that tenure track positions for PhDs/post-docs at higher education institutions are almost impossible to land. ""His exact words were, there are 2 spots for every 100 PhDs nationwide."" However, its unfair to label college as a scam to high school kids accross the country on social media, promising unlimited wealth by seemingly doing nothing simply because people refuse to see the value in STEM + professional degrees.   


For example:  
  
\- Engineering, medical sciences, immunology, biochemistry, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, Computer science, computer engineering, aeronautical engineering, etc.  
  
Every successful person I know is either an engineer, medical professional, or PhD in one of or related to the aforementioned fields working in industry.  
  
My single mother decided to go to University when I was eight years old. She did an undergrad, master's, and PhD in Pharmaceutical sciences. By the time she was done, I was 22 years old, and she was 47. Her life was a financial mess, and she could only do it because of the financial child support offered by my father to give me a stable childhood. She was finished with around $165,000 in debt, above average for her field. She got a job lined up pre-graduation in big pharma in 2018 starting at $90,000 and has now company-hopped her way up to $140,000 + $45,000 from a post-doc she is doing simultaneously from home (COVID helped tremendously with the job market). Her major was IN DEMAND, and probably always will be. That is nothing compared to the demand for computer science and tech majors in our advancing world. My biggest regret is not pursuing a tech or accounting degree.   
  
Before anyone says those majors are 'difficult' or some people aren't smart enough for them, I completely disagree. Anyone is capable of succeeding. It all comes down to mindset and discipline.

But I've noticed something that's been bothering me – the strong resistance of some Italians to changing up their traditional recipes.  
For instance, there's this unwavering rule that ""Carbonara must always have guanciale."" And if you even suggest throwing in some garlic, it's like you've committed a serious offense. And don't even think about adding cheese to a fish dish! Even more, if you propose putting chicken on a pizza, be ready for some serious backlash from the ancestors.

  
I get that these declarations are often made jokingly (most of the time). But the idea that trying something new will wreck classic dishes seems to be deeply rooted in Italian cooking. Go to an y video online of someone cooking an Italian dish and read the comments, they will be full of outrage from people declaring how wrong methods or ingredients have been used. Honestly, I'm worried that holding onto this mindset could harm the future of Italian food.

  
Interestingly, some of the absolute best pizza joints aren't even in Italy. And some of the my favourite Italian restaurants are located outside the country (and I've travelled Italy a lot). These places have managed to give classic recipes a modern spin while keeping the heart of Italian cooking alive – simple recipes with the freshest ingredients.

  
Sadly, this attitude toward cooking has taken a worrisome turn recently. Italy is the first country in the world to outright ban lab-grown meat, despite many EU governments investing hundreds of millions in this novel technology. This method could be a game-changer, producing meat without the need to raise and slaughter animals. It's a scientifically sound and ethical approach. But this decision reminds me of times in history when stubborn beliefs hindered scientific progress.

  
To wrap it up, let me emphasize that I truly enjoy Italian cuisine. Yet, I'm urging for a more open attitude to change – a willingness to mix things up while holding onto what makes Italian cooking special. This flexibility could breathe new life into Italian food and keep it shining on the world stage. It's a departure from rigidity, kind of like those moments in history when old beliefs held back new ideas."

Hidden fees distort the free market and make it harder for customers to fairly do price comparisons. These fees are deceptive and can often add up to 40% of the advertised price.

I’m tired of clicking on a $49 dollar ticket for a show to find out it’s really $70 when I go to checkout.  Or a $50/night hotel room having a mandatory $30/night “resort fee”

Similar policy should apply to things like hotel rooms, car rentals, phone bills and all sorts of other consumer purchased goods.

If a fee is variable (like shipping) or taxes, I could see that not being included in an advertised price if they can’t be reasonably determined at the time of advertising.  a TV commercial for a national brand, they could say “$499 + tax” since the tax is different everywhere.

However, for sales where the tax CAN be determined, it should be included in the price.  A hotel room should advertise the total price, since the tax calculation is based on where the hotel is, and can be reasonably determined at the time of advertising.

This greater price transparency would greatly benefit consumers."

Because not enough psych wards try to talk or reason with people first. They put patients on drugs without first checking if there's a logical reason or traumatic event behind the illogical behavior.


Unlike physical health care, mental health experts cannot do physical scans of the brain to access what specifically is the root cause of the problem.

So when there's a behavioral issue, the experts assume it's a physical brain problem. Experts give patients drugs to 'fix' something which may not be a physical issue at all.

---

The problems many patients have stem from bad circumstance & severe neglect which CANNOT be fixed through drugs. In 2023, mental health care tends to ignore the patient's emotional & psychological needs.

The instance of pharmaceutical drugs as the 'solution' can be profit-driven instead for the patient's best interest. Some mental-health doctors are reported profit off patients' insurance by putting patients on new drugs at the patients physical & emotional expense.

There are many patients, whose core mental health issue is caused by lack of good human connection, lack of intelligent love, lack of good friends, and lack of good environment.

1,2023-08-30,CMV: Plastic Bag Bans Are Less Effective Than Fees,u/Ok_Spell1407,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/165vixw/cmv_plastic_bag_bans_are_less_effective_than_fees/,changemyview,"Background: I live in a state where plastic bags are banned entirely. The total banned followed a two year fee period. I also work in retail, so I have first hand experience with bagging. Most retailers in my state charged the fee for two years, though some switched to paper or reusable bags almost immediately. Nearly everyone I know cut their single-use bag usage by 80-90%, myself included. Humans are forgetful though, so sometimes I had to cough up the 10 cent fee for a bag. I would then go on to save that bag as either a trash bag or dog waste bag. 

However, I believe the outright ban is where we went wrong. Since the outright ban, stores now offer legal alternatives to single use plastic bags. It's a fairly even split between paper bags and thicker ""reusable"" plastic bags. Stores rarely charge for either of those. Now, many people simply neglect to bring their own bags at all, because they know they'll get a bag at no charge. I constantly see people walking out of stores with carts full of paper bags or thicker plastic bags. 

Also of interest is my own experience working in retail. During the time of the fee, I noticed many people either carrying items, or bringing their own bags. Only 15-20% of customers would be willing to cough up the fee for the plastic bag. Now, since those plastic bags have been replaced with paper bags, noticeably more say yes when I ask if they'd like a bag. Also, I can count on my hands the amount of times people have brought their own bags since the fee ended. Paper bags are also measurably more difficult and slower to bag products in. 

All this has led me to conclude that these ""reusable bags"" have simply taken the place of single use plastic bags. 

""But wait! Why not charge a fee on reusable bags?"" 

Well, my last argument actually answers that question. I believe that the fee itself was not the deterrent from using plastic bags. The fee was actually a subtle reminder that using those bags is environmentally unfriendly. Seriously, the dollar fee for 10 bags won't break the bank. Now, if we charge a similar fee on bags that are supposed to be environmentally responsible, I think the fee will lose its desired effect. Also, retailers will be burdened with the responsibility of collecting the fee AND inconvenient-to-use bags. "

Putting it another way, it is possible to empathize with and agree with violence despite knowing the act breaks the law. For example, there are cases of parents enacting vigilante justice against their loved ones' abusers and are penalized in turn for it. [Marianne Bachmeier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Bachmeier) appeared in court and shot her daughter's murderer dead and chiefly received compassion for the act despite serving prison time.

In other rare but existing cases, some face minimal to no penalty at all. Such an example would be [Gary Plauché](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Plauch%C3%A9), who shot and killed his son's molester in broad daylight and subsequently avoided prison time. In a case such as Gary's, a high measure of consideration was given to the circumstances that would lead a person to do this. The defense argued he was at a highly emotional place and couldn't think clearly. It was empathized with and understood because we can surmise that if (god forbid) put in a similar position as Gary or Marianne, thinking clearly would be difficult for most of us.

I propose this reasoning can be applied to people who respond with violence towards bigots, whether on an individual level (kicking a racist man down the stairs for threatening Black children with a knife), or on a macro, systemic level (protesting and rebelling against social systems that allow the murder of unarmed Black citizens). The examples here and throughout this post are racial, but my argument pertains to any form of bigotry that leads to, promotes, co-signs, or reinforces abuse and injustice towards targeted groups.

**In the Case of Violent Bigotry**

Violence against violent bigots should be a no-brainer, but there are those who believe recipients of bigotry shouldn't ""stoop down"" to the same level as their abusers when defending themselves (see criticisms of Montgomery Brawl). This position is easily debunked when you analyze the grounds for self defense and when it can/should be applied.

Unfortunately, of course, this attitude of ""not bullying the bully"" predates the Montgomery Brawl by centuries. Turn the other cheek is a doctrine that has its place in keeping the peace, but its application often stifles the ability to feel compassion for those whose cheeks remained unturned. Growing up, I recall criticisms of [The Black Panthers for being parallel to the KKK,](https://digitalcommons.law.seattleu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2345&context=sulr) which is an absurd position considering the levels of destruction caused by the KKK and how diametrically opposed they were to the belief system of the Panthers. This isn't to say the Panthers are without fault, but their militance in response to the insurmountable racial violence surrounding Black people at the time is a perfect example of violence with reason.

Perhaps the most pervasive example of the decade is the non-peaceful riots that sprouted up in tandem with BLM protests to George Floyd's murder in 2020. It is a mass-scale showcase of meeting a nauseating act of violence with violence. [Think pieces](https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2022/01/06/jan-6-capitol-riot-black-lives-matter-242162) about the efficacy of looted Targets aside, there should not have been surprise that violence erupted from Floyd's public execution, especially when taking into account the decades' worth of police brutality that preceded it.

Simply put, if you are punched in the face, you punch back if it means preserving yourself.  It's furthermore dubious to lecture abused parties how they should defend themselves as a substitute for criticizing the violent behavior that necessitated self defense to begin with.

**In the Case of Non-Violent Bigotry** 

Violence against non-violent bigotry is more difficult defend at face value and may be where this post receives the most pushback, but I believe there is a case for it. An argument I often hear is, ""People shouldn't be brutalized for simply being mean or using [bad words](https://journals.openedition.org/estetica/2063?lang=en),"" but I maintain this view stems from a struggle to empathize with the actual consequences of bigotry. Perhaps this is because discrimination isn't a universal experience for all and won't strike as hot for those who never encounter it on a regular basis. 

For those who do, it is not a matter of meanness, it is a matter of threatening a person's right to exist. It is a threat that has led and leads to unspeakable suffering, including but not limited to the violent forms of bigotry discussed above. Therefore, when expressed even through non-violent behavior (such as **slurs, racial profiling,** and **micro-aggressions**) there is an inherent co-signing of the traumatic and abusive repercussions of bigotry, and a stress response that follows. 

Recipients are put in high levels and often sudden, compromised positions of [**danger, stress, anxiety, degradation, and fear.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3483920/) Often, there are only so many ways within a short amount of time for a person to decide how to properly respond. All of this, in my views, amounts to violence as an expected outcome, even if it's not always considered the best outcome. It is, at the end of the day, another act of self defense. 

Since bigotry is not a universal experience that everyone can comprehend the damage of the way we might Marianne Bachmeier and Gary Plauché's situations, I put forth additional scenarios where violence can be argued as an expected response, even if not legally protected.

\- witnessing a loved one being degraded and abused

\- someone degrading and insulting your child

\- someone mocking the death of a loved one

The list is endless, but the intense feelings surrounding such cruelties are the same as those who encounter bigots and often more because of the added element of threat and fear that comes with bigotry.

**Conclusion**

Like with anything, there are obvious limitations. Intentions can be misconstrued. Violence can escalate to indiscriminate cruelty. Violence as self defense is restricted by the law for this reason, but there are cases in which even the law can't deem it wholly unjustified. We each have an obligation to respect the physical and conceptual boundaries of our fellow human. But if that obligation falters in sparing the welfare of those who wish you nothing but misery and death, I firmly believe there should be no reason for surprise.

Change my view.

**TLDR**

If a bigot bigots, they should expect to get slapped."

So many time we see cruelty in the world and online for utterly trivial reasons, people’s lives get ruined over something small blown completely out of proportion, people driven to suicide just because of such

For example:
John can unintentionally throw a baseball into  Jessicas’s house, and instead of being reasonable her family scream and cry and attack John’s family, this makes his family attack the others because they use it as justification, meanwhile John and Jessica both knew it was an accident but their families are “protecting them” by killing each other, over a fucking baseball

People just want justification for hate, for drama, for suffering, for war. Because they love it, and while there are good people they are way too few and far between

I hate when they act like their better than them, because the second they bully innocent people so *slightly* have to do with a problematic situation, they’re immediately on the same level

When you’re on the internet there’s no need to pretend to be nice because you’re hiding behind a username, everyone shows their true colors, that’s why there are so many Incels and Nazis online, because it’s who they really are, who humanity tries to be

This discussion has been going around for ages and when i read blog posts about it, i never see the actual kids who grew up with it speak about how it affected them. because their opinions matter the most. 

I will say i can take initiative to my flaws and failures in life and am not trying to blame the complete lack of technology for my issues but i will say that it was a harmful nurture. 

Kids these days will be very isolated to their classmates who discuss about the last tv show, video game or movie they have seen. It made me feel out of place and weird for not having the one thing everyone around me had. I had to lie to my friends because i was embarrassed to tell them about my home situation. i hated it

It also stunts creativity or passions in life. I spent most of my childhood outside or inside the home with nothing to do. If i had technology before maybe i could have pursued coding or writing but i never had access to any of it. 

In general it made me extremely bored and pessimistic as a kid. Wanting to be like other kids who could play games, seeing the kid beside me at he hospital play on his ipad and my heart being broken, it was terrible."

He just made it up. The exact formula to calculate energy doesn't matter. Really, all we need to know is that there's lots of energy in small things.  


Mass is measured in grams. We didn't discover what a gram is; we just made it up. The speed of light is measured in meters and seconds. Likewise, we didn't discover either of those things. All of these units of measurements are nothing more than a figment of our collective imaginations. We decided what they all are.  


The speed of light is a ratio. You can't just square a ratio without completely changing the ratio. If the length of a meter was different, or if the length of a second was different, then the ratio between meters and seconds for the speed of light would be different, and that would make the square of that ratio not even slightly the same as it is now.  


ALL of the numbers involved in the equation for Energy are completely made up.   


By the way, the square of the speed of light isn't actually a thing. You can't square a ratio that has two different units of measurement. Think of it this way - what's 5 seconds plus 3 meters? The entire concept of the square of the speed of light is absurd. Or, if you can't wrap your head around that, try this on for size - what's the square of the US national minimum wage?"

I saw a post on r/cats about someone’s cat being killed by dogs. Some of comments said that cats shouldn’t be allowed out unsupervised but I disagree.


Idk here so basically cats and dogs are different.
Cats are solo hunters it is in their nature and dogs are group hunters in their nature.

Here is why I disagree that cats should be on indoors or on leashes like dogs:

1. Cats must be let out on their own for a hunt or they will become depressed as hunting is a big part of their nature keeping them inside all the time or on a leash is cruel. Of course there is toys but still not the same.

2. People say this must be done for the cats safety for example in this post OPs cat was killed by a group of pit balls. But I disagree because that is why you should keep your dog on a leash until your in an area like a park where the safer animals know to stay away from.

3. It is very unlikely and unheard of that a child has been killed by a cat. But it is heard of that children have been killed by dogs. Of course not all dogs will go after people but most will do so for animals so see point 2.

4. Then there is the argument that cats go out and kill rats and stuff. So? There are lots of other animals out there that will be killing these smaller animals like large birds and foxes. Keeping your cat inside or on a leash will not prevent these small birds and mice etc from being killed because they have multiple predators.

5. As for cats being hit by cars this is often due to an easy mistake of the cat being difficult to see especially in the dark so keeping your cat inside at night should lower the chances of this happening significantly. But really there is no absolute way of preventing this it is like how children may be hit by cars when playing in the road or running into the road. 

I think people tend to forget that cats are not dogs and shouldn’t be treated like dogs for this reason.

Like I often see people comparing cats to dogs and they will act differently then people will be like this is why dogs are better than cats! Like yeah they act different because they’re different animals. Don’t see people comparing dogs to rabbits."

Some people however are just unfit to own a dog. I find that many people don’t even acknowledge their pet is an animal and refuse to acknowledge the breed’s characteristics of which they adopt. Pitbulls would be far less of a contentious issue if the people who adopted them trained them adequately. A lot of dog bites come from people who don’t have the time for their dog or the space for their dog, people who don’t correct behaviour etc.  Most times  a dog gets put down for biting it’s a moral failure on the owner. It’s cruel on these dogs to be bred in a certain way and to be adopted by lazy humans who will not train walk and care for these dogs. It is not an intrinsic right we should have to own another animal and before adopting a dog I believe you must be able to demonstrate your ability to make sure you can adequately care and train your dog."

What is often ignored is that the average person (especially in developing nations or historical states) has many personal problems and is just trying to live their day-to-day lives. Going on a huge and dangerous moral crusade to save a group of people you don't even belong to and might not even be able to pay you back seems completely foolhardy from their perspective. What you also must understand is that nobody is born in a completely neutral environment; morals and beliefs all come from somewhere. The people who partook in any historical atrocity or even merely ""looked the other way"" were fed ton of propaganda from birth justifying how abusing/killing the bad people is righteous and in-line with what God wants. The people in such societies have access to completely different information/technology than what modern Western kids have along with a different lifestyle. And it is not like modern westerners don't have their own biases and ignorant beliefs as well.

Before being offended that people in another land or in another time are committing major atrocities, how about some people try to fix the major wrongdoings going on in their own homeland first. Let's focus on the USA since most Redditors are from there. How many Americans support prison reform? How many Americans support animal rights? How many Americans want to stop climate change? How many Americans actually engage in protests? How many Americans even bother to boycott?

Everyone likes to imagine they would be the hero, but in reality, they would probably only join the heroes once their victory is inevitable. Assuming you aren't a member of the persecuted group, your average person nowadays wouldn't oppose chattel slavery if they were born in the 18th Century New World. The average person wouldn't oppose The Holocaust if they were a German during the 1930s/1940s, the average person wouldn't oppose the apartheid if they were a White South African in the 1960s. The average person wouldn't join a secular revolution if they lived in an Arab theocracy. This is not to say brave revolutionaries don't exist, or otherwise societies would never change. But revolutions more often succeed due to external forces and extra-political factors than they do to brave heroes finally saying enough is enough and standing up for what is right.

To change my view, you have to demonstrate that either ""evil regimes"" have a lot less popular support than I think, or that a significant part of the population opposing an atrocity that doesn't directly affect them is actually quite common."

1,2023-08-31,CMV: High school English classes should consider what students might enjoy reading only secondarily,u/Fact875,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/166i5iq/cmv_high_school_english_classes_should_consider/,changemyview,"Over and over on Reddit and in personal conversations I've read/heard people say that high school English classes made them hate reading, because they couldn't read the things they want to or found enjoyable, and had to read things they found boring or difficult instead, like Shakespeare.

I've come to think this is a good argument for high school English curricula thinking about enjoyability as a way to foster an interest in reading and good reading habits -- but enjoyability *shouldn't* trump what I think the basic function of a high school English class is: teach reading comprehension and analysis, and the ability to communicate that comprehension and analysis. Difficult texts that admit of a lot of complex interpretation are ideal for this, and so something like Shakespeare is always going to need to have a place in high school English. Maybe we can rethink to some extent *how* it's taught, but it has to be taught. 

Curricula should probably include more books high school students can get excited or interested about, which probably means more contemporary literature, and probably means some variety of genre fiction. I'd still argue that care should be taken to pick something here at the interesction of enjoyability and worthy of complex analysis -- more Neuromancer than Harry Potter (I recognize neither of these are particularly contemporary, but they're just examples).

Open to changing my view because I've seen the opposite argued so often that maybe I'm missing something. I should also note that it's been a long time since I've been in high school, so I'd also consider my view changed if someone can convince me that this *is* how English is largely taught now (in a broadly Western context, obviously)."

&#x200B;

If we take the example of an asian person identifying as Latino. The ""fact"" that he's ""asian"" only makes sense in the context of a society that attributes importance to certain physical characteristics. In other terms, one isn't born with any race until he is labelled a member of a certain race only in a sociopolitical context. Race is a social construct.

&#x200B;

Hence, just like gender, one is not bound to one's assigned race and all the expectations that come with it (which are too socially constructed and racist and yet they still exist). It also helps us to get rid of our understanding of race an immutable category. A white person can be an asian and an asian can be black. If anything, racism can best be ended by a radical deconstruction of such racial categories, just like transgender people are helpful for the deconstruction of traditional gender norms "

1,2023-08-31,CMV: Most people don’t actually care about the presumption of innocence,u/p0tat0p0tat0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/166lhnr/cmv_most_people_dont_actually_care_about_the/,changemyview,"I'm sure you've all heard someone say that a person accused of rape or abuse should be considered innocent until proven guilty. And they should, in the eyes of the law. But for many other suspected or alleged crimes, people are held in jail prior to a conviction, which is a far clearer violation of the presumption of innocence than believing what a survivor of abuse says.

People hide behind the presumption of innocence, as a way to avoid meaningfully dealing with allegations of rape. They do not sincerely believe in this principle outside of the context of allegations of abuse against men. The strongest evidence of this is the popular indifference to elements of the criminal justice system that egregiously infringe on the presumption of innocence, at a much larger and more severe scale.

Pretrial detention violates the presumption of innocence. Legally innocent people are being held in jails across the country, often for years on end, in very mean conditions. 90% of those being held in Rikers Island are awaiting trial. That is a far greater threat to the principle of “innocent until proven guilty” than believing a survivor of rape when they tell you who did it. 

The argument in favor of pretrial detention is public safety. And yet, countless allegations of rape aren’t taken seriously or heard out, because bystanders choose to presume the accused innocent. This choice results in alleged rapists not being known to the community, thereby threatening public safety.

Survivors of rape are placed in an impossible situation, where if they don’t report, they are blamed for any subsequent rapes their attacker commits, while also being silenced with “innocent until proven guilty” when they come forward and name names. 

As long as pretrial detention is the norm in this country, there is no real presumption of innocence."

I've noticed a massive difference between what is written and what I've experienced, obviously studies don't test out their theories on the entire world, but isn't that the biggest flaw?

If you take a sample of 1000 people and ~most of the participants proved the theory correct wouldn't you have to take in mind thousands of small factors.

Someone's many types of intelligence whether that's emotional or IQ, someone's mental experiences, their mindset, who they've been exposed to, it's way too broad of spectrum to have any remotely conclusive answer.

I remember seeing a study on effects of physically disciplining your child and based on myself and slot of successful capable people they were disciplined when they were kids, does that mean correlation equals causation? No, but it's not conclusive I've seen kids taught perfectly according to studies turn out horribly, and kids who were taught ""poorly"" be doing well.

Their mental health was also good if you're wondering.


I just think the topic of studies (specifically in psychology) are never black and white, take what you can get, but don't take as with 100% certainty

Sorry If this was kind of confusing I am not good at explaining."

None of these initiatives actually push for living wages or workers rights. It provides a tangential outlet and further placates employees by giving them an excuse to get out of working.

If I was a greedy CEO, I would invest heavily in DEI. Boosts my ESG score and prevents my workers from thinking too hard about class. I can simply pay a couple yes men that look different than me rather than just pay everyone fairly or actually lobby for real structural change. If anyone criticized me I could just shame them for being on the wrong side of history. If someone within the company openly disagrees, I can just fire them for “culture differences” and don’t have to pay their unemployment or severance."

Most of the issues in these groups would usually consist of things such as:

* Struggling to fit in with the LGBT community while being a bisexual male, which has always historically faced multitudes of erasure.

* Coming out as bisexual

* Refuting stereotypes

* Tips on how to manage mental and emotional health

All of these subjects would lead to very fantastic and in-depth discussions.

However, within the last year or two, most of these groups have started to become over run with transmen.

Normally, I'd say cool. Okay, that doesn't bother me.

But it seems 85% of them would rather talk about their pube beards, HRT and top surgery scars, as opposed to meaningful topics. That or posting pictures of themselves with some pity caption to recieve validation.

The worst part? The huge chunk of these trans men just look like women with short hair, as if they know they're trying to mock us.

I'm so over it, it takes away from actual men's issues, and makes us seem like a joke. It's already hard enough as-is to find a safe place for men to discuss their issues. I usually support the T in LGBT (within reason), but it seems like they just end up ruining every safe space I'm in.

I'm trying to discuss SEXUALITY with other like minded individuals, not GENDER. I'm not transphobic, but how the fuck am I supposed to talk about actual issues with a group without them always barging in?

I'm willing to change my mind on this if presented with a good enough argument."

But come on, not every cop is bad. Sure the meaning of ""to protect and serve"" may have dwindled down over time, but come on, do you really believe that every cop out there is racist? Do you really believe that cops are out to get you? And without cops, many people (including you) would be committing crimes. You might be dead without cops, even though some of them have shot innocent people.

I have never seen any good argument against my view, even though apparently it's seen as bad. I don't get it. Is ACAB just an exagerration or am I missing something? Please help change my view on this."
