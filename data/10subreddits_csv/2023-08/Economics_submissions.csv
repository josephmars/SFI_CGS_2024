On this forum, I have been trying to create sensible discussion whether we are going to have a major crisis due to debt and what we can do to avoid the impact of it.  In the past, when I discussed on this forum, I was getting responses indicating US debt levels are quite reasonable. Yet this is not correct as it can be seen from the data in the article. AFAIS, US will hit a major inflationary period to pay off this debt. FED will be forced to reduce the interest rates soon due to impact of interest rates on the budget. This will yield to huge inflationary pressure. If tech sector fails to innovate and improve employee efficiency, we can again live through stagflation as seen in 70s.  And yet no one seems to predict, expect and price in this possibility."
