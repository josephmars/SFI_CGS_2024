Animals that do not feel competition or the need to defend will often (though warily) exist within the same area without going out of their way to bother each other. For example, birds of various species will frequently hang out in the same area (such as a pond or wetland) with only occasional tensions fueling. 

However, it seems primates (of all kinds) tend to be more erratic, hostile, and willing to go out of their way to pick a fight. In areas with monkeys, for example, monkeys are some of the scariest animals to come in contact with due to their aggression. Humans are similarly naturally inclined to impulsive and aggressive behavior and will often take over large spaces and eliminate other animals, even ones that we are not in competition with. Though this practically makes sense (such as protecting crops/homes or preventing diseases), the scale of the destruction is immense. 

If another type of animal were to have human-level intellect, would they still be as erratic and destructive? For example, if an egret wee able to learn as well as humans, would they be even more destructive and look for ways to wipe out all the other shorebirds that cohabit the same area to maximize their food production? Would shy animals like a duiker, even if they were gifted with our intellect, still tend to stay away from other animals and keep to themselves? 

This is a very hypothetical situation but I imagine that of all the species to be gifted with our intellectual prowess, primates were a worse option due to their inclination towards greed and impulse.

The sheer intensity of the noise and the raw emotions being unleashed create an atmosphere that's incredibly distressing to be around. It's like a wave of tension and unease washes over the environment, leaving everyone on edge and uncomfortable.

What's even more unsettling is realizing that this behavior often stems from a loss of control or authority, as if the need to prove dominance is more important than fostering a loving and nurturing environment. The impact of these moments can be long-lasting, affecting not only the individuals involved but also those who are exposed to the turmoil.

Beyond the immediate discomfort, there's a deeper concern about the kind of example being set for the children. Witnessing their mothers resorting to screaming teaches them that such behavior is acceptable, potentially leading to a cycle of unhealthy communication and emotional responses.

Furthermore, I can't ignore the toll this takes on the kids themselves. The fear, anxiety, and confusion they must experience in those moments must be overwhelming, potentially leaving scars that affect their self-esteem and emotional well-being as they grow.

All in all, it's a distressing and disheartening situation to witness, one that highlights the need for more empathetic and effective ways of handling the challenges of parenthood."

When I go through a fast-food drive through the act of checking what‚Äôs inside the bag changes the outcome of my order. If you don‚Äôt check the food will be wrong almost every time.  
  
If you do check inside the bag the food is almost always correctly how you ordered. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the worker did before. You checking the bag or not decides the outcome of that order.  
  
Every time man. I swear every time you don‚Äôt check the bag it‚Äôs wrong. Ever since I started looking in the bag though it‚Äôs been perfect. How that is possible I don‚Äôt know but it‚Äôs wild.

E.g. a collegue wanted to set certain tags on all azure resources. However if you do set only the tags (which are in a hashtable) you overwrite the old tags, all of them. So you have to first read those out and put them back in with your new ones - but if those tags you want to add are already set, your new tag setting would also overwrite this, so you have to check if those tags are already there and exclude those resources. 

  
It is just a simple example that I had recently and before I even ran the code I had to think of every way it might accidently fubar all tags for the whole company. That's where the comparison to a genie came to mind.

because a 6 out of 10, would be interested in a 6-9 out of 10, and maybe would do a 5.5 or even a 5. but a 9/10 wouldn't be interested in anything below an 8. so given most people at 4-6 and anything at 8 or above is 9, makes it less likely.

you might be like well what's the 9 going to be doing with me, a 6 or 7/10 or whatever, then - well maybe they think you're their type a bit more, and maybe if you're a dude, you're rich, have a good job, decent personality, while she's like an airline hostess or a former model doing a sales role or something not earning a lot.

Not to mention that Wi-Fi problems are so common because there might be other people in the house using it or even just because someone is not in the financial situation to afford the constant high quality Wi-Fi.

I think it‚Äôll be a really good idea If someone comes up with a space where people can use soundproof rooms with optimal Wi-Fi speeds that is exclusively for video conferencing. These rooms can be public for universities or even private and renting out a room per hour!

Even better, the room can be provided with a ring light mirror, rentable webcams and mics, and even backgrounds to make the best impression to the other party behind the screen!

Just a thought :3"

Let's throw ourselves outside the universe for a second, most scientists that there isn't any existence out there, and that time cannot pass as there isn't any medium for it to pass through.

Inside our universe time does pass, as it has a medium to move through, existence.

Existence can be dented by planets and stars, it can be stretched by the universe expanding and it can be bent and squished by black holes.

Therefore 'space' isn't.... space-it is nothing, it is jam packed with existence.

So that lovely black blob that surrounds us shouldn't be called space, but rather it's name should be full, as it is, rather full."

In the beginning, they're ready to give up everything for a chance to become famous. Their determination to become stars knows no bounds. They pull the wildest stunts in front of the paparazzi just to get noticed. They sneak through backdoors to get to important events. They work their asses off, hustling and sweating themselves to the top. They use SMM panels to bump up their followers' numbers, thinking that Instagram likes instant delivery will make them the next overnight sensation. They dream that thousands of people would scream out their names in excitement when they get out of a private jet at the airport, but if/when they happen to achieve the desired fame and it's time to reap the rewards, the complaints start to rush in.   
It seems all they want to do is sulk and wallow in self-pity. I find this very stupid. Didn't you know what it would take when you struggled to get there? To tell you the truth, I'm not so sure they dwelled on this for too long. The extreme invasion of privacy they're all complaining about is part of the deal! I'd be under no illusions about that if I ever wanted to become a celebrity. Why do they want to flee the paparazzi? Without photographers, celebrities wouldn't be relevant. I believe celebs just have to accept reality and embrace the fact that their fame is a reward for their dedication and perseverance, not a punishment in any possible way. So, why does everything work this way for any star? Are they just playing it up to get more attention? I can hardly believe they truly wish to be left alone without being noticed."

Farmers kill all beetles, caterpillar, snails, rodents, etc. Even in a far distance away from the farm to not damage the crops or have those pests come back.  
If a person can eat 3 kg of food in their stomach, then a male cow on average is ***1,100*** kg (Let's not include female cows because that will make it more complicated) then a ***1,100kg*** cow would feed **366** people. now assuming that everyone eats 3X a day then a male cow would feed **122** people in a day  


Now let's say you have a **100** acre farm that produces 5000 products a day ( 1 product = 1 full meal for a human) and in each acre you have ***30*** pests, and they keep coming back every day, you'd have to kill 3000 pests a day. You'd feed **1,666** people each day. (assuming people eat 3x a day and one product is a good meal for them)   


If every cow where to be the same size and be eaten off everything then we'd feed about **1,830** for the cost of only **15** cows.   


**TLDR:** >!15 cows will feed more people than being vegan. And 3000 lives will be lost for less people fed a day.!<
