2,2022-12-31,How should I deal with inevitable hostility from subsidiary employees?,u/rgbmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1007dbi/how_should_i_deal_with_inevitable_hostility_from/,careerguidance,"Years ago I worked at a subsidiary for a large company. I was promoted to the parent company and have since been promoted again within the parent company. I’ve been working at home since I’ve been with the parent company due to Covid. At the start of the year, workers are required to return to the office. I live 2 hours away from my office so I my boss has set up an office for me at the subsidiary I used to work at considering it’s 20 minutes away from my house.

I’ve called out the subsidiary since I’ve left and have been one of their biggest critics as they continuously prove to be unreliable for the business. This has burned many bridges with some of the management there ( I never really got along with them anyways even when I worked for them). My role in the company does not deal with this subsidiary anymore and I focus on a totally different department within the company.

I’m glad I’ll have an office close to home but I can’t help but think I’m going to face some passive aggressive behavior from these people I no longer have any business with except sharing an office.

Any advice on how to go under the radar here and not get into arguments? I’m not necessarily looking to make amends with these people as I’ve meant every bit of criticism I’ve ever given to them.

Edit: basic grammar"
3,2022-12-31,I am feeling like I may have chosen the wrong career. Can anyone give some advice?,u/careeradviceta56,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1007ezj/i_am_feeling_like_i_may_have_chosen_the_wrong/,careerguidance,"So, I have a bit of a tricky situation when it comes to career and education options, so I’m lost, don’t really know what to do if I’m being fully honest. 

For reference I’m 3 months shy of turning 20. 


I went to public school from pre-k up until 6th grade. After 6th grade my mother pulled me and my siblings out of school to ‘homeschool’ us. Except, she didn’t teach us anything. She was pretty abusive and nothing was ever confirmed but I think she did it to have more control over us. 


Things happened when I was 16 (2019) and my dad kicked her out and I had a big argument with him and forced him to enroll me back in public school. I had two options when this happened. I could start as a freshmen and graduate when I turned 22, or I could take classes that would be more suited for someone going into a trade. I didn’t want to graduate at 22 so I went with the latter. People who choose that graduation path don’t have the necessary credits to attend a 4 year university. Only trade schools. 


Then, the pandemic hit which worsened my quality of education even more, and I was pretty burnt out so I did my best to graduate and eventually got there with a 4.0 GPA. (This was a shock to me as I never checked my grades which in hindsight could’ve ended poorly but it didn’t so oh well!)


Due to all the above, both my education and my social skills are pretty stunted. As far as I can tell, if I want to go to a 4 year university I’ll need to take some remedial classes, but I failed Algebra 1 three separate times so I’m not sure if taking those classes would be worth my time and money. I’m almost certain I would fail them or get poor grades. 


Anyway, due to wanting to take advantage of the financial aid my state offers within a certain window of graduating high school, and due to the fact that I can’t see myself in a career that I don’t at least somewhat enjoy, I was given two options and two different trade schools. I could either get an associates in graphic design, or I could get an ‘advanced diploma’ in 3d animation and VFX for film. 


I didn’t want to make logos for a living (and I still am not interested in graphic design), so I landed on the second option and I’m currently 6 months away from graduating. 


I feel like I haven’t learned enough, they only really teach us the basics of how the programs work and after that it’s more of a “figure it out yourself” mentality. Recently my original professor quit, and he was replaced by someone he’s known for a long time. 


I don’t like this professor’s teaching style, he refuses to help when we need help even if we try to find the answer first. He graded the first project since my old professor left and the way he graded it was done in a way where he deducted points for stuff that we didn’t even go over in class, and stuff that had nothing that pertained to my project.


I recently learned that a lot of this profession is contract work, and I don’t think I would like that very much. I want consistent job security, where I know every paycheck will be relatively the same as the last. 


I also recently learned that apparently 60 hour weeks are the norm, and ever since I started attending school I’ve been doing 60 to 70 hour weeks without any days off between school and work. Overall I’m burnt out and I genuinely don’t think I can keep this up. I’m a hat drop away from having an episode. 


Some of the stuff I do at school confuses me and I some things that my classmates figured out easily early on I still struggle with. I think it’s due to the pace of instruction. All of these factors are causing me to have doubts on if I picked the right career. I’m not sure where to go from here but I would like advice on possible career options giving my situation. 

Also, I don’t want to live where my dad lives forever. (We’re in the south, I don’t live with him currently but I plan to post graduation if I can get a remote job in order to focus on paying off all my student loans as fast as I can). I want to move somewhere up north, preferably northeast or northwest, maybe the midwest. California would also be nice but realistically that’s way out of my price range as far as considerations go. In other words I would like a job that pays me well enough to live comfortably on my own, and possibly (preferably) allow for travel. 


Some things that interest me or I do well enough that I could see myself doing it for a living. 

Art (Painting, illustration, sculpting, digital stuff, I love trying new mediums though.) 
Writing
I’m very interested in vintage stuff and I find restoration to be fun.
I’d be open to trying my hand at wood working, pottery, or print making (posters, shirts, etc) given the opportunity.
I love film, and would love to work in film, but for reasons I stated above I don’t think I’ll be a good fit. 

I’m open to jobs that gave some manual labor but I wouldn’t want to work outdoors all day, and also don’t want to sit in front of a computer all day every day. I also enjoy working with animals. 

I know this is long and I’m a bit picky but I’m open to exploring any and all suggestions in case what I’m currently going to school for turns out to not quite be for me. 

Thank you everyone for your time and assistance, and happy new year."

I have over a decade of sales experience but sales burnt me out so bad in 2021 it resulted in a nervous breakdown with chronic pain and daily medication I still take to this day. 

I studied an online marketing course in 2022 but both marketing roles led to dismissal in just a few months each time. 

I’ve always wanted to have my own business but fear I lack the self discipline and motivation to invest full time into being my own boss. 

I fear I need the structure of employment while at the same time I’m sick and tired of the structure of employment and want freedom. 

With a recent cancer scare I want to help people more than anything and would love to be a better ambassador. All of my options via sales, marketing and engineering feel like they lack being able to directly help people. 

Do I start over again and risk investing time in an avenue that is another dead-end, or do I use my past experience and education to find some sort of middle ground in the right direction that answers my wants for freedom and nurturing others?

Worked in various places in the world. I love the actual job (controlling planes, making sure the dots don't touch, etc.) but hate the shift work, hate inconsistent days off, hate all the fucking overtime, hate having zero options to leave and work for another company (there's basically only one per country not including the military) if they treat you like shit.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, although my job is considered very important, I basically have zero qualifications or skilled that are transferrably recognized. No one gives a shit about my ATC license accept for ATS providers. I am getting on in my life so I don't really want to drop a 130k+ USD/year (I am not in the US, just using USD because it's probably the largest demographic on this sub and I want to hide my identity) job to go back and study for years. So I don't really know where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought studying something in my own time online that I could eventually leave to do. Something with coding or cyber security? Given what I am looking for below, I am leaning more towards perhaps working from home? But I really just have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

Money for me isn't super important - I don't live an extravagant lifestyle by any means - but I am obviously very comfortable with my salary and wouldn't want it to change too drastically.

&amp;#x200B;

So to summarize what I'm looking for;

\-Something I can pivot to while still undergoing my current career, but can eventually make my primary income in the coming years

\-Consistency in shifts and time off

\-No overtime. Leave work at home (maybe work from home?)

\-Salary can take a hit but still like to be comfortable

&amp;#x200B;

I have no other qualifications other than my ATC license. Good high school grades.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Got a couple 'how did you get into ATC?' questions so I'll just answer it here; it's different for every country. Type into google ""Air traffic control apply \[your country here\]"" and look on the website or ring up and ask. I didn't 'get into it', I was working in a retail store packing boxes and typed 'highest paying jobs without a degree' in google on night when I was pissed off with my paycheck.

ATC was on one of the lists, had no idea what it was but googled further and sent in my resume - it just went from there with testing, interviews, etc. like with any job. Couldn't care less about aviation."

I also have an associates in music recording tech and a Bachelor's in ""Media Study"" (it is analogous to a communications degree with a bit of video editing thrown in).

I graduated with my bachelor's in 2019 right at the start of the pandemic. I was trying to direct my career in the direction of live events/music, working as a stagehand and AV tech. These jobs rarely had full time hours to offer so I supplemented by taking an ""e-commerce assistant"" job, where I assumed I'd learn about graphic design, e-commerce, marketing etc but it ended up being more of a warehouse job. 

When the pandemic hit I was laid off from everything but the nightmarish e-commerce job - it was going nowhere, it was clear that people from outside the owners family were just cheap labor and we're never offered responsibilities or opportunities to grow - I quit to become a residential roofer for a couple of years. 

Fast forward to today and I have used my construction experience to get into the sheet metal union. I like the work a lot so far. And honestly, the time I've spent doing construction has been amazing. 
I'm not exactly someone with amazing soft skills, my social energy dissipates right after the interview and people tend to get weirded out by my ""attitude."" None of that matters in the trades. If you show up to a site or shop and just show that you can put in hard work and learn things, nobody really cares about your personality as long as you're not causing issues. I have loved having the opportunity to work with my hands for the last few years as well.
The potential pay and benefits here are good and will get better if I stick it out. There is a lot of variety in my job too which is great. But I occasionally get a weird feeling that I should've used my degree instead, that I'm missing out on something and just got complacent doing what I needed to do when times were tough.

- I’m literally a junior engineer but I’m the only full time engineer because the other ones have quit and I have no one else to turn to. Yet, they expect me to ‘train’ other new engineers who basically have the same skill level and experience I have.

- They get mad when I don’t show up to the optional company happy hour (either because I’m exhausted or I have to complete a project) and some of the supervisors even take it personally despite me telling them in advance I can’t go.

- The final red flag … when I was  actually given phrase for the first time I was not happy, I was disappointed. I’m so screwed up from this job that I’m disappointed I haven’t been fired yet

Then I was close to having a mental breakdown due to family pressure and drama, so I went back overseas to ESL after finishing master's. I came back in March 2020 cause of covid. Due to a few family members being high risk I had to work from home and help them out. I did remote ESL teaching and notary work. 

Then in January of this year (2022) I had to decide if I wanted to stay here or go back overseas. After deciding to go overseas the war broke out and covid lockdowns started again in the country I was going to go to. So I decided to look for jobs here at home and I sent in hundreds of applications for HR position (figured with my 2 degrees HR would be a good fit) got rejected from all of them. So I switched to administrative positions, got a couple of offers but the pay was honestly insulting for my experience and degrees. I was making more remote teaching and my notary business. So I've been in limbo and depressed to be honest since fall about what to do next. 

Ideally I want a remote job that pays well so I can work from anywhere. But there doesn't seem to be s job like that that will accept simply my degrees and my teaching experience. I've been taking a social media management course and I'm considering  going back to school for IT. I really want to go back overseas but my family has gotten used to me being here these past 3 years and it'll be difficult for themand for me to leave them if I'm honest. (My dad is now legally blind and my sister now has 2 kids and my mother is the sole bread winner for her household but she doesn't think she can work for much longer due to her health.)

As for me I feel like a complete failure. I'm 30 years  old with a master's degree living with my parents again. I truly don't know what else to do. I've been so stressed over this the past 2 years that my health is deteriorating. I have a chronic condition that I feel is relapsing and getting worse by the day. But I don't even have health insurance so I can't even get the proper treatment. Not to mention my mental health.

Any advice/ guidance you might have is much appreciated!"

According to the company, they hire individuals that have no experience in their field and the only requirement is to have a bachelor's degree which I do. I applied for the position and passed the screening stage and moved on to the next stage which is the assessments. The assessments are 150 minutes long and are divided into two sections. The first section is a metric test that tests your knowledge on subjects related to the company and the second section is a logic test. Throughout the assessments I was monitored through my webcam and microphone to prevent applicants from cheating. They have a strict no cheating policy which is understandable. However, I feel like I did not do as well as I would like. I still have another stage of the application to go through and then two rounds of interviews.

Started  out as basic Data Entry, but I was pretty handy with excel so I came up  with several innovations to improve the process and save a lot of time  (did that for a few other departments too) and built a reputation for it

Picked up some skills in Tableau and SQL and utilized them in my work too (Mostly Automating Reports and running adhoc queries)

however  despite having several wins (Company saves about 16 hours daily due to  my work and I do a regular 7.5 Hour Job on top of all that), being on good terms with literally every manager and even  winning and award for innovation I can't seem to progress in my career  (Climb the Corporate ladder if u will)

every  time I try for a promotion they always come up with some Excuse to keep  me in my current role, give me very little feedback on what it would  take to progress and i've grown tired of that

I want to move on but I dunno how to tackle it and could use some guidance

Current Skills (I'd call myself intermediate in all these)

\- Excel (VBA, Power Query, Formulas)

\- Tableau (understand calculated fields and LOD)

\- Power BI (Used Dax but man do I hate it)

\- SQL and Python (Understand the Fundamentals)

\- Googling Stuff and then tricking people into thinking I was an expert all along (I'd say I'm pretty good at this)

I  feel like i'm overqualified for my current role and under-qualified for  everything else and I just don't know what a good path for me would be  (what's in high demand, and would fit my current skillset)

a  friend suggested I take Comptia+ to get into IT (and I actually do  think it would be interesting since i'm pretty weak on things like  Hardware and Networks and would love to learn more about them)

another friend suggested I try freelancing

but  I struggle a lot with this sort of thing, the only reason I have my  current job is I stumbled into it via temp agency and then just managed  to make it work,

I never would have found it on my own

was wondering if I could get any guidance on what a good next step would be? I adore excel, as well as process improvement, but I'm not sure what to do with that "

And reading most of this and other job subs, I feel a bit like an idiot. It seems like such a job is most people's huge dream.

It's managerial title but no team because company slowed down hiring, great pay and benefits (top 1% in my region), 4 days remote, nothing to do but be semi-active on teams, a 45min weekly report and ~6h of meetings or mandatory training a week. Whenever I try to do something my bosses tell me not too stir the pot too much and stick to my scope. Essentially being almost but not fully benched for years to come.


But after a couple weeks of this, I ran out of YT videos and went through my podcast backlog. I was doing some personal projects but each day I just felt more and more tired. 

I got depressed really fast (and maybe I'm an idiot and it's just seasonal). It really did feel like watching paint dry, with just enough obligations to have something in the back of my mind but not enough to stay engaged. When I did do my own stuff on work hours, it just left me stressed and guilty - what if I get an urgent message or I get 'found out'. Also there was always some meeting or catch-up at the end of the day that prevented me from going out or getting into a flow of a project. 

My bosses did not want to hear about how little time was needed to do the job, so they kept insisting I just 'keep working on the projects', even though what that meant was just waiting a few days on different email replies and  maybe 30-45 min in PowerPoint and statistics software once I finally get the reply. I think they tried to do my role before themselves, failed, and now were insisting that I'm actually quite busy and have lots to do??  

I did consider just doing freelance contracts or working on a game or something while just getting paid. My contract was ambiguous there. But there was always just enough meetings and emails and that one last-minute thing a week that scheduling was difficult and I was always distracted. 

So after a couple of weeks of this I just put in my notice. I always have something lined up, so I took a ~20% pay cut but the next job will be fun. I just can't image wasting 6-9h a day and feeling too dead inside to do anything afterwards. But maybe I should just try to overcome this feeling and embrace not doing anything?

Am I an idiot? Should I have done things differently?

I have tried switching to some other profiles but I get rejections everywhere my qualifications don't stand out and since my work profile is distinct not many companies have this opening. 

I want to do something that's not sucking my soul this much and bothering me everyday. I want to do something different but I don't have an answer. 

Am I being ungrateful for having a well paying job when others are not finding one? 

I really enjoy teaching psychology but is it too late to begin  there? Obviously if I switch a career the pay won't be great am I taking a stupid decision to do a low paying career for the sake of peace? 

Any advice is appreciated please help me."

I'm about to choose my course at university, and my favourite subject was Biology during my school years.

However, I would love a job where I can work from home. I found out that there are heaps of jobs in the I.T/CS  field that offers work from home opportunites. 

Although I do not have much interest in learning programming or I.T in general, should I still consider pursuing I.T just for the ""work  from home"" opportunites?

Or is it not worth it, and I should instead opt for a subject (Biology) that I enjoy studying (even though it does not offer WFH opportunites)?

Your opinion would mean a lot!"

I stopped around the time COVID started, but it was not COVID related. I had begun to develop back problems. They worsened over the lockdown to the point where I can barely stand for more than an hour and a lot of physical tasks (like lifting things) are painful or outright impossible for me. Hell, I've started walking with a cane when I do have to go out.

I collect Disability for now (and technically could forever), but I hate being ""disabled"" and unable to work

I wanted to go back to school for a Computer Science degree, but it is just not financially feasible at this point. What could I possibly do with my degree if I can't do any sort of physical work?

I asked on a Culinary subreddit and the best I got would be to do management (if I found a place that would hire me to be a manager with no actual management experience and knowing that I can't stand for long and walk with a cane, I'd be shocked) or some type of prep cook role in a place where things are a lot calmer (like a care home or catering). Or obviously selling baked goods and/or meals out of my home, where I could go at my own pace.

These are things I can consider, but the management idea is probably what I'd be willing to do the most right now. Is there ANY hope of finding some place that would hire me knowing my physical limitations and lack of management experience? I'm just totally at a loss because all I imagined I'd do with my education is work my way up to a chef position."

I just graduated college and got a decent paying job in a field I like. The issue is that the location of the job is 5 hours away.

A couple of days ago I was asked to interview for a decently paying job with a six month contract in a city close to me, so close that I might be able to live at my parents house for the six months, a job that I don’t love, but find tolerable and pays decently. I am curious about taking it, so I can buy a new car and have some savings and then try for another job in the field I really want to pursue, but I have a real fear of being able to find a good paying job in the field. It isn’t the most exclusive field in the world, but good jobs are kind of hard to come by nowadays. I also have a fear of “getting stuck” in basically the hometown area I grew up in. Also, I have never really liked living with my folks, I don’t have privacy and my parents&amp;brothers (who I love) are always asking me to take them to run errands or cook for them when I get home and just want to relax.

I have been running my own business since the age of 18 (I am now 25 years old). I have never worked a traditional 9-5 job and have always been an entrepreneur. I was able to put myself through university, earning a Bachelor's degree in Psychology. However, I am now considering a change and exploring other career options.

This year, my business earned around $70,000 after taxes, but I am feeling burnt out and eager to explore something more fulfilling. The main issue I am facing is that I am unsure of how to transition from being an entrepreneur to obtaining a traditional employment position. I have always worked for myself and have no experience with the process of applying for and securing a job within a company. Additionally, I am not sure where to start or what steps to take in order to begin this process. As a result, I feel overwhelmed and uncertain about how to move forward.

The IT field seems very interesting to me and I am potentially considering going back to school to get a Bachelor's degree in IT. However, everything I read says that it is important to work on getting a job first. I am unsure of how to balance the idea of going back to school with the need to gain practical experience in the field. Additionally, the idea of taking a decently sized pay cut to do help desk work in hopes of a higher salary a couple of years down the road just doesn't feel like a smart option.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance anyone has to offer on how to navigate this transition and make the most of my education and experience as an entrepreneur. Thank you in advance for your help."
3,2023-01-01,Best major for good money while also having a social life MIS or CS?,u/Putin666,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/100lafe/best_major_for_good_money_while_also_having_a/,careerguidance,"Making money is important to me, but I don't need 200K/year. I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends.

Please help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.

# Computer Science (CS)

Pros:

* More likely to make a lot amount of money.
* Probably more work from home jobs.
* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.
* Problem solving can be cool
* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??

Cons:

* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.
* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.
* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:

1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.
2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.
3. Global outsourcing.
4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.

# Management Information Systems (MIS)

Pros:

* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.
* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.
* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.
* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.

Cons:

* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS
* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??
* People call it the CS drop out degree
* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??
* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??

&amp;#x200B;

No matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.

Which path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: MIS will maybe give me more free time than CS with only a bit less money???"

I manage a large team at a tech company, and I truly love my team. I am very passionate about coaching/mentorship, watching them succeed and just generally they are great people and are performing very well. I have managed for 3-4 years and have never had any turnover because I think they feel valued and well respected at work, and I make sure they have clear growth paths in place. 

However, I have discovered I am not great at ""managing up"" and playing the internal politics games which is really important in a leadership role. My role also is high visibility and I have to do a lot of public speaking and internal presentations to VPs, etc which gives me a lot of anxiety too. 

Given how much I love managing people, I don't really want to return to an IC role, but I also don't want to climb the corp ladder further into leadership. Are there any ideas for tech roles that may be a better fit?

My master's degree is in Kinesiology (study of the human body, movement, and muscle) so a lot of people associate the degree with exercise training, physiotherapy, etc. However my undergrad and master's had a heavy focus on molecular and cell biology of muscle - for all intents and purposes my experience would be nearly identical to a cell biologist graduate with slight extra focus on muscle.

1. Will this discrepancy between degree title and experience be a detriment? For example, some jobs I'm hoping to apply to require a degree in biochemistry or biology.

My fiancé , two dogs and I ending up not getting anywhere and living in a shed for 4 months before stopping and moving out. We had no money, and felt homeless. I’d talked to investors and had plans but I ran into 3 big hurdles that made me get out. 
1- it would take over 300k to get the ball rolling for a job that I’d have to be present at EVERYDAY. Plants don’t sleep and they don’t take days off.
2- I rarely ever use cannabis anymore. Maybe 2 times a year. I just don’t like it in my daily life anymore and I don’t feel passionate. 
3 - my fiancé was still working doubles everyday and was extremely burnt out and lost hope. She just wanted to move home to the east coast and started resenting my project taking a different course than our original plan.

Fast forward and we’re both servers at a fine dining restaurant making about 65k a year each after taxes. Been here for a year. It feels like the job pays too well for me to leave but I have knee problems and it’s honestly killing me. We have no savings (working on that) and all I know is that I’m ready for a change.
I tried to go back to school online for business and I couldn’t keep up. I spend a lot of time researching different topics but I can’t seem to either be interested enough or find the path too risky. I’ve even tried quite a few. I landscaped, grew micro greens, consulted for other grows, played with crypto and nfts, started learning copywriting and SEO, cyber security. I legit considered meta verse stripping! I feel so lost but I’m SO ready to get it together and get working on a new career.
What I want for sure in life now is a job I can work remotely from Anywhere, and to be able to afford to build my future. 

So, what should I do to help map out my next steps? Where should I look to find a career coach that won’t just take my money and give me crap advice?

TL;DR: former pot grower stuck waiting tables and is looking for help finding a solid remote work career.

It seems I change careers every ten years. I have my BA in psychology and worked in an ER for ten years, triaging patients and doing insurance, lab orders, and other admissions-type work.

Then I got my BA in Secondary ED English and my MA in Curriculum Development. I've worked for ten years as a teacher. I'm now a middle school teacher leader. I write curriculum and teach writing. I also freelance for a publishing company doing editing and ghostwriting, primarily memoirs and self-help books.

I'm interested in a shift toward technical writing, but I'm not sure what certifications are required. I looked on Linked In, and it varies. Some places want a college degree in computer science, some want an English or Communications degree, and some say nothing about education but want experience. I found a self-paced UK program for a reasonable fee that claims to give you an overview of what the field is like. Is that a good first step? I looked into certification through the Society for Technical Communication, but it's expensive. 

Should I be learning things like HTML? CSS? My boyfriend is a project manager in cyber security, and he recommended that.

I’ll try to keep this short - so I’ve always aspired to be an entrepreneur. To have my own companies, be a leader and hopefully achieve ultimate financial freedom (though money is not my “why” or “purpose”). I like to read about Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Tilman Fertitta and I’ve also met some extremely successful people. 
I also enjoy learning of space and it’s many mysteries and would like to be the one to lead a mission to Neptune one day. So I figure the best way to get to this would be astrophysics or aerospace engineering (besides space itself, I enjoy learning mathematics and physics and I think it would be incredibly satisfying and interesting to have a job related to research of space/the universe). 
At one time I was all about finance and the markets, but the two aforementioned careers are slightly more interesting. Though finance would be #3 choice if nothing else. 

So how can I better focus and narrow it down? How about combining astrophysics and entrepreneurship? I already live on my own so going back to school would require a significant investment in both time and money. And I would need to earn a PhD.

1,2023-01-01,Salary Advice for New Role?,u/Dawer22,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/100xfxk/salary_advice_for_new_role/,careerguidance,"Hello! I am going to be moving into a new role at my current company that is being crafted for me. In my current position, I am making base of $95k and up to another $50-60k with monthly/quarterly bonuses. I know the monthly bonus will not always be uncapped as it has been the past year so expect that do go down to closer to $30k/year. I have been applying to other internal roles that pay between $135-150k. I am concerned the role I am moving into will be around $110k max and will not have the monthly bonuses. Moving into the new role, I won’t be able to apply to other internal jobs for a year or so. It’s also not something I can turn down as it’s a huge step for my career. 

TL;DR - moving into a new role that was crafted for me, but will end up making less and is less money that I would want. 

Any advice on what to do in this situation? 

Thanks!"

It was an HVAC apprenticeship and most of what I did was shadowing the service technician to see whether or not it was a fit. After a few months I had my first manic episode, and I was in the hospital for nearly a month afterwards. With a fresh diagnosis of Bipolar, it has been difficult for me to find a job where I feel like I am living up to my full potential. I have worked five different jobs since returning to the workforce with a few distinct gaps. I was fired from one job for bringing my guitar to work, one employer decided to retire while I was working for them, and I quit the other three for reasons ranging from poor management to potentially bad interactions with my medication. 

Currently, I am working as a HVAC service technician and I do not desire to be in this field anymore. I hate being by myself most of the day working on machines! I get the most satisfaction of my job through interacting with clients face to face, making connections, helping clients make decisions on purchasing new equipment/services, or just by making a client's day a little bit better. I love that side of the job, but the main focus of the job is technical, and my mechanical aptitude is abysmal compared to my people skills. I have considered jumping ship yet again and trying my hand in sales / something with more of a focus on dealing with people, but I have more to lose now that I am a father. Please advise/"

Past year made me realize how much I should look for something more suitable per who I am and the environment I want to work in. Main reason is that I really find my supervisor to be very passive aggressive and don't respect her leadership ability/skill set.  So here I am now looking to finally start taking my career/work life with more care and consideration. Pretty excited to start learning how to find a new job. Any suggestions on where you would start if you were in my shoes?

1,2023-01-01,From advertising to retail?,u/elbartodxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/100z1y1/from_advertising_to_retail/,careerguidance,"So I have been working in digital advertising space for the last 8 years- as client servicing person. That was in Dubai and I have now moved to Toronto.

For the past 2 odd months, I’ve been looking for jobs in my field, 3 of them are taken to the final stage, and I’m waiting for hear from 2 of them.

But given that i am unemployed since September 2022, its starting to take a toll on my savings. And i need to get a job real soon.

I am considering shifting to retail - customer service. You know the staff in clothing, perfume or accessories store. I realize this is completely away from my field, which is why I’m not very sure.

Does that make sense to anyone here?

The reason i would make this shift is as follows:
- I want to get a feeling of the actual retail setup as i’ve never done something like that
- I want to be simple, little to no brainer place, as i intend to use my earnings for product management course and then switch to that field in next 4-5 months
- I also intend to use this time to work on my own online business 

Additionally, I am okay to get a slight reduction in my field, but too low a position after 8 years of experience is not sitting well with me.

One major reason of getting at least some employment is that i want to be outside and work. Not WFH or hybrid. And i also want to move out from my current place (I’m staying with my family, and not paying rent, but it comes with other caveats)

And my final question is- since I don’t have experience in retail- my sharing cv to online posts or in store won’t be much relevant.

Any feedback will be appreciated"

As disappointing and heartbreaking as it is for me to say, I already feel disillusioned by my career teaching high school English and it’s only my third year.

For context, I pursued teaching because I loved literature, worked well with kids, and most of all, I wanted to do a bit of good in my corner of the world. After receiving my B.A. in English, B.S. in Secondary English Education, and finally my M.A. in Curriculum &amp; Instruction in 2020, I began my first year of teaching. I’ve spent the last two years teaching English at public high schools, and quickly realized how emotionally, physically, and spiritually draining this career can be. I recently made the switch from teaching public to private this 2022-23 school year, hoping that the change in environment would help reignite my passion for teaching, but I continue to struggle with work/life balance and the demands of the job. 

Don’t get me wrong—there are aspects of my job that I love. For instance, I love being able to exercise my creativity when I plan lessons or units for my students to engage with. I also love how people-oriented and interpersonal my job is. Collaborating with my colleagues on projects brings me a lot of joy, as does forming strong relationships and working with my students. There’s a lot of love and community to be found in this profession. I can also be very charismatic and extroverted, which makes the presentation/“performance” piece of teaching important skills/content also quite engaging. 

For a while, all of this was enough for me to overlook how little work/life balance I had and my steadily deteriorating mental and physical health. But I don’t want to continue overlooking my own happiness. I don’t want my life to come at the expense of my job anymore. At the same time, I’m terrified that I won’t find something I’d be well suited for or that people in a different industry wouldn’t give an English teacher a shot. I can’t help but worry I’m throwing away a career I’ve spent years preparing for, and I feel so financially behind compared to my peers who are also in their mid-20s. 

I’m feeling defeated, disappointed, and so lost. I try to think of this as a “the world is your oyster” circumstance—that maybe I could think of my childhood aspirations like acting, writing, or content creation and give it another go. But honestly, I get so overwhelmed and intimidated by all of the options, and also desperately want stability in my life. I’m looking to work to live, not live to work, and I’d really love to learn about some potential careers that would suit my interests and skill sets.

How do I navigate finding a new career? Any tips and tricks on where to start, how to explore possible paths, how to network or strengthen my resume for non-teaching contexts, etc.? Are there careers (preferably WFH or hybrid) that English teachers can realistically transition into? I’d so appreciate any and all advice about any of this!"

In the last month and a half I had the strangest urge to try coding again. Ever since, I have been doing an online bootcamp course and am really enjoying coding. I am about half way through this bootcamp and I am thinking I might want to take all my learning time outside of work and pursue web development instead of getting a business degree. I feel like I will be more fulfilled and proud of myself doing software development rather than getting a business degree.

Anyone have any thoughts on what path I should take? Can I sustain a quality career in software development without a degree? The business degree feels like the “safer” option, but I feel inclined to go for web development/software development. 

I also feel confident in saying that I am self motivated, a self starter, a team player, coachable, and always hungry to learn and grow and willing to put in the work. I know this is important for any role in any career, but I feel like it’s very important in being a software developer as well.

1,2023-01-02,How would leaving my PhD without defending it affect my future career opportunities?,u/lockeden39,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1013xpo/how_would_leaving_my_phd_without_defending_it/,careerguidance,"TL;DR:  I have submitted my PhD thesis, but do not want to defend it for mental  health reasons. What impact would this have on my career in the long run?

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

I  submitted my thesis in September, after four years of being enrolled.  The last three years were just painful, and I wanted to quit every  single day, but pushed through because I let myself and others tell me  that ""it will be worth it"", ""be strong, ""employers value a PhD title"",  and so on and so forth. In essence, I just thought quitting would be a  sign of weakness (I have now realised that the opposite is true).

Anyway,  two weeks after submitting my thesis, I started a job in the industry,  and it is everything I had hoped for. I have responsibility for small  projects, and I can implement my own ideas. Colleagues consider me a  valuable member of the team and come to ask me for advice if it is  within my field of expertise (as I do with them).  This job is the exact  opposite of my PhD, where I could only implement the ideas of our  collaborators (my supervisors don't have any experience in my research  topic); every time I proposed an idea, I was told in clear terms that my  idea ""will take too long"", ""is not relevant"", or ""out of scope"", which  had a big impact on my self-esteem.

In theory, I'm still  working on one journal paper and still have to prepare my PhD defence.  My supervisors and their collaborators have been sending me emails about  the paper for the last three months, which I have largely ignored. When  I think about touching the paper or my thesis, I get this tight feeling  around my chest and have difficulty breathing. Therefore, I sent an  email yesterday to my supervisors and their collaborators to explain  that I am currently in no position to work on anything related to my PhD  and that I am considering not defending it at all (there has been no  reply so far, which is not surprising given that I sent it on NYD).

I  wonder, though, about the potential consequences of not defending my  thesis. Will it affect my working life in the long-term (I will  definitely never return to academia)? Will potential employers think I'm  a quitter or loser for not walking the very last mile? I think I'm relatively good at what I do, and my current boss has told me on multiple occasions that he and the rest of the team are very happy with how I contribute to the team and our projects . From that POV, why  would it matter whether I actually have a PhD or not? 

I  am interested to hear from people who are or have been in a similar  situation, and how you dealt with it. Also, I'd appreciate comments and advice from people involved with recruiting :-)."

I am 28f and the boss in question is 45m. He got extremely angry, abusive and even violent toward me the day before New Years break. This is a family business so his father is the owner, and his younger brother helps his father run the business. 45m is rarely there.

It all started with a call from a customer saying ""hi, we bought a machine from there last year after Thanksgiving, here it's New Year the next year and I'm STILL missing the light bar"". I tell the customer I'll look for it and to call me back at her leisure. A few hours later she calls, and I answer ""hi ma'am, unfortunately I wasn't able to find the light bar, let me speak to my boss (45m), who sold you the machine and I'll find out if he put it somewhere special for you"". This of course didn't sit well with the woman and she started making threats about lawyers. I put her on speaker for another boss and the secretary to hear both sides so that there could be no accusations or issues. We decided that I'd speak to my boss about a refund for the lights instead. However upon hanging up I remembered I had previously done inventory on small whole goods and it may be on that list with a location. Thankfully it was. I found it and called her back but got no answer. 

3 minutes later my boss (45m) calls. I answer the phone and he begins by saying ""I got a call from a Mrs.____, who says she hasn't got her light bar she bought from there LAST YEAR!"" I say ""yeah I actually just found one, I tried calling back but got no answer, she's being a bit of a c***, but I put her on speaker for others to listen and remained professional"" he says ""well she has been perfectly nice to me and YOU DO REALIZE SHE HAS HAD TO GO TO ANOTHER DEALER TO GET STUFF BECAUSE SHE CANT GET IT FROM US"" I respond ""yes, but you realize this wasn't my sale right? It was yours, you sold it to them"". This of course makes him even more irate and he yells loud enough for his brother and the secretary to hear thru the phone ""DONT START YOUR FUCKING SHIT WITH ME DONT START BEING RUDE DO NOT MAKE ME COME UP THERE!!"" to which I respond ""Well I mean.. come up here (insert name of 45m), but I didn't even do anything.."" he screams ""OKAY!"" and proceeds to hang up on me. 

15 minutes later he comes FLYING into the parking lot in his company truck, jumps out with his chest puffed out, fists clenched and teeth gritting together - ready to physically fight it appears. He BURSTS through the showroom door and in doing so nudges the Christmas tree and decides to go ahead and punch it over, then gets in my face screaming ""YOU WANTED ME UP HERE? NOW HERE I FUCKING AM!"" I said ""(45m name) what?? I didn't even do anything!"" He screams ""YOU GET YOUR GOD DAMN ASS INTO THE OFFICE IN HERE RIGHT FUCKING NOW"". Of course after the violent outburst, I'm not about to go ANYWHERE alone with this man so I say ""what? No! Why?"" He yells ""BECAUSE IM YOUR FUCKING BOSS AND YOU DO WHAT I GOD DAMN TELL YOU TO DO!!"" Being scared to death at what this man will do, again I said ""NO! I am NOT doing that!"", keep in mind, my 7y/o son is hearing ALL of this, along with his brother, the secretary and customers at the parts counter just outside the showroom. He then proceeds to walk aggressively toward me again, getting in my face and screaming ""IVE HAD E FUCKING NOUGH OF YOUR GOD DAMN BULL SHIT, YOU WILL DO WHAT I TELL YOU TO DO"" I respond ""NO, (45m name) I didn't even do anything, this was your sale, how was I supposed to even know she needed a light.."" before I can finish he continues screaming profanities and insults, all the while his younger brother just stands there with his head down allowing the violent interaction to continue. The secretary has left the room scared and uncomfortable and my son is nearby at the parts counter. My 45m boss then continues screaming saying something about how I'm fired, I better be getting my shit and leaving (which I do, although his father, the owner, later rescinds because the son does not have this authority, especially when the father realized how bad this was and how wrong his son was). As I'm gathering my things he starts screaming again saying something along the lines of ""99% OF THE TIME WHEN I GET THESE CALLS IT IS YOUR SALE AND YOU DID FUCK SOMETHING UP"" I respond with ""(45m name) that's not true! My customers don't even know you, IF they ever had a complaint they'd call up HERE and speak to your father!"" His response seems to be an attempt to cover his a** when he says ""WHEN I FUCKING TELL YOU TO SHUT UP AND LET ME TALK, THATS WHAT YOU DO! WHEN I CALLED YOU GOT SMART ASS AND DECIDED TO SAY ""HA FUCK YOU GO AHEAD AND COME UP HERE!"" to which I responded ""THATS A LIE! YOUR OWN BROTHER AND SECRETARY HEARD THE WHOLE DAMN THING!"" He says ""WHATEVER, FUCK YOU. I SAID GET YOUR SHIT AND GET OUT"". So I yell for my son to come on, and we leave. 

This family has ALWAYS been good to me. The father is an older, very wonderful man, the younger brother is the same, they are both family men and love their wives and children more than I think I've ever seen. Even 45m is generally a pretty good man, has loaned me money, let me borrow his farm truck to haul things, etc. I do not want to cause them ANY legal harm. However, I do need to do something. I need to feel safe working there and I currently do not. I had to work a few hours Saturday and spent the whole time panicking about whether he would show up being crazy for something again. I should add, this is NOT the first time he has had violent outbursts, its just the first time he has actually come at me aggressively, the man literally ""flinched"" on me twice as if he would hit me. Previously he has kicked a hole in my office door while screaming at me over selling a tractor at a price his father set because he intended to sell it for more and personally profit. As I said, I don't want to cause them any legal harm, I'm not even sure I could, but I do know that I want something SERIOUS done this time,  dealing with these violent outbursts is NOT okay, especially when he acts as though he is going to hit me. If something isn't done about it, I guess I'll explore legal options, but I'd prefer to keep my job and find some sort of solution. 

Any thoughts or advice?"

I really like the work, and I'm good at it. At our company holiday party, my boss said I was the best admin they'd ever had since the company started, so it's not just my wishful thinking. I was also recently given a 1$ raise based off performance. I would say things are going well.

Right before the new year weekend, my boss came over to my desk and asked if I liked data entry. As data entry is a big part of my job, and I do like it, I said yes. She asked if I was at all interested in working with billing, specifically accounts payable. I don't know \*anything\* about accounts payable, so I asked what kind of duties there were and she explained a little - and that there would be an associated raise if I agreed to go to accounts payable.

I said I wasn't sure, and she offered a trial period where I could do a little bit of the accounts payable work and if I liked it I could transfer to billing. I agreed, and the trial period is set to start next month (2/23).

My question is, is this a wise career move? I really like my admin work, basically the only thing I don't like is interacting with clients face-to-face because admin also works front desk. This would definitely move me off front desk, but I already enjoy the rest of my job (referral capture, provider relations, call forwarding, records keeping, handling paperwork). Is this a good move?"

Context: I'm technically starting my second semester in two weeks of my third year at a maritime academy tied to a community College in Michigan. I'm in Texas currently .

I originally was going to do this so I can get on ships but now I don't care about getting on ships and feel like continuing my degree at that school is wasting more of my time and money because:

I think I want to be a Power Plant Operator instead. I know I can do this after completing the school in Michigan since ships have their own power plant but the school sucks, and it'll cost much more not only in tuition but for room and board.)

There's a community College here in Houston that's a 45 minute drive away and more cheaper than the school in Michigan and from the looks of it, a better learning experience. 

I just feel like I'm making a dumbass decision."

I’m currently in a bit of a spot that I would like some peoples input on. I (21M) graduated from a community college in my area with a technical associates degree for Laser Electro-Optics and I’m continuing on to an engineering degree. I also scored a job as a Technician for a large defense contractor that pays fairly well for a 21 year old, and I’m looking to make my next step. 

My family is saying I should ditch the job or at least go part time and finish my undergraduate as fast as possible while my professor from my CC is saying I should take my time and have my job pay for my education and while it’ll be a couple years later I finish, supposedly I can probably start off with higher pay and have a load of technical background to propel me forward. I also have a scholarship that’ll cover half my tuition if I do full time school. While I would like to just speed through my undergraduate and be an engineer, I also do like the idea of having that technical experience while saving money and having a higher pay to boot when I do finally get the bachelors. I was wondering what some other people think and use some feedback to help me consider what could be the optimal decision."

I've worked in high stress fast paced jobs and am great at dealing with people. what are some job titles I should look for in my job search

I currently work for the school district as a Field Trip Coordinator. Any sport games, band competitions, UIL Events or Elementary trips go through me.  My past experience, I worked for the government as a event/social media coordinator, during that time I was on a military base in Japan so most of the events involved the locals in the community. I loved this job but of course I married a military guy and moved with him, which brings me to my current job. I love the job itself, everyday is something new,  someone always needs help and I love being able to solve whatever problem are in the way. I'm great with people and communicating, emails/phone calls all day, jumping from one thing to the next, it definitely keeps me on my toes. However,  I'm not just doing the job I was hired to do,  one of the requirements of this job is that I had to get my CDL because ""there is a bus driver shortage"" and they said that if they needed me to drive as a last resort then I would be able to... well apparently the last resort is everyday.. all day.  I drive a bus 5+ hours a day and I'm still expected to have all field trips covered, and now they are cracking down on over time, so I might get 2 good hours of my actual job in a day which isn't enough. Then the director is having a power trip and wants me to uproot from my office and move to a different location 30 minutes further away from my house all because there are problems at that locations he wants me to fix.  

A brand new bus driver starts at $20.00 (recent change) why am I doing 4x the work and only making $20.98? Anyway rant over

I'm ready to move on,  there are so many things starting to stack up but I don't know what kind of jobs are out there that best fit my skills. 

 Multi tasking, working in a fast paced environment, communicating via in person/emails/over the phone, Excellent in Microsoft and Google suites, leadership, problem solving, the list goes on.

I know my skills would be a perfect fit for plenty of jobs I'm just having a hard time searching because I don't know what those titles would be. Any ideas/recommendations would be amazing (I live in austin, tx)"

After a few dozen interviews Im starting to get to a point where I feel like Im unemployable and could uae advice on where I might target the job search.

Quick stats:

- pieced together my degree across deployments, no prestigious name on my 4 year.
- 9 years military, lead groups from 3-20 doing Nsa intel for top 10 national threats in theater
- arabic linquist
- wounded in combat/gap
- 1 year pricing analyst
- 1 year admissions
And then the hard part. 

- 4.5 years fortune 50 saas sales. Promoted rapidly through bdr,inside sales,partner,customer success. Then finished my time there spending two years building a monthly subscription service version of our platform. Took it from business model to 300 customers and 40 people. Working with almost every leader globally. Built and lead a sales team that was experimental and non traditional. built new experimental processes in pso, engineering, sales engineering, success, partnerships, and business development. Product managed the build of a custom crm for the team. Etc.
- vc company carves us out, reorgs, cuts my product, fires the team.

Issues:
- cant get an individual contributor job in the four IC roles I held - they either think Im under qualified due to such a short time in each specialty,  or think that I wont be happy/wont stay. Sometimes dq'd by old pay being top of range despite assurances id come down.

- they dont recognize the miltary experience at all. Which is a common issue.

- cant land the management or director roles - want more experience or I dont have the exact experience building the same exact org theyve already designed for the role. 

- not getting responses from operations, product manager, or project manager

Anyone have any suggestions of role titles or where I could start to look or what to do? Before I had the manager title, id constantly have written offers to turn down. But now without a job, and having a lot more experience, it feels like Im unemployable suddenly."

idk what i’m expecting out of this maybe some advice or just to vent because i’m really stressed out right now

i’m in high school, senior year and am nearing the end of my first semester, overall in high school i was an okay student with the exception of math which i screwed myself over with by not paying attention in the beginning, i tried to pull myself together in gr 11 and worked my ass off in functions and managed to get a mark somewhere in the mid 60s (can’t remember what it was specifically) overall my other marks were decent in gr 11 ranging from 70-90 depending on the course, this year it’s just been so bad. i’m failing advanced functions really badly like REALLY badly and it’s to a point of being unable to actually bring it up at all let alone on time, and it’s not like i don’t try i try the hardest in that course compared to literally every other course, but it just doesn’t click for me and i know it’s my fault for not paying attention early on because now it just feels like im playing catch up except im way too behind. my other marks are also shit this sem, i have 2 other courses and a spare and they’re both in the 50s right now, im so upset at myself because of all the times i could’ve been experiencing burnout im experiencing it now when my marks matter the most, i don’t know how to fix myself it’s not like i couldn’t have gotten better marks i just fell into a pit of depression and lack of motivation that sucked my will to do anything right out of me. idk what to do 

in addition to my shit marks i’m also so lost because i don’t wanna do anything i’m not passionate about anything i’m not super interested in anything i’m not exceptionally good at anything especially not anything that matters but i’m a broke immigrant so i NEED to find a well paying job i can’t afford to just do nothing or not stress about this, i’ve done SO much research into so many fields and have built understandings of each but they all just seem so out of reach to me 

looked into accounting, can’t major in it without math so i’m fucked
dental hygiene, 75+ in bio and i don’t have that nor did i take gr 12 bio 
publishing, awful pay and hard to get into
anesthesiologist, don’t think i’d be able to pass the MCAT also med school is insanely competitive 
UX design, i was interested in this and i think i’d be a decent fit but honestly anything in tech just requires too much experience that i’m not sure where to get idek how i’d begin to prepare for this 
IT, idk how to code and it’s not sth i think i’d be able to do well 
project marketing, similar to UX design or requires experience that i don’t have and have no clue how to get
lawyer, one of the only things i may be able to do i enjoy learning abt the law and the only skill i really have is being able to read hundreds of pages of information and analyze it however apparently it’s hard to find articling positions and jobs especially ones with good pay also insane debt also a lot of memorization which makes me lose confidence 

i know the whole concept of not going into a field solely for the money which is why careers i researched into are all careers i have some form of an interest in but at the end of the day i just don’t have the luxury of choosing passion over money or literally anything over money, it fucking sucks being poor and i just need to make money so i can stop feeling so guilty for everything 

i have no useful skill to offer to the world and it makes me so upset like what i’m good at is not profitable and probably never will be 

like the thing is im not even hoping for a career/job where i don’t have to put in a lot of effort, i don’t mind effort i will work as hard as i need to i just need to have a stable career and a career that’s guaranteed (wishful thinking i know) and something i can actually DO 

anyway my point is i’m fucking lost and i know no one wants to spend their winter break reading about some teens breakdown but if u happen to have come across this and have any word of advice i’d really appreciate it"

Let me preface this by what I have done in the past and maybe ya’ll can help from there.

My mini resume 
-high school diploma
-PG year diploma
-College dropout in senior year of college (went to school for Exercise and health science)
-Promotions job in high school for large radio station
-a couple front desk representatives jobs 
-Certified personal trainer for 2+ years
-took some time of PT during Covid as most gyms were shut down. Was doing Grubhub delivery.
-Got a job doing SDR cold calling sales gig and after 7 months I was promoted to sales specialist 


My main question is what should I do from here?

I have found that many people are in the same shoes I am in now. SDR to what???

I like the sales gig but it’s not my favorite as it’s not as fulfilling as I thought it could be.

Do I continue to go down the AE / AM route or do I switch to more customer service or do I go back and get a degree.

All I want is a job that’s easy where I can make decent money and not have to hustle as much as I am now.

I've always thought of it as a bonus but would a graduate employing company even care that i have the extra major other than my main econ.

I'd like to have your advice on my career. I have almost 10 years of work experience and I always worked on international politics and diplomacy, mainly related to climate change. To make it short, I'm a climate change negotiations specialist. I have a stable job now working for the Foreign Services of a major country but I'd like to move to the private sector. I'm thinking about this mainly for the career perspectives the private sector would open to me and also to leave my comfort zone. As I have a background on political science and international relations, I think I'd fit in a Public Affairs/Lobbying company/department. 

Is there anyone here with a similar experience or anyone working on Public Affairs/Lobbying? Or anyone that moved from Public to Private sector? Any advice would be great. Thanks!"

In other words, the life of an online-university professor seemed pretty chill. No office hours, nothing needing to be done in-person, just grade a few dozen papers per month, grade a few dozen exams and quizzes per month, make a few dozen forum posts (often super-brief,) and.......that's it?

Well, it seems I have decided to outsource my decision making to Reddit. I have recently finished the first semester of Systems Engineering at my university and I’m afraid I don’t like it very much. The topics are fine and I feel like I’m moderately good at it, but most of my classmates are pretty dull and I’m kinda worried about my future workload after reading several articles about programmers burnout. I am really interested in cinema and literature and it seems like no other person studying this career shares these interests. The people who actually like those subjects are studying them, so I’ve been thinking about studying something on a field I am actually creatively fulfilled. Studying cinema seems like a great idea, but I’ve been told by some people working on the industry it is a nightmare. I live in the third world, so the chances of success are quite small and there’s not a lot of work. My parents aren’t rich either so getting the funding for the university short films sounds like a huge problem. So, I’ve been debating between two options: CS and living a life of burnout or film and skipping meals to fund short films nobody will watch. It is a though devotion, so I’ve been looking for ideas and possible solutions, maybe even other career options. Happy new year and thank you for reading."

**Backstory:**

I'm at my current job for a year now. Before that I had two long jobs (2-3 years) and two short term jobs (6 -12 months). I left the short term jobs because there were better offers but sadly I did not enjoy it that much so I switched jobs again.

**Current Job/the issue:**

At my new job, the pay is about the same and the workload is higher.... but I enjoy it more!  
I have a team lead that does some operational/implementation work as well. However, he keeps publishing his new versions of the software without testing it. He also tends to read over things and is always in a hurry/busy. 

He also, sometimes, has this ""Ah, it's easy, I'll fix that quickly"" or ""slack-y"" -attitude.

I corrected him numerous times, in a nice/1-on-1 manner. Just pointing it out. No judgement or whatever. But it seems to re-occur.

**Salary/perspective:**

Recently we had a meeting about my pay. I recently received an **excellent performance review**. When we discussed pay it only involved a minor bump (150 euros). He disagreed with my new pay too. So, on that behalf, he's on my side. We were to discuss this again on Wednesday but now the meeting is postponed (again).

Next to that, I also had a brief, orientation with another company that really wanted to hire me. A friend/former colleague recommended me.

**Summary:**

Although, I enjoy my job but his mistakes/lack of professionalism bothers me a lot. The meeting about my salary was also somewhat disappointing because, although my performance was excellent, the compensation is somewhat minor.

I know I can earn more somewhere else but I don't really feel like leaving for another job. It would look so weird on my resume.

Any suggestions how to handle this issue?"

Taking in consideration my art background, graphic design seems to be easier to learn. I am not sure about the demand tho. This field seems quite saturated. Please tell me if I am wrong.

I also started to learn webdev through some online course. I think it’s pretty alright. Maybe not my favourite thing but I can tolerate that haha. There seems to be a lot of opportunities in that field. Am I right?

I have been considering for some time making a complete professional shift and leaving the advertising world behind but I have not made up my mind yet. **I am looking for anybody that knows/decided to make the same decision**: changing from the advertising world to another field like engineering or IT - anything *more stable* but with a small creative background *if possible.*

I am still looking up for information in order to decide. Any information will be super, even somebody to contact that experienced this.

I'm 27 years old and located in Spain. I have completed two years of advertising school which have been super insightful on how to work creatively and prepare a portfolio but it seems too difficult to establish a professional career as a creative. I would like to work somewhere these creative abilities are valued but probably won't be the main priority when it comes to daily labour.

How likely is that to happen? What would you recommend to me? **Should I go back to study something else?**

*All I want is to be able to afford an independent adult life*, and it seems quite impossible so far.

Thanks for reading this &lt;3"

Really looking for guidance or an unbiased perspective at least. Created a throw away as I live in a tiny town and know my circle is heavy into Reddit. I'll try to keep this succinct. 

**Career profile**

I’ve been working for about 10 years now in the natural sciences and software space. I’ve got degrees in both, so I can play the role of a programmer or scientist and I really like that work and field.

**Company 1**  
Role: Programmer / Scientist  
On site, 65 USD, duration 5 years total, sciences

I quickly moved into leadership roles, company was more science than tech so I found my niche and ran with it. Eventually hit a wall, management was against a lot of new development ideas I could fit in along with the status quo they wanted me to support. I was also advised that I was more a programmer than a software developer, totally fair and I know the differences.  But I ran into a wall, and no way to further grow, I tried a few positions within the same company to identify growth opportunities and it went nowhere.  

**Company 2**  
Role: Engineering Manager   
Hybrid, 100 USD, duration 14 months, software company in IT

Found a software management role in town completely unrelated to sciences, Hybrid (pre pandemic). Role was great, team was great but then about 8 months in I started working with some pretty toxic leaders outside of my dev team and managers. My role changed, needing to manage 30+ people and full release management and I needed to start working with a remote team resulting in some heavy shifts as everyone was either US or India based. Working 12 hours a day was needed at least twice a week to ensure teams were all in sync. I burnt out, tried to push through it for another 6 months but couldn’t manage the stress. 

**Company 3**  
Role: Product &amp; Engineering Manager  
Remote, 90 USD, duration 12 months, health care

Took a fully remote role, 90 USD in the health care space. It was great, I confirmed how much I enjoyed the health care space and I didn’t have to manage the team but rather manage managers; I enjoyed this. I really loved this role but leadership were heavy micromanagers despite having no software expertise they didn’t let me do my job despite attempts to work with them on what would be owned vs consulted.

**Moment of Retrospection**

I took a moment to reflect on this point. I enjoyed the healthcare space, I love the math and stats world from my first job. 

Feedback from other leaders from these roles: Ambitous, very empathetic, successful at leveraging a democratic management style effectively, at times I ask too many open ended questions.

Feedback from teams I've managed: All team members really appreciated the empathy approach and setting them up for growth even if that meant I did a lot of coaching. 

So I’m my mind. I’m good with people, I enjoy math/analytics roles. I have found more joy in the healthcare space and realised managing managers and products is more enjoyable than larger teams. 

End retrospection

At this moment, Company 3 started layoffs and while I wasn't chosen, we had just started a family so I got nervous. I found a few roles aligned to this retrospection but those interviews always resulted in having to move out of town which I wasn’t planning to do because my spouse and I are starting a family close to our parents. 

**Company 4**  
Role: Engineering Manager  
Remote/on site(see further), 130 USD, ongoing 12+ months, software/IT

So I got another engineering management role in a more analytics facing area but not in health care. It’s remote, 130 usd, small team, I report to the VP and there’s another two managers on the team one more junior than me and one way more senior. Senior one has double my work experience and his tech stack is a perfect fit where as mine is more modern and a lot more adjacent to what we’re doing. 

Things go well, I’m getting great feedback, teams are hitting all our goals. But then my VP puts me under the more senior manager and my new manager puts another team on my plate. I now have the largest team, bigger than the junior and senior manager. I’m totally fine with this and still hit all our goals. 

Kid number 2 arrives. 

Then a couple things happen. My new manager tells me the remote option I agreed to is being dropped. I now have an hour commute each way. I’m also getting feedback I’m not technical enough from the my new manager. I’m also being told since they added the extra team Im not performing as well as I used to. No examples are given, no metrics are measured. The timing of this was interesting as it’s also when kid 2 entered my family's life. 

All of the feedback from my teams have been great. The KPIs I measure show teams are improving. My new manager is very authoritarian he’s the type that works nights and weekends with pride, and whenever there are mistakes made, there is no acknowledgment. Everything is done to the letter or process and if I need something from him and there's no tool from the company for him, he's unwilling to provide guidance. Ex: that technical feedback he gave, suggests I use LinkedIn learning and is unwilling to give me guidance as that's not his job. If I want mentorship, go see the mentorship process the company has. 

I personally want to prioritize my family and not work at the moment. At least until both kids are in day care. There’s been a lot of changes at the current workplace that I consider red flags and its clear my new managers style is not one I can work under happily. 

**The career Advice I'm seeking is:**

Given these roles since company 1 have been so short, I'm questioning whether or not I'm just out of my league? I feel like I have a rationalization for each as to why I would leave, but when I try to look at this objectively, I get the sense that maybe its more me thats the problem.

I could easily get another role. Head hunters are super aggressive in this field, I’m messaged weekly so I know I can move. 

My debate now is, have I been switching jobs because I find out that I’m not cut out for these roles, am I under-qualified causing me to doubt my future in these companies Or are these reasons rationale and it’s more a coincidence that every 12-18 months there are these reasons to leave. 

Help! Thoughts?"

I wish I could be more analytical, see patterns...and I honestly feel attracted to learn more about the technical part. I was thinking about moving towards a technical account manager/ csm role, or into data science. I feel a bit stuck and afraid at my age. But I was recommended to start with Python and learn that, since that is being used in multiple fields. Is there anyone who can relate or add other insights on how to transition from a commercial CSM role to more technical roles?

I was wondering, how do you all deal with aptitude and psychometric tests while sending dozens of CVs and cover letters to many companies without feeling drained?

In fact, I’m graduating in a couple of months but I’m looking for a job as a graduate since September and I’ve been only rejected. Moreover, to all the companies I was sending my CV, I had many aptitude and psychometric tests to complete, which were also really long. I believe, in three months I filled almost 90 of these tests as it was one of their requirements for applying to the advertised positions and now I’m feeling drained and can’t convince myself to send more CVs. 

I’m attending a uni here in the UK and I have been advised to send CVs before January if I wanted to start working in a company from September 2023 as many of them have set their deadlines for December and January. However, I’m feeling drained because of the uncountable aptitude and psychometric tests I need to fill all the time I send a CV to a company. And in one month for example, I usually send my CV to 30-45 companies, so I have like 30-45 tests to complete."

I have another company that has a vacancy for a position that I fit perfectly and I know I would get the job. This company is a very good company, I would definitely get a good raise from what i earn right now.
The thing is: my current company is paying me a post graduation that I will finish in october this year. I signed a document that says i cant leave the company for 2 years because of that (half year already gone). Otherwise I will have to pay for the course which is +/- 1.7x my monthly pay.
I dont feel like paying but thinking of so many months of this boredom.... Plus I haven't been raised since i joined the company yet.

It's at a very new, wishy-washy startup, where about 85% of the staff are younger than me and it's frankly not in the line of work I want to be in. To provide some backstory, I was laid off from a job I loved (and was excelling in) last summer and have struggled to get back into the line of work I was in (it's a bit of a niche area). This isn't the first job I've tried out since the layoff that hasn't been a fit and I take responsibility for choosing it out of haste. I regret this decision now.

I mainly took this job because it involved some interesting projects that I was told would be part of my regular duties when I was first hired. All else aside, I felt desperate to get out of the last role I tried out post-layoff (which was even worse) and just wanted to line something else up. Since then, said projects have all been dropped due to partnerships involved ""being too expensive"". Two people from my team have already been let go since I started (with one of them being laid off) - another thing that has raised red flags for me after my own layoff experience. I've also very quickly learned that my manager has zero prior management experience (he's even admitted it) and control issues. He micromanages, is horribly inconsistent with his communication and is the kind of person who likes turning what could be a short email or Slack message into an hour-long meeting. Before the holidays, an incident occurred where he sent me a really insulting and unprofessional email - all because he incorrectly thought I hadn't completed a project on time (I ended up having to go through a whole song and dance to prove that I had indeed completed said project by its deadline). I frankly see zero career growth at this company and don't see a future here at all.

Before the holidays, I had completed the final stage of a 3-part interview for a job I really want (at a large, reputable company and in the line of work my first job was in). They followed up with me before Christmas to tell me they would let me know about ""next steps"" in the new year. I was also contacted by another promising company right before the holidays. In addition to all of this, I have many contacts/freelance opportunities sitting in my inbox if I want to take them.

After everything that's happened since losing the job I loved, my mental health has taken a huge toll. I keep getting ill (I've never had more consecutive viruses in my life), have trouble sleeping every night, have constant nightmares, no longer have an appetite and experienced a pretty bad mental breakdown over all of this at Christmas. My family and friends are worried about me and some people are suggesting that I quit and prioritize my health. I'm supposed to have a ""mid-probationary"" review on the first week in the new year and I don't think I've ever dreaded returning to work so much before in my life. I just keep thinking about how the last thing I want to do is have a meeting where I have to talk in detail about my future at this company and discuss how I think things are going, when all I'm really thinking about is my exit. I also have this paranoid sense that my manager is setting me up to fail and that no matter what I say or do, he can somehow already sense that my heart isn't in this job.

My hope is that I'll know if I got the other job before the performance review happens, but if this doesn't happen, the thought of having to go through with it is filling me with such horrible anxiety. I feel so tempted to put in my notice during this meeting and reveal my true feelings, but at the same time I know quitting a job without another one being lined up isn't the responsible thing to do. Has anyone else ever been in this situation before and if so, what did you do?"

I am planning on handing in my notice tomorrow at my large national company because I have had an offer (with a slight salary increase) for a larger global company that is literally downstairs.

I absolutely hated it in my current place for the first 2.5. My boss and mentor was rubbish and other graduates even commented how I was spoken to like “sh*t”. I was not being trained and discouraged from asking when I tried.

I wasn’t introduced to anyone, was pressured to start work before even finishing my degree and then left to fend for myself with multiple pieces of work well above my level on day one. 

It felt like they just needed a body and I wasn’t there to be trained.

I am concerned because I have started to get more comfortable in my current role more recently, a younger guy has even offered to step up as my mentor (although he cannot sign off on work and isn’t as experienced) but my current role does fit my career aspirations slightly more (only slightly more but both have the same outcome overall).

I’m just worried this was a move I made when I hated it and applied to places but now should recognise that I started to feel as if I could stay.

2,2023-01-02,Should I continue to pursue my law degree and try to become a lawyer?,u/AerieAdventurous2080,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/101k1pg/should_i_continue_to_pursue_my_law_degree_and_try/,careerguidance,"First time posting! Throwaway account just because I feel embarrassed of my life at the moment, to say the least! I hope this is the right sub to ask my questions, please advise if that is not the case and which sub would be better suited to answer. Thank you!

Context:

I spent my first year of law school in the USA and then transferred to a Canadian law school but wasn’t able to complete my JD in Canada. Long story short, my performance at law school was lackluster at best, coupled with difficult financial situations (ie unable to pay tuition on time) and extenuating personal circumstances, I was asked to withdraw, meaning I was kicked out of the faculty (this was end of 2018). I was just one single course short of graduating. I tried appealing through the student review board for an opportunity to complete my JD but was declined. I have legal counsel looking into other ways I can complete my JD from the same university, though it’s looking more and more unlikely.

It seems as if my only option of becoming a lawyer is to apply to another law school in Canada as a student with advanced standing. I haven’t reached out to any law schools yet but having spoken to a few people, it seems I’d likely have to complete one year at another law school, which say at Osgoode Hall would cost approximately $30,000 in tuition for the year. Taking on additional debt at this point just gives me the shivers. And even if by some miracle I were to get in, I would still need to work full-time, while studying part-time (if that is even possible). Going back to my US law school and asking them to give me a chance at my JD is something I also thought of but would be a lot more costly than any Canadian law school I would think. I haven't actually reached out to them just yet, so still need to confirm the assocaited cost (if they would even allow it in the first place). 

I have been working as a tax and corporate law clerk since leaving law school, in the hopes of one day fulfilling my dream of becoming a lawyer. I started off at a very small law firm and was recruited to one of the biggest law firms in Ontario (outside of the downtown core). I have excelled at my jobs and have excellent references that will vouch for that.

I just turned 36 and my current gross income is approximately $95,000/year. My credit card debt is $28,000 and I owe $94,000 in student loans (OSAP). I am trying my best to pay off my credit card debt asap and hope to accomplish this feat by the end of the year, if not earlier. For OSAP I’m paying $900/month. I started an Amazon business on the side that runs entirely by my VA and nets about $500/month. I just filed a trademark for my brand, so hoping to scale this to much higher levels over the next few years.

Needless to say, I realize my situation is fucked. I've made a lot of mistakes but I really am trying to improve my life and grow my career. God knows I am trying! I have a family to think about and I want to provide the best for their future. 

I could use some genuine points of direction (questions below). Any help, guidance, advice, points and/or tips and tricks you can provide would be more appreciated than I can say. Thank you so much! Happy New Year! Wish you all the best this year has to offer :)

Questions

1. Do you think it’s worth a shot to even apply to another law school, given my current debt, the additional tuition cost, the requirement to study part-time, etc.? If so, any tips on how I should approach law school admissions? I was hoping to ask if they’d allow me to obtain my JD by taking just that one single course I need to graduate (one can dream right).

2. Or should I just forget thinking about pursuing my dream to become a lawyer at this point? And just try and continue to advance as a law clerk?

3. At the same time, I am looking to apply to new jobs and move up, in the hope of earning $120k per year. Desperately trying to pay off my credit card debt even faster! What would be the next best option for me pursue, in order to grow my career (as a law clerk for now and hopefully one day as a lawyer) and make a lot more money? Big-law? Bank? Private sector (ie equivalent to an in-house counsel jobs for lawyers)?

4. Lastly, how can I earn extra money on the side as a law clerk but without taking on too much debt or liability, given I usually work long days as it is? For example, for people who incorporated ‘simple’ companies and were just provided with the articles of incorporation and nothing else, I can offer my services to prepare their corporate minute books (with the information they should already have) for say $149/minute book. It wouldn’t be too complicated or time-consuming for me. Is that a good idea? If so, what sort of platforms can I use to offer these services? How do I actually get clients?

The fact that I know I am going to receive the same amount every paycheck has lead to my complacency. My pay is no longer motivating my performance as a self contributing employee. My supervisor tells me that I do a great job in the role, which I do, but I know more can be done. How do I get out of this rut?

5,2023-01-02,How can I explain to an interviewer that I've accepted a job but am waiting on them to extend an offer since it is my dream job without looking bad?,u/CoookieHo,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/101lenn/how_can_i_explain_to_an_interviewer_that_ive/,careerguidance,"So this is a very interesting situation to say the least.

In Nov, I accepted a new job that will start in mid Feb, where I will also be relocating. My current boss knows I've accepted the job, and my last day at my current job is Feb 10.

One week after accepting the job, I received an email for an interview. Normally, I wouldn't entertain another job after accepting this one since the TC package is very good and the job appeals to me. I was actually turning down a few interviews, but this specific email was for an interview for my dream position for my dream job. 

I accepted the interview and made it to round 2/3. Round 2 is supposed to be in early Jan, I'm really hoping they get it scheduled this week. I feel like I'm a top candidate and have had a good rapport going on with the interviewer who will also be my supervisor. All signs point to me being a finalist. Whether or not I get the job, I would like to have this all sorted out before mid Feb so that I can be properly relocated, know where I'll be working, and not have to worry about quitting a job I just started for a new job if I'm offered the dream job a few weeks into the new job. If the interview process is completed before my new job start date, it would save me a lot of hassle.

So this is where my question starts. If I make it past the second round, how can I politely ask to have the final round scheduled sooner than later without hurting my chances or looking pushy?

 If I make it to the final round, how can I ask to have a decision made sooner rather than later without hurting my chances or looking pushy?

If I'm extended an offer late January, how can I politely ask to start the job within the next two weeks so that I'm not unemployed for a few weeks since I would turn down the new job? without sounding pushy and hurting my chances?

Lastly, should I explain the situation to the interviewer? If so, how? I feel like if I tell them I already accepted a job but plan on turning it down if I'm offered the dream job can look bad on me. It'll look like i'm not a man of my word. I'm not turning down the new job unless I get offered the dream job since there's no guarantee I'll be offered the dream job. That being said, I would like to know the best way to have the interviewers expedite the process without sounding pushy and desperate and hurting my chances, so that I can get this all sorted out before mid-Feb."

For context, I’m still in college and work part time at this job. I’ve noticed that I lack confidence at my job depending on who I work with, due to how my co-workers go about acrually working. What I mean by this is there’s about 5 “senior” staff that work at said occupation (meaning they’ve been working there for over a year). The rest (about 6-8) of us are newer staff. With that, I find that senior staff gets upset a lot by the mistakes we “newer” staff make. Some reactions to the mistakes are warranted, but others just excessive. I find that the senior staff genuinely forgets how it feels to be new and often nitpick several mistakes we make — which honestly makes it super intimidating to even work with them. You would think as senior staff, they would understand that mistakes happen and not talk shit but they do and it’s just annoying. It’s also pretty much impossible to go to management about this because of how close they are with senior staff. I genuinely just want to focus on myself and my work ethic and not get caught up with staff. Any tips?"

I certainly made a mistake going to school out of state but I do have good news. I have a job lined up which I’m starting right after I graduate and my starting pay rate is $80k. 

It’s also important to note that my job is located in a very poor, low COL area. I expect my monthly rent to be no more than $1500, but ideally I’m looking for ~$1000. 

I have no issues with living below my means. I don’t need a fancy apartment or a fast car or anything like that. I just want to get my loans paid off asap. Is 5 years completely impossible or is that a reasonable goal?

Here’s my (very rough) thought process:
80k is about 60k after taxes. That’s 5k a month, minus 1k for rent I’m left with 4000 per month. Take away another 1000 for other needs like groceries etc, 500 for savings and I’m left with 2500 per month to contribute to my loans, or 30,000 per year (roughly half of my take home pay)"

1,2023-01-02,Potential PhD dropout who had an absolute path -- now feeling incredibly lost?,u/Thoughtgeist,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/101o2z6/potential_phd_dropout_who_had_an_absolute_path/,careerguidance,"I'm having a mental breakdown and will be taking a leave of absence from my (humanities) PhD program (hopefully they grant it to me; if they don't...I might just quit because the thought of continuing into this upcoming semester is literally unbearable and makes my chest hurt).

I thought I knew what I wanted. I double-majored in a humanity and social science in undergrad with the original goal of becoming a high school teacher. Fell into research with a mentor and a research fellowship to eventually go to grad school. I had the path mapped out and mapped out for me. I continued on it because I thought that's what I wanted. I have literally been in school for the last 25 years with maybe two semesters off (non-consecutively). Overachieved: got summa cum laude with a 4.0 in undergrad, and a 4.0 in my Master's (en route to PhD). I'm struggling with this perfectionism, and it's really what gives me pause about completely quitting my PhD outright--the idea that I didn't achieve the highest thing I possibly could in the only thing (school) I've been good at.

Looking back, I realize it was unwise to major in humanities. I have not even the prerequisites to do a master's in science if I wanted to: no upper-level math or science courses to speak of.

I've become dispassionate about everything in the last two years since I started grad school. Even my original love for literature is gone because I read *so much.* The next step in my grad program would be to read 150 books for my Qualifying Exams and I just can't. I have the worst brain fog, can't remember anything, and that's on top of what I think is a severe anxiety disorder. I've lost interest in my research topic and I am also completely disillusioned with the circuitous ivory tower that is academia. Even before I contemplated quitting I knew I wasn't going to pursue a career in academia. I 100% at least know that.

Right now, to prep for my LOA, I'm applying for jobs, and I realize for the moment I will take anything because I need health insurance and an income. I'm pretty qualified for administrative work with my previous work experiences that I did while in college. I have 4 interviews this week, which I guess is a good prospect. But *career-wise* and even life-wise, I have no idea what I want anymore. I think I still love reading. I still buy books that would mainly be for my reading pleasure even though I have no time to read them. I don't want to be stuck in an administrative job forever and I'm so afraid that if I transition to full-time admin support work I'll just stay there.

I've thought about getting into writing again, because I really do love it (but not academic writing; I hate that) but writers are a penny a dozen nowadays, right? I feel like that would be a pretty unrealistic goal.

I have no idea what I want to do. I feel listless and like my passions are just embers now. I've gone from having the next four years in stone at least to being ejected into space like an accused imposter in Among Us. I realize it's of my own doing because of my mental health, but the only positive thing that's come of this is that at least I know one career I don't want. I feel incredibly weak for even wanting to quit, and I don't want anyone who really knows me to think that it's not because I didn't want to work hard. I'm going to talk to a psychologist about what's going on with me mentally, but I would literally work a 12+ hour retail shift (which I've done before) than the current prospect of continuing with academia for at least the next few months.

I'm afraid of being stagnant in whatever job I do get. And I worry that my MA in a humanity discipline will be utterly a waste and that employers will just scoff at it."

Hi everyone, and happy new year!

Last September I joined a new company as an Account Executive. First week on the job I realized that this company is not for me but I liked the product and the culture and I thought I’d give it a chance. The reason I thought so was because the VP made a few comments ‘jokingly’ making me thinks he lacks any emotional intelligence, or any humanity. They were red flags for me about the senior management of this company.

Fast forward and early December my direct manager tells me that they will be changing things in Q1, including my team and my market. I work for UKI accounts, but they want to move me to MENA. I said I didn’t want that because I specifically joined this market as it aligns with my future career plans, and also because its a more mature market and makes more money, so I have a better chance of getting my targets. My manager made it clear that it is not his decision to make but that he will communicate this to senior management. 

Last Friday in the Q my manager pulls me in the meeting room and tells me that the decision has been made and I’ll be moving in Q1. I told him how I feel hasn’t changed and that I feel cornered because I’m still under probation, and if I make a fuss about it, I’ll be deemed unfit for the culture and I’ll be fired soon. He reiterated that it wasn’t his decision.

Now I want to start looking for a new job, how do I justify the very short employment to new companies if I find any opportunities? Also, how do I go on about writing it on my LinkedIn on or my CV? Any advice?

For context I work in the EMEA HQ, I have 9 years in media sales and 4 years in SAAS."

My sister referred me to the large, super profitable company call centre she works for and I interviewed and got hired for the sales position but months later when they called me with a start date they said I would be starting off in technical assistance as there were no positions available in sales. 

I figured I would give it a go as I had waited almost 5 months from interviewing to start the job and was ready for a change. The first week on the phones after training I cried everyday because the customers were so angry/rude/frustrated because their equipment wasn’t working or technicians hadn’t been out yet to fix things, etc. 

It’s been over a month now and while the customer interactions aren’t getting to me as much, I really don’t enjoy the nature of the work and don’t know if I can stick it out long enough to actually progress into the department I might enjoy more or benefit from more. 

There’s so many aspects to the job that I don’t like and I don’t think there’s enough positives to persuade me to stick it out. But I don’t want to feel like a failure, go back to the old job and be stuck with the original issues and no career progression. 

Any advice is appreciated!"

&amp;#x200B;

1. Game Developer / Programmer:

\+  I love making games and the documents that go with them. I work with  Unity in my spare time, and even though I haven't published games yet, I  plan on going into my first game jam in 4 days to hopefully get some  experience and see if this is a viable career.

\-  The downsides is how long it takes to actually break into the industry  and how long it would take to get a job at a studio \[Since building a  good portfolio takes a while\]; that and since I plan on moving to  Germany in around 3-4ish years there isn't really a job market for game  development there.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Working with Animals / Nature \[Zoology, Ecology, etc\]:

\+  Working with animals and nature would be interesting since who doesn't  love animals? It would be very fun to wake up every morning knowing my  work is helping animals out even if its backbreaking work, overtime and  all that jazz.

\- The amount of  schooling I'll need including experience will not only take a long while  but put me in massive debt, since Financial Aid wont cover everything  and I'm to broke to afford school outright; and once again, not sure how  the market is for this type of work in Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Veterinarian:

\+  As similar to the point above this one is more specialized. Either  working with home pets or exotic animals doing Vet work would be  interesting and something I can see myself enjoying.

\-  Once again the amount of schooling I'll need to make even a livable  income is a lot, let alone the amount of experiences needed as well; and once again, not sure the job market for this in Germany.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall  I'm stuck between wanting to do these 3 and being very off putted by it  as well. From having financial issues where I am now, to just wanting  to do these jobs and not wait, I am stuck where I am. I know it is  either due to laziness or just wanting to do these jobs now and not  wait, but I have no idea what to do, and any help would be greatly  appreciated. Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon!"

I'm a junior in college pursuing a double major in a humanities field (english/lit-adjacent) and in math at an Ivy League. I only mention the school because the impression I've been given is that employers care about this, although honestly I don't know if that's true anymore. I'm asking for advice here because I'm not very involved in many pre-professional spaces on campus and I'm disillusioned with the careers I see a lot, if not most of my peers go into. Not only do they seem to work young grads to the bone, they also have them doing things I find really morally repugnant and want nothing to do with it if at all possible.  

In terms of what I want and can offer: Ideally speaking, I would like a well-paying, remote job so I could move around every few months. Besides this and the moral requirement, I'm not picky––I would be happy to take any job in any field that takes me. I have a 4.0 GPA and speak multiple languages fluently, but I don't really have any professional experience besides research work in the humanities and tutoring. Over the last two summers, I've pursued research and took classes abroad, which I was planning on doing again this summer but some of this career anxiety has led me to think I might want to do something else, although what would be helpful I'm not sure. 

I'm much more interested in the humanities than in math––I'm strongly considering going to grad school for the humanities a few years after I graduate, itself a terrible career choice from what I understand––but I would be happy to work a job that relies more heavily on the math skills if it pays well. Generally speaking, though, I don't know how suited my resume would be to a STEM career, since I haven't done any STEM extracurriculars or internships in my time at college. While I am keeping my math major since I'm practically done with all my requirements, I also haven't taken any math classes (or STEM classes more broadly) in the last year. 

On reflection, I feel like the best place for me to land would be tech, since careers in writing are dying out and not much else seems to pay well, but I don't have any coding experience so I'm not sure if there's space for me there. I briefly considered doing a coding bootcamp or something, but I'm not sure how helpful that would be, especially since it seems like it's mostly for people who already have established careers. In any case, I would really appreciate any guidance here. Thanks!"

I haven’t really gone to school for anything yet but I’m able and willing.

Specifically what I’m looking for is something repetitive, monotonous, and routine. I’m autistic and have ADHD and I find stuff like that to be anchoring, satisfying and rewarding. Like I like the stuff that’s more brain numbing and predictable without making me use too much creative energy, if that makes sense (I get overwhelmed very easily, especially by unfamiliar or complicated things). I also love organizing and categorizing things!

I’ve dabbled in coding and I didn’t really like it; there wasn’t enough structure and consistency for me. It felt like there were too many variables. But that could be also because I didn’t go to the right sources to learn.

I did briefly have an online job working for a friend’s e-commerce company. It started off as blog-writing which I HATED. It took me way too long to formulate my thoughts and it was overwhelming. But then I got tasked with taking products and putting their info in Shopify and it was absolutely amazing, I could do it for hours on end and not get tired of it. 

Is there a job out there like that? If so what would I have to do to get it? What should I expect?

Any info or advice would be appreciated :)"

425,2023-01-02,What have I learned going from waiting tables to a corporate senior manager? (United States),u/we_got_caught,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/101tpc5/what_have_i_learned_going_from_waiting_tables_to/,careerguidance,"Brain dump of career advice from someone who is content.

I went from waiting tables at age 29 and having no idea what I wanted to making $140,000 at age 41 and this is what I’ve learned over the past 12 years.

First thing that I realized was that work can just be work; it doesn't need to be a passion. Sometimes work is just a paycheck to give you the time and money to pursue your passions. Am I particularly passionate
about my career? Nope. Am I damn good at it? Yup. When I'm working, I work hard and produce good work and have good relationships with my colleagues. I realized I needed to find a place that would offer me security and that Ineeded to work my butt off to be as good as I could be at my job. That doesn't necessarily mean promotions (though they will come with good
work, a good attitude, and skills that others find valuable). I got into the door at my former company and realized it offered a $ $ $ level and work security I never
had before, so I decided to do whatever I needed to to make myself invaluable.


Also, promotions don't necessarily mean expanding vertically or becoming a CEO. Sometimes it means staying where you're at and expanding horizontally by adding to your skills and experience and becoming an
expert in a THING rather than managing others or making business-y decisions.
I also learned that I had to find a ""theme"" for my career. My theme has been ""I'm excellent at taking things other people create with their skills and smarts and polishing them and packaging them for delivery"". That theme can be applied to many different areas, but it resonates with everyone I have interviewed with. It shows I appreciate the smarts of the people around me and am able to support them in a way to get things done. Do you see what I mean?

The second thing I learned is to vocalize what I want. At first, Ididn't know what that was, so I talked to a LOT of people around me, asking them what did for their job,
what they liked about it, what they didn't like, and what they did to get where they were. And a lot of them said that relationships are key. Becoming ""the go-to person"" for ONE thing can be a very valuable thing. It creates relationships where you save someone's butt and you can go to them to leverage THEIR skills. Once I figured out what area I wanted to go into, I looked at what I currently had skill-wise, what was needed to get where I wanted to go, and started working towards filling those gaps.

You don't have to be good at everything. Pick one or two things and hone your skills in that area. Get any and all certifications or awards you can related to that skill. I am fantastic at organizing projects, so l got a
master's in Project Management (education that my former company paid for) and my PMP certification (proof of experience). This opened doors for me to specialize further in managing specific types of projects. I then obtained a certification related to that to further show my skills. But give me math or a complicated spreadsheet? I'm lost. BUT I have a connection who is amazing at that, and she shares her skills and understanding with me and I do the same for her when she needs to, say, bounce the wording of an important email off of someone who won't judge her and isn't involved in it.

Finally, I learned to find meaning in my life outside of my work. I keep a distinct work-life balance. When I'm done for the day, I try not to check my email or hop online unless it's REALLY necessary. Otherwise? It can
wait till tomorrow. I take my PTO and I enjoy it. I spend money on the things that are important to me, like good food, fun things (for me, that's baseball games, Broadway musicals, bands, and doing pottery as a creative hobby). I make sure to spend time with my friends and family and cultivate those relationships that are important to me.

Again, this is just what works for ME. It may look completely different for you, but take a look at yourself, your life, what you value, and what kind of life you want, and then.... just start. Figure out the small, incremental steps to get where you want to go. And you will make mistakes. You will try something and go ""oh hell no, that was dumb"" and then take that lesson and LEARN from it, apply it to future experiences and move forward.

I hope this helps. It takes time and doesn't happen overnight. You'll take two steps forward and one step back. You'll have shitty interactions with assholes. You'll face rejection. You'll doubt your abilities. But that's okay. It's part of the process. Be confident in who you are, what your values are, and what you bring to the table, and eventually, the pieces will start to fit
together. It may not be perfect, but my goal is to have a life/career that is ""pretty damn good"" about 80% of the time, and that kind of offsets the shitty times, which become easier to deal with the more you deal with
them.

Sorry for the novel. This is something important to me and something I want to help others with. Best of luck to you, friends."

I don't think I've ever met a single person who only ever worked in their field of study, a lot of people I've met always worked in various different fields anyway.

I work for a large asset manager in the US, and I recently applied for a transfer opportunity within my firm. I was mostly looking to work in a more technical field and receive a slightly higher salary, which my current opportunity just is not providing. I spoke with a recruiter as well as the hiring manger on the new team. Following my interview and after asking my current manager for permission to switch, I received verbal confirmation from the hiring manager and the recruiter that the transfer would be processed in early January. I did not receive a formal offer letter, so I followed up with HR.

HR reached out to my manager, and they spoke about preventing the transfer from happening. Apparently, our team is understaffed for the amount of workload coming into the company, and my manager does not want to lose an additional employee. I spoke with HR and they said that the company did not want to lose me as an employee, but would not be providing a higher salary or any of opportunities that the other team provided.

To make matters worse, my current manager has become quite hostile and is threatening to withhold my bonus and refuse to hike my salary this year. This year has been especially challenging for me, as our company has not raised pay at all during inflation (or since 2021). I am currently looking to leave my firm, and I am thinking I have an external opportunity coming. I would prefer not to provide my current employer with two weeks' notice, but I would prefer to hear advice on this. Can someone help me out here?"

As a first-time parent with no direct knowledge of what to expect made it was difficult for me to continue with the job since it requires me to be away for 21 days every month.

After consistent research, I decided to quit my job to focus on finding ways to support him. I followed some specialist's recommendations to develop visual &amp; verbal communication tools and assessment materials which proved to be of great help.

We were able to achieve some impressive success rates. He's now seven and has exceeded all performance expectations. In early 2022, he was gradually transitioned into a general learning environment at the recommendations of his teachers, after multiple and consistent performance evaluations, and he will be moving up to 3rd Grade this year.

To help pay the bills after I left my job, I started looking for something flexible to do, I met someone from usautosale who informed me about a $200 referral fee for any customer I sent to him who completed the purchase. I started making an ad on Fb, Craigslist, Letgo, and other sites. I made about $1000 or more a month. It was helpful but wasn't enough.

Then I went on ThemeForest, purchased a WordPress template and created an auto-buying website, and configured it in a way that when a prospective buyer completed and submit the form, it will automatically share the information to my contact at the usaautosale without me having to manually do that. Please note: This was my first time building a website, and I only learn to do this from the template documentation and a little online research to make some basic little changes to the source code to work the way I wanted.

Then, I discovered Amazon. I would research some of the best-selling products on amazon, I would put the products in a spreadsheet, make a note of places that sell them cheaper online and start listing them on my amazon store with a pretty decent markup (usually about 40 to 60% markup). When I make sell, I would order it from a cheaper store and have it shipped directly to the customer.

The more I list more items, the more my sales grow, and profits. My problem started on Dec 29th, 2021. My total sales for the 2 weeks were around $46k. The most I've ever made in two weeks (I usually averaged about 26k to 29k but I added more products for the holidays). 

Amazon put my account on hold, sighting some drop-shipping policy infringement but refused to provide more insight.

After submitting multiple reports and 60 days later, some funds were released but my selling privilege was reduced to only selling through FBA. This means, I only have to ship my products to their warehouse before they can be sold.

These changes made it very difficult for me since I never had any actual products in stock. I invested some funds into purchasing some products and sending them to their warehouse but it did not worth it and I ended up getting over 10k worth of returned products, of which most of them were damaged.

So, I started going to different thrift stores buying used computers, upgrading/updating them to the latest software version possible and selling them on online. 

I went back to ThemeForest and found a template, used web scrapping tools to generate thrift store locations, and used excel to filter the data to show me only the data I needed (store name, phone number, and location) then I made a website and an app that automatically shows me thrift store locations near me.

I made the app because I was planning to drive for uber while sourcing thrift store products for resell. And since that involves me going to various places, it would be easier for me to automatically see any thrift store within any location I found myself (usually stores within 2-mile radius) without having to search through google (which sometimes doesn't show me the stores within a reasonable radius).

Again, I've no coding skills but I made the app following the documentation, but unlike the website, the app involved a lot of technical challenges. I had to buy a recent MacBook as my old one couldn't handle the process involved as well as the Xcode.

But it was completely satisfying seeing the app alive on my phone after several challenges and I had to make certain configurations on the terminal to update/install some of the development tools required. Oh, I also became an apple developer even though I technically had no idea what I was doing half the time other than following process documentation!

After making the app, I got a windows laptop, installed Oracle VirtualBox and Centos 07, and started learning Linux. Although I'm not sure if I'd ever be able to remember all the command lines requires to do it as a job but I know I can easily do a lot of tasks in Linux following a process documentation.

I also worked on Visual studio but had to abandon it since I never had an android phone to check the testflight. It was much simpler for me than the apple Xcode.

The thrifting still brings some income sometimes but it's not a reliable business model compared to drop-shipping.

My problem is, I'm feeling so hopeless and useless at the moment. I have been trying to find a job but have been unable to get one since I don't have any real professional skill.

I don't have a degree since I dropped out of college without finishing up. Only cert I have is the Google Project Management Certificate and no real-world job experience outside of the oil field job.

If for any unlikely reason you found yourself in my situation at 38years old without any job experience, what job would you apply for and how would you tailor your resume since most recruiters (I believe) would frown on the mention of self-employed.

Any input would be greatly appreciated and thank you for reading this far."

I quit my last job impulsively. But I am looking and haven't mentioned it yet to a company. I need to urgently get hired. Problem is the pay here is below average for days, despite this being nights.

Standard 2-4% raises each year, typical 5 point rating system yada yada. My role is production focused, and I was promoted in august (~13.5% raise) after hitting my annual goal in May. I was able to maintain that pace through December and produced more than double the goal in addition to hitting or exceeding the other more minor targets, training a new employee, and taking on a community service leadership position.

I spoke to another colleague who performed similarly last year, and he received a ~7% raise and ~140% of the bonus target amount but had not been promoted during that year. 

I understand that I can’t expect 7% given the mid year promotion, but what do you think is a realistic expectation? The company overall did very well this year although last year was slightly better. Goals for next year are 70% higher than this year though, which, given market shifts, is unachievable. I’d have to work more than 70% more hours than I currently do to even try to hit it, so I really want to make sure I take care of myself this year while I have excellent performance to stand on. 


Additional context:

1. I started working there in February 2021 near the top of the last pay band. After the promotion I am square in the middle of my current band

2. I have 5.5 total years experience all in the same area, but my last company didn’t operate in a standard corporate mindset so I don’t think that experience is a good comparison. The market for my specific job is very hot

3. Somewhat above average COL area but not high like nyc or San Fran. I was told the company did not adjust pay bands last year for inflation but am unsure if they plan to do so now. Performance conversations happen in early March and I don’t get my rating until then. My boss has been giving me consistently good feedback throughout the year though

0,2023-01-02,Question Regarding Filling Out Job Applications- Is It Necessary to Disclose Your Contact at a Job and or Reason for Leaving?,u/DarkCaprious,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/101wgls/question_regarding_filling_out_job_applications/,careerguidance,"Hi! I am currently applying to some jobs, and this particular job application is asking me for my job contact (e.g. a supervisor, etc.). It is not a required field, but there isn't an area on the application where you can indicate that you do not want your supervisor to be contacted. Is it okay to omit this field? Other job applications have made this field optional, BUT they have also provided an option to indicate that you do not want your supervisor/manager to be contacted. 

I feel the obvious answer would be that it's okay to leave that section of the job application blank, but at the same time, a lot of job applications have a lot of optional questions, and to omit those optional questions would be to leave the application largely incomplete. I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it, or if the optional fields are truly a test of character. 

Any input regarding this would be much appreciated. Thanks so much!"

I (23M) recently got out of the military, before that I was a mechanic (in training) and a detailed for a while. Joined the military to change my life and we’ll sort of a family tradition. I loved it, and hated it at the same time, I felt like I did good there, became a (leader very quick, always preformed very well, made e5 fairly quick, but as todays military goes I couldn’t handle anymore of the political B.S. and now that I have a fiancé I figured it would be best to get out and focus on family, life, and a “real” career. So here’s where I need some advice, I took a job as a salesman, it’s hourly with quarterly incentives, in theory sounds great…. Hell even my mother in law works there….(that’s how I got the interview lol) that being said sitting behind a desk all day really isn’t what I thought it would be, seems like I’m having an extremely hard time just understanding the concept of what I do and how to do it “confidently”…. I find myself asking the same questions.. a lot, and really I’ve kinda conjured the thought that maybe I am just not made for the behind the desk life and more of a trade? So here’s where I need help I guess… should I stick with this job I have and give it a chance (lots of opportunities for GREAT money to be made after a while) or do I use my G.I. Bill and go for a trade like electrician or HVAC… I’m 23 and have NO idea what I want to do with my life and seems as if I’m never satisfied with ANYTHING I do…I really feel like I’ve failed in life by having these thoughts and I’m letting myself down too soon.. what are your guy’s opinions on this?

I’m experienced in both lab and office work as well as project management, I’m great at risk mitigation, and I have soft skills that a lot of my colleagues don’t (technical writing, clear communication, etc). I don’t necessarily need to stay in STEM, but I do need something that still pays well (like $100-150k range) or could get there within a few years since I’m the sole breadwinner. I would really, really like a truly remote job, and something that made a positive difference in the world.

GPT3, DALL-E and ChatGPT especially has been mindblowing personally, and I want in on the cutting edge stuff. To me, data science without domain knowledge is quite restrictive. I have a lot of knowledge in molecular biology and would love to combine my interest for both biology and data science (not bioinformatics though).

That being said, the qualitative nature of my degree has made it been tough getting a job in data science since graduating in July. In fact, the only jobs I seem to get are freelancing jobs, and I get rejected for every other job I apply to. Might be worth noting that I have two years of experience in python development at an academic startup, which nobody I apply to really seems to be caring about/taking into consideration. 

Im 26, and im conflicted. Do I work myself up by continuing to try for an entry level data science job anywhere I can get it, or should I rather take a PhD in data science and write a thesis centered around a biological question? Assuming I get a data science job tomorrow and continue for 3 years, would this experience be more valuable than the 3 years I spend doing a PhD? Working would expose me to the business life, but im assuming the learning curve would be steep initially and stagnate after a few months when I get a hang of that particular institutions way of working. PhD would expose me to a wide variety of things but would ultimately be quite spread out (?)

With a PhD I will be poor for 3 more years, ill be 29/30 then, can I take that? I dont know. I want to get out into the world and do cool stuff and maybe make someone's life easier but there seems to always be more receipts to get. When will I have the money to finally buy my own house?

1,2023-01-03,Is there any way I can use my resignation to help my colleagues?,u/Kat_qit,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/101z60p/is_there_any_way_i_can_use_my_resignation_to_help/,careerguidance,"TLDR; my job changed my job to work-from-home to in office and I have to resign, but I want to make a last ditch effort to change the boss’s mind.

I work as a translator in a very large law firm, in total we are a team of 6 translators. I joined the company almost two years ago, when the entire office was still working remote, but as the rest of the office began returning, we remained working remotely. We were asked if we wanted to return, and unanimously we chose to remain working from home. Last week HR asked us for our parking passes and told us they would be reassigning our work spaces to other people. We were all relieved since it meant that we would indeed stay at home. However one of the senior partners threw a fit (it was literally described that way by people who were there to witness it) and we are now being forced to return to the office.

I work two other jobs remotely, so an office setting is absolutely impossible for me. I informed my direct boss, told her I would stay all of January to make sure I handed in all pending work I had and to give them time to find a replacement for me, but that it was impossible for me to remain after that. She was understanding (she is a wonderful boss), and this Wednesday is my first day back in the office.

I’m very disappointed and honestly sad, since I love this job, but I need the other two jobs to survive, so my decision is made. However, when I return I still have to speak to my boss’s boss (the head of the area we are a part of) to formally notify him of my resignation, and I was wondering if there was something I could say or some way I could lead the conversation to maybe see if it could be beneficial to my coworkers and maybe make them reassess the decision to bring us back. I would appreciate any advice.

*Just to add, working remotely has not in any way affected our work, in fact, since the pandemic, translation services have become the second most profitable service the firm provides."

Last May, I interviewed for and was offered a project manager position.  I received a $15k bump from my past job.  Great, huh?!

The company restructured and I was retitled as a senior project coordinator.  The company restructured again and now I do research for reports though I have kept my sr project coordinator title and pay.  

I noticed my last place of employment has an opening that might suit me only I would be hired at the rate that I left (15k less than what I make now) and I would be an hourly employee instead of salary and start over with PTO and seniority, which is kinda where I’m at anyway (no seniority, little PTO). 

My new job really isn’t what I thought it would be.  It’s not terrible but it’s not what I was originally hired for.  

If you were in my shoes, would you consider going back to your old job?!  It’s lesser pay, but it’s stable and familiar.  I mean, at where I’m now they’ve already restructured twice and plan on doing so again.  They laid off 100 employees and a handful quit.  Those who quit haven’t been replaced."

I'm on £21k and my company doesn't offer salary ranges for better performance within a job spec, it's just a flat rate that everyone gets. Due to me transferring from a dedicated position to the regular team, I am on more than them, but I'm not sure how much. I'm assuming they get 20/20.5k.  

We've been told that pay will be reviewed in January and I'm expecting them to give us a raise. However, I'm strongly expecting that they will put it up to 22 or maybe 23 at a push.  

I really like working at this company and the hybrid working is great for my childcare arrangements, so I don't want to just jump ship. How do I have the conversation that I think 25k is a fair salary when they are unlikely to jump that high and will potentially see me as greedy?"

And that’s okay.,u/Working-Scientist202,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1023zod/whats_my_passion_honestly_not_working_and_thats/,careerguidance,"Small brain dump. I (F, late 20s) have a good career so far- I’m not making 6 figs, but I have excellent work life balance. After talking with people from a variety of ages and industries, I have realized that there is this pressure to “find your passion” (at least in America there is). I’m not saying you should be miserable at work, but I think this mentality sets an almost unattainably high bar for choosing a career path. I feel like if you manage to combine the thing you do for money with something you are passionate about, it can be great. But it’s not necessary to be happy or fulfilled, and it puts a lot of pressure on finding your passion within a career. I personally think telling young people to “find your passion” is an inspirational load of BS. I have a lot of passions in my life- none of which involve doing anything for monetary gain. I feel like it’s frowned upon to say that? I don’t often see people being praised for having a good work-life balance or exploring their passions outside of work. But I always see people being showered with praise for working like a dog and “grinding” to make a high salary. Glorifying the hustle culture is not for everyone and that’s okay. I’ve never really cared about making a ton money or being in a position where my job is my whole life. I know I’m still a young professional, but in my opinion, support your lifestyle and do something that interests you and engages your brain. But don’t stress yourself out if your job is just a job. For me, my life outside of work will always take priority. If any of this resonates with you, I hope you reach your goals while protecting your peace."

The work isn’t anything amazing but it’s tolerable, although I can see it getting old fast and the money isn’t great but enough to live off. 

My husband has his own business in construction which is busy and for the last few years has been at capacity. He works every hour of the day, on the tools throughout the day and then doing admin (quotes, invoices, emails, ordering equipment etc) at night until bed. I feel my experience has me well placed to take on the admin portion of the the work. The benefit of this would be sharing the mental load of the business, husband having better work life balance, the possibility of growing the business together, the mental challenge of working for myself rather than someone else, freedom to control my own time, and flexibility of when and how I work. 

The only thing really holding me back is the fear of the unknown; whether I will enjoy working for myself, whether we are headed for a recession and if I’m crazy to be thinking like this, whether I’ll add enough value to the business for it to be worth it.

So just for some background info, I'm graduating in June this year in **Europe** with a state diploma and the international baccalaureate IB diploma, I am also 16 years old. I will be graduating with the highest level of mathematics (this was for context).

I have already sent out a few applications to EU unis for bachelor degrees in international relations and poli sci, however I am getting cold feet. I am not sure that those degrees will land me a job nowadays, also considering that I have high grades and I can apply to a degree in econometrics for example. There is a catch though that stopped me from doing this in the beginning is that i do not have a 'talent' in mathematics, rather I study a lot and thus I am able to achieve decent results in this field.

Therefore my question is if I should pursue a degree in Poli Sci (which i will be most probably getting from the best EU unis that offer it as a subject) which is my passion, or should I go into a more practical field like econometrics despite my lack of 'math talent', in which i will be accepted to a decent uni but not the best.

I’ve been working in a distribution center (DC) for a Fortune 500 courier company for the last 6 years. I have been promoted several times over the years and have reached a point where I have no motivation/desire to continue moving up the chain of command. To be fair, I have learned a tremendous amount about the overall management of people within this setting, as well as several logistics systems related to this type of industry. My positions over the years have been directly related to operations and quality assurance. Despite the knowledge I have attained over the years this past year (2022) has proven to be really hard on my mental health and I believe I have reached a point of exhaustion/burn out. I have fallen into some major depression due to several work related issues (of which I refuse to turn a blind eye towards) that have ultimately led to bad decisions post work and overall a toxic work environment. I’m reaching out because I feel stuck at this point of my life and have been unsuccessful in finding employment within the same benefit parameters elsewhere. My annual income is paying the bills and my benefits are great but it has been incredibly difficult to translate my experience within a warehouse setting to a potential new job that might require office skills. I will mention that this is the job that I acquired while studying at university and is all I know within the professional world so it is a bit daunting picturing myself in any other setting. That being said, I do believe that I have a high growth potential and pride myself in my work ethic and believe I could prove to be an asset elsewhere. I do have a bachelors degree in sociology (played sports in college lol). I am well equipped with the basic skills and knowledge of Microsoft Office (Excel, PowerPoint, and Word) but have been out of practice for the last 2-3 years post graduation. If anyone has any advice for me moving forward or any recruitment links that they are willing to share please reach out. It would be much appreciated. Thank you in advanced"

I would like to advance my career into Business Analyst role so I post my resume in LinkedIn to find any job opportunity. 

After a lot of interviewing, I finally got 2 jobs offer that match my requirements. These two company provided me with very similar benefit with tiny difference in job descriptions. But I'm not sure which company should I choose, here some detail I could shared.

1. Frsit company is a vary well-known insurance company. This company want to hire me as an outsourcing with yearly contact where I will be working as 100% Business Analyst for them (no coding needed).

2. Second offer come from Cognizant in a Full-time job as RPA Business Analyst. I got this position because they looking for candidates who not only  have knowledge in BA role but also have a developer skill as well. So my job will might be responsible for both BA and Coding (unlike the first offer)

I honestly doesn't know much about Cognizant, I've read around in reddit but can't find any information that helpful. If anyone have any experience to share, I would be really grateful.

For now, my goal is to transfer career into Data Analyst (that why I think work as a BA role might give me more opportunities) and working for any international company not just in Thailand to improve my English. And hopefully one day I can become a project leader or project manager (I know it might sound unrelated but at least that is my plan).

Thank you for reading a very long thread. But I'm really need some advise. Please let me know what is everyone thought. Thank you."

I have a bachelor's and masters degree in education.  I loved a lot of aspects of teaching, but quit my job last June.  Teaching was always really stressful, and the combination of the pandemic, administration issues, and the effect of all of this on my students led me to realize that teaching (at least not in a US public school) was not going to be a sustainable path to a healthy life for me.

I am incredibly fortunate to be happily married to someone who makes good money, and around the time I made the decision to quit, he accepted a temporary assignment in Europe.  This makes it a lot easier for us to live on one income until the end of the assignment - likely another year.  So, I'm currently living in Europe, with no immediate need for paid employment, and plenty of time to build some new skills towards a new career.  

Guys, I don't know what to do.  So far, I have consumed (and paid for) a lot of mediocre career advice aimed at burned out teachers.  I've done some work towards a couple of careers recommended as good options for former teachers - Instructional Design and Project Management - but those fields are getting flooded by other former teachers reading all the same advice I am.  I would love some fresh perspective.

I know that I'm a smart person with a lot to offer, and I know that I have skills that can transfer to other industries.  I have very strong people and organizational skills.  I'm a strong communicator.  I tend to be very passionate about my work, and have always had a reputation for getting shit done.  I have a much deeper science and engineering understanding than your average elementary school teacher - but no specific science background that I can put on my resume.  I'm totally willing to think outside the box and do something totally different, and can even pay a reasonable amount for training.  I'm just not willing to pay for another college degree at this point.

So - If you had a year or so to retrain for a new career, what would you study?  What fields should I be looking into?  What fields are actually willing to hire folks with entry-level experience?  How can I take best advantage of this amazing opportunity?"

Last week, after Christmas, I went in on Tuesday. I started having such bad anxiety that I just couldn't go for the rest of the week.

I just told them I was sick with a stomach bug or the flu. But truth is, I just can not morally line up with their thoughts and actions.

Back story:
This company has taken way more than it has given.
In January, my husband was wanting to leave his current job and get into sales. We have a whole sales department in my company, so I asked my boss if he could bring him on while explicitly telling him, if not, I understand. 

I know a lot of companies don't like spouses to work together, so I understood. I figured I'd ask since it's a small family owned business and everyone sort of works with everyone.

Anyways, fast forward to ten months later.
They fire my husband.
And for honestly, literally the dumbest thing ever. They really had no other reason to fire him accept for the fact that he is Hispanic.
Everything they highlighted that he was doing, the entire sales team actively does, or has done. The only difference between him and the others, is he's a person of color.

Anyways, I go to work the next day and they sit me down and surprise surprise, I get a raise.
I'm not dumb though.
I know deep down that this is an, ""I'm sorry, please don't leave"" raise.

I'm grateful for it, but I also can't help but think about how I have a whole business degree and am two classes away from completing my second one and only make 46K a year after the raise.

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful. But I do believe I deserve more. They have manger Bob over here making 56K whole has zero education and then manager Jim making 60K, again with no education.
I get it, education isn't everything. Experience is. But hey, I have years of admin experience. I was basically acting as an executive assistant for the entire company but only held the job title ""Administrative Assistant I"". When I got my raise I was switched to ""Administrative Specialist"" 🙄.

Anyways, after they randomly fired my husband, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. Tried to move past them putting us in a predicament where we couldn't pay our bills.
I definitely don't make enough to fully support us on my own, which they know and to top it off, they knew that we had just spent our entire savings and then some on two emergency surgeries our cat had to have.

Anyways, I never moved passed all of that.
I tried, don't get me wrong, but then the harassment started.
Bob started being just utterly rude to me every chance he got.
Which I reported it to Jim who is my actual manager, who then did nothing about it because it kept happening.
So then I went to the top, (we'll call him Lucifer, because that's who he reminds me of) and again, nothing changed other than now Lucifer thinks it's okay to do the same on top of now assigning me inappropriate tasks that have nothing to do with my job that overlaps other people's job putting me in uncomfortable predicaments where people feel like I'm stepping on their toes.

Which isn't fun.

Then, to top it off, we found out that my husband's pay was dramatically lower than it should have been for the ten months he worked there. He was set to make 35K just in salary. I know for a fact he brought in at least 4K in commission.
The unemployment folks told us that for the entire 10 months that he worked there, he only made a total of 17K.
I may not be the best at math, but I'm pretty good. The math just ain't mathing up.

So I got curious. I looked at my last pay stub and saw that for this year, I only made 36K when I should have made closer to 42K.
Again, the math don't math up.

Anyways, I spent the last week looking for new jobs. I have two interviews this morning.
I have to go in late in order to attend both interviews.
I don't want to tell them because I know that they will harass the heck out of me because they don't want me to leave.
They will throw all sorts of stuff at me.
A huge raise, possibly a hybrid wfh until I feel comfortable to go back.

Which, would be great and all, but I just don't trust these people anymore.
I just can't and would rather just cut ties and call it a day.
What should I do?"

Being a pretty big brand, they have all the benefits, structure, pay is decent at $22/hr. I get along with all my coworkers most of the time, I get to be outside etc. Right now, this is my plan for retirement. 

However, here is the kicker. It’s becoming pretty mundane and too repetitive. M-F all I’ve been doing is work, gym, video games, eat, sleep, repeat. Granted, I do have seasonal depression or some sort of it around this time of year so that doesn’t help. But still. 

I considered the fire academy a few years back but for whatever reason or another, decided to hold off. My uncle is a FF and so is one of my best friends so there’s been influence around me. I also like the the idea behind being there for people to try to make their day better. Obviously a big reason I’m considering it again is to escape the M-F mundane schedule. Obviously I know I’d work some weekends, but I would also never work two days in a row. 

So, I’m kinda in limbo with it all. Like I said, on one hand, I’m comfortable and pretty happy with my current job. The more I reflect on it though, the more I just don’t know how I’m going to do M-F for the rest of my working career.

Would it be worth it to pursue this career with only an associate’s degree if I’m able to work on my skills on my own and build a good portfolio, or is the extra time and money needed for a bachelor’s degree worth the increased opportunities?

I then moved back home with my parents and took a smaller role closer to home, but have found myself unfulfilled in my job and career (in finance). I value travel in my life so much and am trying to save money now for a 3 month trip with my gf at the end of the year, and considering moving back to the role I left in Oct'21. I am also considering relocation to Australia when I have saved enough and planning to include this location in my travel plans to decide whether it is somewhere that I want to relocate to for work.
The old role is exact same position and likely not going to be any more money than my current role, but I view it as somewhere I enjoyed before so might enjoy it again now (without the pressure of trying to get promoted or chase money).
So, my point is, would I be better (1) trying somewhere completely new and different for these next few months, (2) go back to an old employer as I wonder if I made a mistake leaving in the first place, or (3) to stick out this role I don't really enjoy as it's only 9 more months to avoid coming across as too jumpy on my CV?

I am a pastor and recent father. I am currently taking care of my infant daughter full time, and that is likely to be my primary focus until she is school aged (1.5-2.5 years from now).

I have experience in program directing, team and committee leadership, volunteer management, public speaking, and critical research (humanities). 

I could easily pivot to non-profit work or teaching, but those tend to have the similar work/life boundary issues to church ministry. I think I need to acquire technical skills to have better options.

Important Questions to me (and likely others in similar situations):
What advantages do humanities majors bring to STEM fields?
What ""soft skills"" help someone to thrive in data analytics or programming?
What interests or personality traits are critical?
If you work in data analytics or programming, where do you find the most meaning in your work?

I have been lurking around and wanted to finally post after reaching a breaking point. I have been fairly lucky in my career and jobs, getting advancement after switching jobs - 1.2 years, 5 years, 1.5 years and now 1.6 years and reaching an upper management role at my current job. I was hired in directly into this role. The problem is that I don't connect with anyone here at this current place. I already felt this when I started 1.6 years ago but thought it was just new job barriers. Now I really know that I don't connect with anyone. My boss is fairly busy all day and we talk about job related topics only, same with everyone else. In my previous roles, I have always been able to establish close relationships with my coworkers and bosses. Now I am wondering if perhaps this current job is just not a good fit or it's because I am now in a senior role while I was not previously. I am also a fairly quiet person so that probably didn't help. Are all senior management roles so isolating? As a background, I also suffer from anxiety (family history) and I believe this situation has also amplified this anxiety so I am pretty miserable at work. For example, I start out each morning with this anxious feeling in my chest and think about drinking to calm myself (which I know is not healthy). Unfortunately, with the economy going the way it has been last year (I am in US), I believe it will be difficult to find another job with the same benefits and pay. I am also concerned that another senior role will lead to the same isolation and anxiety. Should I just suck it up and count myself lucky to have landed this role? I am just not sure how long I can sustain this. Thank you in advance for your advice!"

So, I'm 27 and based in the UK and am an engineer. I worked at Company A for about 7 years, and completer an apprenticeship with them where I gained my degree. After about 7 months of passing my apprenticeship, I left to go to Company B. Rationale being that I wasn't liking the ethos and that I felt that I wasn't being rewarded for the work I was doing (was doing work at a grade above my level and not even getting recognition).

In my exit interview, I said to my manager it would take me £60k and the next grade to stay. Naturally this was dismissed as it would have been a 20k/Yr payrise. So off I went to Company B, which has less commute time, and I do 3hrs less per week.

Company B have now introduced a 3 day requirement to work in the office. I'm not too keen on this as before it was up to the discretion of the engineer. Company A requires you to work in the office 2x per week. Company B has also been a bit slow, and I've been here for 7 months. The manager is great but I'm only on £41.5k here.

Anyway, I was speaking to an old friend at Company A, and he's said he could probably get me his old job (he's moved internally at Company A), for a promotion and ~£60k/Yr. I'm stuck now as this was the initial criteria I set out to my (then) manager. I'd be working under the same chief engineer, but not the same senior manager or line manager. I would also be working on a different, relevant technology.

So, right now I'm a bit stuck. What do you all think for career progression, would it be worth it? It'd be a £20k/Yr payrise for me, and we are doing an extension at the moment on our house, so money is tight.

I'm 27, making 58.6k gross (which people will think is a good median) in Canada. I have a career in building operations and have 3 years of schooling under my belt. Do I like my job? Not particularly. Am I good at it? Yes and no. Somedays feels like i'm an imposter posing for the job and not actually knowing what to do (which is not usually the case).

All in all, I feel lost because i'm not where I want to be or that the job I am doing is not one that I enjoy thoroughly and is more of a drag these days. The pay is ok, I'm loyal to the company. But it seems like if I want to enjoy fun and not try to live paycheck to paycheck, I would have to move away or get a significantly better paying job. And yet that costs money as well.

This feels like a late 20's crisis that im experiencing but I dont know. I'm not depressed or sad, im just mellow really.

Any examples or case studies I can read up on to see if this is a worthwhile endeavor?,u/throwaway_almost,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/102cq36/i_am_trying_to_redesign_a_flat_organization_into/,careerguidance,"I am hoping to find articles, papers, research etc that can help with an approach to career path design for large but flat organizations. 

Here’s what I want to explore - my organization is fairly flat with not so many jumps on the proverbial career ladder. We compensate our employees very well with all the benefits etc. people love the job and are not looking to leave or anything like that. Due to the flat organization there is less of a “progression” title wise or ladder wise. 

I was wondering if there are examples of companies that break up steps into multiple smaller steps without creating a bunch of new random titles. Eg: “junior role + level 1,2,3,4,5” then “senior role + 1,2,3,4,5” etc. 

Each level will Ofcourse have a salary increase, will have new KPIs, etc.

So in essence instead of promotions that happen every 5/6 years, I’d love to have promotions every 1/2 years.

Is there a name for this kind of organization? 

Thanks!"

First job was around 9 months, second job was 1 year and 3 months and current job I’ve been there for about 8 months. Each change has been a significant increase in both responsibility as well as pay. I went from about $50k, to around $65k and make $85k at my current job. These have all been remote jobs working for  an various agency’s. 

I came across another opportunity that would pay over $100k. I’m a firm believer of focusing on yourself over the company because they’ll do the same so I’m not worried about hurting feeling or anything and I’ll always leave on good terms/give a respectful notice. 

My main concern is am I doing this too often? I know people job hop a lot more nowadays but I wanted to get more insight. If the new employer offers me the job and doesn’t mind, what other scenarios should I be wary of? If future employers see that as an issue, could I just stay at the new place for a couple years to “break the cycle” essentially?"

I  want to boost my career options. I currently have a remote position  (mainly administrative) which I am honestly overqualified for but I live in a country with very high unemployment so it is what it is. This position is not that busy most of the time, so I want to use this opportunity to boost my employability. I have a background in psychology and business administration.

I  don't want to waste resources or time doing something that won't really make a difference. I'm looking at courses/certifications that are marketable, future-oriented and internationally recognized, and preferably valued in remote work.

I was thinking of something like agile project management, is it worth it? or any other options that anyone knows.

I'm not an IT person (i.e. don't know how to code etc) but provide generic IT support once in while.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

What should I do?,u/PandoraBox99,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/102dos9/nearly_2_months_in_my_first_job_after_graduation/,careerguidance,"I am a computer science graduate majoring in data science. While I would like to get a job relevant to my major, the reality in my country is that there are limited openings and most companies only want senior data scientist/analyst. So, I was approached by a recruiter for a java developer role while job hunting.

As I majored in data science, the primary language for me is Python despite also learning other languages for a few subjects along the way and java is one of them. I had my reserves accepting it as I was worried, I was not qualified but still accepted it regardless.

I received my first task early-mid December and completed it last week and today my code was reviewed. Mistakes like not including exceptions for file closing, variable names are not meaningful were brought up by my project manager. I understand it's unacceptable for these minor mistakes to happen but he treated it as if it's going to break the application and commented that the quality was low and ""2 days' work took 3 weeks to finish"" etc.

To be fair, I didn't meet their expectations to deliver in 2 weeks as I promised. I did not expect that it would be that difficult as it was my first time using the report generator software without any training and also understanding and modifying existing code written by the other team member. At the end of the 2 weeks, I had to request an extra 3 days to complete it. Not to justify my failure, but I requested more time as the client has postponed the requirement for the time being and it wasn't urgent.

My local manager was in the meeting too and heard all of that. She compared me to my coworkers and said they never requested an extension before and that they even worked during weekends/public holidays to catch up (does she expect us to have no life and learn during our days off or what, and I really do not see the point of her comparing me to others in front of my project manager who doesn't even manage my coworkers). I told her I did too and she wasn't convinced. All the while I thought she was a good manager as she had talked to me in private about having high expectations of me. Though now it seems like she is just playing politics and trying to look good in front of the PM based overseas. On a side note, she was even racist by stereotyping certain races to be lazy and told me personally on my first week that she hoped I outperform the other races so that she could hire more people of our race.

She later told me that I might be assigned to a new role (tester or something else) because of this poor performance. She agreed to give me another chance for my second task and if it doesn't meet expectations, I will be getting a role change.

I had a baby over the summer and thought I would take a few years to be a stay at home mom but I missed making my own money. I started applying for any job I could find that was related to education but not teaching. After doing this for a few months with no interviews, I bit the bullet and applied for a teaching job for an online school. Long story short, I’m sadly realizing that I was misled about the school culture and workload during the interview because they were desperate to fill the position. 

Anyways, I finally heard back from a non-profit organization that I used to volunteer for and they’re looking for an associate instructional designer. I applied for the position before I even applied to my current job. I check all of the boxes and based on the job description, I think it will be a much better fit for me. I had a phone interview and now I’m scheduled for a second interview. So my question is, do I mention that I just started a new job? I don’t want to give them any reason to believe that I’m flakey or something. If I don’t mention it and am offered the position, will it come up in a background check and raise red flags?

TLDR: should I mention that I just started a new job during my second job interview? What’s the best way to bring it up?"

Ihave a bachelor's degree in management and  communications.  I don't feel like it's really been applicable to any of the work that I have done. I have been working in customer service for about 10 years with a higher end fashion brand. I work in a higher level position in corporate resolutions right now focused on the brick and mortar stores.  I have worked with the ecommerce side as wekl and have some informal leadership experience as a trainer and floor supervisor.

 However I feel like I have hit a plateau with no way to move up further in this business bc they have bottle necked the official supervisor roles.

I feel like my experience is so generalized amd that is the issue. Unless Resolutions/escalations is considered a nich but I have not found many jobs around this. Is there any direction to go based off of that?

Would a project management certification or user experience certificate go well with my background?

 Would either of these help me find a better paying role?

If not what suggestions for certifications would anyone have based on my background? 

Someone recommended for me to pivot to HR... would that be a good direction in general? 

My goal is just to be able to find a higher paying position whatever that may be. But I am not sure what dorection makes sense that will build on the epxerience I have.

Not quite ready to take on a Masters degree rn which is why I am looking at a certificatio of some kind."

So heres some details. I've worked at my job full time for 4 years in the UK, and i did work experience there for a further 3 years prior whilst I was doing my degree. The boss told me he could only employ me full time once i finished my Bachelors Degree, so i worked hard and got it 4 and a half years ago, however, when i started, i was told my salary was to be £16,000 a year, working 9-5. I felt at the time this was insultingly low, but i had just left my prior job to join this one (BIG mistake to have not found out the salary beforehand), and i was 23 then so i wanted a steady income. 

Since I've worked there I've been promised raises, which only came in every April, when the minimum wage increased, as such i now earn £17,500 a year, just a little over minimum wage. And a couple months ago i found out i was being paid for working 35 hours a week, not 40, i dont get an official lunchbreak, i just get told to go get food, have it and then get back to work (which i knew about the lunch thing but at the time i didnt mind it as i enjoyed the job). Am I entitled to having the extra hour for every day repaid to me? 

Furthermore, I've been applying for chartership in my field, and failed twice, with little to no help in training from the company, particularly after explaining to them, that in regards to some of the competencies for the chartership, i have no experience doing with my current job, therefore i would never qualify for chartership no matter how many times i apply. And from previous discussions with my boss, he wont give me a significant pay rise unless i pass chartership, and had an undertone of 'if you fail again we'll have to rethink your position'. Since then I've been applying for jobs and I'm waiting to hear back from a recent interview, since its impossible to get any experience with those competencies.

At the moment I'm off work with a sinus infection, but if im in tomorrow I'm expecting to be laid off or fired as i havent passed the chartership. Is it better for me to hand in my notice first and quit myself? Is there a difference to being laid off or fired? Would I be able to receive severence pay or anything? Or any other advice is greatly appreciated."

I forced myself to get my life together in the last few years, start holding down jobs, consistently workout and finally do a 3 month coding course. I thought I was improving. Got a coding job from that and in 2022 I stopped working. Nothing motivates me and I hate remote work. Now I've lost the job, need a new one but I don't think I will ever be able to keep a job and care about it. I want to know how people manage to just have a job and do well at it. Thanks.

Hi. I am a jack of all trades sort of creative person who never finishes anything. I have a degree in Japanese, I'm a good writer but I don't finish things, I'm an okay artist etc. But generally I do not commit to anything, and start to avoid things as soon as I achieve any success in them. I learnt japanese on my own very well but when I started my degree I immediately stopped studying for example.

It took an extreme change in mindset in 2019 to get me to actually finish my degree, because I had been not engaging and handing in everything late. I put in some solid strategies that helped me and started going to the gym regularly. After that, 2020 messed me up but in 2021 I decided to take my adult professional life into my own hands and I quit my job (which I was about to get fired from), moved home and did a 3 months software engineering bootcamp. I did it because I had wanted to learn to code when I was a kid and I heard it made a lot of money. I've always been poor and I realized I needed money to improve my life.

I coded basically 12 hours a day Monday to Saturday and worked a job on Sunday. I was single focused and felt pretty alive and like I was finally focusing on useful stuff to move my life forward and I might end up with a respectable career and some money. I had an anger that drove me to be better and push forward. I also destroyed my health a bit but I bounced back in a month.

In February 2022 I started a software engineering job, in March I moved back to the city where my friends are. Felt like a success. My job gave me little work to do, no deadlines and I had no in person contact with my co-workers. I was also pretty comfortable and no longer angry. My mental health felt stable for once. I proceeded to do nothing for a year. Every day sitting in my house doing 1 hour of work and wiggling my keyboard. Feeling guilty so not actually enjoying other things except the gym which is probably the only productive thing I can do consistently.

At the start of this new year 2023, my contract is not going to be renewed at my company so I have to find a new job. I have to decide whether to renew my expensive apartment contract without knowing if I'll be able to afford it. If I can't I'd have to move home again to the middle of nowhere. And so there's some fire under my arse to study and get another job. But I don't see the point... 

I feel like it's not going to work. I have proved myself incapable time and time again of consistency. I either am very focused or I fail to even do the bare minimum. I don't seem to be able to just do what is required to not get fired. I have to feel a lot of pressure or a lot of passion. I can't imagine ever caring enough about any job to do it. No normal motivators seem to work on me. And the fact that remote work is the norm now is destroying me too because I don't even have the social environment to make me feel engaged. Every year since 2019 I felt like I was making improvements in preventing myself from sabotaging my life but I have managed to undo them in 2022. The only thing that's stuck is gym. I literally worked hard for a job and then threw it away as soon as I got it. Sometimes I think, what if I stopped trying to have a sensible career and starting doing some crazy creative passion project and it would probably be more successful just because I would be able to give a single ounce of care about it. I hate being told what to do and I think companies are evil and soul crushing. I cannot bring myself to care about a company doing well. I also used to love tech but I think it is destroying our lives these days and we need to stop innovating at the expense of the planet. But I think I can't even stay consistent on a career in something more fun. I think I'd just grow to hate it, or grow to hate myself from lack of consistency. Honestly the only thing that motivates me is thinking women might like me more if I'm successful, and a general fear of dying in irrelevance. I'm obsessed with self improvement but it doesn't stick.

How do you people just do jobs?
Does anyone else feel this way?
What do I do?"

One may use all his/her vacation as soon as they like but there is a new rule that if you use all your vacation you will have to pay back any used vacation that was not accrued at the time of resignation/termination.  For example, if quit and you used 4 weeks of vacation and you only accrued 2 weeks, my company will force you to pay back the 2 weeks of vacation by taking it from your last paycheck.  

My question is if I use all 4 weeks of vacation, collect my last paycheck then quit without a two weeks notice am I legally obligated to pay back the vacation I did not accrue?  Would they try to invoice me?  Could they take legal action against me or threaten my credit score?

They rolled this policy out without it requiring we sign anything so I’m wondering what legal ramifications if any I could face if I were to quit with no two week notice and I happened to go over on my accrued vacation as well?  

Thanks everyone!"

So I've been through job hell over the last 5 years. Based in UK (in North West). Been placed through redundancy processes twice and a hell of a lot going on outside of work to manage too. As a result, here's what my employment history for the last 5 years looks like and the reasons for why each one ended:

Job 1 - 1 year (fixed term contract finished)

Job 2 - 1 year (at risk of redundancy so I jumped before I was pushed, which I would have been)

Job 3 - 1 year (due to Covid, placed at risk of redundancy so I again jumped before I was pushed)

Job 4 - 6 months (fixed term contract)

Job 5 - 1 year (I left because they changed my location 
from 10 miles away to 40 miles away and the commute was unmanageable)

Job 6 - 4 months (it was completely a wrong fit and my child was very sick in hospital at the time so I left to do freelance)

Job 7 - 3 months (freelance)

Job 8 - 3 weeks (!) I left because my Job 7 freelance offered me a permanent position for 3x money, better location, better work life balance

Job 9 - 3 months and counting! Same as Job 7 freelance employer

For context before you think I'm crazy or incompetent or both, my job before these I had for 6 years.

So what's panicked me... My current job (#9) has just announced a restructure... And I'm completely panicking this means I'll be on the hunt for yet another job and figuring out how on earth I would be employed by anyone based on putting the above on my CV...

Any advice or thoughts welcome

Some thoughts and questions from me:

- I am thinking of not putting Job 8 down and merging Job 7+9 together which is fine in terms of timeline.
- Would it be better to just not show Job 6 at all? Feels easier to explain a gap than a very short one?
- Can an employer or recruiter request employment history e.g. from HMRC without explicit consent from me?

Any other considerations for not showing the 'full truth' on employment history?

Also - getting 2 positive references shouldn't be an issue (likely from job 5 and 9)

I'm a 2020 graduate in Mechanical Design and Production. And right now I've been in a process engineering job for 10 months. The job itself is incredibly boring and it requires leadership + social skills which I really lack. The job being boring and me not being able to do it well is depressing to me. My manager and my coworkers don't really expect much of me because I'm new and without much experience, but this expectation is making me even more depressed because I feel more like I'm useless. I've fantasized a lot about quitting while having suicidal thoughts because of the feeling that my life is going no where like this.

I've been determined for some time now even before I got this job that I want to be a data scientist, I'm an analytical person and I like to think a lot about problems and their solutions. From what I've studied so far Data Science seems like a perfect fit. Now, should I quit my job to pursue studying full time while looking for a simple transition at the start for a Data Analysis job? That will me my plan after I leave my job. A lot of people have advised me against this, most of all my parents, but they don't feel what I feel. Financially, I have saved quite some money that I won't need any for many months to come. And I'm also single and still live with my parents. Is leaving my job a good decision here?"

My name's Josh.

I got accepted into dental school but something in me wanted to defer the offer for a year. I did.

I didn't get into med school the same year but got into dental scho. I think I like the idea of being a doctor more than anything else. Not necessarily the actual being one.  I do feel this sense of duty to study everything to do with the human body, which is what held me back from doing dentistry.

Do you think I should pursue medicine because I feel that longing for it?

Or, do you think I should just settle with dentistry? It's good pay, it's very well rounded. You can prescribe.

Some people get caught up in medicine and the superficial high regard of it.

I don't know if it's for me. I do know that I'd be an excellent doctor, is the thing. Everyone has told me this, for my whole life.

After undergoing five days of training on the computer, I has my first day of on the floor training today. 

I had to wipe down tables, clean the bathrooms, take people’s orders and make some beverages.

I wish that hadn’t happened so close to the end of my shift, because I was in the car on the road and on the way home when I realized I forgot to give the customer his dough nut. I really hope that the customer asked one of the other crew members and that one of the other crew members gave him his dough nut. 

At the end of my shift, I had a two questions in mind. 

**Question #1**: What if I am in the middle of cleaning the bathroom when someone knocks on the door? What do I do?

**Question #2**: Based on my performance today, do my fellow crew members have any constructive criticism for me?  

I was thinking that, but I was not sure how to ask that question. If the crew member in question is in the middle of doing something, I do not want to disturb them.

Despite how specific the title was, I will probably need more information than just the location of things on the menu. The title was that specific, because I could not figure out another way to phrase the question."

For context, I graduated with a degree in architectural engineering. I’m very creative, love to build things. Since graduating I’ve been working for 3 years in construction project management. I love organizing and making a plan, but most importantly I really enjoy working with others, being a friendly face, making friends. As some know, I’m not finding a lot of that in construction. The stress of pinching for Pennies and the constant arguments and stress associated with unrealistic deadlines have burnt me out. When I try to research project management type rolls in other industries a lot of what I see is software/tech based, which I don’t have much experience or interest in. What other industries is their a need for an organized face that can get people on the same page to complete a goal? I would love to try something more creative but find it hard when I’m not an architect or a designer."

I'm not burned out/exhausted right now but, I will be if I stay here too much longer. I can stay for three more months before calling it quits.

I ignored plenty of red-flags during the interview stage - that's my fault and I completely recognize that. I don't want to make that mistake again. I want to be able to take my time with my next job hunt to find the best fit for me.

I don't think it would be a good idea to take interviews right now, because my job is currently very demanding. By the time I sign off - I am dead tired. But I am still open to doing so if that's really the best move.

I have some questions I'd like to get some ideas on:

* Would it make sense to stop contributing to my 401k/HSA in order to build up a larger cash cushion? Once I resume working I would continue my normal investment behaviors. My cash cushion would be able to last me \~12 months.
* Should I leave the experience off my resume due to short tenure?
* Should I air my grievances to my manager in hopes of something changing for the better?
* Any other tips/guidance?

I already have two offers and have a couple other interviews lined up with companies that are under the impression that I have a 3.4. For reference, when I send transcripts I just combined both unofficial transcripts into one pdf and theres no real way to see the overall between both colleges, just the two separate overalls.

With this many of us have to do jobs that don't fall under our job descriptions.

Right before the holidays, our Executive Admin/Inside Sales person gave notice. After listening to her reasoning and thinking about the role, our boss (CEO) has decided to split this position into two separate roles - one focusing on inside sales/customer service and the other being more executive admin/office manager. 

I have recently written the job descriptions for them and while the Inside Sales position does lend towards a full time role, my feeling with the Executive Admin position is that it's closer to a 20-30 hour position (the executive admin would fill in the remainder of the time helping with inside sales/customer service). 

My current marketing role is around 20 hours and I spend the remainder of my time assisting with customer service. I would like to pitch the idea to my boss of changing my role to include marketing as well as the executive admin role. Many of the tasks under the executive admin (HR, accounting, general office management) role I really enjoy doing (and have been helping do) however I do not want to give up my marketing position.

Hello everyone and Happy New Year!

I am an international student pursuing Computer Science. I was under the vague that CS is explicitly for programming, so I chose it because programming and technology is my passion but I had a downside which I hate math, turns out that CS is more about mathematics than actual programming, which made my life miserable.

Over the course of two semesters, I always had these thoughts that CS isn't for me as I failed to get the required marks to pass the courses for my specific program every time, but I didn't want to quit, so I had taken a break from CS courses, and took electives. But now the third term is over, I fear taking CS courses again. Because at this point, I am just repeating courses, and as an International student in Canada, it costs a lot more than a Canadian student.

I got depressed because it turned out my dream was a lie and thinking of withdrawing but the idea of returning home with nothing scares me. I am looking for options, maybe applying for Full Stack Developer in a college, but the nearest entry term is Fall 2024, I was hoping for a nearer date but I can't find any. I thought of taking the Udemy course but still don't know If that helps me find a job and return to CS program at some point. I don't know if what I am asking for is manageable, but at this point, I'll take anything but quit."

March 2023 marks 2 years since I relocated, and therefore the end of my commitment financially to the company (if I left before 2 years after relocating I’d owe them that money back). 

I’m ready to move on and test the job market and gain some more diverse experience elsewhere. If I’m free of financial repercussions to start a new role 4/1/2023, when might be a good time to start interviewing and chasing offers? I get a lot of LinkedIn traffic and interview requests, just don’t want to get an offer and tell them I can’t start for 4-6 weeks (or is that normal??)

I'm 27 and I'm currently based in the New York area. I have worked 2.7 years in Public Accounting and then switched to a Financial Firm for 9 months and just ended up at my current position at a different Financial Firm with a title upgrade that it'll be 6 months there now. 

I applied for a Consulting position that I was going for; before I ended up at my current job and unfortunately earlier in the year hiring was paused.

They have just reached back out to me asking if I wanted to interview and I'm a bit conflicted. I left my job at the First Financial Firm because it wasn't challenging enough. This current job I have is pretty good, I have no complaints on it so far but unfortunately I have this nagging feeling like I should take the interview and see what happens.

I think moving 3 jobs in the past 2 years might be a bit detriment to my career and I'm really hesitate to do it. I wanted the consulting position for a while and tried to get into when I was in Public Accounting and timing just never worked out. 

How bad would it be to switch again? I would be trying to stay there for the indefinite future."

1,2023-01-03,No challenge and no growth--I feel like an imposter. Yet I'm the highest performer with the least responsibility--and now I have to walk a minefield with a coworker. Is this career at this company even something I can navigate/salvage?,u/Strong_Hat7508,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/102nh7l/no_challenge_and_no_growthi_feel_like_an_imposter/,careerguidance,"I will try to summarise a long story, just looking for insight or similar war stories I suppose--I promise there is a specific question.

I had a ton of responsibility before COVID, plus layers of direct reports. I loved coaching my team. During COVID we had MASSIVE layoffs and I lost 50% of my staff, then later teams split during a restructure and I went from almost 40 people to 3. (New boss didn't know what all we did and admitted later I wasn't vouched for properly).

I'm back up to 5 (five...) employees now. But the area I'm over now was my easiest segment with the least work needed and least developing of employees. **Now I work about 5 hours a week--everything is so smooth that I could get away without being there--thankfully I WFH.** My team doesn't run into conflicts or things like that which allow me to develop them and therefore develop myself. **Because my reputation and my team is so good, I also don't hear from leaders in the company because nothing is broken**.

I am constantly asking my boss for work, more responsibility, etc and am candid with my need for growth/challenge. **I was told I'm the highest performer on the team, even higher than another level of management, in a sub-group of 75. But I have the least responsibility.**

The only person who really knew my situation was one of my old employees/friends who I completely trusted and vice versa. My main outlet for my level of performance was collaborating with her on her area, which is very similar to mine, because she lacked the tenure/skillset to manage and develop her area properly. Essentially I was still developing part of my old team and employee/developing cross-processes, etc. She even said I should still be her boss/at a higher level--it was all welcome and a good working relationship.

However, a couple months ago, this person reported me to HR off false claims. **I was completely cleared formally and even casually after the investigation by both my boss and HR**. Simply put it was bizarre to everyone. Regardless, the professional side must continue, except the coworker won't work with me at all. She is aggressive, and now I have to copy my boss on any emails to her to ensure she stays in line. But many times she will still not respond, respond with only partial information, will refuse to be on a call with me, or otherwise affect my work. **I am constantly stressed by this minefield that I didn't cause and don't want to step in again due to her unprofessionalism**.

Company is not really posting promotions or other roles due to economic concerns, so I just don't know what to do. I am scared to find something else and be low man on the totem pole. Is there anything I can salvage in my career? I have been here almost 12 years, love the company, hate my role though. I support a large family and I don't want to let this situation + this coworker make me leave and start all over on vacation insurance, etc., but I don't know what to do. Am I missing something or is there no point in staying? How can one pivot, or communicate with my boss the dire issues, etc.?"

I’ve been working in a distribution center (DC) for a Fortune 500 courier company for the last 6 years. I have been promoted several times over the years and have reached a point where I have no motivation/desire to continue moving up the chain of command. To be fair, I have learned a tremendous amount about the overall management of people within this setting, as well as several logistics systems related to this type of industry. My positions over the years have been directly related to operations and quality assurance. Despite the knowledge I have attained over the years this past year (2022) has proven to be really hard on my mental health and I believe I have reached a point of exhaustion/burn out. I have fallen into some major depression due to several work related issues (of which I refuse to turn a blind eye towards) that have ultimately led to bad decisions post work and overall a toxic work environment. I’m reaching out because I feel stuck at this point of my life and have been unsuccessful in finding employment within the same benefit parameters elsewhere. My annual income is paying the bills and my benefits are great but it has been incredibly difficult to translate my experience within a warehouse setting to a potential new job that might require office skills. I will mention that this is the job that I acquired while studying at university and is all I know within the professional world so it is a bit daunting picturing myself in any other setting. That being said, I do believe that I have a high growth potential and pride myself in my work ethic. I do have a bachelors degree in sociology (played sports in college lol). I am well equipped with the basic skills and knowledge of Microsoft Office (Excel, PowerPoint, and Word) but have been out of practice for the last 2-3 years post graduation. If anyone has any advice for me moving forward or any recruitment links that they are willing to share please reach out. It would be much appreciated. Thank you in advanced."

I was furloughed back in 2020 and then brought back in my old role and a newly created role, and department, that was specifically designed for me and a coworker. Last January I transitioned into an Applications Admin role in the IT department and slowly transitioned out of my two older roles (back filled my replacements while learning the new role).

&amp;#x200B;

I've taken it upon myself over the 2.5 years since furlough to really lean in to VBA and more recently Python to automate Excel processes.  I'm big on looking for more efficient ways to do my job programmatically. The automated processes I've created save me and my coworkers hours of manual work. I have also recently started learning SQL and have burned through a few learning sites already (SQL-practice and W3) . I would like to learn more and get more hands on but the opportunity to write SQL at my current company doesn't seem to really be available. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've really enjoyed automating these processes and would like to leverage what I know to the benefit of other departments across the company. Is there a job title for process automation and what title would that be? If not, what do I need to learn to make a leap to another title (Software Engineer or Data Analyst)?

During this interim time before he was promoted, I had to report him to HR for unprofessional behavior towards me during a call (speaking over me, cutting me off, mocking me). I told our VP (his manager) that I did not feel safe being alone on calls with him (before he was promoted) and I expressed my concerns that he would be retaliatory based on what I know about his character and what my coworkers told me who had him as their manager before (keeping them off projects, yelling at them, etc). Of course he was assigned as my new manager anyway... Three other team members left shortly afterwards citing to HR that they could not work for him as our new team leader. He plays favorites and heavily relies on his friends who report to him because he has no idea what is going on and is unqualified for the role. Red flags much?

I have also recently found out that he has been keeping me off important collaborative meetings (the organizer shared that he said my input wasn't needed). He even stupidly wrote that I have been left off meetings in my professional evaluation. I told our VP again that I cannot have someone fucking around with my career and I am sure my new manager got chewed out for this because now 9 months later he suddenly has an interest in what I do.

I am a very independent worker, always do a good job, and our CEO once told me ""you know you never have to worry about your job"". I have been with the company for almost 5 years and they have recognized my hard work and identified me as crucial talent to retain by substantially investing in my professional development.

I have been able to get away with not meeting with him directly by having other parties present on our calls for project-related discussions. I will gain nothing by having these 1:1s with my manager because he has no guidance to offer. In fact, I believe these meetings will be a risk/liability for my career since I have seen he will try to take credit for work that I do alone or undermine me.

In this role I could probably get all my series and eventually work to become chartered.

Northern Midwest, USA

Education: As an adult learner, I have earned a BS Business Management, emphasis hospitality; MA Organizational Leadership

Certifications: Certified Dietary Manager, Certified Food Protection Professional (CDM, CFPP); Certified Food Protection Manager (CFPM); Certified QuickBooks Pro Advisor

Work Background: The majority of my positions have been related to food in some way, e.g. deli supervisor, line cook, restaurant/bar management positions (even a family grocery store I learned to manage as a minor), non-commercial food service manager. Other positions were fairly entry-level accounting positions, e.g. A/P clerk, receivables coordinator, etc. held during grad school. Current position (for past five years) is as food service director for a large non-profit residential drug &amp; alcohol treatment organization. I directly oversee two full-service kitchens with food served at 7 locations around my city. I provide direct support and training for the food service managers at two of the four facilities in other cities fairly regularly. I also have a small side hustle as a QuickBooks Pro Advisor, with one bookkeeping client.

I am a fantastic manager of things/administration, and a fairly good leader of people (getting better each year) despite being more of an introvert. I generally attain a position, improve it significantly, get bored and leave.

Personal Life: At the moment, I am primary parent to two young kids. I do not plan on leaving my current position until they both enter school since I have a very flexible position which allows me a great work/life balance. Plus, I'm still finding things to improve upon in my current role. 

 **Where do I go from here?** There's not too many corporate director of food service roles, and of those, a portion require formal culinary training, which I do not have. I can shoot higher, like a VP role, but those are even fewer and harder to break into without a stepping stone position that has much higher budget management parameters, and for-profit skills for muscles I haven't had to flex about in seven years.

I'd like to plan my move out now so I have a few years to learn requisite things for the transition. I'd like to move out of food completely as I have developed some food allergies as an adult. But, I'd be willing to stay in the industry if it were in a more executive or administrative leadership capacity. Otherwise, I'm wondering if Operations or Project Management would be a possible career transition? Any other ideas?"

This would be to attempt shifting my career toward product management in the tech/gaming industry. 

Pros: Challenge myself to pursue my dream; leave a job I greatly dislike; gain the freedom and opportunity to take on contract work I'm familiar with and pays well before the bootcamp begins 

Cons: Will be without consistent income for 10 weeks; not guaranteed a job afterward; limited experience with coding beyond fundamental HTML and Python; gap in resume could become an issue 

Does anyone have experience with coding bootcamps, and can speak to their effectiveness? I'm sure mileage varies but would love to hear from anyone who either successfully or unsuccessfully tried to radically change their career in this way."

I(24F) applied and interviewed for a “Production Assistant” position on a TV show. The interview was on 12/16, and the producer told me they would have a decision the following week (week of 12/19). I followed up a few days ago and the recruiter said that the team would likely reach a decision next week- so the week of 1/9. They’re slow😂

Anywho, I saw that a “Production Secretary” job was recently posted on the company’s website. It’s very similar, just slightly more administrative (but still entry-level and relevant to my background experience and interests). It’s in the same department- just on a different TV show. I’m interested in sending in my resume/cover letter for that job before it gets taken off their website. 

Would that look bad on my end? To apply to the production secretary position even though I’m still waiting to hear back about the production assistant position? And if I do apply, what should I say to the recruiter? Does anyone have advice? Input? Thank you in advance :)"

I hope you are having a great start to the year! I just really wanted some advice as I have been in two minds about this. 

I am based in the UK and I am a 24 year old law graduate. I graduated in the middle of the pandemic and got desperate so I fell into tech sales at 22 years old. After two years, the job is honestly pretty good: WFH, friendly culture, amazing manager and a £60k salary. The only problem is, I don't really like the job and my motivation is completely gone.

I really want to pursue a career in law again as it was something I worked so hard towards. This would mean I would start at the bottom of the ladder again. I would have to become a paralegal and take a big paycut. I have started looking but have not yet been successful in getting an offer.

I am fortunate that I have some savings and still live with my parents. However, I am just scared with how unpredictable the job market is especially with how the economy is looking to be headed towards in 2023. I am worried that I may be making a huge mistake throwing this job away to take a gamble on another career but it just feels like the correct decision for the long term. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation as me? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!"

Now that I am in the role for a couple of months I am starting to see some serious challenges.

1. The product isn't ready - The product we are developing is a very good concept but still at least several months before it is ready for market. When I was interviewing I was led to believe it was ready. 
2. Late to Market - The company spent several years trying to perfect the product while competitors rushed to market with a less ideal but suitable solution. Now the vast majority of the target customer base has already tested and selected a solution to move forward on.  
3. Out of Touch Expectations - Now that I am in the role management is frequently telling me their expectations. They spent several million dollars developing this product and I am sure they have a tremendous amount of pressure to start showing ROI. I am very concerned that their expectations for 2023 and anything even remotely possible are so vastly different that no matter what happens I will be considered a major failure. 

On a daily basis I am enjoying what I am doing. I am focused on high level strategic decisions and how we develop a market but I am seriously concerned about my job security in 12 months. "

Need some advice. I currently have a sales job, had it for over 14 years(manager and seller), and to be honest, I'm very tired of the sales quota, and the never ending threats about meeting numbers.

I been wanting to get into cyber security within my company. I have a friend who is pretty high up within the cyber security department, and can influence a lot when it comes to pick candidates.

However she wants me to get 2 certificates so she can at least back me up when i apply. The certificates are the CISA and CISSP(I'm aware even if i pass the tests, I'm will not be certify until i have the experience required). She said with those 2, she can push my application, and justify the reason of hiring me. The job will be an entry level, but i will make about the same i make now.

Here my problem, and afraid to pursue what she advise me to do:

1. i have no experience, just common knowledge
2. i have 1 year left to get my AA, so i have no college degree either

My question, are the certificates mentioned above achievable for someone who has no experience. Is it even worth it to go through this tough route?( i know ill be studying none stop for the next 4-6 months) or do you recommend i start with something different to enter this career?"

I started this job about ten months ago and essentially worked that whole time period, only taking a few days off here or there. By the time my vacation came around, I was seriously burnt out. Every task I had to do felt like a weight. I was stressed a lot and anxious. Often working 10-hour days (I know this isn't a lot to some, but it's more than I had discussed when I got hired), sometimes without taking lunch because I just had so much to do. I then had about two weeks off (including weekends and recent holidays). However, this didn't do anything for me, as I'm essentially back to feeling dread over every task and like a lead block in bed in the morning. I've only received complimentary feedback from my manager, but he does not know how I've been feeling.

My knee-jerk reaction is to start job hunting, but I haven't even been here a year and I was only at my last job for a year and nine months. I also think there are things I can try to do personally to help change things:

- Sleep more - I haven't been sleeping nearly enough and maybe this would help me relax and take things more easily during the day

- Set hard working hours - No more working late

- It's just a job - things may go wrong, but I shouldn't be stressed about it

- Exercise - I was in this routine, but fell out of it. I should get back into it.

Sleep and exercise are easy enough to work on, but I take it very personally when something goes wrong and I could've stopped it. I always feel on edge about making a mistake. I don't really have any reason to fear this right now, but just the thought that I could be fired and suddenly have no income is almost paralyzing.

Does anyone have advice for this? A lot of my stress comes from the fact that I work in a client-facing role, and clients always think that their problems are going straight to the top of my radar. I can only work as fast as I can to try and solve problems, but it's stressful when there is a never-ending stream of external requests coming in."

I’ve been just over a year out of college, and have been in my current role for almost a year and a half (including time in the “same” role as an intern). Comp is 66k yearly with, 10 holidays (federal), 13 days total PTO (sick + vacation), 5% of total comp matched for 401k at 1:1 rate. 

I have degrees in Economics/Business Analytics and Political Science (both bachelors degrees), plus 3 years of experience in the government contracting field. 

At this point, I feel like I’m being slightly underpaid for what I do (proposal pricing started and supply chain strategy work + some contract negotiations), but I also feel incredibly underutilized/underemployed. There’s not a single time in the last year that I feel like I’ve been mentally challenged. I feel like I could teach my exact job to a high school student, and a good portion of the people in my role are far older than I am. 

Do I hang around this Fortune 500, continue to gain experience and connections, and parlay into a more senior role (hopefully) soon that presents a more interesting and stimulating set of challenges, or seek employment elsewhere. I’m a bit afraid of the “grass is greener” dive, but the grass I’m standing in right now is slowly dying in the poison of stagnation and pure boredom."

People of Reddit,

I hope you're all doing well. I am a 21-year-old graduate (June 2022) Computer Science engineer from India who wants to become a game developer. I recently got a game developer internship in a startup with a small stipend. I do plan to go for a Master's degree in '24, perhaps in some course that will help me a more efficient developer.

The company I'm working at does not seem to have much credibility, since I'm unable to find any information about it online. I eventually want to open an Indie game studio of my own in India.

So I have a few questions:

1. How do you suggest I approach this situation?
2. What are some good credible STEM courses I can do for my Masters's to help me reach my ambition?
3. Do you think I should continue looking for other jobs and internships? (since this company does not seem very credible)
4. What, in your opinion, are some courses I can do in order to get a more nuanced understanding of the world of game design and development?
5. Do you think I should learn about broader topics in general, even if I plan to be a game developer eventually? If so, what are these other skills I can develop?
6. If you do work in the video game industry, what are the steps you took to ensure that you secured a good career in this domain?

Any help regarding this situation would be appreciated. Thanks so much."

Not enough workload

It's a rather small spectrum of jobs i have to ( i basicly just type in data most of the time) do and i just want to learn more, especially since i do not have much expirience yet!

Work times are really not ideal, i work from 6:45-15:30,for me this means i have to get up at 4:30 latest and don't get home before 16:30.. i still have my dog to care for and when i'm done with all duties for a day it's at least 18:00.
I'd much rather start working from 7:00-9:00

Bad payment (i'm a time employee)

No chance of getting promoted since i'm only a replacement for a women who had a child and would stay for 2 years at most.

So i'm wondering what i could say at a job interview without coming off as bad? Any suggestions?"

The current job is well paying, pretty much almost fully remote, flexible hours and decent benefits. The boss is a good guy and understanding. But I am bored and demotivated to do anything in my job beyond words, and I really do not want to go into it here in detail as it just gets me depressed talking about it, but I just don't see myself working in this role for a significant amount of time and keeping my sanity together. And I have these thoughts of changing careers or somehow escaping the current situation for years now, every year stronger, to a point where I need to avoid work when I am at my lowest through holidays, sick days or whatever.

I would like to restart my career completely and get into Data Engineering. Data has always been an interest to me, ever since I graduated my Mathematics degree. I have some knowledge in SQL, Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, C+ (all at basic level) that I have learned either through my own interest or through some courses that I financed myself. But I have no practical experience in this as the job profile I am in has no space to incorporate these to the work I do.

The real problem for me that is withholding me from doing anything is financials and my current commitments. We have recently taken out a mortgage, and because of said mortgage I have missed out on the opportunity to be laid off in the existing comparty as part of redundancies with half years redundancy pay (they offered me to go to another department for the same role, which if I would have declined would had me laid off with pay). The banks here need continuous employment for at least half a year at the time of getting a mortgage to be eligible for it. This would have covered for me to have enough time to get into an internship and probably to some junior role to soften the blow.

So as it stands, the question here is if it is worth to quit my comfortable, well paying job (the only real downside without my own issues with it is that the role in the current company will likely go extinct in the next few years) reduce my current income by 75% to find some internship in Data Engineering for a few months, which would then give me some tangable experience to show for a Junior role in the field, which would then probably put me up to a 50% reduction in pay for at least a year. After that, it would likely still be lower than my existing pay for another year, although much closer, with everything after that time period being of higher pay, or at the very least equal.We have enough savings to last us the transition, we would likely even survive the junior period with what we have and my fiance's income until my salary picks up again, but it would mean that we would likely have to put on hold planning our wedding, as well as doing anything with the garden outside (16 ares, currently just a field of grass) or any other larger investments on the property. There is also the risk of me not doing well in the transition, or not liking it even, as I guess you never truly know until you try it. I am also getting somewhat old now, I suppose.

Maybe I should just suck it up, see that I am privileged to work in a job with decent conditions, and just stick with it? Or at least for as long as I can."

NYU student here. The pandemic really hindered my participation in clubs. 3 semesters to go, and I only have membership in one club, with no leadership experience (you have to apply for leadership, and it’s really competitive). I only did two internships, one of which I bought as part of a summer camp. I also don’t have much activities to list from high school other than the fact that my SAT and high school GPA was really good. My college GPA actually isn’t that good. 

Everyone else’s resume had accomplishments and leadership positions that stretches out 2 pages long. It’s as if 90% to 100% of the 50,000 undergrads at my school had a club leadership position, got a massive trophy in high school, or have a 4 out of 4 in college or something. 99% of people at my school get a job within six months of graduating, and I seem to be on track to be among that 1%. Literally no company would let me intern with them. One company I applied to rejected me within hours. Just straight up received my resume and tossed it in the trash without asking. 

All other attempts to thicken my resume have failed. I write articles on Seeking Alpha, only to have all of them rejected. I don’t know if you could even list class projects (I had quite a few of them from my CS classes last two semesters). And with just three semesters left applying for club leadership anywhere isn’t really a valid option anymore. Somehow my studies are really hard so I don’t really have much time for hackathons or going to the career center or significantly more clubs and whatever things people tell me. Not even cold-messaging on LinkedIn works. People look at my resume and they just don’t call back.

I just don’t know what to do. It’s like I’m in a whole another lane. It’s like everyone is going down a hill and I’m the only one who feels like the worse than going up a hill. I’m the only one who’s having problem finding internships when I look at my connections from LinkedIn, mostly from high school. No one else has these problems."

Looking for job opportunities in countries nearby (not as far as the US). My first preference is Dubai, however as far as Australia is okay.

At my current job, I earn well (20L CTC) but not good enough to save for my parents' retirement and pay off the loans. The reason for limiting myself to these countries is because my parents are already not okay with me going so far away and I do not want the huge time difference in the countries like the US and UK to mess that up further.  
I just need to know the process as I do not know anyone who went abroad for a job rather than higher studies. Where do I apply, what to prepare myself for and are there any exams that would help my case? Please do give any relevant advice you may have."

2022 - 2023 - commercial management trainee in construction

Hey Folks,

I’m 25, currently in a business strategy unit for a start up. 

I started out as a customer support agent, transitioned to sales operations and later moved to my current company in strategy. 

For most of my career I’ve been under the impression that I need to have an MBA to be in a strategy job (I’m an under graduate).

Now that I’ve managed to get into a strategy job (without the need of an MBA), I’m learning quite a lot at work. However, there are days when I feel a little stuck or unsure how to tackle problems or come up with solutions. I try and start somewhere to get things going and build from there, but there are times where I feel that I should be able to figure things out instead of feeling stuck in most scenarios. At other times, I consider that I should be an MBA graduate in order to be more better at handling the challenges of strategy jobs or other roles similar to it (like program/project management &amp; product management).

How do I get better at dealing with this state of mind? Or do I need to scale myself up education-wise?


[EDIT]

I would also like to add that, I am a Bachelor’s in commerce undergrad and not from an engineering background. The company I currently work in is a tech startup for finance."

I’m currently a college student. I’m in my 2nd year, but I feel lost on my career path once again. I have most of my basics done, but I’m questioning if I made the right choice to switch my major. I have always had a desire to help and make a difference in someone’s life, but I never knew how to go about it. I started out in Nursing since I’ve always loved science, but after taking my first Anatomy and Physiology class I realized that it’s very hard (obviously). I thought that maybe I should go another route and it being hard means nursing isn’t for me so I chose Social work. They are both different careers so it’s hard to compare the two, but I don’t know if I want to truly do social work or if it was just my fail safe. I would love to hear any advice on what you guys think I should do as well as hear stories and perspectives about the careers. Moneys not everything in the world, but I do know most social workers work multiple jobs to make a decent amount of money and that’s not the life I want to live to make money. Do the pros out way the cons?

1) Maintain and support two systems, on top of any project work I’m assigned. If a ticket needs escalation, I follow it through until completion by the vendor. 

2) Act as the primary QA resource and generate test plan/test cases for changes &amp; deployments for managed systems or project deliverable. 

3) I’m a certified Salesforce Admin, recently got the cert and part of a Salesforce professional development team

4) Lead mentoring/professional development group that involves planning, presenting and encouraging continuous participation on a monthly basis from the members. 

5) System configuration, SME on one of the systems I manage and also considered the system admin for that managed system 

6) Data modeling, mapping and validations using power query for manually extracted tables

7) I provide knowledge transfer and training with team members higher up on the systems I’m the admin/SME

8) Manage, assign and organize Jira items and confluence pages under each project

I went through the whole interview process which included the company flying me halfway across the country to their office for a final interview. Everything went very well, and they ended up offering me the position at the end of September 2022. I struggled with my decision, as it seemed like a really great job that would allow me to grow professionally much more than I can see myself growing in my current position. However, I respectfully declined the offer for a variety of reasons, the main one being that they only offered me a slight increase in pay for a job that would require me to move to an area with a much higher cost of living, even after trying to negotiate the salary higher. I was also recovering from a broken arm at the time, and moving 1000+ miles away seemed like a major difficulty (I am healed now). Another reason was that I had been working on an exciting project at my current job, but the project has since stalled due to reasons beyond my control, and I'm not too confident in its trajectory anymore.

Fast forward to today, I just saw that the same position is now open again with the company at the same office location. I have somewhat strongly regretted not taking the position originally, as it was a great opportunity, salary notwithstanding. The company and the people also had really good vibes and I could see myself spending a good amount of time with the company. I am tempted to reach out to HR and see if they would be interested in considering me again. However, I'm not sure if this would reflect poorly on me considering I declined an offer for the same position only about 3 months ago. I fear it may make me look indecisive or unprofessional, but I really don't know, as I've never found myself in a position where I regret declining a job offer only for the same job to be reposted a few months later.

I felt like a glorified proofreader and secretary writing personal emails for the sales team, not a content marketing person.

I enjoyed working most for nonprofits whether I did research, developed content, and even mentored high school students, helping them focus and improve study habits so they could get to college. Seeing their progress made me happy, even though the pay was low and hours crazy.  Some folks suggested I do UX design or coding, but I feel they are too saturated for entry-level level positions.

A host of factors—including my own personal shortcomings—led to me not being my professional best.

None of it was too dramatic—some heated Slack exchanges with my bosses,  some unprofessional behavior towards the people I managed, such as showing up late for meetings,rescheduling one-on-ones because was I not budgeting my time well, turning in unpolished work, and so on.

I'm starting to look for work again and I feel a lot of regret for how I acted and how it affected the people around me.

I'm tempted to reach out to some of them via email to apologize, but I'm worried:

1. It'll look I'm only doing it because I want a good reference
2. It'll look like I've joined a 12-step program like AA and am making amends. (Nothing against the former, but my former employer is already very gossipy to begin with and I don't want to invite speculation).

My partner says I'm overthinking it, that everyone there was miserable, it was during Covid, and people will not be hard on me for behaving the way I did. 

At one point he even said it's not something professional people do, especially at my career level (senior manager) and is worried I'll look kind of crazy if I did. 

Still, something about all this is not sitting right with me.

I feel like I need to make a call either way so I can move forward in my job search but I have no idea what to do and am genuinely on the fence.

So a couple weeks ago I was hired by this company. It was for a position I had been working years to get. Previously I worked for Robert Half as a full time engagement employee as part of their salaried professional program. I worked there for about 15 months and I had gone on what they call ""assignments"". On one of those assignments I worked for the company that would eventually hire me. I wanted to work there full time but they didn't want to pay the recruitment fee that Robert Half would charge (half my salary). So I left on went on another assignment for 10 weeks. This company wanted to wait to hire me until one year would pass from when I started working there as a contractor (January of 2022). I express my concern about this but they tell me they have read the contract and I won't need to worry. So I leave RH &amp; accept the new position but literally on my first day on the job (yesterday) while I am doing my onboarding paperwork my manager tells me RH is claiming half my salary. I am not working today as they are ""pausing my employment"" until they figure this mess out. What are my options here?"

My supervisor has asked me before if I see myself doing my current position for a long time and the answer is no but I didn't say that and I think he knows my answer was no.

It also feels like they've been pushing me to apply and look elsewhere with comments like ""not sure if the company is doing layoffs but just look around and update your resumes,"" or ""i hope i see you back from the holiday break.""

In some ways, my supervisor is very supportive so I think if I were to mention I want to apply to the other role they would encourage it.

I'm just not sure if I should because wouldn't I be viewed as a flight risk? If they think I want to leave and they do start making layoffs then wouldn't I be the first to go?

Also, how do I navigate switching roles? Would I have to contact HR and then apply?

I have worked for more than a decade on getting to where I am today. 

My career started as a content writer at 17 years old, I went to college, dropped out, hustled for four years, landed a low level onboarding job at a SAAS tech company, got married, had a kid, moved up in the company, got a management role, moved companies, am now the Director of Operations.

I have spent most weekends working or setting up other business ventures. 70 hour work weeks are normal for me. I cofounded two tech companies that have so far gone nowhere.

After what is now almost fifteen years of work, I now know that I hate being in management. I know a little bit about every part of the business from finance and law to software development and design.

I don't know what I want, but I have spent the last six months denying to myself that this is where I am at professionally. I make $80,000 a year and have been aggressively paying down debt with only student loans remaining.

TL;DR

Got my dream management job. Hate it. Want to be an individual contributor role. Don't know how to start searching for that as it's brand new to me. Everyone just says to follow your passion. Not feeling like I have one.

I'm confused as to how to classify myself. I'm 21 and newly living on my own, and I sadly know very little about taxes as of yet.

I registered for an LLC last year but didn't keep up with any of it because I wasn't sure if I needed it yet (I didn't make enough money to pay taxes) and I couldn't afford to maintain it. Though I suspect this year I will in fact be making more than $12k doing freelancing. I'm in a bind financially, so it'd be nice if I didn't have to renew my LLC this year, but I may just have to, yeah?

Should I get my LLC figured out and renewed before identifying my Federal Tax Classification on UpWork? Or would I identify myself as an individual/sole proprietor? Do you have to apply to something to label yourself as an individual/sole proprietor?

1,2023-01-04,What are some viable next steps here?,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/103a143/what_are_some_viable_next_steps_here/,careerguidance,"Long story short, I attempted a career change during peak COVID '20.  I went back to school to start taking some accounting courses and wound up breaking into the field.  After a couple of poor experiences, I realized that the work and culture of most accounting orgs wasn't for me.  So, I ventured back into my original career path as a data analyst starting in May 2022.  

I wound up with a pretty good opportunity working at a F100 firm.  I support a team mostly consisting of lawyers and paralegals.  I love this job in that I'm really good at what I do and I manage to impress my stakeholders regularly.  I've been here a little over seven months now.  My manager loves me and my team and I get along well.  I currently WFH 100%, but may return to a hybrid schedule in a few months when they can find us a new home.  My job is super flexible and I'm rarely ever stressed out.  

As much as I love my current role, it falls short in some areas, too.  For one, I wound accepting a lower level title and salary just to get back into analytics.  As it stands now, I'm in more of a junior level pay grade despite having seven years of progressive analytics experience.  

My manager is a bit of a micromanager.  It's nothing that I can't generally handle, but it is rather annoying.  She needs to have her hand in everything.  Any time I present something to her that I worked on and successfully delivered, she needs to know every single detail about what went into it and even goes so far as to try to re-do my work.  I do like her overall, and I think she will be an advocate for me, but her style is quite suffocating.

The pay is solid, but it is not really in line with my experience level either.  I was making this same salary back in 2016.  With my upgraded experience, skills, Master's coursework, and inflation, the salary doesn't really make sense for me long term.  I've expressed some of my concerns with my manager a few weeks ago, and she seemed to agree with me and willing to work something out around my 1-year mark.  

One final concern that I will note is the lack of development opportunities here.  Since I'm embedded with a legal team, I am by far one of the most technical people on the team.  There really aren't any other analysts that I can learn from.  And since my role is an ancillary support role, I don't think there is a major focus on grooming analytics people.  I often feel like an after thought as a result.  Therefore, I think my growth opportunities may be limited."

This person is mother to two kids one of them just four years old. After Christmas, the management decided that everyone should come to the office to work, regardless of who they are And what their prior commitments are.

This person is unable to travel to office and back which takes about two hours in the roundabout trip because she must be home to save her children when they come back from school.

Those who are actually going to the office, or complaining of bad behavior, including micromanagement to the extent that they are not allowed to go to the bathroom at well, no one is allowed to accompany someone else to say the water dispenser are the cafeteria. People are being ridiculed on the office floor by the manager our team leaders.

The management says that she should either start coming to office like others and find ways for the kids to stay back home until she returns, or just stop showing up to work which would let them terminate her without any benefits and no experience letter for the 8 months she has worked there. And there is no in between.

Does anyone have any thoughts on how she can tackle this? She tried to reach out to the HR for help and they were just acting like a mouthpiece for management and were refused to help her in anyway at all.

My question is, is there a position (or positions) I could apply for that would see the work I do at my current position as a desirable work experience? I guess I'm looking for suggestions on what sort of positions I should look into as I continue looking for a better position. I am also currently self teaching front end web dev and have *some* experience using those skills as a freelancer to make money. That helps inform the type of work I want to be able to do in a company setting eventually and some of my other skills, but recommendations made here need not be related to that.

I'm 26 and I live in Illinois. Thanks in advance for any assistance."

I'm 32. A copywriter for ~7-8 years. I've worked with creative &amp; digital marketing agencies, and moved to working with a tech brand now.

I've been happy with what I do here, but a sense of monotony is setting in, and it's only getting worse because I've got a fear of a how bad the upcoming years are going to be (majorly because of the slumping economies across the world).
I'm sure I'm being paranoid, but I'd still wanna be ready, and or atleast start preparing if I need to get another job or something.

As a copywriter, I have written print ads, managed social media accounts and content creation, put together the brand voice and guidelines, digital ads (from social media to display networks). I can also write search ad copies and put together content for landing pages for them.

Can y'all please recommend what else I should do, or skills I should focus on and sharpen, should I have to pick up freelancing gigs in the future?

I'm okay to pick up any and all writing gigs (except for those that need blog-writing and other long form content).
Please advise.

For a copywriter, I'm sure this must come across as a poorly-written message, but I can do better. I'm just a bundle of nerves right now, and really need some direction.

I'd really appreciate all help!"

Occasionally a recruter reaches out to me on LinkedIn. And I have this question at the back of my mind but I’m never 100% certain. 

I go ahead check out if their company exists, check their actual page to see how many connections they have, see when was the last time they posted etc. I Google the position they message about and the area to see if it actually exists. Everything checks out. 

They always have LinkedIn Premium, and seem to be from legitimate recruiting companies. But sometimes my cyber security training plays tricks on me. So when they say “this is a fast moving opportunity” automatically I think it’s fakes”.

Some of them even ask if they can do a teams call today or tomorrow, then they never respond. 

Just the rush of it always feels like a read flag, but I could always be misinterpreting it.

Right now I'm working on a resume and am just unsure as to how to approach this kind of situation. I think its important to list my experience/employment on my resume even though its not unrelated and I can explain in a cover letter or objective statement on my resume that I am changing career paths and explain why. Should I completely revamp my linkedin? For example, all of my skills are relevant to my current career but not really relevant in the field I want to go into. Should i scrap most of what I had and focus on my education, things I learned in my classes, that are relevant to my new career path?

Has anyone been through a similar process and have any advice? Its been pretty stressful for me."

Hi. I needed some opinions and fresh take on this. 
I accepted a job offer recently. It's good, but it isn't something that is going to help my career grow. After accepting the offer, a couple of days ago I got another job interview (I had applied for this months prior, however I heard back from them now). This job which I got the interview offer for sounds perfect for my professional growth. I've decided to not leave my new job immediately, and maybe leave it in 6 months time. My dilemma now is do I accept the job interview and then let them know that I am only free to join after 6 months tentatively, or not bother giving the interview at all? Is it wrong? 
Thank you."

I work 45-50 hours a week, the hours can be stressful (lots of getting drilled by the C-suite), but hours are great, I'm a top performer and have the halo effect from past performance. I'll probably never be fired even in a severe recession, but I have an ambiguous path to the next level (managing director). I'm kind of dependent on some people leaving, and honestly my boss may leave, and there's political danger my team becomes much less high profile (as it was before he joined). I can work from home 2-3 times a week. I enjoy WFH a lot, but I have a newborn and live in a one-bedroom NYC apartment, so honestly WFH has lost some of it's value. 

A smaller firm is offering me to head their strategy team. Something that would take 4-5+ years in my current role, and the MD title. The firm is not doing as well as my firm. I'd probably work from home 0-1 times a week. Hours would likely be worse, and I'd be mostly doing inorganic growth (M&amp;A). I've done a decent amount of this, but I mostly do organic growth in my current job...So there's a chance of failure, and we're entering a likely recession. 

Raising a kid in NYC is expensive, and the incremental $110k after taxes means we could probably stay in NYC with kids long term, since I could afford private school and to buy a place. At my current comp, I'll likely have to move to suburbs if I have a second kid, which I don't want to do. More money would also help us immediately as we could have a permanent night nurse, do a nanny for longer, and afford childcare for vacations / nights out with friends /etc. which is tight right now. 

On the other hand, starting a new job with a newborn seems difficult, I'll need to re-establish my reputation, and I have a much higher risk of being fired or laid off."

At one point I hurt my shoulder doing one of these jobs and my boss didn’t say to file a workers como claim and I didn’t know what to do honestly I was young and dumb thinking I didn’t want to hurt the company. Time went on another person was hired to do one of those jobs then my job was still very demanding. I asked about a raise in my evaluation one time and was promised that it would happen . That I was a great worker etc. the following year it didn’t happen. Then I was told that year that it wasn’t put in the budget bc the budget had already been created but that year it will be included . It wasn’t . Then this last year I was given a raise that included a cola raise and the different from my salary was $3,000. There are other things that have happened in the agency such as multiple employees quitting since I started I think a total of 10 or 15. Doesn’t sound like a lot but when it’s a small organization it’s noticeable. It’s a non profit and idk if that has something to do with it but I would hear from people that it’s not good to work for them and I never understood why.

I no longer feel happy being there and my boss has since then started acting indifferent towards me, taken me out of projects or tasks and just been really shitty honestly.

Background:  
While I was finishing college, I started a career in advertising, but I left after a few years (this was in 2011) so I can travel and enjoy life for a bit. I've lived in different states doing customer service roles for a long time and eventually got a customer service role with an amazing company that I love. Worked for the company for years and eventually made my way into a marketing role at their headquarters. Then the pandemic started and I was let go from a dream job at a dream company. I still work for the company, but I'm back in a customer service role that is remote. I no longer live in the state where the company is headquartered and they don't offer remote positions other than customer service. I have been submitting my resume and interviewing for jobs for 2 years and feel hopeless. While in the process of improving my resume and hunting for marketing roles, I'm starting to wonder if it's even what I want to do.

I appreciate the help."

A little background: I have a bachelor’s degree in psychology (minor in criminology). My beginning professional work experience started out with working at an emergency youth shelter (part time) and the preschool teaching (full time). For the past year though, I have been working at Job Corps as an instructor in both career prep and now academics. I had the intention of getting a teaching license but that’s out of my interest now.

I am looking to transition my career into the IT field at some point as I thought teaching would be a long term deal for me, but it’s rough when it comes to the pay, working hours, and people you have to constantly deal with. While I further my education and skill set, I will continue working full time in my current field.

I was heavily thinking about getting an Associate of Applied Science in Software Development (60 credit hours). I would like to be able to get into website design/development and graphic design as well.
 
But is it more worth it to get a short term certificate instead? There is an 18 credit hour program in website design or a 21 credit hour program in Web Application Development.

I’m just not sure which path might lead to more job stability. Is the AAS degree like a 2 in 1 deal meaning it would lead me to both my desired career goals? Or can a certificate do it all?

Just looking for some advice from people who have gone this route before. Thanks!"

I have a masters in biology (uni of Sheffield) that I’m not using and spend hours a day pondering my future. I currently see 3 options:

1) If I start an electrical business the money could be good but unreliable and stressful. As a plus, it would be more varied than just being an electrician as it requires some sales and project management skills. 

2) I could keep studying to become an electrical engineer but the prospect of another degree is daunting and I don’t know how lucrative electrical engineering is in the UK? 

3) I could start again (again) and learn to code. I’ve done some Python in my spare time and I enjoyed it. The potential earnings and idea of remote work are attractive but am I too old? (Age 28)

Both the tech and electrical industries are set to grow so I know there will be jobs. From what I hear, tech pays better atm. Will this trend continue as we shift to renewables and need to update our electrical infrastructure?

Alternatively, are there any fields that combine the two?

I also have a bit of history with my first employer. It's a major Investment firm. But I faced sexual harassment there and reported it to Title IX. While the company acknowledged that I was wronged and ended up making a lot of changes in their work policies. I had to leave since some of my seniors became hostile. Later when I left, I did hear from friendly colleagues that harassment still continued, though the company took it seriously now when reported.

I'm concerned about applying because I fear switching jobs after 6 months is seen as bad in the finance sector? Or is it okay? Would it look bad on my Resume? Will I be questioned about it later on? How will this future employer react when they do background checks on me from my first employer? Can I get good recommendations from my current non-profit employer if I choose to leave after 6 months?"

I was brought on last year to fulfill a very specific need that no one else in the company could or had time to do. I started last year at $70K, and after the new year, was told I would be raised to $80K, and even received an $18K bonus, which I was really surprised by. They had told me the bonuses could be quite large because we all ""share a piece of the pie"" when projects get finished, but it was still quite a lot. It also just shows that they truly value what I do, an action to match their words to me throughout the year. The benefits at my current company are poor - I have no 401K match and although it's ""unlimited PTO"", my company has a grindy culture where I'd say most people only take between 10 and 15 days off a year.

Before the year ended however, I was approached by a recruiter from a fortune 500 company in the same area as I currently work. I've been interviewing and have a pretty strong sense that I'll receive an offer. I have one ""final"" interview left which seems like a formality. I don't think I'm interviewing against any other candidates, they've been trying to fill the position for months, and my skillset matches exactly with what they're looking for.

This new job is for $95K, has a 5% 401K match, and something like 23 days of PTO a year. Also has 5-15% year end bonuses depending on performance and company profitability. And 2-3 days of remote work per week (which is what I currently get). And I'd be doing almost exactly the same job (or as close as you can possibly get when switching companies).

I'm really struggling because it's clear my company values me, they gave me a huge bonus, and it would be a slap in the face to leave now. But, the other companies pay is literally $15K higher and the benefits are just better, period. 

If it matters, I'm still in my 20s and early in my career. With how small my current company is, I see the potential for large career growth and expanding into higher roles pretty quickly. At least, more quickly than if I was at a large corporation. The new company is a large corporation that is a pretty substantial name drop on a resume for the industry I work in.

Ultimately, this is a first world problem, and I don't think I can go wrong with either choice. But any advice would be appreciated.."

Is there something wrong with me?,u/Guila_princess,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/103hl7d/i_dont_feel_productive_when_working_from_home_is/,careerguidance,"Hi! I'm a Sr. Product Designer located in Brazil who works for a European company. My job would be almost 100% remote if it weren't for the company's official hub in my city, except its located in this very pedestrian-unfriendly business district (I don't drive) with no subway station and getting there by bus or train eats away over an hour of my day (without mentioning the trip back home), so going to the office is a bit of a hassle at times.

Anyway, I've been seriously struggling with the WFH aspect of my job. Currently, in a post-pandemic world with an economic recession and layoffs looming over our industry, workers are being forced to go back the office against their will. And while sure, I'm really glad that I have the privilege to be able to work from home regardless, I just have such a hard time being productive with remote work and I keep thinking that there's something wrong with me. Most of the time, I just end up scrolling twitter, going to the kitchen to make coffee or do really small, simple tasks, and most video meetings just feel SO draining that its almost maddening.

I'm definitely an extrovert and I have joined this company only 4 months ago, so while I did have an in-office immersion during my first week, when I'm not in the office, I don't feel really seen or like I'm a part of the team. When I interact with people, have in-person meetings and when I'm able to showcase my work on the spot, I just feel so productive and confident, even when I have to sit through very introspective tasks, I feel like I can power through a lot just by being in an office space.

My previous job was 100% remote too, but I had been working for that company since before the pandemic, I grew from junior to mid-level in that company and I knew everyone. And sometimes I feel like working from home really harkens back to the dark days of 2020 when we had no other choice than to be stuck home.

Before anyone asks, I do have a sort of a routine. I go to the gym, I have a little office-dedicated room in my flat so I don't work from my bed/living room, I dress up even though I'm not going anywhere, it's not like I have a lot of distractions with the exception of my cat, but it still feels weird.

Everyone says they feel more productive when working from home, there's even research to prove workers are more productive when given the opportunity to work remotely, so I just keep thinking that there's something wrong with me :(

Does anyone else experience the same problem? I think talking about it would help me lots! Thanks :)"

1,2023-01-04,Right move to go part-time mid career?,u/ConsistentMeal7,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/103ho6j/right_move_to_go_parttime_mid_career/,careerguidance,"I work in the professional services industry. Great company, decent base salary for my position and above average bonus potential. I do not have to work crazy hours for the bonus either.

The issue I'm grappling with is I've reached a point in my career where the entire day is fixing problems and making critical decisions at a very fast pace. It's taking a mental toll even at 40 hours a week. I'm often completely exhausted mentally by the end of the day and it is a real challenge to get things done outside of work. I spend most of my free time resting and recharging.

I've given it plenty of time, hoping I would become used to the demands and find ways to be more efficient as I have done in previous roles.  That hasn't seemed to happen so I'm at a bit of a crossroads.

I don't think I can change my role at my current company to reduce these demands, it would require changing companies and I'm don't think the grass is greener. My employer is not the issue, more so the demands of professional services.

The only alternatives I can think of is attempting to reduce my hours so I am not so mentally exhausted. I don't know how that would fly or how it would affect my salary and bonus potentials, it could be a major hit. I am financially stable enough this is doable though, I just would not save as much for retirement. 

The other option is to change fields or start a business. Both of which I'm not certain are better options either. There's aspects of the industry I enjoy and the challenges are a plus to me, it's just a bit toooo challenging right now. If I could handle the demands, it's a pretty darn good job all things considered. 

My main question is what sort of financial hit can I expect by going part time and how does one approach their employer about that? I know that's vague but on average is going from say 40 to 32 hours a week a 1/5 total comp cut or are companies going to want to cut more or just reject the idea all together? I'm not that far from reaching base comp ceiling and additional bonus potential would mean even more responsibility so I'm not as concerned about long term impact to career progression."

1,2023-01-04,Any tips for career changing into IT/Tech?,u/CartographerLow6788,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/103ipf3/any_tips_for_career_changing_into_ittech/,careerguidance,"Hello all.

I am a 35 year old male with a wife and two kids that has been working at a food manufacturing plant in the Midwest for over 14 years now. I have 8 years as a production maintenance technician/mechanic, and before that, numerous production operator roles throughout the facility. It is getting to the point I am just entirely burnt out on the field and my surroundings/co-workers that aren't much like me. The pay raises are minuscule (\~40 cents a year at best), and the facility in general is becoming more lackluster year by year. I am effectively taking a loss in pay every year I keep this job due to inflation and stagnant wage growth. Manufacturing just doesn't pay out like the tech fields do, and the growth opportunity just isn't really there in general to ever get past a technician/electrician level unless you are one of the few lucky chosen ones (heavy politics involved).

Growing up and currently I'm pretty much a huge nerd. My #1 main hobby has always been electronics and technology/video games/computers. I have built a couple of simpler websites in the late 2000s when I had WoW guilds etc. I have put together numerous PC's and other electronics for various friends and family over the years. I have been the de facto ""IT"" for my family members and close relatives etc for years. The job I am currently doing requires lots of troubleshooting on the fly while being physically exhausted at times and putting in 12+ hour days.. not to mention the mechanic side which wears on your muscles depending on the task at hand. I feel like a job like this I would end up dying earlier in life if I continue with it til retirement due to all of the wear on the body. I have no doubt in my mind I can learn IT careers or possibly software engineering in the future which would be much better on my body and a better life balance in general. 

The biggest issue however is I don't know of a way to even enter the IT field financially. I currently make $29 an hour which should be $63k/yearly but with all of the overtime (some required and some volunteered for) ended up being $79k gross for 2022. With supporting a spouse (she also works and makes \~$35k) and 2 teenage kids it just isn't financially feasible to go into IT for a year or two to do the mandatory Helpdesk positions, assuming they only pay $15-20 per hour. A slight paycut would be okay though, but I couldn't do less than \~$65k/yearly in our current financial situation. When I started at this employer in 2008 the manufacturing pay relative to other fields looked much better than it does today in 2023.

I am willing to do whatever I can to get out of this career I am stuck in to have a better outlook and future for my family. I have already started looking into the certifications a lot of companies look for such as A+, Network+, Security+, as well as Microsoft certifications. Another option I can have is to finish an Associate's Degree and take part time classes starting in the fall towards Computer Science, but that may not change much in the end vs just doing certifications and/or bootcamps without a degree. I do feel right at home working on computers/networking as this has been my hobby most of my life, which I can't say about being an industrial mechanic as a past time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice or tips?

I’m an Australian who’s just graduated with a bachelor’s degree in animation. I did well grade-wise and had a lot of good feedback on my portfolio. Despite this, the animation industry is incredibly small in Australia and competitive so I haven’t had any luck finding work. I was lucky enough to be supported by my parents throughout my studies, I had to move to a bigger city to study without a support network. Now that my time there is winding down, I’m beginning to panic a little. I can’t realistically find any animation work there before my lease ends in February, and because it’s a capital city I don’t think I’d be able to afford rent, furnishing and transport on an entry level animation job regardless. My other options are moving back home with my parents but that poses it’s own problem. They are moving even more rural than we already live, to a remote town with 100 people and they will be living off grid, without internet. So I could stay for free, but my career prospects would be nil. The other option I’m considering is moving to Japan to be an assistant language teacher. I’ve studied Japanese everyday for about 8 years myself and I meet all the requirements to do so, however moving overseas alone is a big challenge and the companies that allow you to do so have terrible reputations. It all feels a little hopeless, any advice or suggestions from people here?

TLDR: Have a degree in animation, can’t find work, can’t afford to stay where there is work. So my options are to move off grid isolated with parents or go to Japan as an assistant language teacher."

I told our training team I am no longer available to assist because of the amount of time they wanted me to give. This was something I had to push as a no. They were not expecting it.

Since July, I have been testing new tech to be used internally. This has involved several meetings, countless emails all day every day, lots of documentation, etc. This is taking way more of my time than initially noted. What really frustrates me is my feedback is pretty much being ignored and people who aren't even going to be using the tech are ultimately having meetings and making decisions. I don't see how you can comment on functionality if you haven't even used the new tech nor have you used the existing tech.

I have not even received a gift card for lunch or something small as acknowledgement of all this extra work. 

I've had all the right conversations with the right people at the right times about getting some kind of extra pay, etc. Nothing. I was told next time say no. But this is more of an I'm asking to be polite but am expecting you to say yes scenario.

Right before graduation, I found out that you need a 4-year degree to get my state's license. I said no thank you as I barely wanted to go to school, to begin with. 

Even though I wanted to change careers, with student loans and consistently get better pay and perks how could I leave (golden handcuffs)? Since college (10 years later, 30M) I have been at 5 firms. Only one of which I stayed at for 5 years. Over the years school has paid off and now I'm in a spot needing to go back to school (30k+/-) to really advance.

I'm working at a pretty good place where I could become a partner at a small mom-and-pop work working alongside a colleague I greatly respect personally and professionally. I've been told I'm good at what I do and my colleagues have questioned why I would want to leave. I can't seem to commit to going back to school.

I can't seem to ideate or find something that is of interest or one I believe I could competently do (#self-doubt). The colleague I admire has made comments in regards to me buying in and I feel I'm stringing along him and the professional I work under (and would replace).

I have seen a career counselor and done a large amount of introspection as to who and what I am. The biggest item found is being in an engineering field and should be in a more artistic one. I've been able to narrow done interests and capabilities and am between, photographer, videographer, graphic designer, or some amalgamation of those. 

I haven't pursued really diving into those because I feel ridiculous leaving engineering and wanting to do something creative instead. I also have concerns about money needing to be made (owning a home and married in NJ = $$$).

I moved to a bigger hospital, on a general medicine floor so we get stuck with a lot of psych patients, and after a while it does start to get to you. I've noticed people in this bigger hospital are a lot more entitled and the management never stands up for the staff. I am exhausted physically and mentally and am looking for a career change. For context, I make about 57,600 after taxes are deducted.

I haven't really ever tried anything except medicine so I'm not sure what I would like and not like, any advice on how to even start trying to switch my career? I'm not sure if I want to stay in medicine. I went into it to help people and now people are the thing that make me want to quit. I just can't stand people's entitlement when I am doing everything I can to help them."

I honestly do not know how I got this job, but believe I’m doing good. I’ve been here for 3 months and had a week of training with a lady that did not want to train me and would only spend an hour a day. I mainly order parts for R&amp;D engineers, and will start being put on important projects. I believe I am doing very well and understand a lot but there is a lot of stuff I don’t know. The first couple months I was thrown into the fire at the end of the year with budget stuff I had to learn a lot on my own since my boss was rarely in and teams scares me. 

I am also severely adhd which helps with my job going from order to order, but had my first 1:1 today and will start having them weekly. Today did not go well My boss told me yesterday we would have it today and every week going forward. I came in unprepared and had a lot of things to talk about but kept jumping around unorganized. At the end I asked what I need to work on and he told me to slow down I’m going to fast. 

I want to talk to him tomorrow and apologize to him for not being prepared. Is this a good idea? I would like to discuss how he wants these meetings to go and what topics to approach. Any advise on what else I should ask about the 1:1 is very appreciated. It’s all I can think about because I feel like I sounded like a complete dumbass but I am getting my job done. 

How do you guys/gals handle 1:1 what do you discuss? What are the topics I should bring in? My role is rather weird I order parts for R&amp;D engineers so every order is completely different some easy some complicated. I really love this job and do not want to be fired so any advise is greatly appreciated.  Also, what should I say to my boss about me being unprepared and what should I ask him what he expects from a 1:1. I’m a recent post grad and had a job right out of college for a year and had monthly 1:1 with my boss but all we talked about is hunting and fishing so I don’t know how to handle these."

I am confined to part time remote work at the moment. I have a Masters degree in Urban Planning and my Bachelors was in Psychology. I am very good at writing, research, analysis/problem solving, teaching (I have tutored before online) and can handle customer service but would prefer it not be a job where I am on the phone all day.

Writing and Research are probably my best attributes for work from home jobs that are part time, as my field of urban planning rarely offers PT work to my knowledge.

All I see when I look for this type of work online are a bunch of scammy looking websites, jobs that barely pay (below minimum wage), or options that might not be great for me (constant phone calls all day).

I am a bit pickier than I should be, but that is mostly because I am looking out for my health and am supposed to reduce stress per doctor's instructions.

I have the education, some work experience in urban planning, mental health, and education (tutoring). But I am having trouble finding something that can fit me. Usually the biggest barriers are the Part Time aspect (everything is either full time or unreliable) and of the jobs available that I can probably do, I don't always have all the qualifications (e.g. I am well versed in psychology, but I am not qualified to conduct remote therapy, a popular job listing, in the United States).

I’m suffering from imposter syndrome and I really don’t feel I am capable of doing the stuff that I want to. 

I reached out to the University career services and went over my résumé. We went over my background, and after discussing my goals about moving away from NYC towards Europe, the career services advisors stated that I should have the confidence to apply given my background. 
My background is very unorthodox. I started engineering as an undergraduate, studied abroad twice, my first career start was in corporate management…. 2 years and 2 months before I quit because of health concerns related of stress (which I’m convinced I only got because they mistook my exchange for a masters). I’m in graduate school and graduate in 6 months if all goes well. 

Looking at my background, the career service advisors stated that this misinterpretation by the company was advantageous for me because it really strengthened my resume…. 

But in my heart, I feel like I’m lying to myself and deserving or being capable of pursuing my goals. 
The senes of imposter syndrome has really been ruining my sleep the last few nights and it’s really beginning to take a mental toll on me…. As of I’m wrong for event thinking about pursuing the life goals I have. 
Take note, I don’t come from an Ivy League back around or anything like that… So the fact that I came from a small school and began my career in New York City in the position that I did was huge already to begin with …. 
I don’t know… it hurts. A lot… that’s I’m afraid to pursue what I want."

Below are some characteristics and interests

1. She prefers to work alone

2. Shes a perfectionist

3. Rude people really affect her, as do ""weird"" people (in her pastry jobs, restaurants can bring in a lot of rude and weird people)

4. She hates math and science

5. She loves classical music &amp; having morales

6. She loves reading, coffee shops, and travelling

7. She does well with learning new languages

8. She is very considerate and empathetic

9. She has a short fuse when angry

10. She is very good at organizing and planning

11. She is an introvert. She would do well working from home

12. She is very sensitive

13. Stress really affects her negatively. A low stress job would be ideal

Hey Everyone! I earned my BA in Biological Sciences in 2017 with a 3.2ish overall GPA. I worked as a substitute teacher for 4 months, and then as a pharmacy technician for 8 months. I enlisted in the Air Force to pursue a Physician Assistant program they offer, but I’ve changed my mind since. I’ve been working as an Avionics Aircraft Technician for the past 5 years and am looking at separating mid 2023.

I’ve been researching master degree programs but am struggling to pick a career path and whether I should even go for my masters. I’ve seriously looked into Biomedical Engineering, Clinical Research Assistant, and Pharmacology.

For Bio Engineering, I think it’s really cool that I’d be helping develop artificial organs, prosthetics, etc. I am excited about the biology aspect, but the designing/engineering portion is a bit daunting as they’re not my strengths.

For Clinical Research, I enjoy the thought of being the intermediate between novel medicines and patients, as I enjoy interpersonal workplaces. My con is reading that the average pay for a CRA with a MA is $60k a year, which is about what I make now with benefits calculated in.

For Pharmacology, I like the prospect of studying the effects of chemicals on people and helping create new drugs. From my research it seems that a MA wouldn’t increase job availability/salary that much, and that going for PhD is the main route for those interested.

My strengths are microbiology, anatomy, biology, medicine, math, working with people, working with my hands, troubleshooting/problem solving, teaching, leading/managing teams, attention to detail, lab skills, and documentation. My weaker areas are chemistry, presenting, engineering, and sales.

My main goals are to find a career that pays above 60k (or 45k with my BA), requires nothing higher than a masters degree, deals with biology and medicine, and is realistic with my 5 year gap of biology experience.

I’m also interested in radiology and anesthesiology, but I have yet to research them thoroughly.

Thanks for taking the time to read and for any suggestions!"

2,2023-01-04,Am I striving for Computer Science just to escape being a doctor?,u/Prod-GoB,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/103p3zj/am_i_striving_for_computer_science_just_to_escape/,careerguidance," Hi from Malaysia!  
So I'm currently in Matriculation (basically a kind of foundation course that gives people a better chance to enter public unis after).

To get straight to the point, my family has been pushing me to study medicine for years now. However, I do not find any interest in it and told them several times that i prefer getting into computer science. While this might sound like a cliche ""fam wants me to study medic/law but i should chase my dreams lets gooo"", I personally believe its much more complicated than that.

Firstly, since they have been pushing me to get into medic for so many years, its natural that i get real tired of it eventually. My family would keep sending medic articles for me to read and have me sit down and watch medic related movies during meals regularly. I get that they are trying real hard to get me interested but im just sick of it rn (or maybe im just rebellious hehe). And the problem was that time i didn't really start researching about other careers until SPM (final exam before matriculation), so i didn't really have a 'career dream' from young.

My families main reason for choosing my career for me is: ""You're still young, and there are so many teens who switch their careers halfway through since they were not capable of making such an impactful decision at 18. Also, being a doctor is very respectful and I'll be able to meet all kinds of people and train my people skills throughout the job. Plus they have trained me to be the type of people that can study all day so they think im able to keep up with the stressful journey towards a doctor. Furthermore, theres are a ton of people who just enter medicine just because they have the money and not because they're passionate as well, and they do just fine. We have the financial stability, so why not? My sister was in the same predicament as me when it was her turn to choose. She too did not have a real career dream and was eventually convinced to go for MBBS (the degree course for medicine). Now although shes extremely stressed out everyday, she is decently interested in the course and seems ok with it (at least from what i see). Oh and one more thing, the pathway for doctors are pretty much planned out compared to corporate jobs where theres a ton of politics that will drain me out eventually.""

Then again, im not my sister. I'm more impulsive and enjoy taking risks. During middle school, our school's computer class taught basic html coding, and i absolutely loved it. Although it was nothing much, i aced it and got the highest in my year. Since then, I had attempted to commit to learning a computer language like java or c++ several times during my free time but never really got far (mostly because im lazy). I usually ended up indulging in my other hobbies like making music and gardening, where learning to code kinda ended feeling like homework instead of a hobby. I'm afraid of a few things about my interest in CS

1. my original interest is just due to learning something new and it'll die out quickly
2. they say cs is math-heavy and requires lots of logical thinking. Me being just average in math and unsure whether im logical or not is afriad that im not suited for this career.
3. people also say that theres enough materials on the net for people to learn enough through online courses, apply for several small jobs to get experience and build a portfolio, so finding a stable job sounds like fighting for a piece of meat with a pack of lions.
4. I hear CS in Malaysia isn't amazing and it might be better to search for international companies eventually to be able to get somewhere.

By the way, sorry for making you read this lengthy rant, hope you're having a great day!

I like CS because the possibilities are endless. I consider myself a creative and adventurous person, and i like how i can basically do pretty much anything with this knowledge (provided i find the right company for me which is probably damn difficult but so is any other career out there right?) CS as a field is still growing and expanding now so i doubt that CS jobs will become irrelevant any time soon. Its really fun making something from scratch and seeing your program sparking to life after lots of hard work. If i really wanted, i could even work with medic fields and improve their medical systems since they depend on these stuff more and more nowadays too. I'm also interested in the environment (enviromental science and veterinary was up on my interest list) so i hope to use my CS knowledge to help the environment once i've retired and have to time to work on these things with financial stability.

Right now my plan is to make an extremely extremely detailed research on CS and make a 'presentation' in front of my family on why i want to choose CS instead of Medic on March, right before i apply for uni. I've done this once before getting into matriculation but failed so this time i've got everything on the line. At the point, im tired of thinking whether Medic or Computer Science is the right choice and convinced myself that there is no wrong path.

Any advice/opinions are greatly appreciated. If you have any things about CS that i should know that would be cool too. Thanks for reading and have a swell day :)"

The interview went well and they said they were looking to hire by Dec 21, which is when their office closes for the break. 

They said I made it to the technical round (this is an engineering position) and they were going to email me an interview date. I would email the interviewer about once a week and he would update me. On Dec 14, he said that they were a little behind and wouldn't make the hire until the new year. He said I should expect an email for a scheduled technical interview in ""early 2023"". Early 2023 is kind of vague so I'm not exactly sure what the time frame is for the interview.

The thing is that I accepted a new job offer before I was contacted about the dream job with the dream company the dream company. Normally i would not entertain any interviews after accepting the new job, but it's my dream job, so I kept an open mind. I plan on turning down the new job if I receive an offer from the dream job. I have to report my new job on Feb 13 in a different state, so I'm cutting it kind of close because there will be one last interview round if I make it past the technical round. 

The last time I emailed the interview was December 14, so it's been almost a month. Like I said before, between No 28 and Dec 14, I emailed him twice and he was very communicative and polite about the status each time. I really want to email him again asking him for a timeline so I can plan accordingly, but I don't want to risk being annoying or sounding pushy and hurting my chances. I don't want them to think I think the job revolves around me because I know it doesn't, I'm just in a tough spot.

For some insight I am just recently started my job as a claims adjuster for an insurance company and am experiencing extreme stress and burnout. I feel overwhelmed with the amount of claims I have to work on. I get anywhere from 4-5 new claims a day with multiple parties that need to be contacted within a 24 hour timeframe on top of my existing claims that need assistance. No two claims are a like and all have their own unique challenges. I am in charge of every aspect of the claim; coverage, liability, getting statements, rental cars, setting up repairs, total losses, contacting banks and other insurance companies, payouts for claims, negotiating, on top of being expected to answer our general hotline for 2 hours of my 8 hour shift and in that time frame I cannot make any outgoing calls to customers. 

I am going to reach out to manager and would like your advise on it:

Dear BOSS,

I am coming to you to because I am having trouble prioritizing my workload. 

I understand that part of my role is to work independently and I feel I can complete most tasks independently. However, I am finding myself needing guidance and specific answers on unique claim scenarios which leads to me being stuck and not knowing what to do next. It is preventing me from being able to work my claims efficiently and to my fullest potential. 

I know that most answers can be found in the (website) and (other website) and I do find most of my answers there,but when it comes to liability and negotiating I find myself struggling and taking more time than is expected. 

I know that I am scheduled next week to sit with (trainer) and I believe his insight would be great, however, I feel more one on one time with a trainer/claim rep or possibly shadowing would be best for me in order to be more confident and make decisions to move claims forward more quickly. 

Do you think this could be arranged? Thank you for all of your support.


Anything I should change? 

Thank you."

I couldn’t leave work at home emotionally and my mental health became even worse then it had already been. I left social services and worked as a server for the year. As much as I do want to help others Ive enjoyed not having to really emotionally care for others for once, Ive enjoyed being able to just focus on myself and leave work at work. It’s been over a year now and I thought somehow I would figure out what I would want to do with my life but I have no idea. I’ve been serving on and off since I was 18 and am really done with it. Im not really sure what to do. Any advice or suggestions would really help me!

Some information about me: 
- I want a job that gives me some sort of fulfillment
-something that doesn’t make me anxious or dread going to work all the time 
- I’m not into the whole “hustle” culture
- having my own business ( in what im not sure) appeals to me sometimes but I also know how hard it is 
- I want something I enjoy doing most of the time
- I have inattentive adhd
- I’m quite organized when it comes to work 
- I’m task driven 
- I like and prefer to work on my own independently but also work well with others
- I like creative work (I’ve worked as a florist and enjoyed the creative aspect of it but the money was not good) 
- I’m very introverted 
- some of my hobbies and interests are yoga, gardening, floral design, reading, being outdoors"

Over past three years, I have been exploring other career fields and I have always had an interest in how pieces of code can have an impact on someone's life..or just the idea of creating fun, collaborative projects is exactly what I want to do, so I took a Bootcamp course in Front End Development.

Before I consider a career switch, my age...I am 29 which is not old but that's not so far away from 30 :D Secondly: I evaluated my strengths and weaknesses overall(not generalized as soft or hard skills, just a general analysis) as an employee. Strength's: Persistent, patient, motivated to always learn/improve myself as an employee, good communicator, creative(this does not necessarily say how but for the sake of this post: in problem solving),  attention to detail has improved over the years and emotional intelligence.

My weaknesses: It takes me a bit of time to understand complex processes/information before I'm fully confident at it, asking for help (which I am improving on at my current job), being too hard on myself.

My questions are: Can I still make a career switch to Front End Development based on the fact that I am 29? Second is based on my strengths and weaknesses, would I be a great fit for the field?

Also to mention, I am not afraid of working long hours  (people in Finance knows the hell of MEC :D) and I am not afraid to make mistakes so that I can learn. I am trying to build a portfolio at the moment as well."

(not an easy one :D)

I worked the first year as a Team Leader at Outbound Warehouse.

Last year I managed to get a new job in a Warehouse in the food industry.  
My title right now is Assistant Warehouse Operations Manager. In 2 months I will have my yearly talk where I can negotiate. I don't see myself in the Warehouse, and I wanna go more for a desk job.

In terms of tasks, I am ordering raw materials according to the production plans, optimizing the space all the time because the warehouse is very small, scheduling shipments between external warehouses, creating working plans for people working in the warehouse, and helping with warehouse work.

I am also creating reports with Excel and Python, which I enjoy the most.

So I wanna know, is there any better title that could I ask for that will help my career in the future?"

I 20F, have been working for a mortgage broking/investment acquisition company for about 18 months now. When I first began, it was super full on, 12-15 hour work days 6 days a week plus doing lead generation on Sunday’s so essentially 364 work days a year. My role was assisting the company in acquiring new clients and attracting those clients to working with the company. This role is meant to be short term and you are to then move into other areas of the company. I have been the black sheep of the company for a long time as I moved into an administration role as opposed to a sales role as the long days are not for me; nor are the crippling KPI’s. I find the work that I’m doing now relatively enjoyable, I work 9-5 very minimal OT required. Salary of $45k p.a. AUD with decent bonuses, should be minimum $10k p.a. but I find returning to work after time off causes me crippling anxiety. 

There is one particular member of the leadership team that has been quite cruel to me. Giving me a dressing down with the door open so the whole office can hear. on one occasion over shit she had blown out of proportion - being 2 minutes late to a meeting, when i had asked my manager if i could duck to the bathroom before the meeting as i hadn’t had a chance prior due to training, this leadership member lost her mind at me as i had filled up my glass on the way to the meeting room…. i copped a 10 minute lecture from her for this) 

Aside from her, most of my colleagues are good ranging from tolerable to nice. 
During my time with the company, i have had a short break over christmas 21, an illness march 22 (my position was threatened while I was away due to a horrific ovarian cyst - I had 2 weeks off unpaid as I couldn’t walk), then 7 business days off in october 22 for an interstate holiday, and now christmas 22. Each time i have taken a break, in the day or two leading up to my return, I have had terrible feelings about returning to work. I had the same problem most years before returning to school after a mid semester break. During my time between school and my current job, I didn’t have this issue of anxiety returning to work. I enjoyed my role and the people I worked with (even if a few weren’t angels to be around). 

I do find myself feeling incredibly inadequate and now unmotivated to continue on my journey at this company. 

I think I would like to leave the company and work at a fruit and veg shop that has a position available for me (through a friend - so guaranteed and same or better money) and take some time to learn about myself and get my mental health back together.

Im 20f in nsw, i grew up below the poverty line and was homeless twice as a kid. My parents are very poor and alcoholics, so i moved out at 18. I dont have my p's yet bc i dont have a supervising driver and financial problems, but im slowly gaining logbook hours. Not being able to drive really affects my housing/job opportunities.

I went to uni in 2021 and majored in environmental science, it was the only course i could get into. I lost my casual job during covid and had to survive on 15$ a week after paying rent. I was starving and miserable so i took a gap year.

In my gap year i worked in retail, it was ok but i realised i dont want to do that the rest of my life. 

I recently got into a nursing course, i chose nursing due to many career opportunities and good pay. The problem is i have to do 880hrs of unpaid work to get my degree. This will make it hard to get a job, and ill only have 50$ of youth allowance a week after rent. 50$ a week for 3 years will be miserable.

I dont know whether to continue with 2 more years of environmental science or change to 3 years of nursing. The enviro science degree gives me more time to do casual work but im worried about being able to find a job after uni. 

Honestly im thinking about dropping out and getting a full time job. It seems dumb to spend 2-3 years accumulating debt and starving to end up with a job with average pay when i could be working during that time and gaining experience. Ive been looking into mining,trades and the adf but they all either need qualifications or a drivers licence. But if i get a degree i could be earning more in the long run.

Sorry this is a long post, im hoping people with more of an idea of job prospects can help me make a decision. Are there jobs in enviro science? Is nursing a better choice? What other areas are well paying and looking for workers? My main goal is just to be able to afford to live, Im willing to move anywhere and do basically anything."

I'm about to choose my university major/subject.

I have a huge interest in the healthcare and medical field, and Biology was always my most favourite and interesting subject during my school years.
After doing some research, I found allied healthcare professions (eg. PT, OT, nurse etc.) the most interesting field in the healthcare industry. 

However, I would also prefer work-from-home arrangements, and I know I.T/CS offers heaps of work-from-home arrangements.
But I don't really enjoy programming, and CS-related topics don't really interest me. 
But I do know I have the potential to do academically well in any subject, but obviously the 'interest in the subject' will be missing if I do choose I.T/CS.

Now should I consider something that will lead me towards allied healthcare professions, which I will find interesting, or rather I.T/CS just because it provides work-from-home opportunities?

To sum up: 
Should I consider something that I find interesting to study and perform the job?
Or something that I don't find much interesting to study, but it offers work-from-home opportunities, meaning better work/life balance, and slightly higher salary?"

So I’ve been looking at careers in Sport, and there doesn’t seem to be that many good ones, either there bad pay with few opportunities, or I feel like I wont be suited to them/wont enjoy them.
Also I’m unsure whether doing a Sport related degree at university is worth doing since they don’t seem to lead to any worthwhile careers. But at the same time there aren’t that many sport jobs I can get without a degree

Also, I don’t particularly enjoy Sports either, I just happen to be good at them, so I don’t really want a job that is heavily focused on professional sport, e.g journalism. 
Im also a very quiet person, and most sport jobs require working very closely with people or speaking to groups, which is just not for me.

I graduated in 2019, and I got a job in a small  private company. The money was bad, but I wanted to get experience ASAP. Shortly  after, I got a job at the Civil Service. After 2 years, I changed company  to another  government body in the civil service. Money is still not great. 
Now I'm contemplating applying to private companies  because  I'm  not really  happy with my job or the money. With the rise in the cost of living,  I'm  really  struggling financially. I know  everyone  is, but my point is that I could  be getting  a lot more in the private  sector  than where I'm  now. A graduate  is getting  more in a pharmaceutical company than what I'm  getting after 3 years  working  for the civil service(I'm on a bit less than 38k), I work as a scientist. 

Another  thing is, if I leave this company. I'll  be burning the bridge. They will never hire me again. But my priorities at the moment  are paying  my loans, making money, maybe a career change, and hopefully  migrating. What are your  thoughts? I'm  also thinking  about  applying for PhD. programmes that would  pay me, of course  after paying  off my loans.

I'm unsure of what to do next, whether to continue in marketing or pivot careers, so any advice from the community would be greatly appreciated. Here's my story (sorry in advance if it's long):

I graduated as an electrical and electronics engineer, landed a job as a content writer right out of college, and later went on to become a product marketer, which I've been for 5 years. I never intended to land in marketing, as I was a science nerd throughout school and college. But I guess there are things you like, and things you're good at. Though I never acknowledged it, languages have always been my strong suit. My verbal (English) skills are in the top 1% on all standardized tests, and I've been called quite creative by many people I know (both professionally and personally), so I guess I was in the right field.

I've always been a top performer in my roles, and even in the current one I was laid off from, my manager assured me it had nothing to do with my performance and is willing to vouch for me wherever I decide to apply.  However, I'm seriously considering a career pivot as I feel marketing doesn't offer much scope for research and analysis (which I love doing) and is also quite unstructured.

I'm contemplating moving to Data Science/Analytics, but I'm scared because:

a) I have no CS background at all. Even if I do get some certification, from what I've read, it's almost impossible to break into that domain without experience.

b) I don't want to throw away something I'm naturally good at for lack of interest. 

Do you have any advice for me? Are there any fields that combine English language skills with analytical/problem-solving skills? Is a break in Data Science feasible at this point? I've been feeling lost for 2+ years, and I finally have an opportunity to pause and reflect, so I want to make the most of it. Also, I'm financially quite secure- I can stay in my current role for 2 more months and draw a substantial salary, and I can remain jobless for up to 4 months after that. 

P.S. Sorry if I've rambled on, but I could really use some guidance atm :("

For instance, I work with the Adobe pack, ranging from Photoshop and Illustrator to Premiere and After Effects. Although I have no graduation in the area, I am fluent in those 4 and would like a job that pays in dollar. Any kind of payment is already way better than what I can get in my region

I also am fluent in English and have a very powerful rig, the problem is that I have no idea how to look for jobs abroad.

I also am interested in getting a junior job as a frontend programmer, since I am currently graduating in Data Security (yes I know it is not exactly in my area but it is the one I am most comfortable with), but even though remote jobs for frontend in Brazil are plenty, a good chunk of them require you to work as PJ, which is a hiring modality that is not very good for junior programmers bc the payment is lacking and the benefits that comes with CLT are not being returned in this value.

To be honest I've probably held myself back with my mindset as I've always aimed for low paying jobs because that's all I've felt qualified to do. 

Now, however, I've finally gotten into a field where I can make more than 50k a year with added benefits once I switch jobs. I currently am making $26/hour, but am deep in talks with other companies that will pay more, do extensive background checks, have a lot of added responsibility and more hours to work, etc. 

It's all very overwhelming to me. I'm from a working class family and am a first generation college grad, so the idea of having multiple interviews, dressing up in khakis, dealing with office politics professionally, etc. Is very daunting. A lot of people at my current company have kids, put in 50+ hours a week, and always maintain a professional demeanor. Meanwhile I'm a 22 year old kid who is trying to move out of his parents house after going into debt for college who is struggling to even get to the office on time because waking up at 6:30 is hard. 

Once again only thing I really have going for me is that I'm smart and do good work, but its really maintaining professionalism that I struggle with. I forget to shave a lot, and am often a bit underdressed because I don't really get or care about attire. I don't always say the right things to my coworkers either, as some days I don't have the mental fortitude to deal with the fake smiles and somewhat bullshit policies. It's part of the reason I'm leaving this job soon but also know I'm not going to find a job where I love everyone and agree with every decision that management or corporate makes. 

How do people manage to act so professional all the time? I get that it's good for career growth and that it's only a job at the end of the day, but some people just seem to thrive in and enjoy this environment even if there are clearly shitty decisions being made. I can deal with it 40 hours a week, but I certainly can't manage it or put on the facade in the same way career oriented people do. Really, if I just had to do my job and talk with clients, I'd be all set. I just struggle with the crappy office people, and the politics and policies that just seem to make my job harder and don't positively impact my performance."

It took me four years to finish. 2020 I started again and am currently enrolled in an Art History in Global Context program at the same university. I have minored in Philosophy and Film studies in my BA and Film studies also now in my MA. I am planning on graduating this fall.

During the whole time, I have been working as an editor for the national broadcast company and focussing more on online in recent years. I also worked 100% during the 'gap' year between my bachelor's and my master's. Last year, I started taking on the additional responsibility of a commissioning officer, funding and co-producing multimedia projects. I talk to universities, supporting their art programs, and get to comment on submissions on a national level. But it isn't easy to hold, as this position only officially existed before restructuring. So my current department lends me some additional time, and I get to do my things.(But I still have a lot of say concerning these specific projects. The fund still exists and requires an expert, but I don't have a boss.).

Currently, I am at a fork in the road. I am turning 29 this year. (I wasted some time thinking I would become an engineer). While taking on more responsibility, my pay and job description at work have not changed in the last seven years. (This was also my first official job starting with 21) I feel stuck and stuck in corporate, where I don't get challenged, and sometimes I think at least 30% of my work could be automated. I have applied for various positions at the company. It's either you are overqualified (which is a nice way of saying that I am underqualified) or that I am still too young.

I finished most of my classes on only have my master's thesis to work on, which stretches over two semesters. I have been considering going for a semester abroad. That would imply I would have to quit my job. Is there a place for someone like me in the private art sector, museums, and cultural institutions? Is a semester, which is only four months plus change, worth it? Should I go all in and pivot to art history also professionally or stick to media? I feel like I have a lot of soft skills that I can't communicate or demonstrate on the spot. I grew up bilingual on two continents and speak four languages plus some dialects. So it's not that I have never experienced other cultures. Do you think taking up some CAS classes instead of focussing on the MA is the wise thing to do this year? 

If you managed up to here, thank you for your time. I appreciate it.

Getting such a massive promotion would be a once in a lifetime opportunity for me and for the industry I am in. This chance will not come again. This is a fact that makes me feel like I would have to do it, despite it being uncomfortable in terms of personal life and workload increase.

Unfortunately the environment was beyond terrible, so I quit after four months and have been taking the chance to catch my breath since October, and am now searching again. I was an Executive Personal Assistant in both positions, so a hybrid of industries (private staffing/corporate - one in management consulting, one in a family office), and I am now open to a range of industries and roles. Generally trying to move away from private staffing and directly supporting nutty millionaires/billionaires.

Should I include the four-month position on my resume? Conventional wisdom on the internet seems to say that six months is the minimum for a short-term job on a resume, but a couple of recruiters I've worked with in the past have advised me to include it, and that some employers will pass me up for having a gap. Obviously, if asked about the gap I would answer honestly without badmouthing the short job, but I'm also worried that spelling out such a short-term position on paper will disqualify me.

I do have a one-year gap from 2020 to 2021 when I was out of work after a pandemic layoff, and it didn't seem to hold me back when searching for a job in 2021. I've also remained in a volunteer position this whole time and that is included on my resume.

Using a throwaway bc I don’t want this linked to my regular account. 

I [F28] recently began working in an industry that requires an advanced degree for most jobs. Since late 2021 I’ve been working part time at a fairly prominent place in my industry while pursuing my degree. My coworker (who I’ll call Beth) [F20s] and I were hired around the same time and started working there within a week of one another. We were hired for the same job; there are several part time employees in this position in our department at any given time and all of us are enrolled in the same or similar degree programs. 

Several months ago, a new position was created that is a step up from me and Beth’s current position but still part time. Two of our coworkers who had been there longer than us were promoted to this position. One of these coworkers has recently been offered a full time position elsewhere and is leaving soon. 

I recently received an offer to be promoted to her position. They didn’t open internal applications, just offered me the promotion. As I mentioned it’s still part time but there is a minor raise involved. I’m mainly excited because I know a promotion will look good on my resume. 

Beth was not offered the same promotion. I know if roles were reversed, I’d be a little upset that she was offered a promotion over me since we started at the same time. I have to give myself credit – I definitely go above and beyond, make myself very available, cover extra shifts whenever I can, etc. Still, I feel a bit awkward about it. 

Beth and I aren’t close friends or anything, but we are friendly and we work together quite a bit. I like and respect her and don’t want to make her feel bad. Also, I know from conversations with her that she’s not super happy working here to begin with (for various reasons, many valid), so I’m afraid this will make her even more disgruntled and could make things awkward.

Should I let her know personally that I was promoted? If so, how do I go about it? TIA!"

I know it's a ""classic"", but I feel stuck and need opinions, inspiration and encouragement.

I have a bachelor and master's in Supply Chain Management / Logistics / Operational improvement, and I've been working in the wind industry primarily and others since 2016. I have a super nice and supportive manager, there are opportunities for growth, as the wind industry is expected to grow, my manager and I are making plans for me to step into a bigger role. So it would be good for me financially. + I am working with sustainability / climate which I care about.

HOWEVER, I don't feel so passionate about it. I feel like it's mostly mechanical. I get bored easily at work. I dislike working with all these systems and processes that don't work. It's a huge corporation and the processes are so complex that I can't even understand them sometimes. Everything feels like an uphill battle, it's stressful and I often find myself browsing reddit during the day.

I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT PSYCHOLOGY and would like to work with people, and help them more directly. For ex, I read psy books in my free time for fun. Preferably as a psychologist, or a coach, or something related. But it takes 5 years in uni to become a psychologist in my country. I'm 28, and by the time I finish I will be approx 34. 

This also means that I would have a very small budget during the next 5 years. But I think i can manage cause I have some savings.

Should I 'get passionate' about my current job and try to find a nieche in it, that I'm interested in working more with?

Or should I go for my real passion and become a psychologist? Or coach?

Please give me some guidance, some inspiration or a personal story if you've been thorugh such a dilema and how it ended up for you. Many thanks!"

My first full time jobs were 5 years and 3 years respectively, which I hope shows I am reliable. I switched fields last year and was laid off after 8 months (so not performance related). I started a new job late in the year that I have been in for 3 months. Its becoming increasingly clear I am in a toxic culture where the people working on the team can’t or won’t work together. Manager is on a different page with projects than the people he manages so there’s no direction or consistency and, as the new hire asking questions, I am caught in the middle.

In other words, I took the first offer I got without fully vetting it and I need out. I put the new job on my LinkedIn and resume.

Since it has been nearly 5 months since my layoff, I am hesitant to take the new job off my resume if I start applying. I also know some places do a background check to investigate past employment and I don’t want to be dishonest about any of it.

What would you all recommend about

1.	Leaving a current job when my last two jobs would show eight and three months respectively on a resume. I would think this a red flag even though my last job was ended not by my choice.
2.	 Selling my current departure if I do it.
3.	 Leaving my current job on my resume v. removing it
4.	Timeline on leaving. Should I wait it out or look ASAP?

So I went with Company A. Took the offer and started last week.

Today, Company B reached out and made me an offer. It's a slightly better offer in terms of pay, and I'm much more excited about the company, the people, and this chance to pursue an entirely new role type.

So I'm looking for a little guidance. 

For starters, should I keep the job I know well, the one that will likely be ""easier"" in terms of knowing what to do, getting it done, etc.? Or should I take on the new role where I'm sure it'll be hard, but I'll learn and grow much more?

However I constantly hear stories about professors not being paid enough for their work (more so teachers in general, though this extends to university lecturers also). Also I have the assumption (I don't know for sure) that it is quite hard to actually make good money as a researcher, since it will heavily rely on how many citations you get (and there are many, many researchers like you, also trying to get many citations).

So in short, is academia really that bad? Could one enter academia and use it as a launchpad for something else, perhaps?

The reason being I had a boss that knocked my confidence significantly and I felt I still had to stay junior. Anyway, now I've started I've realised this is just too basic, I've rebuilt my confidence and definitely learnt some interesting stuff but I need a step up.

The problem:

I've been in my current role 5 months, I am going travelling at the end of next year (non negotiable). I have a possible new job offer on the table for a more senior role, from a company I had previously interviewed. However, if I get it I will only realistically stay there 10-11 months before I go travelling.

Which means my CV looks like
2 years, 5 months, 11 months, travel

Will this look bad to future employers?"

Hi everyone! First of all, I'm not 100% if this is the right sub to post this on, but here goes nothing. I would really appreciate advice as I am so confused and stressed out.

I am currently in the UK, recently qualified as an health care practitioner earning about £50K before tax and am planning to immigrate to Canada next July (marrying the loml – I have visited several times).

However, the one thing I'm nervous about is my job/career. I know there is no way to translate my career there (it would require getting permanent residency, doing post-grad courses here, doing post-grad courses in Canada and the US the IF I qualify then doing 2–3-year degree out of pocket. This is my back up plan, if all fails.

Realistically I want to move on to a different field. Healthcare is very stressful and underappreciated, and the money is not worth this. I wanted to get into research or tech initially, but there is so much information out there that I am absolutely overwhelmed.

Ideally, I want to start my own business in the future, but initially, I'd want a (relatively) stress-free admin or management job with room for progression. Something like policy making, data-entry or even teaching. As you can see there's too many career fields to think about, and that too in this market and economy where Canada seems very saturated. As I've got a couple of years before the big move, I would like to do courses/possible MSc in this time, for productivity. I have seen a few online UK degrees I am interested in (that I’d do alongside my FT Job) but not sure whether this would even be worth it in Ontario. 

Therefore, any advice would be of the upmost value. I don't have a big family or people that I can rely on, I’ve grown up poor and am working class and I feel like my life has been paused due to the pandemic (was 20, now suddenly 24). 

Reading this back, I don’t even know what I am asking lol but if you read so far,

Thank you in advance"

I am 31 and currently on 26k working for a ground’s maintenance company, my hours are around 12h a day and I generally don’t enjoy it, don’t see any career progression and don’t really get on with the other 2 staff. 

I have some experience in gardening generally but don’t want to pursue this as a career as it doesn’t pay well.  
Previous to this I have worked in the building trade although I don’t have any qualifications in a particular trade, I am generally good at handy man and renovation style work but don’t see this as a career path I’m able or willing to take.  

I had a year where I taught trades to teenagers with learning disabilities which I was amazing at because I let it take over my life. I was self employed and the boss offered me a drastic pay cut to go on the books so I had to leave.  
My partner doesn’t currently work as we have a 2 year old so we are living off 26k and universal credit in London. 
I have always grafted and worked - for a long time I worked in the day and delivered for Tesco in the evenings.  

I would like advice on what kind of jobs I should be applying for? I have no qualifications whatsoever, which is a hindrance. 
I would like to provide better for my family but feel as though I’ve always been given the short straw at work, with mainly working for small companies or one man bands.   
I would like to get away from the trades and dirty boots but I also need to earn better money.  I am passionate about the gym but being a PT is a lifestyle choice that I’m not willing to make for the sake of my family. I have thought about social care style work, I know little about this though.  

I don’t have access to any money and we’re broke. 
Has anyone been in a similar situation? Is there a way out?  
Sorry if this seems negative, I’m desperate for better options for myself and my family."

No need to say some cheesy stuff including the salaries, just the focus of the course and what kind of job I'll end up having. I know MedTechs has a focus on chemistry and memorize quite a lot of terminologies and although I did pretty well on my General Chemistry subjects in high school and college, I'm not exactly very good at memorization. I'm also not that good at math. I'm pretty confident of my arithmetic and algebraic skills but anything past trigonometry is a blur for me.

I had been working as a sheet metal worker and welder for around 5 years, and I was with one company the entire time. It was a job I was really proud of, and although this is admittedly silly, I liked the surprise people had when I told them what I did for a living (I'm a petite woman so it caught a lot of people off guard).

However, after 5 years and earning my journeyman status, I lost my passion for the job as a lot of extra responsibilities came with it, not to mention the physical toll it had taken on my body. I had no problem doing the work, but I knew I didn't want to do it forever. I was also tired of the 10-hour shifts and waking up at 4:30 every morning.

I got laid off when work slowed down and decided to try something else. Doors opened up and now I find myself working in an administrative role at a non-profit where I'm passionate about the work I'm doing. The pay is great, my boss is great, and the work environment is good too (fantastic work-life balance).

All good, right? Except I feel lost now. So much of my identity was wrapped up in my trades job, now I just feel like every other boring person working a desk job (no offense to anyone else working a desk job). I'm also struggling with dressing business casual, as at my old job I just wore work pants and hoodies. I don't feel like myself dressing office-appropriate. I'm also struggling with how to relate to my female coworkers, as I spent the last 5 years as the only woman at the company.

I really want to succeed here and be happy with the situation that I'm in, but it's a hard adjustment. If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it.

TL,DR: Went from trades job to office job, struggling with feeling like I lost my identity."

I chose this field because I love helping people/athletes and I love working with my hands, however, the schedule of the average AT does not appeal to me at all (It can be very irregular, covering practices/games/meets/tournaments at various times with little time off or consistency). Also I would be lying if I said the pay didn’t concern me a little. I love consistency, I love routine, I love the outdoors, and I love tasks that are never quite the same and challenge me to figure things out with the skills I posses.

Lately I’ve been thinking of going into construction, welding, or some other trade. I’m not afraid of manual labor while I’m young, as I’m currently a collegiate athlete of moderate fitness and enjoy maintaining a healthy body. However, I am only 125lbs and 5’4” with a small frame. Additionally, I’ve always gotten along more with men than women. Not particularly sure why, it’s just who I am, so a male dominated field is not a concern to me.

Here are my questions:  can this be possible with zero prior knowledge of any trades? Is there a degree I could switch to that would help me out more? Are there possible side gigs I could try to see if this fits me? Would this be too physically demanding for me to also enjoy a very active life outside of work?

Any advice/personal experience is greatly appreciated! Just trying to explore my options."

(Hurray for me!) But I'm already having concerns about my new manager. She has been texting me (yes, texting. My phone is blowing up.) asking me if I have resigned yet, how that went, and asking what my plans are for the marketing program and what kind of budget I'll be needing for the year. My start date is a week and a half away.

I am working overtime at my current job just trying to get my affairs in order before I depart, and I have no plans to start anything regarding the new position until my actual first day on the job. I find her messages extremely disrespectful of my time. No, I have not thought about any of this because I haven't even started yet. I'm not even sure I could offer her any suggestions knowing absolutely nothing about what's currently going on within the organization. I worry that by responding, it's only going to encourage her to continue doing this even after I start and set expectations that I'll be available 24/7, answering emails/texts and doing work evenings, weekends, and on vacation, but I also don't want to ignore her because well, she is my boss, and I don't want her getting any wrong ideas about my work ethic once I do start.

What is the best way to respond to her when she asks questions like this?

Edit: thank you for all your helpful responses! I feel obligated to update you on what happened. I texted her back, letting her know that I would need more information before I could confidently confirm a budget. Later that day, I received an email from someone else introducing me to their onboarding person (to get my laptop and credentials and stuff set up beforehand) and asking if there was anything I wanted to start reading through beforehand, understanding and respecting that I'm still at the other job. My future boss was copied on the email, so I responded I know she was interested in setting up the budget. If there's anything you can provide that'll help me understand what's currently going on, I will browse through it *if I have the time* so I'm better equipped to tackle this when I start. My boss responded back and said not to worry, don't stress about it. You're asking all the right questions and we'll set up some time to go over this when you start. So... perhaps there's still hope she's not as crazy as I thought she was!"

Any suggestions?,u/ElKnox,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1045aho/based_in_nc_currently_full_remote_in_help_desk_2/,careerguidance,"Happy New Year everyone

I'm looking for any other remote career suggestions, while not necessarily in the same field. Ideally something I can transition to within the next 3-6 months.

 I enjoy talking to people and building connections. Usually finding myself getting to know the people I support more than helping them.

Currently considering Sales Development Rep, a better paying help desk company, or software engineering. But being a programmer has too steep of a learning curve and barrier to entry for me. (I have a python cert and projects with python. I've definitely given it considerable effort at this point. Which is disappointing because I love puzzles)

Currently at a fully remote IT help desk job. It pays 35k which is not liveable to me in NC without roommates or in a good location. I'm aware 35k is doable in Mexico, but I want a family in the future. I can go anywhere with my current one. So I'm also open to affordable locations in the eastern time zone that speak English too. 

Originally planned to be sys admin but that job barely seems worth it for the pay to stress levels."

After applying to ~300 applications and multiple rejections I accepted a Data Analyst position making 90k at a well known Major Bank. 

On my first day, I noticed some slight red flags. I have been told there were use to be two people that did the same role as me but both left 2 weeks from each other. Now I am a individual contributor in a very niche role supporting a non technical VP. My team members are also non technical and are just doing basic data entry or are also a non technical manager. There was no onboarding process and I had to manage everything by myself. They assigned me a ""mentor"" that had my position 5 years  ago but moved to a completely different position and division. I haven't even been presented to any database warehouse or anything yet.  

The job description mentions use of SQL, SAS, and Microstrategy. My technical interview was just consist of basic SQL questions that were easy. 

Now today I was assign to help configure Excel spreadsheet using VBA and Macro keys. I have an extremely basic understanding of Excels (pivot tables, graphs, math formulas). I told one of my group's managers I don't know wtf I am doing, and he gave me a line of ""That sucks, go ask someone else to help you."" I don't have a senior data analyst member that I could ask for help or guidance. My ""mentor"" is busy and frequently unreachable. I don't have any internal documentation that I can look up to and they even block stackoverflow. I haven't done any SQL, R, or Python since I came in. I feel like they are looking an Excel expert and I am definitely not it. 

I just feeled highly pressure for an individual role. This is my first big boy fulltime job but I did have a Summer Internship at a different company that had an amazing mentorship, support system, and technology stack. I absolutely enjoy that role and team. 

My mental health is rock bottom, I wake up everyday dreading the commute, and my anxiety is through the roof. I am thinking of talking to my VP soon about quitting. I just don't feel supported and left to dry. 

If I do quit, should I even give a two week notice? Do I just suck it up and hopefully it gets better in the future? I'm alright with going back to applying for jobs but should I even put it on my resume that I work in this position for about a month? I had to decline two other interview invites when I accepted this position.

But now that I've been doing it for a couple of months, I find that I actually hate it.

The problem is, I can't tell if it's that I hate the work itself and I need to start all over from scratch, or if it is the office environment that I hate, and I would actually like doing this job if it were from home, or on a different schedule, or even a different location with different people? And there's no way of knowing for sure... the higher ups at this office are 100% inflexible, and will not allow any work from home, so that is not an option.

Given enough time in a crummy situation, I will earnestly believe that I chose the wrong major, and enter the existential despair of ""I'm stuck with this for the rest of my life"" or ""I'm going to drown in debt in order to start over with something else that I might also hate.""

I need guidance. I'm 26 (F) and have a degree in finance. In high school, I was third in my class, and at university I graduated summa cum laude. I've always been an overachiever and perfectionist, and always strived to be the best at whatever I set out to do. I switched my major A LOT at university. At one point, I was a journalism &amp; marketing double major, but I switched to accounting as that challenged me more. In the journalism major, everyone around me could barely write a paragraph, which was depressing. After switching to accounting, I added a creative writing minor more for fun than anything else. I was ALMOST done my accounting degree, then realized I actually never wanted to do taxes for someone else, so in my senior year I switched to finance... leading me to graduate with a finance degree (four years ago). All that being said, I'm only a few classes away from an accounting degree, journalism degree, and creative writing minor (a few each). I was further off from the marketing major.

My work history: I started as a Property Adjuster at an insurance company that I had interned at in college. I was there for about a year. I then switched to my parent's business (well known fast food franchise), training to become an approved owner operator. I was with them for 2.5 years and worked my way up to General Manager, running a multi-million dollar store. We decided as a family to sell their franchises, as my Dad's health was declining due to a genetic condition. Which led me to my current(ish) job of fine-dining waitress. Basically, my now husband and I moved out of our home state, and we knew we would be getting married/taking time off to go back to our home state for the wedding &amp; honeymoon, so I didn't want a true ""career"" job. However, I ended up making so much money at the restaurant (as it's fine dining and costs a fortune to eat there), that I decided I wanted to keep the job for another busy season.

The problem: I tried to come back to said restaurant, and basically I gave up my job when I left/there's not enough room for me currently to come back. There will potentially be space for me in February when it gets busier. It's not a case of them not wanting me, as I've been texting my boss quite a bit and just went in to see him the other day. He's trying to get me back on the schedule, but there's no room for me without cutting someone else. So... I'm unexpectedly currently unemployed and I really need help figuring out what to do next. I love writing and want to actually have a career I enjoy. I'm okay taking a pay cut from my GM job &amp; current(ish) job to start entry-level in a new industry. Should I go back to school and finish a bachelors in one of the above fields? Or go back for my Masters? I've been applying to jobs I could see myself enjoying, but with little experience in the fields I'm applying (publishing, copywriting, copyediting, events), it's a struggle. I was a copyeditor for the school newspaper in college... so at least there's that. Please give advice!"

I live on Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. I earn 50k salary, plus 4.8% in lieu of benefits, 3 weeks paid vacation, and 2 weeks paid sick time, and usually receive an increase in wage in June each year for inflation. I’m always compensated for overtime, but since it’s an office job, there isn’t much opportunity for overtime. I’ve been at my employer for 4 years. Downsides, no medical benefits, no RRSP matching, and no pension. It’s clear my employer (mid-size firm) is not going to give much more as I’ve requested a raise for the last 6mo. 

I’ve been looking online at other jobs and it seems like I’ve fallen from the higher range to mid range for my job description. Other than salary, I’m very happy with my work. I have excellent flexibility and work-life balance. My work ethic is always praised, I’m quick and efficient, punctual, and have excellent quarterly reviews. 

Would you switch jobs? Would you stay and attempt to negotiate this further? Next year I will hit the extra 1% vacation pay, and will have 1 week vacation added. 

I’m also curious as to what my “official” job title would be. I do multiple jobs which range from answering the phones, greeting clients and other admin work, to processing payroll, calculating and remitting GSTs for clients, and other bookkeeping items. 

As I began to look at potential new jobs, I realized that I really don’t know what role I would fall into. Is anyone out there in a similar role?

I subsequently worked in IT and software engineering jobs for a few years.  In the last 5 years, having experienced 10 years of unemployment, I thought I would try to rectify things and at least make it appear to potential employers that I am not a lost cause.  To this end I read for almost all of a BSc Applied Mathematics and ended up graduating taught masters in EE from a very good school, again with very high GPA - enough to go on to PhD.

After graduating, I took a position as an intern where I was used to free up my manager of some 10 years my junior so they could read theory while I did the work and in fact was used to train them in various aspects of the work particularly the use of test instrumentation.  Another person 12 years my junior was given a full-time job at the company while I was there, doing a job I could have easily done.  I left with some bitterness.

I moved continents and took a job where I was told I would be an EE for a startup company.  The company used me to do some work briefly that was related to some coursework and I was then thrown into some kind of project manager type role which I detested.  This was beginning of pandemic.

The pandemic destroyed my mind further and I moved continents again for a second EE MSc at a highly prestigious school which I am currently engaged with.  I applied for a part time student job, ostensibly to work on hardware, where, as per usual, I had been lied to by the management with the allure of one thing and once the ink on the contract was dry, shoved into some kind of middle-management/project management type deal.  I have since left the role as I no longer have faith in the people managing me.

I have addressed the alcohol and was never drinking in work time anyway.

All I want is to write my thesis and develop a specialism in EE.  Everywhere I look around me and including friends from a long time ago, I see people who were given opportunities and developed specialist skills.

Sure, I can, and do, technical things as hobbies and enjoy them.  Everywhere I end up, though, it seems I am being ridiculed by colleagues and management for not working for this length of time.  It's the same catch-22 situation as I had when I first graduated.  Need experience to get the job, can't get the experience without the job.  The last position I held I deliberately took a low-level training job only to not be given the training.  It seems like a self fulfilling prophesy.

Do I cut my losses and give up now and accept that I will never have a career and just have a job to pay the bills?"

BA in arts; MA in communications/journalism 15 years in marketing; 20+ in performance

**NTLDR**:

Late 30s, senior level career, looking for a bunch of options that fit my skillset and aptitude OR recommendations on finding a ""career counselor"" to help me on this journey. Wild ideas welcome!

My career is a patchwork, mostly in marketing and the arts. Because I'm a jack of all trades, I don't know what to master in next. Either cobble together all these skills into a Super Freelancer or Consultant, or find a path that covers most aspects I enjoy and am adept at? Government or government-adjacent jobs (contractors for example) would be great, self-employed even better.

I'm willing to get another degree and learn a completely new skillset - I love learning new things! That may be part of my problem.

**THE DAY TO DAY** 
Ideally, I want to mostly (60/40) sit at a desk with a clear creative brief, figure out how to best communicate those ideas, create/produce that thing, and get paid in a generally consistent and predictable environment.

**SKILLZ** 
*Master/advanced/senior level*: singing, acting/voiceacting, copywriting, journalism/informative writing, producing, project management

*Intermediate*: graphic design/illustration, performance art, flowcharting, data analysis (no coding), designing surveys, database management (no coding).

**ENVIRONMENT** 
Things I want to avoid: sales, fundraising, convincing people to spend their money; grueling work 365 days a year; ""fast-paced"", ambiguous, quick-changing day to day.

**APTITUDE** 
I also took a couple aptitude tests (123Tests &amp; Princeton) and agree with these results: Creative work - words, visuals, inventive, multimedia Investigative - analytical, explorative, intellectual Conventional - detail-oriented, organizing, administrative

You might say these are completely different and youre right, they are.

I know what the jobs are about, I know basics of HTML CSS and JS (due to studying on a previous Uni-course).


Im here looking for your opinion, what would you pick? And if you did work as either one of these then I would really appreciate your insights.

So pros and cons:

Frontend pros:

- High pay. Remote job opportunities. Not physical. 

Frontend cons: Office life, I really hate office people. Heard that it may be automated (I dont know much about it)

Electrician pros:

- Work with hands ( I like it due to adhd). Almost certainly not be replaced by robots. Huge demand and okay pay.

- Working hours (?), hard on body


As u can see from my question marks, I am not so certain about everything. So I would like your opinions.

What I expect from the comments is everyone saying to go Frontend."

I am feeling a little lost and would appreciate a different perspective on my situation. 

I have 10 years of experience working in Financial and Management Accounting. 

I have gotten bored of this a while ago but kept persisting. Always thinking that the next job will be good. But the sight of another journal entry, balance sheet recs or gross margin analysis kills me now. 

I am currently studying for:
1. AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
2. Disciplined Agile Scrum Master.

I have also looked into:
1. Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Functional Consultant certification 
2. Data Analytics with Tableau/Power BI
3. Business Analyst Certifications from IIBA

Without getting into too much coding. How can I leverage my existing experience and break into a tech career. 
Ideally aiming for a high salaried career down the track after getting some experience.

Since then I have worked on myself and just started looking for new opportunities.
Last week I went to an interview and was selected to start next tuesday. Although I don't particularly like the work area, real-estate, I am currently without any income apart from my husband so... anything goes I guess.

2 years ago I started working in a school. There as good points to the job but I’ll cut right to the bad points because it’s the reason I’m asking for advice. It’s low paid, stressful and I find it difficult to switch off from work meaning that I have chronic insomnia and burnout. As well as this I find my colleagues difficult to get on with. Although lots of people work in the school, I only work with two others. Both are very experienced but they are so disorganised, generally negative and don’t show me how to do the paperwork side of the job. This is important because one of them is retiring in in the next year or so and if they left right now I wouldn’t even know where to start. 

If you’ve read this far and are wondering why I’ve stayed this long, I have just finished my qualification. It was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done but I stuck it out purely because it’s something that can go in my CV to show I’ve achieved something in my time working here. 

I would like a new job in the future, but I’m not actively job hunting. I live in a rural area so well paid or permanent jobs don’t get advertised often. In the meantime how can I leave work stress at work and stop if affecting my life? I’m currently on holiday and not looking forward to going back next week. It’s not that I want to enjoy my job all the time, because nobody does, but how can I think about it more positively?

Any advice is appreciated!

I am court ordered to pay for my children's livelihood, and I can't live with them, so I need to pay for my own livelihood. I also owe about $10k in taxes from two years ago, and $10k on my car that just got repo'd, I haven't paid December's rent and don't have any money for January's, I have $150 to my name. I got fired from my last client on the last day of November. I've worked with him since around 2019. I applied for regular jobs in 2017 and 2018, and was offered many jobs including one by Goldman Sacchs for quarter million a year, but their offer and every other one was retracted because of my criminal background.

In particular, 7 years ago and 12 years ago, I flashed teenagers. That's the crime. I was told it'd be easier to find a job if I had murdered someone, because nobody understands the mental illness that causes flashing, which I don't have anymore and haven't for years. But my name is part of google search now, the entire first page, so I can't escape it.

I don't know where to find clients who would be willing to work with me. And I'm on a time crunch. I am legally required to pay $3k/month for my wife and children's livelihood, and have no money to pay a lawyer to get that overturned, and when I presented my case to the judge he already said no, I will have to pay this or be found guilty of contempt. I also owe about $1k/month in back taxes and other debts. Not to mention needing to afford a lawyer (guessing $1k/month), and rent ($1k) and food ($200) for myself per month. That puts me at $5200/month.

So I figure I need to make about $40/hour, which sounds like a lot but remember Goldman offered me $125/hour which testifies to my skill even if they retracted it for other reasons. And I got many similar offers for anywhere from $50-$100/hour from other companies out here.

I'm absolutely out of ideas. I have very very little time left to get a job before I'll probably be homeless. This is creating decision paralysis. I also have very little idea how to navigate job applications lately. I get no hits on upwork, and I can't work in government/financial/medical jobs because of my criminal record. And I can't find any subreddits where I can offer my services as a software consultant.

I have basically no advertising or marketing skills at all. I've made some software that I think is legitimately innovative and asked for GH sponsors for it, and posted regularly on HN to tell people about it, and it gets no attention at all, not a single upvote ever. And I imagine reddit would be even harder to get noticed on.

I'm okay with dying, I actually kind of prefer it, so if this doesn't work out, then that's it, and I'm done, and I've done my best. But my children need me to provide for them, and I will do everything I can to provide for them. That's my only purpose in life, and if I fail at that, then I'll be glad to go to sleep."

The thing is, omg I'm getting rejected from everywhere. They don't even call for an interview. When I applied for my job as an engineer I got accepted from dozens of places.

I ask for feedback from the hiring people. They usually tell me they're looking for someone who has an experience in management. Somenone more senior.

I work in a small (8 full time, 7 part time) sales focused office, however we rarely to never (maybe 3 times in two years) have unexpected visitors to our office, even expected visitors are at most once a month. 

When I started, I was told dress code was business casual. When I onboard new employees, I tell them dress is business casual. However, this dress code seems to only pertain to the full time employees that work in the office (mainly women), full time employees that split in the office and in the warehouse (mainly men) wear jeans (which is understandable it's dirtier out there). 

Our boss (CEO; we all report to him) does wear button down dress shirts and dress pants Mon-Thurs (jeans for all is acceptable Friday).

We are currently hiring two full time people and I kind of want to ask my boss if there's a reason behind the dress code and if it's something that we can consider loosening. I have worn jeans on occasion and he's never said anything, we have no HR or employee handbook, I believe some of this is the woman that hired me said this was the dress code because the woman who hired her said it and it keeps passing along. 

Any success stories of convincing management to lessen the dress code? Additionally, if you are searching for jobs; does dress code matter? If you are a more casual person, maybe don't have dress clothes, would a job that requires business casual be a turn off?"

For accounting I could attend WGU and do a self paced program for a fraction of the cost but won’t make as much as going into finance (specifically investment banking)

For finance I will have to pay a lot more for school but will make more money in investment banking. But the hours are insane (or so I’ve heard)

Should I go back to grad school?,u/throwawaylifeat30,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/104cim4/work_in_tech_field_with_irrelevant_degree_and_am/,careerguidance,"Heres the breakdown of my situation:

my porfolio:

- 2 years of total professional experience (and at my current job) as a self-taught embedded software engineer
- irrelevant bachelors degree (math)
- was promoted at my current job

my concerns (why I am considering grad school):

1. I am concerned about future. If I lose my job or decide I need to change companies, I'm not sure if other companies would not consider me due to the lack of the relevant degree since it is a highly technical role

2. I think the degree would help me move towards more specialized roles that usually demand for more technical knowledge. The piece of paper would give more validity towards any technical knowledge I've learned, although I know that I can learn a good portion of the necessary knowledge on my own, using internet resources (as I have so far)

I have tried researching but was unable to find a source that relates to what I need, I need some help figuring out what I need to do.

For background knowledge, I have recently moved to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, with my family in March 2021. Things haven't been the greatest and it is time that I search to get a job. My dad had asked me to get a job here for the experience and for some money but I am thinking it would be smarter to get a remote job and work here locally part time. From my knowledge, I will need to get an under the table paying job for myself. With that being said, I have something going that has a chance of making me money which is game development. I've been working on this for over a year and the person who I am working with is offering me $600 usd for a small cut of the game whenever I need. Okay cool, that's less stressful. However, I have no clue what to even do when it comes to getting a job. 

What I plan to do is become some sort of software engineer and take the free Harvard CS course online, I do plan to go to college but most likely when I am already working. I will need help with understanding college as well. I am an English speaker learning Spanish for over 6 months now.

If anyone is willing to share some resources or has any similar experiences, any bit helps.

I just finished nursing school and passed my NCLEX and am looking to get my first job. I'm pretty pumped. I do want to be independent and living on my own, experiencing the world alone.

However, my parents want me to go into NP school immediately and follow my mother's footsteps. They'd say it'd be a mistake to wait and to just get it over with. That'd I'd make double the salary and think of how much money I'd make. (75k+ as a nurse. 120k as a Psych NP). Most people say wait to get a couple years under your belt as a nurse and shoot for it.

The smartest strategy to save money and time, would be to go to school full time, and work part time as nurse, stay at home, and get it completed within 2 years. I'd be around 27-28, finally leaving the nest.

Also, another problem is, I graduated with a 2.8 gpa and for most schools, there's a minimum of 3.0 to be able to get in. I'd probably have to work to get them to give me a chance, retake some courses, etc. It more than likely, would not be an easy route.

There are also schools that'd let me straight in but they have a reputation of being diploma mill schools accepting anyone with any gpa. I saw some say that'd it'd be pretty hard to find a job after school and I'd always have that reputation of going to a ""Shitty diploma mill""

I'm not afraid to work hard to do whatever it takes to get to a 3.0 or get into a reputable school, but it just seems like an uphill battle and I'm just so ready to live my life. I don't want to spend all my 20s in school and start my life in my late 20s-early 30s. I understand that I'll have more money but at the same time I can't help but to think, at what cost? I'm extremely tired of living at my parent's place.

I just don't know what to do. It just feels like I've been fighting for so long against myself and my past mistakes. I know if I never get that NP, I'll always feel that guilt and judgement from my parents and they'll be quick to let me know saying ""It's just that we want the best for you"""

 B.A. in geography, and I'm almost done with an M.A. in History.

.
.I hope your new year has started in an appropriate way and that you are well off.
I'm about to start my law degree in a German university soon and wonder how I can achieve my ambitions.

As every other students i must write 2 state exams later on. The first after 9 semesters and the second after 2 years clerkship. When I'm done with these, I have the option to get a Master of Laws as well. I would probably take it.
My problem is I need to decide on subjects in a few months and it might be difficult to change afterward. Most fellow student just do what they are most interested in or which class is easy to pass, and then look after they are done where they could fit in, but this is no option for me atm...

I am looking forward to start a career in the private sector, maybe as legal counsel. My dream would be me working for a tech or science company with a vision. But I would be okay with other fields as well.

I know there are theoretical options on working anywhere as a German lawyer, but also that only theory is nothing to build on; I need some practical inputs as well.
Maybe you guys know what kind of experience is expected from somebody with my plans. What could make it easier for me to start soon after graduating?
Does any of you have experience with foreign Lawyers/Attorneys/etc. working abroad in the USA or even other non European countries?


I wonder which classes I should take to reach my goals. Maybe you can help me a little out.

I am working a minimum wage job and also have a debt which my father took.I have been trying to get girls since I was young but all I got is rejection. I can't afford fashionable clothes, shoes, hairstyle, tattoo, any car etc. I have never had a girlfriend or a female friend. I am sexually frustrated at this moment because I still can't get any girls at this age. Girls only date with guys who are drug addicts, abusers, aggressive, have rich families etc . I literally have 0 chance with any decent looking girl.

TLDR; All of my friends, neighbors and classmates are now already married to super hot girls without even going to gym and some of them even have kids. I am way too behind than them. They do not invite me anymore because I still don't have a wife or a gf and also no car so we have nothing in common anymore.

No attractive girls like me. I tried to approach one pretty girl in neighborhood but she refused to even talk to me. I tried to approach one cute girl at my workspace but it seems she just wants to avoid me no matter how nice I am being. I tried to talk with girls at nightclubs but I realized that they ignored me and they were literally laughing at me and making fun of me. I have never had any girlfriend. I never get matched with slim and pretty girls on dating apps.

Can you guys help me? Do you guys have any tips/suggestions about how can I improve! Please suggest me some pills or creams to look handsome like other men. Going to gym is not changing a single thing, I am also taking testosterone tablets and protein powder to look masculine and they are helping. I have never even touched any girls in my life. I have lost 40 lbs in last few months but I still go to work and gym by bus or walking and NO GIRLS date me because of that.

I feel very jealous when I see a girl and a guy are happy together and that I still can't get a single girl at this age. Most people also asked me to improve my personality but I'd still say I am being so nice and friendly to girls and treat them with respect. I have never disrespected any girl in my life. Everyone is saying I don't deserve a PRETTY girl because this is how it works.

I recently started listening to advice by *Andraw Tate and he's asking to not be nice to girls and get 6 Abs and Make Money in order to get Girls but I think I will at least take 5 years for that"

I don’t know if this belongs here…


Hello, I’ll like some advice about what to do with my career. 

I’m studying photography in a small school. It’s three years and I just finished the second. Early in december they told us that the school was closing due to financial problems. 

They said that we could get a title for the two years we made or stay this year but would be two days of classes a week and during the rest of days we’ll focus on the two proyect that would be done during the year. And the money to pay would be less. 

I was told that with that money, I could instead take courses that would focus more in the area I want to do (wildlife and landscape). I think i like that idea. And meanwhile, i could work. 

To be honest, my dream is to find a job in america or maybe in Europe something that has to do with photography or maybe as an assistant to a photographer, but maybe for that I have to work and get better. Actually, I can’t wait for an opportunity to work abroad. 

So what do you think is best? Staying in school i would do only for a sense of responsibility, but i think i want to focus on the area i want and earn extra money. 

Thanks for reading x"

When I was 23 yeas old, I graduated from English department. I felt satisfied with my TOEIC test score. I thought the score of 920 points should help me land on a decent job. But I was wrong. For one thing, most of the local Taiwanese did not speak English, hense there was low demand of learning it, for the other, even if there were job vacancies, the pay was extremely low, to such a degree that I felt humiliating. In the end, I was offered a cram school opportunity that only paid minimum wage. I rejected it, and then began to think about learning computer science.

Now I am 30 years old. I am going back to gradschool to study computer science. I wish to hear from you that whether becoming an intern in my age is a strange thing? Or is it perfectly acceptable?"

First thing, I’m an active duty right now and I’m getting out of the Navy in 2024 July. I found out Booz Allen Hamilton is offering a fellowship for 12 weeks through ‘Hiring our Heroes’ and I’m VERY interested in joining the program and hopefully they satisfy with my talent and get hired by the company. I never had a civilian job before, so I was wondering if there’s any training or resources that offered by Booz. Something that will benefits me in the future when I apply for the company. 

Basic background of my career is, Bachelor’s in Data Analytics at Syracuse University and working as a Logistic Specialist in the Navy (working as a financial manager/ analyst). Serving in the Navy over 8 years, obtaining Secret Clearance, currently working with Naval Special Warfare ( Navy Seals &amp; SWCCs). 

Because of my current job in Navy and my Degree (graduate in Spring 2025), I figured Logistics Analyst would be the perfect position to apply after the fellowship. 

I’m just trying to find a way to make myself better before I get out, so I can be ready for any obstacles I’m about to faced. Sharing your advices / knowledge with me would be very helpful!

Thank you in advance!"

I have been working for myself doing gig work on multiple apps since the pandemic. I lost childcare and had to do something more flexible than my old job as a fast food manager. This past year though I decided that especially since I'm getting older I need to get back in with the larger company where I have benefits and backing in case something were to happen with my vehicle. And also want to set it up to where I had a predictable paycheck and then I could supplement the rest of what income I need with gigs. The problem is that most of my work experience before being a delivery driver is in food service. And these places really just do not want to pay a living wage. I was offered $12 an hour to be a manager at one place and $13 to be a manager at the job I just started. First day of course I'm thrown to the wolves but it's not rocket science so it's not hard to catch on quickly. I see a lot of health code violations. There's not really an organized flow it's just kind of get in where you fit in and you can tell that the skeleton Crew that was supposed to be training me was used to doing all of this by themselves. The manager wasn't giving direction the store was just kind of running itself while the manager was stuck in the kitchen making sandwiches with her husband literally. And they cussed each other out for much of the time that I was there. It was really just a nightmare. Also I can make more doing delivery. I really lost money by being there. To make matters worse the manager talked down to me as I was leaving. I made a small mistake that probably could have been easily corrected but she decided to snap at me and scold me as if I were a child. That really made me just not want to go back. In the interview when the GM hired me he said that the store had a lot of problems. I kind of want to talk to him today and share some ideas; some things I think could help. But on the other han,  for what they're willing to pay, I don't think it is enough to deal with all of that and help him fix it. I kind of want to stick it out just because I don't like to burn bridges but I also kind of want to run away screaming. If it were you what would you do?"

I'm looking to pivoting into Supply Chain, I'm currently working in Food Safety and Operations QA role.

Part of my job is-
After performing audit, I'll record the gaps; create a workaround; outsource tasks that cannot be done internally- find suppliers, talk about our requirements, talk about the costs and terms of payment, Get an approval for PO from co-founder; schedule and execute the tasks; followup with my finance to Ensure the payment for vendor.

I don't know where does this duties fit in a supply chain spectrum.

Additionally, I've a 1 year PG diploma supply chain degree and MBA marketing degree.

My current challenges are:
1) When I lookup for job postings the employer require a lot more than whatever I'm doing- guide here.

2) What's the trick to survive in a Supply Chain area? 

What drives an employee? Should an employee be thinking about costs all the time And make decisions based on it?

I'm my current role as QA, I think and connect everything to Food Safety and Hygiene to ensure the products are safe for consumption. We have SOP, SSOP, work instructions, training teams to do that. Similarly, in what point of view should a guy think and connect all the time in a supply chain business?

3) Apart from V lookup what else do you recommend looking into in Excel?

4) Advice if have anything else.

Please mentor me, I'm struggling to have a career and in mid 30s already.

(M25)",u/jobdecisionta1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/104l5sz/job_opportunities_at_opposite_sides_of_the/,careerguidance,"I've been presented with two job opportunities. One in Ontario (where I currently reside) and another in British Columbia.

Before I get into the jobs, **a bit about myself**. I graduated with a B. Com in Accounting. I do not enjoy the profession. I've done 4 jobs in the past year in Accounting, ranging from AP to bookkeeper to general accounting. I find the nature of work redundant and tedious. I am still unsure if I want to pursue my CPA but currently don't see many other opportunities for a better career path (which don't require a complete 180 in terms of education).

The **first job opportunity** is working as a Jr. Accountant with a salary of $55,000. The job is mostly remote with 2 visits to the office a month. Most of the job is AP, with a few analytical aspects.

The pros of this job are the fact that I'll be living at home, and saving 80%-90% of my paycheques. Remote jobs are extremely rare now (at least with what recruiters have told me, and the past 2 months of interviews I've done). I save a lot of time being able to work from home, compared to the past 4 jobs which were all in the office. 

 The cons are I'll be unmotivated within 3 months. Doing AP again is mind-numbingly boring and I mostly take these jobs for income. I'll also most likely be continuing my CPA studies. 

The **second job opportunity** is working as Contract Admin. with the government of BC. This job is paying $50,500 with $11,000 assistance in relocation. It is 3 days WFH and 2 days in the office. This job is a balance between AP and admin work. 

The pros of this job are that it is a government job. I've been told that government jobs are safe and secure positions for people who want a work-life balance. There is the opportunity to move around once established as a government employee. 

The cons of this job are that it's in an expensive province. The cost of living is high and rent alone will eat 50% of my salary after tax. I'll be locked in for 2 years due to the terms of assistance in reallocation. I'll be losing out on all the non-monetary facilities of living at home with my parents. I would bring a friend along who would cook, clean, and take care of the apartment for me but I would be financially responsible for them as well. 

I think I'd be going to BC with the hopes that life there would be a kick in the ass, along with some exposure to moving up or around with new opportunities. Whereas here in Ontario, I feel so unmotivated with the opportunities that are presented to me and being in the rut of living under my parents roof."

Rejection after rejection. Obv I’m the blame - it can’t be the market place or external world. Honestly I feel super down — thinkin with all my education nd 2.7 years of experience how am I failing this badly. I’m hardly sleeping and hardly wana be around my family. I’m extremely discouraged - leading me to Reddit - first time actually using/sharing my “current obstacle”. I don’t mean to be a downer but lately life has punched right in the mouth.

Initially we all helped out with a few tasks outside of our role here and there. I took over a few things temporarily in areas I wanted to expand my skillset in with the goal of going for a promotion. 

Over time I am now the only person in my department who is expected to do all the responsibilities of my initial job and several outside of it. Some of which were handed to me without training or even telling me I was supposed to be in charge of it until deadlines were missed. 

I outlined all the additional tasks I do and the data of how it has helped the company and in the process realized I am also the only person in my department actually delivering on all of the initial job accountabilities. Out of the 10 or so listed I do 10/10 + an additional 5-7 while my co-workers only do 6-7/10. 

I met with my bosses and presented my case asking for a promotion and was denied. I am feeling frustrated and disappointed because I was doing 60-80 hour weeks for a long time hoping to move up in my field and now years after starting I am left with the same job title that doesn't reflect all of the work I do for the company so it feels like time wasted.

I checked my contract and it does state that they can change the responsibilities of my role as needed, but I have definitely been given way more than my peers in the same position and the responsibility of what should be at least 3 separate jobs. I am newer to the job field so I didn't see some of the red flags when I applied but will definitely be cautious of these things going forward. 

I want to be reasonable because I obviously can’t just immediately drop all the additional responsibilities and I don’t want to throw the rest of my team under the bus or burn any bridges. However knowing these tasks won't lead to any sort of path to promotion or moving up in my field I don't want to continue them further.

Short of leaving the company entirely is there anything I can do to either get my title to represent my work or drop the additional responsibilities without pissing everyone off? 

 If I do leave how can I reflect the work I do in my job title on my resume without lying?"

Chat Gpt: It can be difficult to communicate with loved ones, especially when they don't seem to understand how we feel or what we want. It might be helpful to try to have this conversation with your parents again, but approach it in a different way. Instead of just telling them that you don't want to be a doctor anymore, try to explain to them why you feel this way. What are your current interests and goals? What other paths do you think might be a better fit for you? It's important for them to understand where you're coming from and why you feel the way you do. It might also be helpful to have some ideas about alternative career paths or educational options that you could pursue instead. You could also try writing a letter or email to your parents explaining your feelings if it's easier for you to express yourself in writing.

me: That is the problem, you see. I myself am lost. I don't know what my current interests and goals are. I don't know if i want to find a career in science or if i want to change streams entirely. Sometimes i think might make a good psychologist, sometimes a biotechnologist and sometimes an air hostess. I don't know why i feel the way i do. I was a studious kid until 2019. After the pandemic, when everything went online, i couldn't really focus and my performance went downhill. I am so stupid that i couldn't comprehend that i can not study the way i used to and took admission in a coaching institute so expensive. I feel so guilty about wasting my parents' money and their time on me. I feel like I'm a disappointment or so i will be after the exam. I don't feel comfortable to talk about this to anyone as I've already talked with the people i trust and they all gave the same advice, ""Give it your best."" What they don't understand is that i just can't. When i feel like crying whenever i open a textbook, how can i just study well? When all that guilt is grasping me in a hold so tight that I'm suffocating and have almost given up, how could i just study well? Nobody seems to understand me or my thoughts. They all seem to just give superficial advice and false hope. I feel like I'll be crushed under all these hopes and expectations of everyone and never make out alive.

P.S. - It told me to seek professional help from a therapist after this."

I’ve noticed that 25-ish hours is the sweet spot for me in these jobs.

My current job is very flexible and sometimes I don’t work for days at a time. At some points as much as a week of not working, but it generally averages out to 25 Hours/Week.

BUT during those breaks I work on side hustles and given that I get a week off. I can sit and work on those for 40-60 Hours in that week. And feel invigorated after the week is over. On weeks I don’t have off, I still regularly work on side hustles for 15-30 Hours/Week.

It feels ridiculous. It feels like I SHOULD be able to work a standard 40 hours at a normal job. But I can’t hold those jobs down… at that pace. Sometimes 25-30 hours can be too much. But self employment kind of stuff, I can do it for so much more time, even with stressors and a day job. 

It’s weird. I just can’t make sense of it.

I Can work full time+ on my own time?
I Can do a part time day job and part time side hustles?

1,2023-01-06,Advice needed. What can I do post a chemistry baccalaureate and 5 years of semi relevant experience?,u/riddermarknomad,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/104nf9y/advice_needed_what_can_i_do_post_a_chemistry/,careerguidance,"Hello,

I  have a bachelor's in chemistry.  I've been working in my first career  job around the NYC/NJ area for over 5 years in a non-pharmaceutical,  non-quality assurance position—the position I am in is more like  materials testing for a raw chemical supplier for manufacturing. I  simply don't make enough and I have stopped learning on the job after  two years.  I have become stagnant and complacent.  I've also become a  little resentful towards the field and chemistry in general.  I may have  stayed at this job too long and I feel increasingly desperate to get out.

I can't leverage my  experience as much.  I haven't garnered advance skills or projects and  the area I am in is mostly pharmaceuticals jobs.  It's like I have put  in the years, but there isn't enough substance in it.  The recruiters  that have contacted me, on the surface, had job offers that would seem  like a good transition.  Once I am in the interview with the potential  employer, it seems I fall short of their expectations.

Anyway, I have thought about three possible options for myself so far:

1. Take an entry level job for a pharmaceutical based job.  Work my way up again.
2. Get a master's in something advance and adjacent to chemistry and leverage that education and my 5 years of work experience to get a higher paying job.
3. Change industries completely.

I  will have to get a pay cut with one, but at least its something new and  I will be learning again.  With two, it's an investment of money I  don't know I will have enough of.  Also, it takes time and I reeeally  want out.

As for three, I have been dabbling in programming since the  material is easily accessible online and I can practice.  There are also  training to work programs that I can try and get in.  Those carry two  year contracts, but I will get paid during training so its the shortest  route too something new.  I also thought about going into clinical laboratory science, but like number two, it requires schooling.

I am not  asking to be rich.  I simply want to have an apartment by myself and not worry about bills.  I may have fumbled my career but I am willing to do  something about it.  Can anyone help me by providing some perspective?   I am open to suggestions."

however, it appears there’s more of a demand globally for software engineering. even just via usa jobs or craigslist for korea you can find software engineering posts. i really don’t want my career to tie me to america but also if ux/ui interests me more and checks almost all the boxes could i pursue it and figure that out later?

should i learn both at the same time? i.e. do a software dev program and teach myself ux? then i have the security of a program for software dev if i want to go abroad and ux design doesn’t work out for that. or i can be more competitive with two skill sets?

i would really like to live abroad in asia, and esp korea or japan. but it appears at least neither korea nor japan have a ux/ui scene. is it just in america?

should i learn the language well, attend the job fairs, learn how ux design is there, have a great portfolio, and hope i’m good enough to hire over a native if i go with ux design? i’ve seen some ppl do that online. and i won’t be someone who puts in bare minimum effort into their portfolio, have just one case study, etc. 

or apply to international companies based here and hope i can do a rotation abroad?

like does it make sense to pick software engineering based on perceived international demand? i do like computer science, just not as much as ux."

Now, I really enjoy coding! It's a lot of fun to me, I'm fairly good at math as well. The pay is decent once (if?) you break in. The current economic downturn seems brutal though ... and there's no predicting of when it will end.

I like medicine. I'm probably not quite as good as sciences as I am at math, but I think I could get into med school. The stability of medicine and landing a good specialty is unmatched. Prestigious job, people respect you, more extroverted which i think is nice. Also, you can make amazing $$$ living anywhere in the country. Software, you'd be much more limited to HCOL big cities.

Now, if you told me I'd make the same amount of money at either job (and a good amount of money), I'd choose Software engineer in a heartbeat. But longterm, medicine is probably going to make more without a good amount of luck.

Any advice from people further down the line? I didn't think this one decision would cause me so much stress and pressure, it's difficult picking the one thing you want to do the rest of your life ... but at the end of the day, I know work is just work.

Edit: Wow! I didn’t expect such a response as this. Lots of incredible advice here and things to consider, thank you to everyone who is weighing in. I think for now, I’m going to follow the CS route. I know I could always reattend med school later if I wanted.

3 months ago, I received a promotion into a new department and role. The role has a bigger impact and I get to work with more senior leaders in my function and more pay. However, I am feeling overwhelmed everyday. The department is pretty new, I have no idea what I am doing and there is only 1 other person reporting into me who is quite junior. My manager wants me to hire another person in a few months.

I feel like a fraud everyday and because I can work remote 60% of the time, I end up wasting time because I have no idea what I should be doing. My manager is too high level at this point, he has several departments under him. I need to setup framework and structure, create a vision, strategy, and roadmap, and basically setup the department. 

If this was my old role, I can do it no problem because I have 10 years of experience in that field. In my new role, I am clueless and you can only Google so much. It’s causing me a lot of stress, anxiety, and I feel like any minute I will be found out for being a fraud and fired.

2,2023-01-06,May I get some advice?,u/bloodwolfgurl,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/104tc0d/may_i_get_some_advice/,careerguidance,"To start, I'll point out I was raised poor, so the only places to study I could only go to, with government aid, was community colleges. There is nothing wrong with community colleges, of course. However, when I was young my parents moved us a lot so I could never stay in one school. I could never figure out what to study. I'm 34(f) right now and work at a minimal level job, making not even enough to fully be able to buy food, with little hope for the future. 

I've recently grown to really love and respect plants, herbs, and foods in a medicinal way of it. I would love to study herbology or botany, maybe homeopathy, to study how foods and plants can heal the body and maybe even help others with problems that may be treated naturally. The problem is, I don't know how to go about doing that. I work just about all day, I come home tired, and I have no money. How would I begin studying that path, and which do I choose? Then, if I do study it, where could I get employment as someone just out of school?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I'm kind of used to going 120% all the time. Now that I'm in a new paradigm, I literally don't know what to do with myself. I don't feel right. There was a time at this new job where I had to work 65-hour weeks for a month and that felt better to me than working 30.

Currently, I work as an analytics director at a company where--

* Salary is decent, around $170k base with a decent bonus--probably make $210 total
* Work fully remote
* Pretty good work-life balance; I work around 30 hours a week, have around 6 weeks of paid vacation a year
* Very supportive team and leadership

I'm thinking about leaving though because I'm bored. I only work 30 hours a week because, honestly, I don't need to work more. Plus, I'm betting I can make a lot more.

But I'm only going to save the money and I could easily see myself getting into a high-stress job.

Any thoughts? Am I being greedy/short-sighted?

\[Edit\] Sounds like the consensus is to ""enjoy what you have"" and ""take the extra time to continue to develop"""

I  am taking a career break next month which will last about 6-8 months (I  can study a software in the meantime and develop some other job related  skills). I am not looking to go back to previous employer once back  working.

Does anyone who did this before can give me their recommendations, in general, but also specifically about:

\-  I am concerned about my limited negotiating power when I will be back  on the market. I am not concerned about my skills, just that as they say  'it is a lot easier to look/find a new job, which you have a job'. Any  recommendations on this? One idea that comes to my mind is to not be too  picky with regards to the 1st job I will get when back, then if they  are amazing - good, if they are not very good, start to look. (if it  matters, my top priority in negotiation will be as much work from home  as possible and ideally 30 days of vacation/year either paid or unpaid,  maybe work 4 days/week, the key point is: salary won't be an issue).

\-  At my latest job I had some mental health challenges where I had to ask  some reduce working time and increased work from home while I fixed my problems. The problems are now fixed and they liked me in general until I  have had to ask for some support. However, I am concerned that if the  new potential employer will ask for references, I will get a negative  reference from them (and from my second previous employer as I left them  again due to some mental health challenges). The most recent employment  where I am sure I will get a good reference is from 6-7 years ago, if I  give this reference to the potential employer, I expect they will get  suspicious?

How usual is it for  employers to ask for references? In particular after a career break? If  it may help, or not help, I will also change country during these 8  months.

Edit: if it is useful: structural engineer with 10 years of experience."

I live in the south of France, I'm a 22 year-old male who's still living at my parents' house, so no rent to pay.

For information I am a seasonal worker in the south of France, I have already had several companies interested in hiring me for 4 or 6 months in 2023, so I will find work within 2 months at most.

I was hired as a receptionist in a hotel 10 minutes away from my home.

&amp;#x200B;

The interview went very well, it lasted more than an hour and I was promised things. A rotating schedule, a fixed salary payment date and also 3 days off per week.

&amp;#x200B;

I started 3 weeks ago and it was a cold shower.

&amp;#x200B;

I was told several times that I was taking too long to manage the reservation files.

I was asked to clean the rooms even though I am not a housekeeper.

I am also responsible for unclogging the sinks and toilets if they are clogged.

Finally, if I am asked, I have to weed the small garden of the hotel and also clean the swimming pool.

&amp;#x200B;

Until then I could manage it, after all you don't leave a permanent job like that, especially at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Since 2 days I got my schedule for the coming year, I work every weekend from 1pm to 10pm, I never work in the morning although it was not planned.

I was supposed to be paid 5 days ago and it's still not the case...

My colleague and I found microphones behind the office.

Of course I'm not paid more if I work on weekends or on pubic holidays.

My boss doesn't pay the bills of the companies that give the food and drinks we give to the customers, in results multiple times a week we have the police calling us to talk to our boss.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, my colleague whom I loved and who also saw what was wrong in this job tells me that she will leave in 1 month.

I will be alone with my boss to manage the reception.

4 people left in 4 months because the atmosphere was bad. My agency doesn't send anyone there anymore because everyone is leaving for ""depression"".

&amp;#x200B;

I was very happy to have a permanent job not far from home and to get out of the seasonal system where I work 6 months and I am unemployed for the next 6 months.

I am still in my trial period so I can leave whenever I want, I have 3 weeks left before it ends.

After this date I will have to leave a 2 months notice and I think that no other employer will wait for me 2 months if he wants to hire me immediately.

Each time that I tell this to one of my friends or family members they all tell me that I should leave before being locked-up for 2 more months...

&amp;#x200B;

Td;rl: Many red flags at work, should I leave?"

I ended up starting my masters in Social Work this fall and I am already having regrets. If I don’t want to burn myself out, I’ll have to extent my masters to 3 years and I am currently going to school in a different state. I really want to get back into HR, but I’m not sure how, as a lot of entry level positions require recent experience and internships require someone be pursuing a degree in HR, though I already graduated. 

I’ve thought of finishing off the first year in the MSW program, and while doing so, seeking temp positions or approaching organizations and asking about being a volunteer HR assistant to get experience. Once I have more experience, I hope to transition into a full time HR role and pursue the SHRM certificate. 

Is this a solid plan? Seeking advice."

I have an MBA and Masters in Finance and Economics. I am located in the US (Midwest) and make about 65k a year in entry level management position at an international organization.

I am thinking about getting an online Doctorate in Business Administration for a couple reasons but am concerned about the cost and return on investment.

My reasons are upward mobility, becoming a professor or adjunct professor in the future (when I get sick of the private sector or just want to try something new), developing greater knowledge and skills, and the overall enjoyment of learning. 

I’ve worked full time through out all my college and will do so for this one as well if I pursue it. I know I would probably do it if it was free but the cost is going to at least double my student loan debt it looks like it will be at least 40k. Also it will take a lot of time and would like to have a kid or two at some point. This would interfere with dating which I suck at anyways mostly because of lack of effort.

After that I want to learn another language as well. I almost feel like something is wrong with me like who wants to work all day than study some more but I do enjoy learning.

I feel currently like I am in a lower position then I am capable of doing and most other people in my position are fresh out of college with a bachelors degree and 10 years younger. 

So random internet strangers that I can’t verify anything about is this a sound decision for a single 36 year old without kids who lives on his own? Thanks for your thoughts in advance."

I’m currently on mat leave and when I was 5 months pregnant, I was placed on a PIP for the way I filed emails in a shared inbox… after I had been doing so for a year and a half. I feel like my pregnancy caused an inconvenience for management so they tried to take proper, necessary steps to push me out. I had GD (Gestational Diabetes) so I had more appointments to attend. Also, due to the pandemic, I was given instruction to WFH (for a job I could easily do at home) by my midwife. My boss threw the midwife’s letter back at me and said that a midwife isn’t a real doctor and had no right to tell him what to do. Things went sour quickly with the company once I told them I was pregnant. Two months before I left (and hadn’t provided notice, mainly due to GD and didn’t know if/ when I was getting induced), they hired a replacement without my knowledge or insight. They made me train her and then got upset when there was nothing for her to do since I was still working. The best part? My replacement was under the impression that it was a full-time, permanent position and she mentioned that management said the position was vacant. I don’t plan on returning but I’m scared that the looming recession will eliminate my job (although I feel like my replacement will stay put). I live in Ontario, Canada."

Went through the interviewing process and signed my offer but wasn’t set to start until another couple of months. They’re asking me about booking my trip for orientation.. Is it okay to back out? Would this be on a job record? I have not done a background check.

I’m confident in my job and I do enjoy working with kids for the most part, but I’m ready to spread my wings and fly to bigger things. Thing is, I don’t know if I want to become a classroom teacher, a school counselor/therapist, or if I should leave education and go into administration. 

My job is pretty stressful as is, but I do enjoy the breaks I’m guaranteed. Right now, however, I’m not paid over those breaks, which puts a lot of financial strain on my household. Also, I’m on the fence about becoming a classroom teacher because I don’t like having to yell at a large group of kids. The stress of my work is what makes me consider administration, but I feel like I’d get bored with that, but also the pay increase without having to go back to school is alluring. Alternatively, I’ve had success working with kids who have IEPs, so part of me thinks I’d be good in mental health/SPED too. I don’t know if it pays any more or just the same as a TA, though. 

I do have a BA in English and a minor in linguistics, so I’m not entirely without education. I just don’t know which career path I should pursue at this point."

Having a hard time, as most entry level jobs pay significantly less than what I currently make.

In terms of industry, I genuinely don’t have a preference. I’m okay with an office job or manual labor. I feel a bit aimless and kind of just want to be given some options for what I can do. All my interests are side hobbies of mine, and I don’t necessarily want them to be my living.

Willing to do any level of education provided it's a fit for me. Here's some stuff about me:

-I'm extremely extroverted and love talking to people regardless of how close I am with them
-I specialized in STEM subjects in high school but still enjoy and excel in the Humanities and Business (not sure how that would translate in the real life)
-My weakness is with History and Geography :(((
-I'm not the strongest, so practical jobs may not be for me
-Did and love public speaking (Debate, MUN) but will absolutely not go into politics
-People call me a leader both in and out of the classroom/workplace setting
-I guess I would be more logical than emotional
-I'd rather my job not be monotonous and have something new everyday
-I'm not necessarily outdoorsy, but I would be ok with travelling or hiking for work
-Salary is somewhat important to me because while following your passion is nice paying for bills is necessary
-I am extremely indecisive and have had several ""plans"" in life, yet none of them have really stuck with me

Here are some jobs/fields I thought about doing but none of them fully stuck (for now at least):

Medicine, Math, Engineering, Business Administration, Health Administration, Astronomy, Writing, Geology, Forensics, Mortician, Art, Music...

I thought because a sporty person i would love the content of the classes since my only motivation was because I wanted to be a elite athlete and it would help me training more.

After failing my exams 2 times I noticed that it wasn't my laziness of not studying but my lack of vision and goals in the field that was the problem. I want out of here.

There is 1 problem though. I'm afraid to tell my parents about it because they work really hard to finance my education, it would shatter all their efforts. On top of that they are super competitive and want me to always be better than my friends and cousins so telling that I want to do it again from 0 won't be the best thing to hear for them.

Hey All,

I'm relatively new to Product Management (18 mo) but have 15+ in FinTech largely with the same company. My roles have spanned across regular CS support, tech support and the majority of time as a Sales/Integration and engagement manager. The PM position and most salary roles has 5 different levels (pay grades which are 1-5) and I'm current at the 2nd highest. I enjoy my current job and have a great team I work with and am making macro differences which is a goal I had made a few years ago. The job is really demanding though and I work with teams across the globe so it's not uncommon to have late night/early AM meetings aligning with teams in APAC or etc. Burnout is definitely something that happens here.

One of my longtime co-workers in the company created a new team called Launch Management about a year ago. This is a position where a person is assigned to the most strategic marketplace/partner deals for about a year with the main goals of reducing time to integrate, supporting merchant adoption of this feature &amp; working with product to ensure deals being worked on are aligned with product roadmaps. It's also a promotion so I'd be in the highest pay grade before moving to a director type role and they are offering a 20% salary raise to boot. It's also a natural role to move to director as my co-worker is looking for someone to prove the team's value and eventually take over the team as director if things go as expected.

I also have a special needs kiddo so work/life balance is important as well as earning funds as we're trying our hardest to ensure there are no obstacles for him if he were to outlive me or my wife.

My question is if you're a recruiter or outside the company, what I want to avoid is a decrease in my marketability. Product is well known and has a ton of different roles and responsibilities. Launch Management isn't a common position and to me seems like a project management role or a step down. I do have the ability to influence pretty much every space in this company if I move to the new role vs just the segment I own but I can't get this thought out of my head that I'd have less responsibilities but getting a promotion and more $$$ making the position prone to being laid off. What are your thoughts?"

I'm about to choose my university major/subject.

I have a huge interest in the healthcare and medical field, and Biology was always my most favourite and interesting subject during my school years.
After doing some research, I found allied healthcare professions (eg. PT, OT, nurse etc.) the most interesting field in the healthcare industry. 

However, I would also prefer something with higher income/salary potential, and I know I.T/CS offers opportunities to earn higher salary compared to allied healthcare professions (PT, OT, nurse, etc.)
But I don't really enjoy programming, and CS-related topics don't really interest me. 
But I do know I have the potential to do academically well in any subject, but obviously the 'interest in the subject' will be missing if I do choose I.T/CS.

Now should I consider something that will lead me towards allied healthcare professions, which I will find interesting, or rather I.T/CS just because it provides higher income potential?

To sum up: 
Should I consider something that I find interesting to study and perform the job?
Or something that I don't find much interesting to study, but it offers higher income potential?"

I am currently working a day job in a film/TV adjacent company but it's not where I ultimately want to be in the future. In my free time, I am doing an unpaid internship with a notable figure in Hollywood whom I will not name. It is obviously an amazing connection to have but the internship itself is very exploitative and, well, illegal due to me not being a student and not receiving credit from it. My internship boss is not the friendliest and can be very critical to her many free interns who provide skilled labor for her. Recently when I was applying for grad school, I asked her to provide some letters of recommendations for me which she initially agreed to and did provide a few but then later refused to provide the last one because I was not doing as much work for her during my applications period (because I had less time to spare). I handled the situation pretty well by remaining professional and we eventually worked it out and I am still on as an intern but the situation left me feeling pretty unhappy. The internship workload isn't unbearable but the treatment I am receiving and the anxieties towards ruining the connection really takes a toll on me. I am trying to decide if it is worth it for me to stay on longer as I know I'll potentially need her help in the future for a TV show I am developing.

Others in the industry have given me mixed advice, older folks tend to encourage me to stay and 'pay my dues' since it is the nature of the industry which I understand. I'm just not sure if I want to keep getting taken advantage of for the mere chance of getting somewhere with this connection.

so i’m having a little bit of a dilemma here. i am currently working as a cna in a hospital part time tuesdays and thursdays (24 hrs/week &amp; weekends) but got another job recently at another hospital where i am prn (as needed, but i can pick up shifts whenever i want and are more likely to get bonuses) and i have 10 credit hours in school. however, because i am doing pre nursing i’m taking pretty hard classes MWF, in the morning and I have a night class on Mondays and Wednesdays as well. now, i have assignments due on the weekend as well as pre exams due on the last sunday of every month. my scheduler scheduled me every single last sunday of every month for this semester (my first job). 

most of the people i work with are in school so it’s pretty hard to get these shifts covered because everyone’s pretty busy. so what I’m wondering is if i should stay working these two jobs or quit the first one and come back in the summer because im only taking one class in the summer and it would fit my schedule so much better! i just told my boss i would love to stay but i am unsure now because i looked at my syllabus. i just really want to do well this semester so any advice is greatly appreciated!"

I have no complaints for my current position. Work/life balance is amazing and the pay is alright for a young man like me at 24 an hour. Although now I have more than myself to think about. My gf and I are looking to start a family soon. While my gf does love me. She is a lot older and makes a LOT more money than I do. She has recommended trades to me and I have always thought about being an electrician.

My question now is, is there a way for someone with no background experience to join a union for a position around my current salary? Another inquiry I have is, am I cut out for this big change? I’d like to hear from other electricians on what it takes to be a successful one. Do I need to give up my work/life balance? Should I get used to the idea of 4am drives to sites.

Also, no one really cares about how much effort you put. All they want results and google is not so kind as it changes its policies every new day and it’s hard to impress that little two eyes (G 👀 ggle) search engine. 

If i foresee into ten years, it’s hard to imagine where I would be and I don’t want to live in uncertainty. 

So what would you people suggest. I have other plans like 
Learn illustration and design 
Or marketing. 

These two professions I feel I can learn, work and upscale.

1st in person meeting soon. We all fly in. 

I went through a very amicable divorce in the last year. I am mid 20’s. Most of my coworkers are 40+.

I haven’t shared that I divorced, mostly because I like to keep things professional and I don’t know what gossip, opinions people would have.

but inevitably at this meeting some will ask “how is your spouse?”

I’m tempted to just say “great” and keep the conversation moving.

Am I making too big a deal of this? 

Being open could lead to better connection, and less stress. But could spark judgements and gossip.

Being private protects my emotions but may be stressful.

Anyone have experience with this?

Am I overthinking this?

Update: 

There was some confusion here. I anticipated the obligatory happy hours and company dinner would be the situation where personal conversations were had (as that was my experience last year) my co workers talk lots about family, so it just comes up naturally.

None the less, thank you all, you confirmed my gut instinct to keep things private at work.

I’ve been a small engine mechanic for the last 10 years.  It’s a small shop, just three of us.  It’s not exactly a high paying job, but my boss has done well for himself.   

However I hate my job, I have for a while.  I think the 6 days a week has just ran me down.   But I’ve been doing it so long, I don’t know where to go from here. As I just don’t really enjoy the repair side of things anymore.

So I started school, figured mechanical engineering would be an industry I’d do well with my experience, and I’ve been using AutoCAD since my sophomore year in highschool.  I still use 3d printers and design stuff.  I also love electronics and have always wanted to get into the robotics side of things also.  

So the issues.  I have a lot of school to do, but I also work 6 days a week, I’m a father and own a house.  So I have a lot of responsibilities.  We can’t afford me to work less.  I’m also important to my work, so taking more time off is hard to do.  My boss has been nice and letting me leave early 2 times a week. My boss is also flexible if stuff comes up, which is really nice. 

However I’m in a bad place, at this rate it would take me like 12 years to get a degree. Maybe 8 if I start doubling up classes.  So I would be 40 by then.  

The easiest option would be to find a new job.  And I’ve been thinking about it.  There’s one major drawback though.  My boss is getting older, he’s now like 65. And he makes references on occasion about me running the shop in the future. We even talked about me buying it in the future.   He was sold the business by his boss is his 20s.  The business isn’t a money maker. We have some busy seasons where we can bring in 20k a month.  But there also a lot of opportunities to grow the business, my boss is just at an age where he’s not really interested in that.

So I’m at an awkward point.  I know the business and industry well.  But there’s also risk in taking over the company.  But I don’t feel comfortable giving up that opportunity.  My boss doesn’t do much repair, mainly running the front and things like warranty/parts/scheduling ext.  

So I’d love some advice.  I could always run the company and continue going to school.  And just move slower for now.  Then I would make my own schedule and hire people to make up the lost time.  Or I could give up the opportunity and find another job where I can focus more on school. 

Curious what people would do in my position.  Having a source of income while being my own boss and going to school seems like a great idea. But that could be 10 years from now, or 2 years. I will add my boss isn’t tech savvy, we still run windows 98.  Pretty sure half of my bosses day could be automated.  But he doesn’t like change."

I am currently finishing my master in micro and nanosystems. Before I did a bachelor in electrical engineering. I am currently in a bigger tech company for an internship and started to question which way to go.

I have big goals and looking for the best path to choose. I want to push advanced technology forward. The thing is, I am not sure if research is a thing for me. One thing I realized is how much I hate the fact, that you invest, so many hours yet get so little progress.

I am someone who needs change. I have to add that I have ADHD. This makes it harder for me to do the same kind of things over a long time, as it starts to get boring.

These are the paths I have in mind right now, but maybe you have some other ideas ?

1. Stay at the company right now and do my PhD there. This would lead the path of research down, though.
2. Go into sales as an engineer
3. Consulting
4. (Start Up) It may be an option but the stuff I am interested in is really hard to do in start-ups"

Long time lurker.

I’m in Canada and currently in my province there is a really long wait time for specialists, and then there is an allotted amount of time necessary for therapy. 

My question is: when I’m able to get back into the workforce and if I’m asked about why I took awhile to start looking for work, what can I say the reasoning was? How can I word it? I’m not apt on right out of the gate sharing my mental health conditions as there is still stigma surrounding them."

We live in an area that was hit a lot harder by inflation (one of the largest spikes in inflation over the past year; &gt; 10%). 

Her level of responsibility isn’t much and they recently lost someone who was in this position. She assists them directly but she can’t be assigned a project. This benefits her when there’s work that can only be done by the person assigned that project. 

The other bs is this is somehow a salary position but they still track their hours to be &gt;40 even though somehow OT doesn’t kick in until 50 (I may be a little off but my bs meter is flying high). She’s never under 37 but also never over 40. If she’s at 41, she leaves an hour early the next day, etc. 

For the new position offered to her, the same guidelines apply except when there’s a deadline they’ll often be forced to stay an extra 3-10 hours once or twice a month. If there isn’t an ability to leave earlier for the month then they’re SOL. 

She wouldn’t need further training in the position either as she’s exposed enough to know the role already. 

The typical pay is like $40-45k with some people somehow earning $50-55k. A former HR person who works there told her to email them asking for $45k. She’s at $36k for her role (very flexible and no direct deadlines or responsibilities) and they said they can only go 10% above. Which is obviously bs since this is a new job and not really a raise. A position that the company wouldn’t spend money on to find, hire, and train her for. 

Question is how should she phrase it and how much should she ask for?
Here’s what I have so far:

Good morning,
After further consideration, I found that the market rate for the new position being offered to me is more consistent to [$45,000] for our region and my level of experience. 

As this is a position change with increased responsibilities and not a raise, I cannot accept the new position for only a 10% increase in pay — especially when factoring for the spike in inflation our region experienced this past year. 

- And then I was thinking about including more info on how they wouldn’t need to train her, etc. but I’m not sure if I’m pushing it. 

- also should she ask for more than $45k? Over the last year, rent for many people increased by over $400 and this area really was hit harder. I just don’t want to give her advice that ends with them calling her bluff"

I am 46.  I just spent the last 11 years with an employer that I actually really loved.  I started looking for positions outside the company because when Covid happened, our branch office closed and I found working exclusively from home to be really very isolating and depressing, and also because the company I worked for went through a merger in which a lot of my job responsibilities were given to a manager from the company we were merging with and that guy really had absolutely no respect for my contributions and took it upon himself to appropriate many of my work responsibilities without my consent purely based on the fact that he had the title of manager and I did not.  I searched our company's job openings extensively throughout this time period, and the company was only interested in hiring people who could work in person at one of our two remaining offices, both of which were on the other side of the continent from me (I have a child with autism, I cannot uproot my family at this time).  So reading the writing on the wall, I applied outside of the company.  A friend of mine (who used to work with me on the same team at the first company mentioned above) mentioned that the big corporation she was now working for was hiring and I went through an online hiring event for them.  I met with a recruiter through zoom one day, interviewed the following week, and by Friday I had a job offer and I accepted.  It was very scary for me since I had just spent the last 11 years with one single employer and it had obvs been a long, long time since I had to start over, but the salary was within range and my thought process was that this corporation was a multi TRILLION dollar company and if I didn't like the role, I could always post out to the literally thousands of job openings that they have open on any given day.

Fast forward 6 months later:  I hate this job, I mean vehemently hate it.  when I was hired in august, they made it sound like I would be doing XYZ, but once I got there, it was a different story.  I spent the first month doing nothing but keeping myself busy with online trainings and attending meetings, and I thought perhaps business was just slow and things would pick up as I went along, but 6 months later, I'm still doing nothing but online trainings and trying to find ways to keep myself busy in between the one or two ""official"" emails I put out to my department each week.  Two emails, that's it, that's my job.  At my previous job, prior to the new manager barging in and taking over my responsibilities, I was taking care of XYZ123ABC555666, in other words, I was busy busy busy most of the time, but this new job, I literally have no daily tasks, no daily chores, nothing to keep me busy throughout the day, which probably sounds really amazing to some people--getting paid to do nothing--but for me it's a fate worse than death.  I'm bored, bored to absolute tears, and I've gone to my ""manager"" (fun fact: this person presented themselves as the hiring manager during the recruitment process but as it turns out she's only been there 6 months longer than I have and is \*not\* a manager and is, in fact, the same pay band as I am) and her manager and complained loudly about this but their answer is always ""you're still new to the firm and getting used to things and we don't want to overwhelm you"".  What makes things even harder for me in this situation is this new employer pays on a 15 day cycle as opposed to 10, and I was basically living paycheck to paycheck before and this 15 day cycle makes everything so much worse, and when I'm sitting there doing literally nothing all day, I can't help but feel like I could be using that time to DO something, to make money somehow, but I can't do that because I have to spend my time sitting in a chair at work with no access to things like youtube or social media, I feel like I was literally hired to just SIT in a chair to meet some sort of tax quota or something.    


So my bottom line question is, has anyone else experienced this phenomenon recently where it feels like they were ""collected"" like some sort of doll or Funko pop to just sit on a shelf somewhere and if so, what did you do about it?  this is a very, VERY large employer so I do have other friends on the inside who have told me to go to HR about this situation and try to get another position within the firm, but now that I'm on the inside and I can get a good look at all the open positions they have open, none of it appeals to me.  I thought by taking a job at a much, MUCH larger employer like this, there would be more opportunity to learn new thing and pick up new skills, but technologically speaking, this company is woefully behind and every single last job opening that I see (and believe me, I read through them every day), are job openings specialized to that company that don't really present an opportunity to learn products that may be useful to employers outside of the firm, if that makes any sense.    


a little something I'd like to add about this company's culture:  We work hybrid (thank goodness), so we are only in the office 3 days a week.  During those 3 days, most of the associates get into the office sometime between 8-9:30 or whenever they feel like it and then leave between 4-6.  When my coworkers get in (typically around 9:30) they'll say welp, I forgot my coffee this morning I'm going to walk over to starbucks (which takes about 30 minutes round trip) and by 11:30 they're ready for lunch, then they just randomly leave around 4.  Nobody puts in a full day at this place, if they do, then they're an exec or a product owner or someone on a food chain higher than me.  they regularly take 30-45 minute breaks throughout the day.  Sounds great, right? but the managers kind of excuse by saying ""as long as you get your work done, we don't care"" - well, I don't have any work to do, so I feel like I can't really follow these same kind of habits because I don't have anything to account for my time.  Sorry for the super long post but I am just beyond frustrated with this situation and I have no idea what to do other than apply apply apply outside of this employer."

However on the day I was to leave for said college I got my diagnosis and my doctor said I would only get worse so I should stay for treatment.  What followed was about thirteen years of physical and mental health struggles as well as a pretty serious addiction to narcotics. 

I have now gotten my illness under control using herbalism and I've been sober for 5 yrs. I'm married to a wonderful man. I work about 30 hrs a week as a budtender and really enjoy helping people. 

I'm trying to choose a career that I can do part time that doesn't require extensive schooling. My interests are literature and languages, herbalism, holistic health care, and the outdoors. I would like to make a positive difference in other people's lives somehow. I'm very lost on what to do or how to go about making a decision. 

I've considered going into phlebotomy as the classes are not long, theyre affordable, I could work part time and help people. If I'm honest with myself I don't think I would enjoy doing this.

Does anyone have any ideas on what a good career would be for someone like me or how I could go about getting some advice on where to go from here ?"

I am extremely fortunate to qualify for disability benefits, but this is quite a tenuous position to be in due to the dynamic nature of my disability and the significant flaws in the system. It also makes it absolutely impossible to get on the property ladder but also makes renting an issue - nowhere will accept me without a guarantor, and my dad (my only option) is retiring in the next few years which will make him ineligible.

I ideally don't want to leave my current area for a cheaper one as my entire support network is here and it's also close to the only hospitals equipped to deal with my health issues, but I will if absolutely necessary. I could live off £19.5k per year.

I recently took a career test and of course it is all in specialized fields that i have not had the funds or time to be able to attend school in order to achieve.

I had a solid plan when i was younger to be a pilot and was on path to do so until i was injured on the job which mitigated me from holding a medical cert for commercial flying. Life drastically changed for me then as i could not pursue my dream and ended up having kids and becoming a single father.

I am stuck in 9-5 office work that is monotounous and draining. I am looking for advice on anything i can do to change this as moving away from this area is not on my list of things to do displacing me away from my kids. My ex is not the best at all, essentially no co-parenting or compromising has ever been on the table with her. Very controlling and manipulative.

My career outline essentially lays out i am an ""Inventor"" i have a lot of great attributes but have not found a place that helps harbor this for me.

I started studying electrical engineering when I was 18, but I grew up not liking it (even though I passed everything with an 'ok' GPA). So I switched majors and am now pursuing a double major in Computer Engineering and Data Science.

I originally studied Hospitality management and obtained my degree, but have decided to change my career towards something I am more passionate about which is branding/marketing specifically within the sports industry.

Two years ago I moved to Dubai to work in one of the cities most luxurious hotel's. Given the nature of my position in the hotel, some luck and handwork I have been able to save quite a good sum of money. As for right now I have about 30,000 euros and expect that to be around 40k to 50k in the next months. All of it in savings.

My original plan when coming to Dubai was to save enough money to pay for a master degree in sports marketing (20k) and from there start my career in what I want to do. During this time I also did an online master in marketing (ThePowerMBA) and have been working on personal projects related to marketing and sports on my personal time. This projects specially have proven to be what gives me the most satisfaction and peace. They combine the two things I like most: sports and creative work.

Now that my time in Dubai is coming to an end and the moment to move back to Spain and do as my plan originally intended, I have doubts. I have to add that during this time I have also helped my family through a financial struggle. Even if things are calmer now, I still feel slightly guilty of paying that amount of money for a master or anything else really.

The question now is: Should I follow through the ""right"" path and pay for the master degrees (20k) as it will bring me contacts, guaranteed internships and better insight of the industry? Or should I perhaps use that money to develop my skills in content creation by traveling the world, buying new materials (drones, cameras, etc), joining classes, volunteering in sports programs?

Just to add a few things. Before anything I will speak with my family to have a better understanding of the financial situation and see what is really needed. As for now my content creation is good in the sense of ideas, but the quality of the work can be brought to a higher level for sure. I will also be using the additional money to invest in a long term plan to take care of my future as well as having money on the side for emergencies and stuff.

If it changes anything, I am 24 years old and come from Spain. I would ideally love to work either for sports associations (Premier League, MLS, La liga, etc) or companies such as Nike or Adidas. 

I appreciate any advice or insights you might be able to provide me with.

Thank you"

My boss mentioned to me in my performance review back in December 2022 that he fully supports my career transition within the company, but it turns out that I completely misunderstood that. 

So fast forward, I applied for 2 job reqs internally and was notified by the HR that I need to reach out to my boss and HRBP for an approval. HRBP told my boss about it and he was not very happy (yeah I messed up big time). We talked for a bit and basically not happy that he was blindsided about it and told me that it doesn’t look good that I’m jumping to another job after 6 months.

It took almost 2 years to find a job and I finally landed one in June last year. Currently I work in marketing (media planning) not something I really love and I was disappointed in my salary offer 45k which is hard to make do with in NYC. 

Anyways I am interviewing for a job in the music industry finally and I was just told the salary range and they said 40k to 45k. I’m disappointed because this job is more what I want to do but I’m already struggling at that pay level. I would take it but because of the pay it’s also not a job I would want to stay at for long and now i already have a job on my resume that im pretty sure I won’t make it to the year mark with.

Do you think it’s worth taking the job for more experience even if i only want to stay there for a few months?

The benefit of my current position is I work for a HUGE advertising agency so there seems to be more stability however I don’t really like what I do. Would you stay and wait for a better opportunity or take the position in music?"

While I love my job right now (great W/L balance, great team, etc.), there is a feeling that I am stagnating a little bit. Some of that is on me; there is a ton to learn here but I've been here a while and part of me just wants something new. I work for a very large corporation (50k+), and my new position would be with a much smaller company (\~200) in the same industry. So, definitely more risk moving to the smaller company if there were to be a downturn or something. 

Some specific numbers:

**Salary**: Base salary would be increasing by **23%**

**Bonus**: Currently I have a **20% target**, historically it hits around **15%,** based on how well company does. New job would only be **10% max** which is more performance based. Obviously 15% isn't guaranteed, but the past 6 years have been decent, despite the market downturn.

So purely from salary standpoint (base + bonus), its a **21%** difference. So barring all other details, I'd leave for that... but the benefits of my current company are really good.

**Current company 401K + Discount Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP)** \- **6%** match, and **15%** discount on up to **10%** of base salary + bonus. New job would only be **4-5%** 401K match, no DSPP... even then technically there is no 401K plan now, but there will be one in the near future... supposedly. Accounting for these benefits, the raise from old to new job is now only **16.8%**. (Assumes the 401K match actually happens)

**Current company vacation** \- **24** days + **10** federal holidays. New position would only be **15** days + **10**. 

New job pays **100%** for medical. But current job is pretty cheap. with the HSA $ they provide, medical is only costing me **\~$800**/year. So not a big deal.

Minor benefits: Current company pays for my cell phone. Nice meals paid for every so often (2-3x per month), access to company suite in sports arenas, etc.

So yea, in summary:

**Pure Salary Raise: 20.75%** based on some assumptions on the bonus, but I think they are safe assumptions.

Include retirement/DSPP perks: only **16.8%** raise TC

Vacation: (I heavily value vacation time) so lowers the raise to **14.4% TC due to losing 7 days vacation**

Medical: Raises the **Total comp to 15%** raise with the new job since its Free.

So on paper, 15% doesn't seem worth it, but wondering if anyone had insight of what I might be missing here. Obviously the new higher salary would be great since that becomes the new floor for future job moves and negotiations. One thing to note as well is that current job allows hybrid office schedule, while new job is 100% office. For the few days of the year that I utilize this, having hybrid schedule is nice because I can work remote while on vacation in a different city.

**Second question would be, how should I word an email/discussion with current employer on how they might raise my current salary to stick around?**"

Im wondering if I should remove it from my resume so it doesn't look bad. I can fill the time gap but Ive been thinking that it may not look good, nor does it fit with the industry Im trying to get into. The only reason why I keep it is because a lot of the daily tasks match other jobs.

Hello, first time posting here. I recently graduated with my bachelors in applied physics, and have started getting involved in the job market to build relevant experience and learn new abilities. I went to my first real job interview the other day, I matched the credentials really closely, and the position appeared open to entry level candidates. When I got to the interview, I was met with pretty detailed questions, some entry level stuff and some higher level course stuff aswell. The interview was definetly structured around quick recall, and quickly became overwhelming for me. I performed exceptionally in college, and even managed to graduate second best at my university. The interview did not go over well in my eyes, as some of the content had referenced courses I had taken over a year ago, and my memory does not function to recall specific theory or equations at a moments notice. The entire time I was in school I was always taught and directed towards utilizing availible resources and reference material to problem solve. It felt like my first real exam without a formula sheet if that makes sense. I want to get some advice from old heads aswell as successful graduates in the job market. Is there something I did wrong here, or is this just standard interview process? Everything they had asked I would've only needed five minutes with Google or notes to recall and implement effectively, my ability is there, I just can't perform well with these quick recall focused interview questions. I feel gutted to be honest, and would appreciate constructive feedback or a relatable experience, thanks!"

Hey guys, first of all i wish you a happy, healthy and - according to your definition of success - successful new year! I am German, so sorry for my English. Hope you’re able to understand everything.

I (27 M) urgently need your advice on how i should keep going with my career and everything.

I don’t have a degree yet. After high school i went to Spain for a year working in childcare, then after that i fell into a really bad state of mental health, couldn’t get up to do anything, was lazy unmotivated etc. When i finally got up again i worked low paying dead-end jobs and started a side hustle as a self employed photographer and filmmaker. The business grew, i took out a loan which i should have never done retrospective but i did and it left me with about 30k in debt  when the covid and restriction times hit me really hard. 2021 i got a good paying job at an auto supplier company, working hands on machines in the production of exhaust systems. It wasn’t my dream job and i didn’t even like it but it paid for a good lifestyle and i finally felt i got my life together, travelled a lot and ofc spent a lot (this was stupidly more of a priority than paying back the loan i took). I also started a Bachelors Degree in Media Psychology besides the 40h work week job at the auto supplier company. Everything went great, so i felt. Well, until i got sick with Covid in November. At first it was just one week, kinda like having a flu. But it stuck with me till this very day in form of „Long Covid/CFS“. I therefore got laid off of my job and good main income at the auto supplier company which also paid for my BachelorsDegree in Media Psychology at a private university with 300 bucks need to be payed each month. Since i did this part time alongside my job i am only in the 1st semester. Nowhere near to get into a potential job. I’d really like to pursue a career in UX Design. I am currently official registered as non-viable. 

Any advice? I don’t want to be 28,29,30 years old looking back on how i should have/could have kept going but didn’t due to lack of foresight.

Again English is not my mother tongue so excuse me for misspelling and poor sentence construction.

Thanks a ton in advance guys!"

I don’t want to leave my current role, I work remote, have a good relationship with my team and manager, and have a very healthy work life balance. With this new role I’d have to commute really far or move. I don’t think I plan on taking the job because I am happy and sacrificing my happiness for money is not worth it for me .

I brought up a raise a couple months ago and they said they wouldn’t be able to offer me one at the current time. I’m debating letting them know about my current prospect and using it to leverage my salary another 20-30k. I don’t  want to risk my reputation here though. I don’t think I would be let go because there’s another position in my department that needs to be filled ( not urgently ) and it would be difficult to fill my role and put a lot more stress on my boss.

As title says, I’m a 30yr making low six figure at a large financial institution, i live in a fairly low COL area. I work with risk models and data, mostly doing python development related work. (Not a software engineer)

I’ve been contemplating on where to go next. Honestly this job is decent, no crazy hours, sometimes not even 40hrs a week, occasional stress here and there but nothing major. Benefits just average. But I feel like I could try to leverage my experience and skills to make more than I do right now, or maybe that’s a delusion.

Question is, what type of position/industry should I even look for next? I’m not interested in becoming manager, not that I have the managerial experience anyway, as I mostly do dev work and although that does include some project planning/leading or mentoring very junior/external resources, it’s not significant. 

I’ve recently passed the AWS solutions architect associate cert, trying to learn about the cloud space and how that might help add value to my data and dev experiences, but  don’t have any cloud experience and it’s a deep rabbit hol, so I’m not sure how far i want to go in. Was thinking maybe the data analytics cert next.

I’m not that ambitious, would like just a senior position (between a junior and team lead right now) with hopefully a higher pay (same is OK) and most importantly a remote position. totally open to learning new tech/skills if there are any hot skill markets, altho not sure if my current experience will be relevant.

Any advice is appreciated, TIA."

Hello, I am looking for advice on what I should do to get started in a career. I am currently working in manufacturing and have been taking operator jobs off and on for about 2 years. I'm looking to break out of the manufacturing industry and start with something new. Ideally, I would like to start in a career field that doesn't necessarily require a college education from the get-go, although I'd be open to figuring that out down the road. I'm also hoping to find a more independent and office based role without any physical labor. I've been looking into Insurance and Real Estate sales as those seem to be the best option for making a decent yearly salary with good benefits. The only issue with those jobs is that it would require a sizable amount of funds to start, and is usually commission based pay.  I'm not in a position to take too many risks with finding any opportunities now, but if anyone knows about those fields or has experience advice would be appreciated. 

I've also been looking into other opportunities that might be applicable: Voiceovers, Management (starting off smaller and using experience), transportation services, professional cleaning/remodeling service, etc..

If anybody can give me ideas about what jobs have high enough pay to consider dropping weekly checks and $20 hourly, whether it be commission or project based. Also, would be a feasibly easy job to start without any prior education aside from licensing. 

I am located in Minneapolis, MN and hopefully will be able to use some of this advice to jumpstart my career path by this summer. If you've taken the time to read all this and leave a response I highly appreciate it, and I hope that this post can help others in similar situations to me."

Been job searching for almost a year with little luck for any career jobs. 

I thought that if I put all my effort into really good projects I’d be valuable and be connected with places or this is in my back pocket when I network with companies, hospitals, or clinics as I was told it would. Or I’d gain more seniority in my previous roles as a kinesiologist and strength coach. Put my heart and soul into my project and only thing I have to show for it is health issues. All roles I’ve landed are roles that don’t respect my education, treat me like shit, and pay $20 an hour w/o any chance to grow (PT assistant and kinesiologist). I can’t live on that in Canada. 

The only professions I can make a liveable wage on with my education/knowledge is as a physio or professor (I researched chronic low back pain). I definitely feel some regret for my masters as I can’t get a job directly out of school with it and the number it did on my health. I’m too burned out of working in clinics and I’ve networked with every college health program within a 2 hour drive and nothing (did take my resumes though). I’m not married to my specific field anymore, especially knowing it’s a rough time for the field right now and kinesiology is a field most people leave and I’m just so burned out of it. But I’d like to stay in health sciences/care especially as I see marketing my masters is less about my specific topic and more about my general field and transferable skills.

I’m looking at doing a masters in public health and still staying in health sciences but away from kinesiology. But I have 0 idea what to do in the meantime. I’m just so burned out of networking and not having what people want or being told they’ll take me in 2-3 years once this recession is done. Any research jobs or education or health sciences/care roles I can do in meantime? Feel very stuck."

My mind wants to, my body does not :( I am 22, and even now I can see the effect prolonged sitting is having on my body (stiffness, slight lower back pain etc). A lot of my hobbies involve sitting, although I also enjoy weight training and hiking.

 I have been working out since high school, but understand that an hour of working out will not undo the damage of sitting for 8+ hours a day, even more so as you get older.

 My father (retired) has had a desk job his entire life, now in his fifties, he is more like 75. constant pain everywhere, prone to injury. (No exercise, but eats very healthy). 

My mother (retired), who has worked a non-desk job (hotel), and cooks, cleans, goes to the gym/stays active still almost feels like her college self. 

All of us eat extremely healthy, it is more than likely that the sitting did my father in. 

Would it be right to assume that one must chose between learning or one's health? 

If it came down to this, I would definitely choose my health, but also, what about the pay? 

I am really worried, how can I make a decent living without having to be sedentary all day and ruin my health?

1,2023-01-06,Am I crazy to reject medical school acceptance and what would my options look like if I chose not to go?,u/stealthstoic2552,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/105cdzc/am_i_crazy_to_reject_medical_school_acceptance/,careerguidance,"I am recent U.S college graduate who has been accepted to a couple of medical schools including my state school. This seems like a dream come true in a lot of ways since the state school is fairly prestigious, offers in-state tuition (~$30,000/yr), has given me some scholarship ($10,000/yr), and keeps me close to my girlfriend, family, and friends.

Since learning of my acceptance, I have been playing devil's advocate with myself by researching many other potential career paths. My hope with this all was to validate that medicine is still the right path for me by reading all the bad things about it and all the good things about other careers. That being said, the more I read reddit, the more I grow concerned about what I am getting into. It seems like other roles like software engineering, SaaS sales, or really any career in tech offers many of the things I would like (high salary, location flexibility, intellectual challenge, ability to make a real positive impact on the world, entrepreneurial potential) without all the downsides of medicine (delayed earnings, insane hours, mistreatment from coworkers and patients, being used by insurance companies and hospital execs).

As far as my ""resume"" goes for any work outside of medicine: I graduated with a bachelors in biomedical engineering. I took some coding classes and only did alright in them (probably because I was more focused on excelling in my premed classes). I do not think I have nearly the same aptitude for tech/computer science as I do for medicine, but I do still think I am good at it and with time could even be very good at it. In my current lab, I often find myself helping all of the biology/chemistry bench scientists with technical, computer, and IT problems. For example, I helped in updating the LabVIEW code for a perfusion system in our lab. Despite me being a bit more of an introvert, I also like to think I have a fair amount of leadership experience/social acumen and think I would do good when it came to technical sales and/or managing others 

I do truly have a passion for medicine and especially combining medicine with technology. Still, I don't know if that passion is worth the risk of losing my hobbies, my health, my 20s, and my relationships. I also know I have really only discussed the bad side of medicine and the good side of tech.

Am I being an ungrateful little whelp with a case of grass is greener mentality? If not, what would the next steps look like for me to break into one of the aforementioned jobs? My guess is that it would mean some type of coding bootcamp, masters program, or mass applying to any tech startups/companies that would hire me. I know that that is an opportunity costs of its own. If I went this route, I also would like to try and stay where I am at if possible (Southeastern Mid-sized city) and work mostly in MCOL or LCOL areas throughout my career.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated and sorry if this question tuned out to be a big ill-defined rant."
1,2023-01-06,What jobs/careers combine healthcare and engineering?,u/miscmiscmisc91749,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/105cfvv/what_jobscareers_combine_healthcare_and/,careerguidance,"As title says, what are some jobs/careers that combine healthcare and engineering? The main career that I can think of and that I've read about is a prosthetist/orthotist, which is not quite a physician, but someone who works in the healthcare field that meets with patients that need prosthetics and/or orthotics, helps design the prosthetics/orthotics and fit them to the patient. I do really like the idea of this (and prosthetics is the original reason I went to college for a degree in biomedical engineering), but I also am interested in other options that may be out there. 

I am open to careers that require and/or recommend more education (i.e. master's, certification, etc.), and at this point, I'm assuming I'll need to continue my education for the direction I'm headed.

Some background: I graduated in 2021 with a degree in Biomedical Engineering, and I really enjoyed my major. I had a bit of a dead-end job that was supposed to be closer to a Quality Engineer role but really wasn't, so I left after about 9 months for my current job, which is a regulatory specialist for a small (11 total employees) medical device company. I don't mind the work, but it's very much a desk job and am bored beyond belief. I'm paid well, the hours and work are reasonable, and I have a great boss. 

I signed a contract when I started that because the company is paying for more training for me, if I leave before the end of the contract term (4 years), I'll have to repay the cost of the training, which would be close to $20k by the end. This is fine, this gives me a lot of time to figure out what I really want to pursue for a career and potentially start working on a master's degree or other type of education that I may want/need.

Another direction I am considering is going the route of a Physician's Assistant. 

Any and all thoughts/advice you have are much appreciated! Thank you :)"

2,2023-01-06,"Should I chase money in something I may not like or be good at, or chase a risky feel-good career that I may not like or be good at?",u/ThrowThinkAway,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/105cofs/should_i_chase_money_in_something_i_may_not_like/,careerguidance,"The higher paying fields I could possibly jump into now that I'm out of college but unable to land a full time job (albeit requiring likely further education, self-teaching or even going back to college...) would be an area in tech, programming, computer science, or IT. But the problem is it's not really my passion. I don't wake up everyday wanting to code or learn new technology and such. I use a lot of technology... as a consumer, but not as a creator or someone naturally interested in learning it.

Now, can I tolerate it? Questionable... I get frustrated easily by programming even though I was decent at programming during my Business MIS degree, I'm not good at math, and I'm also concerned if I would be able to stand IT and the inherent need to deal with potentially disgruntled customers/clients. 

Meanwhile I like random and mundane things like anime shit, fluffy dogs, reading books, being an advocate (before I suffered burnout anyway...) and... being kind. At least, that's what I ***think*** I like right now (admittedly I'm not in a great mental space). 

... but none of those are really employable where I am, or at least not sustainably. I live in a HCOL in the Bay Area that essentially guarantees poverty or borderline poverty level if I were to try going for your altruistic, feel-good career (e.g. teacher, artist, animal technician, voice actor, musician, self-employed, writer, etc). There's a great deal of risk with any of those fuzzy warm ""passion"" jobs, and it's especially concerning that I could one day burn out (like I did with nonprofit volunteer involvement and leadership) and have it all wasted. 

I'm also not *already* skilled or talented enough as an artist or musician who started at the age of 13 that I could feasibly stake out a career with it. It would take years if not over a decade of practice to become ""good"" enough, and there's plenty who are way more talented and younger than me who still don't ""make it"" with the creatives, so I certainly wouldn't be able to put any bread on the table without enough skill and luck. 

If I chase money in tech, I can surely live sustainably here and also pay for hobbies, have a real impact through charity and such for things I care about. But am I really willing to go 80-90,000 hours for the rest of my life going down a soul-draining path I may regret? If you've heard of ikigai, well that's a problem... there's not much that I love, not much that I'm good at, and no overlap with what the world needs, or what you can get paid well enough for. People say don't pick a career for the money or you will hate it, or go for your passion, but I've heard plenty rebuttals like making your hobby your work is a good way to kill a passion, and money can buy you relief from worry. 

So what is it? What do I do? What if I really don't have a passion or know what I can be damn great at? What if I have no real way of identifying the right intersection of natural interest, developed talent, tolerance of the cons in any career, leveraging my natural strengths, and financial prospects that can result in a good fit career?"
2,2023-01-06,Is the corporate world worth it? Especially starting in your 40’s?,u/wisertime07,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/105corj/is_the_corporate_world_worth_it_especially/,careerguidance,"So, I started out in the engineering field, but have slowly drifted toward more to the construction/project management side of things over the last 15 years.  For the last 7 years I’ve been working for a small family construction company and while it’s been fun and I consider them like family, I feel I’ve hit a dead end and have a conflict of management styles with a particular coworker (long story).  For the most part, I love my job and the flexibility and family atmosphere it affords.  If we ever have anything to do, a quick heads up and no questions asked.  I maybe work 35 hrs a week and am paid well, that’s not an issue.  But, I do feel like I’ve hit my ceiling and again, there is one particular coworker that’s not going anywhere and is making my role tough. 

A month or so ago, on a particularly rough day, I uploaded my resume somewhere and was nearly immediately contacted by a very large (Fortune 50) firm in a field I’m especially passionate about personally - about a position.   I figured there is no harm in speaking with them, so I scheduled an informal interview.  That quickly has lead to 2 additional interviews, the last with some VERY high level CEO’s and I can assume a substantial job offer is coming soon.  The job will come with what I’m assuming is at least a 50% pay increase to start, as well as a much higher ceiling.  

My only real issues though, this job will be *at least* an 8-5 corporate role, a little bit of travel (which I’m okay with) and a lot more structure.  I’ve tried to hint around during the interview process and so far, they’ve been honest with “yea, this is an 8-5 office job, M-F”..    

Right now, I’m afforded so much flexibility and the water is my life.  If it’s 2pm on a Friday and I’m slow, I can currently leave work and be on my boat fishing in 30 mins.  I’d most certainly have to give that up for the short term, at least until they trusted me a bit.  And as it stands, I have a ton of vacation time - I never am short on days.  This new position would start out with what I believe is 5 days for the first year, at which point they’d increase.  (And there may be some flexibility on this, this is all just sort of what I’ve assumed based on my research).  

I just have no idea what to do.  In short - taking this would be at least a 50% jump in pay (over what I’m already okay with) in a field that’s literally a dream of mine, but a more structured environment and a set 40 hr week.  But at the same time, a much higher ceiling and getting away from what I perceive as an antiquated, set in their ways system and coworkers.   

Any insight, I would be most appreciative.   I’d also like to add, this would be my first role in a company larger than 50 or so employees.   I’d essentially leave my current job with a small company for one of the largest companies in the world - I’ve never worked with anything close to that.  And all this in my 40’s.  I just don’t know.

It’s essentially like going from a small auto shop to a design position with Corvette.  In some ways I feel I’ve hit the lottery, in others I just don’t know if I have the energy to start over in something like that.   Suggestions?"

It's not going well at all - we get formal reviews after every project.

The first review I got (0.5 - 1.25 months in) was okay. I got all ""working towards level"" and ""at level.""

The second review I got (1.25 - 3 months in) was worse, with two out of 10 areas marked as ""below level.""

The two below levels stemmed from not being autonomous enough when communicating with clients and not working efficiently enough.

I was told that new people are not expected to get all ""at level"" marks and that I'd probably get better with time.

Besides that, I've had this one other person hint at the 4 month mark that my technical skills were below expectations. He sent me a list of resources and said, ""I started here right out of college too, so I know there's a lot to learn. But day by day, it will get easier.""

I also had this other person tell me at the 5 month mark that ""everyone here at our company is accomplished and did well in college and had great resumes to get in"" and said that I had to take more ownership of my work and improve a specific technical skill. They also said I was too introverted when interacting with higher-up's at the company. I'll add that this person stated that they liked working with me.

---

Shortly before the 5 month mark, I realized where my deficiencies were. I had poor technical skills, wasn't seeing the big picture on projects, and lacked knowledge of accounting and finance terms.

In the past 2 weeks, I've leveraged LinkedIn learning and other courses I paid for to patch up those skills gaps, and I've noticed myself slowly getting it and improving. I even used our company's winter break to spend time on those classes.

I also realized that I was not doing a good job selling myself to people and creating professional relationships, both because of my work performance and more reserved nature.

I've worked on that as well by thinking about what I want to get out of this role and crafting a concise and pointed elevator pitch, while working on my social anxiety.

That being said, I am nowhere near where I should be and I feel like I won't even last a year, so should I quit while I'm still ahead?

I don't mind spending massive loads of time and effort to catch up, but I'm just worried I've screwed my reputation over so much that there's no point in even trying.

If it helps, no one has put me on a PIP or said anything about firing me or laying me off.

This is a purely online school that is self paced, and they just added a finance program literally this week that is accredited and everything so I plan on doing the finance program.

However, they don’t offer a Masters in Finance, so would it make sense to get my bachelors in Finance and Mba in Accounting?

Would this allow me to go into either finance or accounting?

And would this further my career?

Or is this just a waste of money also getting an mba in accounting?"

More details: I currently work in animal care and although I enjoy the animals, it is very draining and not meeting up with my overarching life goals. want a more consistent work schedule/ routine and to not work weekends and holidays anymore. I want a kind of work that has low emotional toll and low risk (as in, if I make a mistake, there aren't life or death consequences).
Things I enjoy and can hopefully incorporate into work: excel, looking at data, organizing and editing. Hobbies and interests: clothing, stationary, journaling, fantasy, nature, science.

I’m in a little bit of a predicament at the moment and not really sure how to get out of it. I graduated with a business degree just in the last 6 months or so, but am now realizing I can’t/don’t want to do it. 

Props to those who can, I admire your hustle. But, I don’t want to kiss a bunch of frogs, hop jobs multiple times to get higher pay, and overwork myself for someone to profit off of my ideas. Corporate lingo and conversations seem so surface level, and in general I think the career field I chose will be so incredibly unfulfilling to me. 

So, I decided to get my real estate license, but also realized that it could be quite some time before I sell a home or find tenants for prospective landlords. I’d enjoy it, but don’t have the savings to put my absolute all into it. 

Long story short, I’m doing rideshare right now and making around 35-40k which is just around what business jobs were offering me. I think it’s silly that although I think I have many accomplishments I’m doing a job so far off what I thought I’d be doing at this point. It just feels like I’m stuck doing what I’m doing with no clear direction of where to go. While I’m unsatisfied doing what I’m currently doing, it feels like my hands are tied and I don’t know which direction to walk in.

Without getting into whether or not I should value my equity given the economy, I was given a lot if our company continues its trajectory, the package will have significant impact with my family. 

However, in recent years our company has become extremely political. As a result, I have had my role diminished, despite over performance against my KPIs and I am now in a position in which I’m being asked to take a ~15% pay cut to completely move out of my role &amp; do something completely different. 

I am highly marketable, could easily land a role elsewhere that would be a promotion &amp; come with more pay, &amp; feel confident in my abilities to succeed elsewhere. However, my golden handcuffs are strong because I truly feel like I lucked out with my early equity package &amp; don’t think I could find that elsewhere. 

I’m nervous that staying at a job not doing the work I will do once I leave will make it difficult for me to find work in a year or two once I fully vest.

But having self-doubt is more of a trend in the direction of AI/ML. This is more so as my educational background is in CS/IT. What skill should I upskill myself with? Am I in the right direction? What is the best direction I should take? Will I come to regret this? Even the decision to learn Python or Angular seems hard.

The Internet is not helpful, with a plethora of information and advertisements advising you to do this or that, with everyone selling courses online and saying that this is the thing for the future that you must do right now. Should I continue building more experience and a career in full-stack or find some courses on AI and ML?

Sorry if this seems like a useless rant, but some advice would be appreciated. Also, this is my first Reddit post."

**According to Glassdoor,** the average **annual salary** for a social media manager in the United States is **$50,581**. However, the actual salary for a social media manager can vary greatly based on a variety of factors such as the company, industry, location, and the individual's level of education and experience.

To be a social media manager, it is important to have a strong understanding of social media platforms and how to use them effectively to achieve business objectives. This may include knowledge of how to create and publish content, engage with followers, and measure the success of social media campaigns. It is also helpful to have excellent communication and writing skills, as well as an understanding of marketing and public relations principles.

To learn more about becoming a social media manager, you may want to consider taking online courses or earning a degree in a related field such as marketing or communications. It is also helpful to gain experience by interning or working in a social media-related role, and to stay up to date with the latest trends and best practices in the industry."

Hi all,  
 

I am stuck, and I need your career advice.   
 

I am working as an HR &amp; Recruitment Manager for a 120\~ people IT company.   
I’ve been in recruitment/HR for the past 9 years, and I am on my current role and company since Jan 2020. We’ve grown from 10 to 120 people in those 3 years, and I’ve done absolutely everything related to HR in that time – from office management and payroll to recruitment, yearly goal settings for our employees, onboarding, offboarding and etc.   
 

In the last 2 years, we’ve hired 2 recruiters, of whom I am their manager and 2 HR BP’s who took my HR-related tasks and they reported to our Head of HR. In 2022 we didn’t have as much recruitment as the previous years, and I took care of our employer branding.   
 

I did my job pretty well – all our employer branding statistics are rocketing 3-4x times compared to the previous year, and I also became kinda famous on LinkedIn. I was invited to be a speaker at numerous conferences and in many TV interviews on topics regarding hiring and HR.   
 

Recently I had my yearly review with the company's CEO, and he told me that I should move from HR/Recruitment to focusing more on Social Media and employee engagement. He told me I should move from the recruitment manager role so one of the recruiters could become a recruitment lead and have a place to grow. Also, I am doing a great job with social media, and the company wants me to focus on that as well. Having someone to engage more with our employees is also something in his vision for me.  


He told me to think about how I wanted to change my title and develop a plan for the year.   
 

I have two problems with that. The first one is that I am unsure if I want to become even more involved in Social/Engagement and move away from HR/Recruitment. In the future, I would like to be an HR Manager or even Head of HR for a bigger company.   
Moving more to employer branding management is not sounding to me like a step in the right direction. Is that so?   
Currently, I don’t think that changing my position would bring me any benefits in the long run.  
 

The second problem is that if I decide to stay since currently, there are almost no job opportunities for HR Managerial roles where I live ( Bulgaria ), what would I do with my title and job throughout the year?  
 

Probably ‘’People and Culture’’ manager sounds good like a job title, but still, I am not sure if this would be beneficial for me in the long run. Also what else should I do on that job except taking care of our social media, our company blog and writing articles about our company, organizing internal lections, organizing teambuilding activities and organizing Tech MeetUps? I have plan for all those things mentioned.  
   
We still have 2 HR BP working with our teams at the company.  
 

So basically, I don’t know what to do – Should I stay or should I go?   
I am fairly good at giving advice to others about their career, but here I came to a dead end.  
   
I will be very grateful for your pieces of advice. I really appreciate any help you can provide."

I am a teacher and I’m facing two very big problems. I would normally post this the Teachers sub, but they have banned posts about leaving jobs. 

I have a community member that displays very scary, but roughly legal conduct toward me. I cannot do anything to protect myself from him, the school can’t do anything, as he hasn’t technically violated the law. I had to call 911 while at work due to threatening to hurt himself. 

He is using the legal system to harass me right now, and the officer told me he is focusing on me and one other person, though he filed the report on about 30 other people, too. 

This legal tactic will not work, and I’m covered on all sides legally with this issue. I’m very afraid of what he will do when it fails, so I am preparing to change jobs and leave town, as I’m afraid he may try to hurt the students and my family. 

How do I address this with potential employers when they ask why I’m leaving?  It’s not the school district’s fault and they’ve bent over backwards to try to help me. It’s also not my fault. The district has already said I didn’t violate any policies, nor did I violate the law. Everything I did was in good faith and actually have tried to take steps to protect the man who’s harassing me."

I’m looking for advice and opinions.
I own a small ecommerce business and I’m a officer in the maritime world and have worked in the yachting industry for 8 years. In this role I deal with a lot of various admin tasks, crewing, ops, safety, security etc. while overseeing 3 departments and 30+ crew.
However I am trying to move back onto land to have more time with friends and family. Due to the nature of the maritime world being so abstract from land jobs I have been trying for a year with very little luck in securing a land job. 
My next thought will be to do a coding boot camp. In my estimation I will be able to sell myself as a (semi) technical, entrepreneurial person with management experience. Basically all I am looking for in a job is somewhat tech oriented and the opportunity to grow/ climb the ladder.
The following are my questions to you.

a) Would this type of person interest to you or your organisation.
b) Any ideas what industry I would be best suited to. 
c) Is coding the best course to improve myself or do you have a different idea.

I appreciate all feedback

1,2023-01-07,Might fail my background check. What should I do?,u/backgroundcheckbye,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/105s3au/might_fail_my_background_check_what_should_i_do/,careerguidance,"Hi reddit,

After applying for over 250 jobs I finally signed an offer letter. What I naively was not expecting was a 3rd party background checker to come in and check the dates of all of my past jobs over the last 7 years. They are individually reaching out to every one of my bosses and asking they list exact dates I worked for them and why I left.

To be clear, I've never had any issues with the law and will pass my drug test. However, I did stretch out the durations of two or three (basically all) of my jobs by up to about 6 months. I did this because I've had a variable background and bounced around a lot. I never left any of these roles on bad terms. I just wanted the dates to connect better, to appear more consistent. I didn't make up any of the roles, just exaggerated the durations.

My question is... now what? Should I swallow my pride and contact the people I worked for and see if they'll lie for me by fudging the dates? Should I come clean to the background checker? How likely is my offer letter to be rescinded? How can I spin this if I do indeed get asked about it? I'm devastated, and a nervous wreck. As I said, I've already signed the offer letter. I can't believe they're contacting all of my references AND previous employers now.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated."

A few months ago I got my degree in Public Administration after 5 years in an university. Problem is, I don't think I have ever liked this career to begin with. When selecting what to do out of hight school I was a massive idiot and decided to go for this one because ""it sounded I was going to like it and they told me they don't work a lot"". The only reason I finished it was because I realized too late I hated it and was already too deep so I may as well get that degree.

The thing I actually like are programming and drawing. I didn't choose a programming career when I had the chance because I was scared of math at the time (yeah I know lmao) and I never took drawing seriously until a few months ago but I absolutely loved it now. Financially speaking I'm getting as much as a doctor on my country right now thanks to YouTube (lol), so thankfully money it's not a problem for the near future.

Present day I'm debating myself what the hell should I do, as I have several paths

* Just keep going with it and get a job on Public administration 
* Get into front end programming
* Go full blast on art

I was working in USA on an H1B visa and have an Indian passport, and normally I would be panicking over my visa status, but for the past year I've been wanting to move out of the states and into Netherlands(I really like the country, visited as a tourist, spent a lot of time doing research). I've been pushing this off as it's a huge life decision so I've decided to take this as an opportunity to do just that.

What I wanted to know was if it is a good idea to do a second masters(Is this a thing where people do a second masters or am I overdoing it?). I've done a masters in Computer Science, but my job was website development, which I found very unsatisfying. I was thinking of specializing a bit, and getting a masters in Artificial Intelligence which is both something I find interesting, as well as something that has a demand in the job market. I do have around $50k saved up, so with some frugality and hard work, I should be able to finish a 1.5 year masters with minimal loans. 

A few pros I can think of this are:  
1. I get to specialize, which would hopefully give me access to higher paying jobs. 

2. I get to ""ride out"" the current recession in college, with the job market hopefully picking back up in 2 years. 

3. I get time which I could devote to learning Dutch(I like learning new languages, so kind of excited for this), which might make it easier to get jobs later. 

However, this would come at a cost of stalling my career growth for a couple of years, which I'm not sure if a good idea. Also, my applications would have to be in a rush as I would be scrambling for a fall semester application. 

My current plan is to keep applying to jobs in Netherlands, and at the same time try to apply to universities. If I get a job before semester starts(sometime in august), I just start working instead. Is this a good idea? Or should I prioritize getting any job I can to maintain visa status?"

Hi everyone, I am a MBA student graduating in May and I have been trying to apply for entry level jobs in the US within data analytics (with no prior DA work experience) for a bit. While doing this I've been trying to do some networking on LinkedIn, mostly utilizing InMail messages and leaving notes with my connect request. So far, I have reached out to 10-15 data analytics directors and assistant directors to try and schedule a conversation with them, and have had 1 person respond once, and I never heard back from them. I am not asking for a job, I never plan to ask any of the people I am trying to network with for a job. I truly just want to make connections, and maybe, after talking with me and seeing some of my work, they think of me when a position opens up. Any help on how I can improve my networking and response rate would be awesome!

Here is the general layout of most of the messages I send: (depending on the industry, I do a bit of adjusting)

Distance learning is cheaper, and the degrees are more reputable.

I don't really care if they teach well or not since I can learn on my own from Udemy or other online course, what I want to know is how valued it is?

Also is it attested by WES?

I have been reading a bit, that they have bad management. What is it all that about?

I have considered Open University, but University of London is cheaper, so are there any major reasons that I should choose Open university over University of London?

One last question, do they accept GED?

I have a general question about how I would look from the point of view of a hiring manager. And maybe if others are similarly curious they can ask the same style question in the comments.

General information about myself.

Male from the UK, 27y, grades from school were poor thanks to undiagnosed ADHD and dyslexia (I'm currently working on redoing my maths and English GCSEs) but I have a strong work ethic.

I had several years experience as a barman before leaving for where I work now, I began as an agency temp worker and in six years have worked my way up to be a first line manager. I've gotten forklift training as well as first aider, fire marshal and risk assessment qualifications, well as the countless Excel and other mundane nameless courses available in big companies.

I run a team of ten people shipping manufacturered goods worldwide as well as training but that's mainly on site training so I'm not sure it would transfer.

Sorry for the long post or any spelling or grammatical errors I'll point back to my dyslexia. This is just a general what would you think of me kinda fact finding mission for anyone who's hired people in the present or past. I'm contemplating going back to college to become a plumber but am also slightly worried if I'd be giving up the good opportunity I have here."

These strategies have worked for many people but there have to be more efficient ways of finding a job that are not as well-known considering that:

* Many jobs are never posted (referrals/internal hire/networking)
* Some jobs simply have to be publicly posted as par of company policy even if they plan to hire someone internally so online applications can be a waste of time
* Companies can sometimes create positions for people even if they originally didn't have any plans to hire
* Online applications use ATS that can make it close to impossible to ever get a human to read resumes

I was promoted because I'm good at what I do and the owner recognized that but I feel underqualified.

I have to talk to one of my employees later today because, after many meetings, they are continuing to not follow the protocol that we have set and are therefore being unprofessional to our clientele. For privacy, I won't say what the business is but it opened this past year and I've been working here since day one. I love the owner but they really don't know what they are doing. This is their first time managing a team so they are also trying to figure it out and aren't able to guide me.

Honestly, I suspect that I was promoted so that they didn't have to do the team management. All that being said, I love this company and want it to succeed and for that to happen then I need to step up and take control but I have no idea how and I really need advice.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit- 

I have poured over everyone's comments for days now and I am grateful for everyone's response. To address some common concerns that I see in the comments, I genuinely don't believe I'm being set up to fail. I have known the owner for years and I highly doubt they would do such a thing; however, I completely agree that my lack of life experience puts me at a huge disadvantage.

I know I have a lot to learn and in order to do this job to the best of my ability, I must grow as a person in the process. I have always prioritized personal growth and waking up every day and choosing to be a better person than I was the day before. I know this is going to have a large learning curve and that in order to do this job I will have to constantly push myself to be better and never stop learning/growing.

Thank you all for your kind words, author recommendations, and general advice. I looked into HR training as some commenters have suggested and I will be speaking to the owner about getting formal management training for both of us, as I believe we both need it for this company to succeed. Again thank you all, you have helped more than you will ever know!"

Throwaway account here

I have recently interviewed at two companies for a position that is a promotion from where I am now. Both companies are stellar and I can see myself thriving at either, but I am in quite the dilemma. All numbers and dates will be skewed to maintain anonymity

&amp;#x200B;

**Company A**

Industry leader and widely accepted as once of the best places to develop as a professional

$67,000 base $100,000 OTE (sales job) - 80% quota attainment

**Pros:** This company is great on paper, but honestly the product is pretty boring. The recruitment process has been wonderful and they have very talented people. This company is massive and while growth may be slow, it is almost guaranteed in terms of vertical progression. 

**Cons:** This position does not begin for several months and they want an answer for the position immediately. I am currently interviewing still with Company B and I am confident I will receive an offer. I would feel disgusted if I accepted this offer only to turn it down a couple of weeks later. I want to weigh out all of my options in terms of compensation, company culture, benefits and etc for about a week or so but they will not allow me to do so. Brutally long sales cycle (6-18 months).

&amp;#x200B;

**Company B:**

Relatively new company, but definitely not a startup. They are arguably the first or second best in the industry, but indisputably in the top 2 with the opportunity to become the market leader within the next couple of years.

$72,000 base $130,000 OTE - 60% quota attainment

**Pros:** I love this company culture. This company is also in an industry that is much more aligned with my personal interests. While the interviewers at Company A have been great, I like the team of this company significantly more. The entry level compensation is obviously significantly higher as well. I can really see myself thriving here and the opportunity to move vertical is rapid. I could get into my dream position within 4 years, while it will take 6-10 with Company A. Much shorter sales cycle so I will get commission more often (1-3 months).

**Cons:** Newish company with less brand recognition than Company A. Also, the quota attainment % is significantly lower, so while the opportunity to earn more compensation is evident, it is not nearly as guaranteed. This company is roughly 1/3 of the size of Company A, and while it is said to have a great training program, it is obviously not going to have the same brand recognition attached to it as Company A.

&amp;#x200B;

1,2023-01-07,How Do I Quit A Job That Has Shown Me So Much Respect?,u/Various_Hair3478,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/105vf7x/how_do_i_quit_a_job_that_has_shown_me_so_much/,careerguidance," 

I have been in my current role roughly a year. My manager is seriously the best manager you could ask for and my coworkers do not fall far behind. The internal support from the company has been unwavering. I have so much respect and appreciation for my manager. We have even hung out on personal time and developed a personal bond. They are more like a mentor to me than a boss.

When I accepted this position, I was told I would be travelling roughly 20% of the amount that I am now. I was also told the product I would be selling (I am in sales), and I researched it. I thought I would be interested in selling the product, but honestly I hate selling it, it has 0 to do with my personal interests and the competitor products are often better, more customizable and cheaper. Our products are great for limited use cases, but I constantly get beat out by competitors because of product market fit. Also, the commission is capped when I told it would not be.

The constant travelling and living out of a suitcase is taking my soul. My ambition has dropped significantly as has my mental health. I used to be very discipline, getting up at 5AM every day to prepare for the workday beforehand, but now I snooze until absolutely necessary. I constantly feel like I am going through the motions. I am always in a hotel by my lonesome only to go to meetings that will probably not turn into sales.

I don't blame my manager for these issues, as he does not control out territories. Our director does that. I just hate that I am travelling 5 times the amount I am supposed to, spending half my life in the car or in hotel rooms and selling a product I could not care less about.

How do I tell someone who has shown me nothing but respect and appreciation that I am turning my back on them for a better opportunity? The thought of disappointing my manager has caused me so much stress as I know they are going to have to take over my projects on top of their own until a new person is hired. I do not want to make their life any harder, but I can not keep doing this."

Alright, so context: for 3 years I worked for a major managed care organization that has Medicaid, Marketplace and Medicare plans in almost all 50 states. Back in August, I started looking at other positions outside of the company. My manager had left the company and the org chart was rapidly breaking down at the time - it had become a different environment that no one at the individual contributor level seemed to be ok with. A lot of us left within a few months. 

In September, I had interviews for two different positions. One was in the same field I had worked in for the 3 years prior, and the other was in pharmacy benefits for regulated markets. My government-sponsored healthcare experience was attractive to the pharmacy benefit company, even if I hadn’t worked in the pharmacy arena before. 

I ended up ultimately taking the pharmacy benefit position. It’s been 3 months and I really dislike the work. I’m not comfortable with the ambiguity that seems to linger over most tasks, and I realized that my hiring director was not transparent with me when I asked why the position was open during my interview. He told me someone had been promoted to a senior manager position. But really this team (besides 1 person) has turned over twice since 2020. 

I’m paranoid that I’m not doing well - I can’t find a “reasonable use” policy for the internet related to working at home/browsing news on breaks, etc. Every time I think I’ve overcome the anxiety around something to do with this job, something new comes up and sends me into a tailspin. 

I miss my old work but don’t want to go back to the old team I was on because the leadership that came in at the end of my tenure is still in place - and it was a train wreck. 

Big caveat to this whole scenario is that I rec’d a signing bonus at the time I was hired. And if I am termed or leave at any time during my first year - I have to pay it back. I’m starting to feel like it might be worth it. 

Any guidance here? I have redone my resume and written a cover letter that explains that my transition away from my old subject matter has made me realize that I miss my old subject matter and felt that I thrive in it."

x-posted from r/careeradvice so I can get a wider range of advice from people in this subreddit as well

Hi folks. I'm about to be 27 with very limited education, but I have a handful of marketable skills. I'm on UserTesting and have been for several years and that seems to be an okay source of income, but now everything wants you to be on camera for the same money as just a screen recording. I have a bunch of broken teeth so I'm super uncomfortable being on camera.

I just signed up for Appen as well but that seems to be an absolute cesspool so far, Upwork was even worse and it forces you to have your geolocation on your profile page which is absolute trash for any semblance of privacy.

I've been looking into graphic design WFH jobs but they all seem to require me to know Illustrator, which I'm having trouble finding a class that will lead to a certification that doesnt cost $500+ to earn. I know if I was able to afford the training and certification I would be able to get a better job, but I'm stuck with extremely low income, and not a lot of options. I've been looking for jobs since last May and I've only found like 10 positions I could even apply for, had one interview with a place that turned out to be a scam, and nothing else since.

I'm disabled and one of my main issues is a facial nerve pain condition that makes phone calls **extremely difficult** (I have to take most personal calls on speakerphone which isnt an option for anything involving sensitive information in business). Customer service WFH I'm finding on Indeed and Linkedin all wants you to do phones, I'm finding nothing in chat/email support only except ModSquad, which I applied for and they rejected me based on my resume. Data entry would be an option as well but I'm just not finding anything available. I need part time or flexible hours to manage my disabilities and all these places want full time or in office.

I'm in IL if this helps people find things that would be relevant for my area. I attempted the Vocational Rehabilitation process with the state, but even the Voc Rehab employee didnt think she could find anything for me because I need something really specialized to meet my needs.

Skills:  
\- Photoshop and Canva  
\- Photography  
\- Online community building and moderation  
\- Fast typer and speed reader (I've tried transcription with Rev and I have hearing issues which makes this incredibly difficult to find jobs I can complete)  
\- 7 years of experience with User Testing (I've kept my 5 star tester rating for 7 years so I'm consistently putting out high quality usability and functionality tests)  
\- Highly organized and extreme attention to detail  
\- 5+ years experience with professional communication mostly B2C  
\-I also have some decent writing skills but all the jobs I've applied for for content writing have been trash, the one offer I did get was absolutely insulting and not worth my time (which was surprising because it was a pretty reputable and large publication)

Things that seem to be holding me back:  
\- I have a very limited education in math  
\- I dont have much by way of formal education I have a lot of self taught skills  
\- I have not been formally employed since 2019. I've been self employed since and that seems to drive a lot of employers away.

I'm at my wits end honestly trying to find something that fits this very narrow description of what I can do. I don't have access to regular transportation to find something locally. Any help would be massively appreciated."
2,2023-01-07,Career advice: MSW of functional medicine?,u/Bulky-Berry-1617,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/105x4jn/career_advice_msw_of_functional_medicine/,careerguidance,"I’m looking to pursue my masters in social work or functional and integrative medicine. These are two totally different career paths.  My passion is helping people. I love functional medicine but I’m sick of struggling financially and I’m hearing the MSW is a safer route as I can get licensed and open my own practice and make money faster than alternative medicine. Whatever I do, I just need to get it done in 4 years. You can’t really bill insurance with functional medicine and the pool of people who believe in it are small, but I feel there is a need and it can only grow as our healthcare system is moving towards that, but slowly. Should I follow my passion and go the functional medicine route or be safe and do MSW?  Anyone have more insight on the MSW path and the alternative medicine path that I don’t know about? I’d love to hear personal experiences and advice. Thx!"

I am in the last year of 4 years of teaching in 'endangered' public schools required to fulfill a grant I took to get through college, where I earned a BA in English and a teaching certification for my state. 

In that time I taught English classes to junior high and high schoolers for 1 year each and got certified to teach math to junior high (which I did for 3 years) and high school (which I am teaching this year). A total of 6 years teaching, but only four years including this one met the qualifications for the grant I'm paying off. 

I've also helped write, record, and run a school's entire math program for virtual school during 2020 while teaching physically, and have launched and run 2 middle school robotics teams in the last two years.

I've done this work well, and can probably get recommendations from the places I've worked at, but am miserable working for public schools and want to switch careers to something less people facing/emotionally exhausting. It would be much better to have a job that's task oriented than people oriented. If there were a way to work remote, that would be ideal. 

Honestly, I know it's 'out there' and very  optimistic, but I hope to start a new career by the end of July. Opportunities in my physical location are sparse, but I have a good internet connection and can do remote work and don't mind traveling.

I just don't know where to start making this switch, or even what to switch to. Putting this out there to see if anybody can chime in with advice or experiences."

2,2023-01-07,Toxic work environment or am I just impatient?,u/BansheeSlays,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/105y8af/toxic_work_environment_or_am_i_just_impatient/,careerguidance,"I’m a 24 year old, looking for some honest advice on whether I’m in a toxic work environment or I’m just making things up in my head. Sorry this might be a little long, but I want to get some outside advice for my situation.

I work in the film industry and I started as a post-graduate intern in January of last year for a smaller film company in my area. While my location isn’t as large or supported as Los Angeles, New York, or Atlanta, we have a tight-knit community and the company I work for is renowned for non-union workplaces in my town.

During my time as a non-paid intern, the company got onto a commercial project with a very well-known name in the industry. Up until this point, this was probably their biggest client in the history of the company. Given the important nature of this project, they signed me on as an independent contractor for any time I spent in the office outside of my eight required internship hours. While the work I did for the project was very minor, mainly organizational stuff, I was pretty stoked to have my first big film project after graduation which actually paid me what I consider to be the minimum wage these days (think entry-level base wages from Target, Best Buy, Costco, etc). For the rest of the five months of my internship, I spent about 15-23 hours as a contractor outside of my internship hours, so I was working approximately 23-31 hours total per week. Along with this big project, I got trained on their workflow for different aspects of their commercial projects, got tapped into some major organizational things, and even spearheaded some very minor projects.

After my internship had ended, they kept me on as an independent contractor for the next three months where I worked off and on whenever they needed me. I had a discussion with my supervisor about them potentially hiring me full-time and they said that wasn’t in their cards for the time being. While I was disappointed, I accepted it and understood since I was still early on in my career. When I was an independent contractor there were multiple times where they would call me at the last minute, with up to 24 or less hours in advance. I put my life on hold in most cases to try and build a relationship with the company to potentially get hired. During this time, there were multiple other people, some interns I worked with who got hired shortly after for their specific departments but my department was never ready to hire anyone even though they constantly needed the help.

In September, I was approached about becoming a seasonal part-time hire where I worked 30 hours a week with a dollar raise. I accepted the position and was quickly trained on some programs for their biggest project they have ever worked on. I learned the workflow in about 2 weeks (programs that I had never used before) and was put onto a project which required me to work about 50 hours a week, mostly overnight for about a month. Shortly after, I went back to my “30 hours” and was asked to lead a group of contractors and be the head assistant for another important commercial project. However they did not have infrastructure or help in my department, so I worked 35-40 hours a week with no benefits to help guide this project to the finish line. My supervisor has said to me multiple times after these two huge projects that I have been incredible and have been doing everything right, but he unfortunately can’t hire me because the company owners don’t want to spend the money to get me on-board.

I was frustrated, but gave them a second (probably third) chance when they extended my seasonal part-time position into this new year. The owners said that I have been doing great and they have been impressed with me, but there is not a full-time position available. I am tightly intertwined into the company’s business and culture, I send professional emails on behalf of the company to high-end clients and represent them with the highest standards that I can, and am talked to within the company like I am apart of the long-term future of the team; yet there’s been no long-term commitment from them towards me. My contract ends in the next two months and there’s a possibility I might be unemployed (again) during my time with them. When my contract ends, I would have been a “seasonal part-time” for 6 months and 20 days and I would have worked as a paid employee/contractor for 14 months.

I love the team I directly work with in my department, the rest of the company is really nice to me and appreciates my help, and I’ve bought into the long-term growth and culture of this company for over a year now; but I’m just not sure how much I can handle the constant disappointment of not being in their future goals or how patient I need to be. They have the money to spend on other aspects of the company, but my department is always considered as an afterthought, where any problems are easily fixed by the small team they have which works tirelessly to make ends meet. My department constantly says they need help, but the owners never listen. I just want to be paid what I believe I deserve (I'm getting paid under half the national average for my position) and I have no benefits. Is this a toxic work environment and should I finally move onto something else or is this all in my head and I’m too emotionally attached to the situation?"

5,2023-01-07,"70k student loan debt, Bachelors and Masters of music. May need to find a full-time job to pay down debt. Am I even qualified for well paying jobs outside of music?",u/Capable-Pangolin-319,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/105yui6/70k_student_loan_debt_bachelors_and_masters_of/,careerguidance,"Hello! I’m seeking advice as a 24(F) year old about to graduate in April with a Master’s in Music (Voice Performance) from the University of Michigan. I have accrued 70k in student loan debt and honestly am concerned that I made the biggest mistake of my life. It was a lot easier to follow the dream when I didn’t have to face the financial consequences. I’m not sure what to do when I graduate. I have no real full-time job prospects in the classical music performance. It will take years and even more money to possibly achieve, and even then I’m not guaranteed a high-paying salary. 

I’m not 100% I love classical music anymore. Even if I was, it won’t pay my loans back.

I can’t teach high-school without a Teaching Certification (nor do I want to).

I’m wondering if I should get a full-time job doing something else when I graduate to try to chip away at my student loans. With two degrees in Music Performance, am I even qualified for other jobs in a salary-range that would help me pay down this debt? 

I’ve served tables and done fine-dining all throughout college. I’m great with people and a natural salesman. I know I have plenty of transferable skills that would be coveted in many of the fields my friends have jobs in (marketing, sales, etc.). The problem is my lack of experience. I put all my eggs in the music basket and now I’m not sure what to do. Ideally I would sing for a living (in any genre), but right now it’s looking like I’ll have to settle for singing gigs on the side. It’s heartbreaking to put a pause on the dream (I’m damn good at it), but I have to be realistic about my financial situation. 

I’m terrified I’ll be stuck in a job that I hate trying to pay back my student loans forever and unable to enjoy my life, travel, or continue to do what I love- music. 

Any financial, career, or life advice would be welcome. If anyone has been in a similar situation due to the allure of the ~collegiate music degree with no future financial security~ and has come out okay on the other side… I would love to hear your thoughts."

* Unlimited PTO + Month off during Holiday Season
* 401(k)
* 100% employer contribution to individual medical, dental &amp; vision
* Short-term disability, long-term disability and $25,000 life insurance benefits
* 30% Travel Required
* Fast growing organization with lots of opportunities to learn.

**Company B (Statewide):**

* $70k base +
* 100% employer contribution to individual medical, dental &amp; vision
* Short-term disability, long-term disability, and $25,000 life insurance benefits
* 401(k)
* Week off for Holidays
* 10 days Vacation, 9 Holidays, 20 days Sick time.
* Younger organization but would lead my own team.

This current role is only my second out of college so I'm not very well versed in benefits compared to salary. I know my current job has good benefits but is the pay at the other role worth leaving for?

Any thoughts would be super helpful for the future even if I don't leave my current role for this new offer."

I took a new position with a larger task load in Oct 2021. In July 2022, due to increasing task load, I asked for three things: Help (being #1), pay increase, and professional training. I was told to submit evidence and documentation to back up my requests. 
In October 2022, I had a meeting with my boss who denied all requests, and when I asked why, he said it was because of our geographic location. I asked if he looked at my task load and achievements that I provided and he openly said no. I asked for a re-evaluation. 
Emails were sent every month with a response ever other month, ""little movement has be made..."". I began searching for other jobs and networking on LinkedIn. Did not inform anyone. 

This past Monday, I was informally told that I would not be receiving anything. Today, I checked my payroll and saw a 7% raise. Then i saw someone from my company viewed my LinkedIn yesterday. Told my best friend (who also works for the same company, on same project) and she got a decrease of 5%. No notice to either of us and she was Employee of the Quarter last quarter.

I’m used to bosses publicly being rude and yelling in my face because they feel it’s deserved. I admit when I fuck up, own up to it, adapt, learn from it, apologize, and move on. I also have a tendency to be inflexible and very direct in my wording to the point it rubs ppl the wrong way.  It happened at work today. I apologized and so did my boss. 

I want to learn how to be more professional in my wording and still be firm and assertive, but not to the point where it’s rude. I asked somebody their opinion and they said I was rude. 

What are some good phrases to say that “I don’t appreciate being taken advantage of and I will not do ask you tell me because it’s not legal in the workplace”? 

I don’t want to piss anyone off but I need to stand up for myself because if I don’t do it, nobody will. So where’s the line?"

Alright, so context: for 3 years I worked for a major managed care organization that has Medicaid, Marketplace and Medicare plans in almost all 50 states. Back in August, I started looking at other positions outside of the company. My manager had left the company and the org chart was rapidly breaking down at the time - it had become a different environment that no one at the individual contributor level seemed to be ok with. A lot of us left within a few months. 

In September, I had interviews for two different positions. One was in the same field I had worked in for the 3 years prior, and the other was in pharmacy benefits for regulated markets. My government-sponsored healthcare experience was attractive to the pharmacy benefit company, even if I hadn’t worked in the pharmacy arena before. 

I ended up ultimately taking the pharmacy benefit position. It’s been 3 months and I really dislike the work. I’m not comfortable with the ambiguity that seems to linger over most tasks, and I realized that my hiring director was not transparent with me when I asked why the position was open during my interview. He told me someone had been promoted to a senior manager position. But really this team (besides 1 person) has turned over twice since 2020. 

I’m paranoid that I’m not doing well - I also can’t find a “reasonable use” policy for the internet related to working at home/browsing news on breaks, etc. I have used the internet only for work related search probably 90-95 percent of the time but now I’m worried about the few times I googled or looked at CNN. 


Every time I think I’ve overcome the anxiety around something to do with this job, something new comes up and sends me into a tailspin. 

I miss my old work but don’t want to go back to the old team I was on because the leadership that came in at the end of my tenure is still in place - and it was a train wreck. 

Big caveat to this whole scenario is that I rec’d a signing bonus at the time I was hired. And if I am termed or leave at any time during my first year - I have to pay it back. I’m starting to feel like it might be worth it. 

Any guidance here? I have redone my resume and written a cover letter that explains that my transition away from my old subject matter has made me realize that I miss my old subject matter and felt that I thrive in it."

My manager continuously asks me to do stuff outside of my ""job description"" or goals that we have discussed, which takes up 90% of my time. Then, he gets pissed off when none of the other ""primary projects"" get completed. I do pushback by telling him that I'm busy with other stuff, but he insists that I do all the other stuff as well (none of which is being communicated to senior management).

Its become very exhausting, I have been working pretty much balls to the walls, 8 AM to mid-night on a constant basis (except weekends) now &amp; my hours are substantially longer than any of my peers at my current firm.

Has anyone here worked for PPD (part of Thermo now) in an FSP role or recruited people for an FSP role? That means you are employed by PPD but placed at one of their clients' site. The length of the contract is negotiated between PPD and the client. Once the contract ends or is terminated prematurely (for whatever reasons), you'll become redundant. So you need to either find a new role within PPD/Thermo quickly or leave.

I got an offer from PPD in an FSP role. However, I am not sure if I should accept the offer. To be honest, working for PPD in such FSP role is not different from working for a staffing agency. That sounds scary!

Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated.

1,2023-01-07,What can I try next?,u/imaginaryshivering,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10620fw/what_can_i_try_next/,careerguidance,"I (26F) have been working at my first “real” job for almost 2 years. I work as a grant writer at a medium sized nonprofit. I love the organization, love most of my coworkers, but hate the job. I don’t do much most of the time honestly, but then it will randomly be insanely stressful. I think what I really don’t like is that it’s not really much writing, just a lot of copying and pasting and begging other people for information that they don’t get to me until the last minute. 

So, I need to try something else but I have no idea where to begin. I have a bachelors degree in Emerging Media and Communication. Don’t ask me what I thought I was going to do with that because I don’t know. I really liked my studies but I don’t what else I can do with studying media and fandoms without getting a more advanced degree and becoming a professor or something. Which I’m not necessarily opposed to, but I change my mind so much I’m not sure I want to pay for more school when I’m not 100% sure. Also, before my current job I did Americorps VISTA where I worked at a tiny nonprofit doing social media and redoing their website. That job was alright but I don’t think I’m skilled enough for a real job in those areas and definitely don’t want to do social media again. 

Additionally, only job I’ve ever enjoyed was when I worked at a summer camp during college. I liked being a counselor a lot but what I really loved was when I was the trip coordinator. I planned a took small groups of girls on outdoor adventure trips. It was great. I would really love to do something with travel but travel agents aren’t really a thing anymore? Idk. I also didn’t hate my job as a swim instructor in college, but I don’t really want to do that anymore. But, as someone with ADHD, a job that changes frequently and doesn’t have projects I can put off to the last minute would be nicer Also, my dream job in college was to be a concert photographer, but I just don’t think that’s possible anymore at this point in my life for a variety of reasons, particularly me having pretty severe social anxiety.

Anyways, thank you for reading this. I am open to any and all suggestions! I am in the US. Hoping to find a job in a decently sized city in or near Michigan, but I’m not too picky."
295,2023-01-07,Am I am idiot to not pursue a job opportunity that will be an 60% salary increase?,u/LimeJuice3333333333,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10620rx/am_i_am_idiot_to_not_pursue_a_job_opportunity/,careerguidance,"I know this question seems like an obvious yes.  I realize I am very fortunate to even be in this position at all,  but there continues to be a part of me that is stopping myself from moving forward and I do not know WHY I feel this way. I'm hoping for some critical and objective feedback from anyone who has been in a similar position. 

I currently make $81,600 in the field of data science (being vague here). I have a masters degree and over 5 years experience; 7 total years in the industry I work in. I have been with my current company for almost 4 years. I get to work from home and I truly love my job and people I work with. 

I have a lot of connections in my field so I have explored other positions to get an idea of salary ranges for the type of work I do. Over the past year, I have interviewed at two companies and been offered $95,000 and $100,000. However, I ended up turning down these offers because I was hoping for a promotion and at the time, I was comfortable enough with my salary that moving on didn't feel worth it. My company is pretty small, and with the structure of my team and current company finances,  it really doesn't seem like a big promotion or raise is happening anytime soon. My boss is very well aware of my career goals and desire to be promoted because we discuss it in our monthly meetings. Each time we discuss a timeline and skills to improve, I am told I am doing everything perfectly and I am a major asset to our company, but given minor things to work on and evasiveness on what our budget is to increase my pay. This always feel strange knowing the teams at the two companies where I was offered a position were really impressed with my skills and very disappointed when I ended up turning them down - both directors at these companies even called me themselves when I said no to ask me to reconsider 

Now, a friend I met in grad school reached out to me about an open position on their team, at a large company that is doing very well. The starting pay is $127,000 ( I have already spoken to HR and confirmed this). I have a first round interview in a week and a half when the manager is back from vacation, but HR indicated they are eager to fill this spot as soon as possible. The position is work from home and the benefits are great, if not better than my current ones.

The thought of a salary increase this large seems almost impossible to pass up, but I can't help but feel I am abandoning my coworkers and company for some reason. The other minor downside is that if I were to leave my job in the next month, I would have to pay \~$4,000 to my employer since they assisted with my graduate school tuition and I signed a retention policy. The retention policy will expire in about 10 months, but if I leave before then, I will owe some %, or all, of the $4,000. I have this money in savings, so the true downside for me is feeling like I am leaving my company out to dry when they helped me advance in my career.

Why do I feel such an obligation to stay? Why am I scared of something new that could be life-changing for my future? I grew up poor, so I also feel guilty that I am debating doing this interview and moving forward, at the same time feeling like I am already making more money than my parents ever did when I was growing up.

I know I may not even be offered this job in the end, but overall, is there any reason why I shouldn't move forward with an interview? Has anyone ever felt this way about leaving a job?

EDIT: I know that there are parts of this that don’t make complete sense or add up. I changed a few details because I wanted to remain vague and anonymous on the internet, and didn’t think my post would get a lot of attention. The general gist, that I work in a somewhat similar role to what I said above and this job interview is for more than 40k what I make now, is true. 
Thank you to every person who has commented, I am taking everything to heart and trying my best to respond to when I can. I hope others have gained insight from the really great comments here.

“My ideal job would be, working from home and planning projects to develop struggling communities, educational departments, city parks, etc and then once in a while having to go out to help execute the plans I make and oversee them. I like a job that gives me projects, that I can be creative and imaginative with, and make them into reality.”

My idea is that the general department I’m describing is community development. But I’m not quite sure what positions exist within that sector and how I can get my foot in the door with them.

At this point I have my masters and have climbed to pretty much the top of the pay scale (around $95k). For a few years I was teaching some courses off and on as an adjunct at a local college, but they recently changed their accreditation and require a doctoral degree to teach in the program, so that was a bit of a loss. I’m also not sure if it would really be worth it to spend a lot of time and money on a PhD program when I don’t really want to be a full time professor. I have been looking for other adjunct opportunities, but so far no luck and it seems most are asking for a doctoral degree now.

At this point I am little burnt out working in education especially after the whole pandemic. I ended up earning a certificate in digital marketing science and started a small web design and SEO content writing business, but that has ended up being very unsuccessful. I have had a few clients, so I basically broke even on my education and startup costs. I actually enjoy it and was excited at first, but it ended up being much more difficult to find clients than I expected. I am still considering trying to get a job in the marketing field as a part time job to supplement my income but unfortunately I haven’t really found any good opportunities. I also haven’t seen any full time positions that would pay well enough to justify leaving my current role. 

We have 4 kids and my wife is a stay at home mom. With inflation, it feels like I have had a big pay cut in the past couple years that have made our monthly budget very tight. I would love to advance my career to make more money to provide for my family, but I feel unsure of what to do. 

Some options I have considered are earning an admin credential to be a school principal, but I honestly don’t really want that responsibility…it would be mainly a financial decision, so I don’t think that is the best path. I have considered doing a coding/web developer bootcamp, but I’m uncertain about that with big tech cutting so many jobs recently, I’ve also thought about selling our house and trying to start over in a different state with a lower cost of living maybe (we live in the Seattle area) but I’m not sure I would really be solving any problems since my pay would probably be less.

1,2023-01-07,How should I review colleagues I don't really work with?,u/smooth-brain_Sunday,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1063jfn/how_should_i_review_colleagues_i_dont_really_work/,careerguidance,"Setting: Professional office, USA, 30 people, 95% of time WFH

Situation: Leadership at work had the bright idea of having every single person do a ""360 Review™️"" --a concept where a superior, a peer, and a junior from teams that one works with all give anonymous feedback (one section for positive, one section for constructive) that is only to be seen by the person's manager and then they'll share the feedback to the person in question.

The understanding was that everyone would do three reviews. Now that review time has come around, six people have chosen me and others apparently didn't get chosen at all. Leadership did not redistribute as one might expect. I'm already a bit annoyed at the volume, but that's not the problem.

Issue: Of the six reviews I have to complete, one is my direct manager (makes sense, I guess) and one is a colleague that helps me out a lot and he's wonderful. I'm happy to give him a shining review.

Two are people that are directly on my small team of five (even though we were supposed to pick people NOT on our team). Think of us as account managers that work with our clients completely separately. I've literally never once had a project or overlapping work with either of these people. They also don't really do anything constructive for the organization IMO, but whether or not they are employed is not my jurisdiction. I haven't the slightest clue how to review them.

Another person that selected me to review them that isn't on my team, I can't even recall a single time we've even *interacted* at work. They've been here 8 months.

The last person, we've had maybe two projects and they've mostly not been great to work with and I've been left to follow up to see if things were actually getting done, but I'm not out for blood or anything.

Implications: I've been with the organization for 3 years and asked for a title promotion and raise three months ago. Crickets so far, but it was expressed that it *would* happen, so I've been patiently awaiting these reviews to make my case again.

These ridiculous reviews have me in the predicament of not appearing as a ""team player"" if I don't give them adequate effort. Only team players get promotions. How do I go about this??"

However, after venturing on a life affirming trip through Latin America, that desire hasn’t gone away and moments of procrastination at work are spent numbing an itch wondering whether I’ve resided myself to the office chair a little early.  

I’m currently living in a frustrating state of indecisiveness. I’m young and aware that not before long i could have a family, regretting I didn’t travel more in my 20’s before I settled down. 

Equally, I’m career driven, lucky enough to possess a job many would snatch out of my hands and I know at some point I need to put in the hard yards to get where I want to be and earn stability for my later life and for my future kids.

Would I be a complete fool to drop what I’ve earned to go away again? Alternatively, does anyone have any advice for travelling while protecting a career back home? Travelling with work is certainly an option so this is an avenue I’m keen to explore.

I’ve been at this job for 7 months and I’ve done well and learned more than I probably did at my prior two jobs combined so the experience has been very valuable.

The issue is that my current company has invested a lot in me the past 7 months, including paying the predecessor consulting fees so I can call and ask them for guidance while still learning the work. And I’m not sure what would happen if I just put in 2 weeks notice since this job requires months of training and guidance before getting used to so my successor would have a tough and stressful time getting started if I weren’t there.

What are your thoughts?"

So my current employer is offering a new program that states it will pay 100% of tuition , including books to certain programs offered at certain universities via third party. 

I've emailed the new program inquiring over more information regarding what the company will pay for, rules etc. They've stated my company will pay for 100% tuition, application fees, transcript fees. Theres no strings attached, given that I have been with the company for a year I qualify for free tuition at these selected universities/programs. 

I applied for the program this Spring but there have been some issues with the program not covering some costs even though I messaged a representative over what my company would cover. Yet now they are stating they wont cover this charge. They are also questioning some itemized receipts I received from the university.  In addition, I've sent my transcripts twice this time to the university and they state I have not sent in my transcripts. 

I applied in October and overtime I've honestly grown very discontent at my job as well. A part of me wants to start a new course this Spring but another side of me dislikes my job and also worry my company won't follow through with 100% tuition assistance. 

Any advice or suggestions moving forward?"

I've been doing my job for 11 years and have worked my way in to the specialism that I always dreamed of. I've been fulfilling this specialism for the past 5 years.

Structural changes within the organisation mean that some  positions are going to be coming up in a supervisory role. I've been considering this promotion route for some time now, and at times it excites me, and then my lack of self belief and self confidence holds me back. I become scared of failure, worried I won't make the right decisions and nervous about potentially managing staff with more experience, and strong opinions. I have done the odd day here and there in the role and enjoyed it... But this is very different to managing a team over a length of time.

I've been told by numerous colleagues that I would be good in the promoted role. I've been asked by my 1st and second line managers whether I am going to try, and every time I say that I don't know. 

The truth is I don't know, and I don't know whether that's because I don't want to do it, or I just don't believe that I can do it. Probably the latter knowing me!! 

Can anyone give me some advice who has been in a similar position? Has anyone gone for promotion and regretted it, or not gone for it for the same reasons and regretted it. 

It's a very high pressure job, and the decisions you have to make are often very impactive on those people they involve. 

The problem is, the promotion interviews are coming up soon, and I probably haven't gathered the evidence now to even pass them. 

Sorry for the lengthy post!! 

Thanks all"

I (25M; Canada) have been working in project coordination for about 3 years now in the construction industry and I am definitely on the project management career path. I dislike/am ambivalent about my work; however, I am looking at the people above me in my company and I am not particularly interested in their positions as I do not like the stress involved and the availability required in that position. This is not company related as I have seen the same issues at different companies. I have come to the realization that I care far more about (long form) time off than management/director roles where vacation and flexibility in regards to time off is difficult. This is not to say that money is not important; but I would prefer the flexibility of rotational schedules or contract work over salary and my current career trajectory.

Based on my experience I work with individuals that work on rotational schedules (4 on/4 off 12 hour) or a 4x10s schedule. This is something I want to get into as I strongly dislike the 5 on / 2 off 8 hour schedule with limited vacation especially considering the unofficial request to be available when off. Basically, I am trying to maximize my time off and in long form to use on road trips, hiking trips in exotic locations etc..

What are my options? I went to school for engineering, which is fine but I am not tied to it. I have looked at fly-in, fly-out rotations in remote areas, going back to school for trades (which is where I see most of these attractive schedules), oil and gas or mining. I have even looked at more ‘pie in the sky’ ideas such as becoming a commercial pilot or a teacher. Is it best to try to renegotiate my position within my current company to a contractor / consultant-type worker?

Couple things/notes that may help:

* I have a reserve fund available to go back to school for trades or something else if it would help me acquire the days off.
* I have no concerns at this time regarding missing family time or relationship issues moving to a rotational schedule.
* I am based in Eastern Canada but I have no desire to stay here and am willing to move. 
* I have no debt.

Am I missing other options? Does anyone have any experience with this type of realization?

Thanks in advance."

On top of that, I also changed campaigns within the company I work for and instead of working 10-12 hours per day, I'm working 8 hours per day.

All that to say, I'm now left with 2'ish hours extra in my day and have high-speed internet (shocking, I know). I'd like to try to make good use of my extra time and see if I can make it profitable - either with a side gig or by teaching myself a skill set that would benefit me long-term.

When I graduated high school, I played around with some very basic PHP and enjoyed it. I like tech but I don't have any in-depth knowledge of anything useful at this point. I'd be interested in any suggestions on what I could invest my time in, especially tech related.

I just came back to work after taking paternal leave (3 months) and out of the blue get a text from one of my old coworkers saying the company they're working at is looking to hire and asked if I would be interested. I said yes of course, and they recommended me. I'll be meeting with them this coming week.

Now, here I am, updating my resume and mentally preparing for the interview process:

What do I say if they ask me about my current salary/benefits? Do I politely decline and wait to see if they make an offer? I'm pretty happy at my current job, but if these guys can pay me more, or even the same but with better benefits I would probably take it, but I'm nervous about being the new guy at a new company.

What do I do if they make me a great offer? Do I tell my current employer in the hopes of getting a better deal from them? I'm not trying to put the cart before the horse, just trying to mentally prepare for this since I feel pretty rusty when it comes to the hiring process nowadays.

I have a bachelor’s of history, and a master’s of religious studies. Been teaching English this first year in a K-12. Prior to that I was a TA and a student teacher of record for three years in grad school. I also have military experience as a current serving combat engineer sergeant in the reserves. 

My degrees I admit are pretty useless but I’ve developed decent communication, reading, writing, and research skills. I’m also a good public speaker and thanks to my teaching and military time I’d like to think a proficient leader good at learning about people entrusted to me and finding ways to engage their strengths while improving on their weaknesses. It’s also made me very used to and comfortable working with a diverse crowd.

I just feel lost, I like teaching but in the state I’m in (FL) I’ll never make more than 75kish a year and that’d be after a whole career. I’d really rather not go back to school if I don’t have to but I just want to find a field with growth potential. I don’t really care what it’s doing I just want the chance at earning 6 figures one day and to find something where I can at least start in the 45-50kish range. Am I looking for a unicorn? 

I just don’t know enough about corporate America. I’ve been asked what am I interested in by other people and I always tell them something that makes more money. I think I’d do well in a managerial setting but I doubt anyone’s gonna start me there. I’m willing to work hard and do my time, what’s a promising field some one with my background could do?"

1,2023-01-08,Out of state remote vs In state hybrid work?,u/pixelblue1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/106ca2g/out_of_state_remote_vs_in_state_hybrid_work/,careerguidance,"Considering a couple different opportunities.  My current job would allow me to work remote from any state, but I'm a contractor and my role may be ending soon.

Company A: My previous company I worked at for 2.5 years reached out to me to ask about my availability.   They're offering a 5 month contract to start, which could extend longer term. I would have the option of working hybrid in person or remote, or even remote out of state(with different health insurance).

Company B: A company I worked a contract for this past year would like me to return later this spring, for 5 months, but extension beyond that is unlikely.  They would only allow hybrid.

At this point I'm strongly considering going with Company A and trying to make it work longer term if at all possible.  Working remote out of state would mean I lose pension vesting, but gain 401k matching.  I know some other employees have actually gotten promotions while working out of state, so career advancement here isn't totally reliant on being in person.

  
At the same I feel hybrid would be better for my long term development and possible career advancement.  Hybrid with Company B would pay better, and I would likely have better career development opportunities there, but it's unclear how long I could stay beyond the initial contract.  Company A would be slightly lower pay, but offer better stability potentially.  Frankly either are a bit of coin toss in this regard, but Company A would be more likely to offer stability.

For those of you who work remote, any thoughts on whether it's negatively impacted your career?"

Currently 30 with two little ones, hubby is a qualified builder. We live in New Zealand.

I left school and spent time traveling instead of studying at uni. Floated from job to job in-between the children and living overseas. 

I dabbled in studying online, gave architectural tech a go but didn’t work out, especially as we went into lockdown and had to do home schooling for our oldest. 

I recently left a coordinator role for a govt industry training organisation. When I was hired they said it would be a great chill role, ended up working more than 40hrs, toxic work environment with bitching and sleazy stuff going on, felt my kids were missing me and hubby was struggling with his work load. I saw I still need to be there for school stuff and home maintenance etc.

I’m really happy with my personal life, family and kids, housing situation etc. But feel stuck with where to go career wise. 

Anyone have any advice for a 30 year old mum? Should I study? HR, IT, accounts? Hubby said he can support me if I were to study but I need to be 100% sure. Alternative is picking up an entry level job part time with the hope it has future potential for growth?  

What would be a good industry to tap into? I pick up new things well and just really want a job I enjoy and can grow with. Also earning a good income to support our living costs and for my own spending/savings. 

Feel like I’m blabbing but I am just not sure what to do, feel like I’m at a crossroads and need some honest advice."

I made a lot of of jumps into health corporate pretty quickly due to lots of opportunities lining up at the same time, and didn’t really have the choice to say no, as my work had made my old role redundant. 

I’m now in a more small team managerial / project role. I’ve not yet reached my 1 year anniversary. The role requires a lot of coordination, and client liaison / relationships, and I feel like I’m way over my head in my position. I’m burnt out as a result of the work, multiple deadlines I can’t keep up with, and in part my own avoidance to communicate I’m struggling. Unfortunately, most deadlines are external, and being health, we’re asked to do more with less. 

Work life balance is very important to me, and I currently don’t have that, which means declining health. After seeing the wild hours emails fly into my inbox, i’m not sure I want to go any higher up the ladder. My predecessor also left because of work life balance. 

I’ve been with my company for 8 years, so I’ve got 2 months leave banked, but plan to go back to being clinical, which means a spicy $40k+ pay hit.

I guess my main questions are, will it hurt my job prospects if I took a break from corporate? Is it difficult to apply for lower pay / responsibility jobs with such high level jobs on my resume, and how do you navigate around those questions from employers?"

I am in my 30s, currently working in a investment fund firm but thriving for more. In parallel, I recently started a business with a friend although decided to stop for many justified reasons but truly loved the experience. 

I am now at the point of deciding wether to commit into: i) Studying a top MBA program, at the risk of performing proficiently in GMAT, being accepted and financially having to find a way to pay for tuition (scholarship, partial loan…) or ii) Starting a business with a good partner/friend (knowing alignment and working dynamics are positive), although not having a specific idea at the moment nor many financial resources on my end.

Studying a top MBA program will be helpful and serve as a “lifetime insurance” to guarantee a job (or even ease entrepreneurship) afterwards. On the other hand, can’t stop thinking that the time, dedication and funds required to study an MBA program could be placed in starting a business.

I finished my BSc in Biomedicine and my MSc in Molecular Medicine with around 4 months in research, and have been working at a tech start up as a customer success manager since early last year

I saw this role where I am currently at as a sort of 'break' after my masters which was really tough but now I'm at a place where I need to move again and challenge myself and start learning again

I wanted to break into the field of Patent Law and become a Trainee Patent Attorney but this has been pretty tough and so far unsuccessful as the competition is high and they tend to hire a lot of PhD students seemingly in my field (tho the entry requirements are just BSc). I also thought about consulting and potentially going for the big 4, but that was just a maybe. I dont really feel strongly about going into any career (maybe aside from medicine to become a doctor, but 4 years of medical school + 2 years junior doctor is not particularly alluring to me...)

Im a bit stuck because whilst i do want to start building my career, im also 24 and kind of want to explore a little and challenge myself outside of career and live a little. One of my other options is to do something completely different for a year and do something like TEFL and teach English in Japan or Korea for a year or something, this gives me the chance to experience another country altogether.

I just worry that doing something like that will mean my chances of employment in the fields that im interested in will either not increase or instead get lower. Of course, being in a tech environment, im surrounded by programmers etc... so ive wondered if i should learn some coding, but i dont want to do something like that just because everyone else is. Though I should maybe try it, maybe I have a passion in it? 

Anyway, I just wanted to potentially hear some opinions and advice, maybe anecdotes of ideas of where to go. Maybe those who have been in a similar situation, did TEFL then came back, how was finding a job after?

Terrific critical thinker
International background
Teaching experience with excellent student reviews

I'm interested in finance/consulting and am fascinated by distressed businesses, using my data analysis/ business analysis background to visualise data to better approach a strategy. (And I'd want to be involved in developing this strategy too).

I'm looking to move to New York / Chicago, and am based in the UK, with a UK and Irish Passport. I'd therefore need a visa to work in the USA. I know this is a long shot, but any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Some more information:

I have experience at a top real estate investment management firm, and have been working on a system implementation, building financial models, troubleshooting and fixing existing models too. I come from a MSc finance background from a top 20 university.

I'd be going for either a graduate role or experienced hire. I graduated with my MSc 1 year ago, and have been working in this data analysis role for the last few months.

I have systems implementation experience as part of the change management team, where I'm leading a couple of projects, including troubleshooting their current broken model (broken due to the new system), rebuilding this model using powerquery and also doing data analysis. I finished my MSc finance from a target institution, my dissertation was quite interesting and got picked up by various media institutions for circulation (relating to climate change and how it reacts with the financial market). I also have experience in starting up various small businesses (one drone aerial photography business while at undergrad and couple of websites, one which is a website scraper for news businesses and another which is gives information to users about local holidays)"

Hi Everyone,

I'm new to reddit so apologies if this post seems amateur! For some background, I am an HR business partner (and former recruiter) who is passionate about helping people navigate the workplace. What I've come to realize in my years of being in HR is that 1) some HR people out there aren't very helpful and can often cause more damage than support 2) everyone's relationship with HR is different, which leads to some people not feeling comfortable enough to ask critical questions in the workplace or raise issues such as harassment, issues with their boss/colleagues, and being paid what they are worth. In addition, the former recruiter in me is also passionate about helping individuals get the jobs they want through building strong resumes, interviewing skills, negotiating salaries, etc. Basically, I want to help people get the jobs they want and then thrive in those jobs :)

All of this to say, I've recently started a blog to share advice and coaching on what I've described above. I want to be able to help people in real, applicable ways and am curious: What are things you wish you could ask HR? What topics would interest you? What recruiting/career help do you need?

Thanks in advance, everyone!"

With my job, a lot of my stress i have comes with the fact of work flow/difficulty of things fluctuating. Tomorrow could be a cake walk and I have very little work, and very easy work at that. Then, Tuesday through Friday can be hellish for no other reason than factors outside of my knowledge or control. I cant prepare for it, I cant anticipate it, all I can do is 'do it' and hope it doesn't go horrifically wrong. This is mostly due to me being a copyeditor and each 'task' taking between 5-30 minutes and once it's done, it's done in its entirety (for better or worse). In the long term, this is unhealthy and i'm looking to get out of this job but until I do... I'm not sure how to handle that stress/anxiety and it's messing with me outside of work too.

Throughout the past 3 years, I have applied to hundreds of positions, and I have had maybe one or two interviews and no offers.

I always write cover letters when optional or required, I have had my resume critiqued by my university's career center, peers, and contacts from the industry. I have done everything I can to both get experience and relay evidence of this experience while applying. 

I am not saying I want an internship at Apple or Google. I am talking about very attainable internships or jobs at local or regional companies. I nearly always select positions for which I am qualified. I am not applying to positions with multiple required qualifications that I do not meet. 

It hurts so much seeing literally everyone I know but myself have success in the job market, in computer science, in engineering, and in non-STEM fields. I cannot for the life of me figure out what can go this wrong. I have literally had zero success in nearly four years of college.

These are very small plants with each one only have 3 employees so managing one hasn’t been too difficult.

Hey guys, didn’t know where else to post this but I feel like here should do.  Feel free to offer any advice or criticism!

I’m a 20 year old guy, about to turn 21 and for the past couple years I was having a hard time deciding on a career.  I started skateboarding when I was 19, and ever since it’s been my passion and my dream is to own a skate shop or skateboard brand.  To get there, it’s gonna need some funding so this year I decided to abandon my old art degree from the main college in my state and transfer to the community college to complete my associates in Digital Media.  I’ve been working in a hospital since mid covid when I was around 18 and it can get hard, but it’s a comfortable flexible job.  I do patient transport/sitting for psych patients.  I’ve decided after my associates I’m going to join the radiology program and become a CT tech which is about $50,000+ a year once I land the job.  I think radiology is interesting and I plan on using the money I make to fund my entrepreneurial ideas.  Any thoughts or advice?  I would hate for me to remain directionless in my 20s and have my dreams die, and this is the best plan I’ve come up with.  

TLDR; taking a risk for a job that pays well so I can fund a business."

Long story short, I've been looking **two options** and would like to get some opinions on this:

1. Product Manager intensive online course/programs. I looked into Product School which is about £4k but it's too short overall (hours wise) and I'm worried it would be too broad. I also found a 'career accelerator' program by King's College London which is about £6k and would be 6 months of intensive learning/coaching, receiving a certification at the end. It's also industry-led so they have connections with tech companies and you get x9 sessions of career coaching which you can even use for interview prep.
2. Alternatively I could look at cheaper, more self-paced short courses like ones on Coursera, or even LinkedIn and hire a product manager-specific career coach on the side to guide me throughout + help with interview prep. I feel like this would be much cheaper and possibly faster than £4k-6k. I'm keen to transition this year so I would really focus on this but I'm worried a shorter online course wouldn't look as good and as convincing to recruiters.

I'm tempted to bite the bullet and spend £6k on the King's College accelerator program, but I worry it's unnecessary and 6 months of studying after working hours sounds a bit heavy, but if I have to do it, I will. At the same time, Product Management is a relatively new role so I guess even if I did a shorter course, and got a PM career coach to help me, that might be enough to get me set and ready? I'm keen to know your experiences if you transitioned from a different role into Product Management. I would appreciate all advice!"

I hope it’s ok for me to post this here but really want some advice. I’m 17 and really want to be a tattoo artist when I’m older. I’m trying to convince my parents that when I finish school I should go and study Fine Art at colleague as I think it will help me with my dream and also allow me to build up my portfolio? My parents really hate the idea and want me to do a ‘proper’ degree like English or History and do art in my spare time and volunteer at a tattoo parlour in my spare time to see if it’s for me. My Dad says that way I have a ‘backup’ if I decide I want to do something different when I’m older. The thing is I really feel passionate about this and truly believe it is what I want to do. Would studying Fine Art be useful to me getting to develops my skills and everything? I think I could still do the volunteering too but it would be ever better if I studied art? Not going to college isn’t really an option for me, my parents wouldn’t allow it but maybe it would be better not to go at all and try and start an apprenticeship as soon as I finish school?

WORK SHIFT: Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday. 1:20AM to 11:50AM. Seasonal delivery station warehouse.

My classes start from 7AM. 

I was thinking of having my work schedule be around 3PM to 1AM instead which is still ten hours of work, I don’t mind that. 

If my shift time is changed, I’ll kiss amazon’s feet.Pp

If I continue with current shift, I would miss two days of three classes or actually half of the third class. I can catch up using the three days of my school days and half of my weekend days but still.

I asked the “contact us” staff on Amazon jobs and they looked me up, etc, they told me I can change my shift and showed instructions on where to change shift online.

I checked and it has different day shifts but not the TIME! 

It’s all 1:20AM to 11:50AM. I would miss almost 3 classes by then. And I just got hired! Well that’s on me.

But I just wish to know, would Amazon help change schedule for a student? 

I really want to work because of personal issues and need to pay. Well it’s mainly for my pets health. And I also need to study for a better career.

If anyone knows who I can contact or some good advice, I appreciate it. Thank you!


EXTRA:
Also the people at Amazon are really nice, I asked them for help guiding me in building and they did so politely. I was anxious but that disappeared after meeting polite employees, just wanted to share cause it’s stuck in my mind."

After I have finished law school what would happen next? Also how easy is it to pursue criminal law and potentially become a barrister?

However, I can't see myself doing this forever. 


Basically, all we do at work is receive invoices from trucking carriers that bill our clients. We go over the invoices, make sure that our client isn't being wrongly charged and then we approve them. We use excel 20% of the time, the rest of the time we use the companies own TMS software. 



My questions is: What type of skills can I learn to eventually get a better paying job? What type of jobs are out there that pay well and require these type of skills? I truly enjoy working with numbers, on the computer, and specifically in excel.
I'd like to learn SQL and more Excel. Maybe even learn how to automate my job. The goal is to be able to work from home so that I can have a better quality of life and actually see my daughter for more than a few hours a day.

25 y/o and have a decision to make of either becoming an entry level welder or an electrician at GDEB. 

I’m told because I don’t have any substantial experience in either field that my base pay would be the same for either position. 

I’m wondering if anyone here has any insight to either jobs, a compare and contrast if you will. 

I’ve heard great things and I’ve heard horror stories about the place. 

I don’t mind hard work or getting dirty and I’m aware there can be great advancement in either field. 

With that being said no disrespect but I have a feeling that the electrician route would be more challenging from a text book point of view (I’m aware how ignorant that can sound) but also it can generally be more “relaxed”(I’ve worked on some residential contracts in the past and they were generally the least dirty and overwhelmed at the end of the day with other guys calling them the white colors of the blue collars) 

on the other hand I feel that welding is more of an art that takes many hours to perfect and is generally more repetitive/hazardous depending on the contract.

Last bit is that if I’m understanding this correctly, unless I were to leave the company after a few years and work private contracts or do my own thing or move to another company, the rate as which I receive raises will stay the same unless I were to receive additional training for a more specialized version of either trade while with GDEB. 

Anyways if anyone has any opinions regarding either trades in general and possibly with EB I would be great-full"
6,2023-01-08,I was let go by my company and then my manager let me know I would be considered for another role. How do I navigate this?,u/baconanustart,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/106qmb3/i_was_let_go_by_my_company_and_then_my_manager/,careerguidance,"Around a month ago I was informed that my 1 year contract wouldn’t be renewed, contrary to what I had been told previously. I was told it had nothing to do with my performance, that they liked me but ultimately they didn’t need me for my role anymore. 

It sucked, but I cleaned up my CV and started applying for other jobs. My last day in this role should be in around a month. 

In conversation with the CEO of the company, I casually mentioned that for my next job, I would try to break into a role in a different field (marketing).  It then dawned on him that he may need to hire someone for a similar position and asked if I’d consider staying with them. 

I feel a little awkward about the whole thing, but I like the company a lot and I think this is something I would want. I’m a junior in the job market and it would be hard for me to get an entry level marketing role elsewhere. So this opportunity sounds great. I also really like the people I work with and the management team is great, even though they’re acting a little awkward now. 

I’m just not sure how to behave, as weird as this may sound. I’m pretty enthusiastic about the new role but I’m trying not to seem desperate especially since I had also been considering asking for a raise (I was basically receiving minimum wage before, for an entry level HR role). I expect the CEO to discuss this role with me soon. It’s not set in stone yet so there is still a chance he’ll change his mind or figure it wouldn’t work out. It’s pretty much a waiting game now. 

I’m acting pretty nonchalant about the whole being let go thing and even cracked a couple of jokes about it with the CEO because that’s kind of my personality, and also because I recognize that it is a business decision which I don’t take personally. But I’m not sure if I should keep my guard up. Generally I’m just worried I’ll regret my current approach somewhere down the line or that I’m being naive. 

Anyone been in a similar position? Any advice?"

In May, I will have been with my current company for 2 years. I signed on with them the week after finishing my BA.

For the past year, I served as a project administrator that moved between teams as workloads dictated. Very recently, I was moved to work under the director of operations on a very short-term basis, as they needed help with a time-sensitive issue.

They day after I moved over, the full-time person working for the director announced they were drastically cutting back on their hours. This left a need for a full-time person to fill that role. I was approached by the director with this information a couple f days later and told the position is mine if I want it. 

I agreed, as I have been wanting to transition from pt to ft for a few months and really wanted to have some stability regarding my team placement. In each conversation I have with the director, they mention that by the end of Q1, they want to bring in a manager for me to report to – someone who will be able to see the big picture and improve overall quality.

So far, I have gotten positive feedback and have had a few of my ideas for new projects accepted. I get along well with the director. I feel uneasy when the manager is mentioned, because I really want to be that manager, but don’t know if it’s inappropriate to mention it.

The director made a promotion announcement for me Friday afternoon, so I worry that asking for a promotion will be seen as ungrateful or ridiculous. It was a promotion in terms of money and full-time status, but I am considering it a lateral move because my title did not change.

I feel well qualified to take on the role of manager. I have 3 years of supervisory experience at a previous company, a BA in org leadership and project management, good relationships with all my co-workers, etc. I know a lot of the problems and shortcomings of the company and have a lot of solutions in mind for how to improve things. 

So, is it rude for me to initiate a conversation about this with the director before they hire someone else? Do they keep mentioning this manager because they are hoping I will take the bait and ask about the position?"

**Current Company**

\- 15 years tenure

\- $125K Base (under market)

\- Very comfortable, reasonable workload.

\- One bonus up to 10% possible in mid-2023, but not likely. 2nd 10% bonus guaranteed at end of 2023. 2024+ bonuses unknown.

\- WFH w/ optional local office use.

\- Promotion+Role Change expected/quasi-forced in next couple months.  Don't know all details, not expecting much pay increase -- assume 8%?

\- Company stagnant, bleeding money and in the red. Future uncertain beyond 1 year as company continually moving resources overseas.

\- Eventual layoff could result in massive severance.

\- Nearly 10 weeks of PTO/Sick per year. I typically take 95% of it.

\- 4.5 day workweek.

&amp;#x200B;

**Potential New Company (In Negotiation)**

\- $155K Base (reasonable market)

\- Unknown comfort level, workload.  Assume higher workload, they seem understaffed and disjointed.

\- Bonus details unknown at this time. Possible stock options.

\- WFH w/ no local office.

\- Lateral Move.  Same position.

\- Company growing, but bleeding money and in the red.

\- ""Unlimited PTO"" policy.

\- 5 day workweek.

&amp;#x200B;

**My Situation**

\- 20 year tech career.

\- Overall, a generalist ""Systems Engineer"" caught between Ops, IT, Dev.

\- Live in average CoL area.

\- House paid off.  No debt.  Healthy savings.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concerns**

\- Promotion/role change at current company is a bit of a niche position.  Not ultra-transferrable like current position.

\- Eventually get laid off from current company, severance not what was expected.

\- ""Unlimited PTO"" at new company is BS.

\- No local office to go to.  Cabin fever.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I do Know**

\- I can fully trust who my new manager will be at current company, assuming promotion/shift occurs how I expect.  I can't say the same for my current manager.

\- Money isn't everything.

\- I'll never see this much PTO time again at another job.

This job is 8,30 - 18 and I need on hour and a half to get to work and the same amount to get back from the office. Although I am just an intern, I always kept learning as much as possible and I always showed myself available for many different activities, and so I am achieving some independence and many people (tutors and the tutors' managers) keep assigning more and more ""autonomous"" work that piles up on top of what I usually do with my tutors. By no means I am directing the company by myself, but the amount of activities is heavy, as it keeps endlessly piling up. 
During this experience of mine I am also studying to get my master's degree, so my free time basically amounts to zero.
Long story short, I am getting to a point where my personal life and my mental health is being entirely sacrificed to everything I ""ought to do"" (work+study). 
My question is: will this be how everything will turn out to be from now on? 
The point is that I am not afraid to make effort and to work (I am thrilled at the idea to grow professionally and to learn about the HR world), but I am afraid that my whole life will be set around that. This is what I am afraid of, that a 40h/week job will force itself as the center of my life. Working is important as you can grow and (most importantly) one has to earn to sustain himself, but do I have to sacrifice my whole life for it?"

The restaurant has become a staple in the community and we have very loyal clientele. For the past decade I helped manage it and have been the manager on duty 5 days a week. Doing it and all the tasks required has become second nature to me. Scheduling, micromanaging employees, writing people up, dealing with extremely difficult customers, big parties, vendors, you name it I've done it. I also do bookwork but it's very simple Microsoft word number entry. Only making $20/hr but picking up tables here and there bumped that up to over $25-$30/hr with tips.

Well, our landlord got an offer from some big corporation and they gave us a 90 day notice to shut the business down. It was clearly a huge blow to the family as its supported all of us for decades and became a way of life. As you can imagine, my mind is going 1000 mph thinking what my future holds.

My question is where to go from here. I ideally don't want to stick to restaurant management because I'm tired of the super late hours that makes a normal life impossible. A 9-5 job with benefits sounds amazing. My question is what do my prospects look like as far as putting my experience towards a decent job that's not minimum wage? I have an AA degree from a community college that I got nearly 15 years ago so I could build on that, but I'm not sure what the best degree choice would be that would supplement my current resume. I would prefer a career path that allows me to work with employees throughout the day as opposed to sitting at a desk typing away at a computer. I'm just not the cubicle type. I loved the big picture day to day operations/helping my employees solve problems aspect of my job, but I know that might not translate as well to a resume as something like a degree in accounting or coding.

Does anyone have any idea as to where I should start looking? My mind has been in a mess stressing out over my future. I know my options are open as I have no kids and I'm single, but I help care for my mother who is ill and it keeps my options slightly less open. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I really, really need advice.

I am a 22 year old woman who has no idea on what to do with my life in regards to my (future) career. I live in Canada and attended university studying Business &amp; Society. I completed my first year but the next was the year Covid-19 pandemic hit and I fell into deep depression and anxiety and had to take the year off. I took the next year off after that and the fall semester of 2022 but I feel like I could come back to school now after intensive therapy and counseling. During my terrible 2 years I lost all motivation in my education and career goals. My will to live has come back but nothing else really.

I am literally only going back to school because I want a job that gives good pay. I want to have a job that can let me live a comfortable life a.k.a I can pay my bills and have some spare on the side. I don't mind a 9-5 office job or no excitement in the workplace. I have no interests beyond that and counseling is not helping my mindset.

In high school I was set on getting into healthcare field of work, but sciences/math is clearly not my forte so I went into business for a program that accepted okay grades. I don't hate studying business but I don't like it either, it's what I am okay at and I can live with that.

I think I want to change my program but I don't know if my low grades and nonattendance will let me and I am scared to ask my school's academic office (still working on my anxiety). But with no motivation with a career in mind I don't even know what I should change to. HR, Bus Admin, something else entirely? I really don't have experience in anything worthwhile either. Did a retail job in my teens and did a work from home customer service job during the pandemic to support myself and my family but that's it.

Another issue is I feel like I am so far behind my peers and I'm embarrassed that this is the situation I am in at this age. All of my siblings attended university with no qualms and here I am who should have been completed her undergrad by now but has wasted some years of my life doing absolutely nothing. Younger me never thought that this would happen and I feel like crying over how pathetic my life has become over some stupid mental barriers I have.

I feel like I wrote a whole lot of nothing but to get to the point, what should a person with no career ambitions or goals study? Should I even go back to uni as there is good paying jobs that don't require degrees? And if not, what are some low effort degrees and programs in business (or not business) that will land me a career anyone can lead a decent life with?

tldr: wants to go back to school but does not know what to study, no motivation or career in mind, needs advice on that"

That all being said, I want to start building a career and stop taking random jobs since they are just what come up.

When I started college, I wanted to ultimately end up at an NGO, and thought maybe I'd be a good fit at something like the UN. As an adult, I realize I didn't really do the networking in college that I would have needed to start to build that type of career, nor do I have the funds to take years of unpaid internships and fellowships until I get my break. How ever, I want to keep my career focus on a job that let's me make a difference with an international perspective.

I’m embarrassed to say that I didn’t know employees are supposed to ask for one. I’ve always worked as a performer and taught privately on the side, but liked the stability and camaraderie this academy offers, even though they hired me at less than half of what I charge privately. When initially hired (at $20/hr) I was told that the highest paid person there (he’d been there for 10 years at the time) was making $25/hr. 

Right before Covid I learned that we won’t get a raise unless we ask. I had a ridiculously high retention rate at the time and planned on asking. Then Covid hit and the academy went virtual. The academy offered stable online teaching and I knew how lucky I was to be able to keep working. I had already been teaching my private students online for a few years, so I excelled with online lessons. 

Once the academy was ready to go back to in-person teaching I ended up having to get brain surgery for a health condition. Some things went wrong with the surgery and for almost a year I had trouble staying upright and could barley function. My boss has let me remain teaching at home since. 

Once I felt well enough to return, I sent an email saying I was ready, but heard no reply. When I saw my boss in person about a month ago at one of our recitals, he asked me when I would be ready to come teach in person again, as if he had never received my email. Not sure what happened with the communication there, but I told him that I’m ready whenever he needs me. 

Yesterday he asked me to come back to teach in person so I figured it would be a good time to ask for a raise. I googled what music teachers make at academies near me and stumbled on my academy’s job posting on Indeed. They’re hiring rate is 25% more than what I’m currently making! 

As I’ve been there for 6 years and have never asked for a raise, what would be an appropriate percentage to ask for?"

Right now Iam facing, probably the hardest decision on my life. Iam 22 years old and I've been studying business administration for 2 years. Turns out that, lately, I've been feeling unhappy with my choice and I'am, more than ever, thinking into transfering to Computer Science. Naturally, it is important to add that I have full scholarship. Therefore, Iam more worried with time than money (Since I dont pay for tuition).

Now, here is the shit. I'am enrolled in a student exchange program to go to France and study business at ESSEC 6 months. With this program, iam going to finish my business bachelor degree only 2024.2.

So now, I really dont know if I should:

1- Go to France and finish my business degree at the end of 2024, then, after that, do another undergraduate course on CC starting right at the start of 2025. This undergraduate course would be in Portugal, taking 3 years to complete.

or

2- Change now to Computer Science and delay my exchange program to France for 1,5 years. This CC course would take 4 years. I would have my diploma around 2026.2.

or

3- I could try to enroll into a masters on CC, if I fit the requirements.

Since I've been taking this issue really emotionally, I need help to find new ways to see this situation."

I didn’t really know what I wanted but I always liked finance but after watching a lot of YouTube videos and reading Reddit and other forums people kept saying that the tech industry is so lucrative and that kind of made me want to also have a chance to work in the industry later(much of these were looking at the us where tech is much bigger than Europe where I live). I liked the idea of being a programmer but I had never done any programming. I chose this degree because I didn’t think about the things I liked but more how to be really employable in the future.

The classes are really boring. We always stay at the surface level of every subject and I feel like I’ve learned nothing. We just started programming a little bit and I got a little excited just for the teacher to tell us we won’t be going to really learn how to program just how we communicate with programmer’s in business. The business classes are also very surface level without any numbers something I do miss as I said I’ve always loved finance and using numbers.

I take full responsibility for not asking more questions before I started the degree. the thing I learned the most is I really love diving deep into a specific subject instead of having a lot of skills at a low level. I also found out don’t like communicating very much, the problem is this is really important in this degree. 

Has anyone felt like this while studying a degree?what did you do? Is it because it’s just my first year? Do I stay and figure out what to d or quit work a little bit figure out what I really want and switch to something else next year? (If I quit a before February I get all my money back.)"

i would like to apply for similar roles at the various hospitals in NYC, but fear my midwest address will deter them from taking me seriously for such “low qualification” jobs. 

will i have better luck if i move there first and can attend in person interviews and such?

tldr; move to NYC first then find a job? or find a job first then move to NYC?

thank you all"

I am 22 years old, currently a server at a “higher-end” restaurant but it’s physically, mentally, and emotionally stressful. I dropped out of college halfway through my sophomore year because I didn’t know what I wanted to major in. All of my current experience is food-related but I’m looking to get out of it. I have manager experience but I would rather work up to that at a new place. I’m very good with people. I don’t want to sound cocky, but I’m really good at getting people to like me (laid back, good listener/conversationalist, not confrontational). Although I’m good with people, I’m not pushy enough to be in sales. I’ve thought about getting into a trade, but I don’t necessarily have a mechanical aptitude. Real estate has always interested me, but I don’t have a huge sphere of influence and the market recently has been crazy. I love sports (mainly football) and gaming but I’m not creative or good enough to have a career in either of those cultures. Any advice is appreciated, thank you if you have read all of this."

2,2023-01-08,Unable to transfer internally and capped out potential in role - what do I do?,u/k19972019,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/106yred/unable_to_transfer_internally_and_capped_out/,careerguidance,"I’ve been at the same company for about a year and a half and love the company culture, friends I’ve made, flexibility, remote work, etc. When I joined the company, I was dying to leave my past employer and was really excited at the prospect of working here. However, my role is fairly tactical/in the details/some admin work whereas my past job was very strategic. In some ways feel like I took a step down from my past job with this role, despite a higher salary here, because I have rarely been challenged.

I currently work on the largest business in my organization and am up for promotion, yet nothing would change upon promotion besides my title and pay. There is nowhere to go/grow since people in my org work up to working on the larger businesses and I am on the largest. I am honestly bored and do not feel challenged and like my skills could be better utilized elsewhere.

I’ve been firm with my boss about needing to move into a specific role of interest for ~1 year now. I’m passionate about that area of business and have networked with a ton of people in those roles. I know I’d do a great job in this role. But due to a hiring freeze and team departures that we haven’t been able to backfill, I’ve been stuck in my current role. 

The worst part is that earlier this year, I actually did the role I want for a few months when there was a gap on that team - I loved it and leaders of that org had a role identified for me to interview for. Quite literally two weeks later, the company-wide hiring freeze went into effect and that team lost its additional headcount. Since people in my own organization have left and we can’t backfill, my org’s leadership has been firm in not allowing people to transfer because we can’t lose more heads.

The people I work with are kind and I really love the company and its values, but I’m only in my mid-20s and feel like this is way too early in my career to be settling for something I don’t love + not continuing to learn and be challenged. I’m struggling to come to terms with this because of how great my work life balance is and coworkers are, but I feel like I’ve been strung along for long enough and I’m now doing my own career a disservice by playing this waiting game.

Over the holidays, a recruiter at a competitor reached out to me regarding the exact role I want to pursue at my current company at their company. I have an interview this Friday. Who knows if I’ll like the culture/people/job there as much as I like my current company, but I am going to take the call and learn as much as I can. 

That being said, I want to give my company one last shot to try to move me. I’ve been firm in the past but never so firm in essentially saying I’ll leave if they don’t transfer me. I don’t want to give an ultimatum but rather lay it all on the table and express that I’ve been waiting to follow my career interests for a year now. 

How do I play this with my boss? Does anyone have any advice in this situation? I have been a top performer since day one so I’m hoping I have some leverage here, but I want to be tactful.

Thank you!"

I have a lot of mental disorders. to start off, I have minor learning autism, math dyscalculia, ADD, and auditory processing disorder. As for the math dyscalculia, I literally have the math level of a 2nd grader and can’t do any form of mental math even if it’s basic adding and subtracting. So I cannot do anything related to math or finances. People never take me seriously when I say this but I am not exaggerating at all. School has always been a struggle for me even with disability accommodations. I am currently in community college and I don’t plan to go to university because I am like hanging on by a thread here.

Secondly, my learning disorders also gave me severe depression and anxiety… which complicates things even more for me.

So with everything being said… what are good jobs/careers you would recommend for someone like me? I just need something I can live off of. I wouldn’t mind having to do a training program or having to get a certificate for something but I absolutely will not go to university after I get my associates degree. I don’t even care what the job is I just need something I can make a living from. Everyone says you don’t need to go to college in order to be successful but other than trade school… what are the other options?

I was the managing director for a small company (8 figures in annual revenue) and HQ decided to downsize. Now, after frantically applying to any job I can, I miraculously have 2 offers on the table, and it becomes a first world problem where I'm having a tough time to decide.

**Offer 1:** Managing director at an even tinier company at $200k comp with incentives correlated to revenue (around 5%)

This will be a pay cut, as I initially received $280k in the last company, but what's there to complain about? I lost my job. The high incentive scheme is very tempting, but there is no business yet in my country, and the risk is high being a market launcher. In the near term, I think I can bring about $500k in annual revenue in the first year. Also, there will be equity valued at about $200k, much like the last company. But I never think much about equity in these types of companies.

It's very high risk, but the company has already 1-2 high profile clients in the country, which is why they are confident in landing boots on the ground and hiring someone like me. Also, I expect high work life balance and flexibility, as I am the boss of everything and will dictate my location and schedule by myself. Great for career as it's in a field where a lot of UN and political funding is at, so I may be very sought after in 3 years if this works out. **IF**.

**Offer 2**: Senior manager at established company at $300k

Nobody reports to me, I am just in charge of 2 portfolios. It almost feels like a glorified admin. Medium work life balance, I can't dictate the schedule, and it's absolutely mandatory to be in the office 5 days a week, but they respect my holidays and try to keep within office hours.

The industry here is not super serious like the first one with UN funding and all, but it's super fun! I will be sent to conferences around the world. So it gives me the impression that I will be a highly paid admin in a fun industry but my career would stagnate.

**Initial thoughts**

I'm trending towards Offer 2, but there might be a tinge of regret in not taking Offer 1. Both industries are recession proof and grew throughout covid-19 and the current economy. Both roles will offer more work life balance than what I initially had, which had a crazy schedule, crazy stress, and no boundaries - I had meetings with the founder CEO sometimes starting at 1030pm. However, at this moment, I am tired of picking roles with a lot of ""ifs"" in the name of career advancement (looking at you, Offer 1). I'd likely be stuck in the same salary bracket and same company for years to come with Offer 2, but I feel like settling down for a few years of stability given the current climate.

I currently work from home and enjoy my job. I have always valued my career and drive to be successful, but ever since my husband and I found out I was pregnant, my job no longer feels important to me like it did before. 

I am already dreading the thought of juggling a corporate career and being a mom, which has me daydreaming about quitting my job. The problem is, I still want to have my own “thing.” I want to still feel fulfilled in my life outside of being a mom and wife. I’ve been researching and reading up on all kinds of freelancing and entrepreneurship ideas, but the thought of working with clients doesn’t sound much different than working for an employer. I know the big difference is you decide what you’re worth and who you work with, but at the end of the day, you’re still answering to someone else. That is hard for me to accept as I really want to enjoy whatever path I take. 

I’ve just been feeling lost and even when I feel like I have a great idea to pursue, I feel it still isn’t a great fit. I’m probably being too picky, but am looking for guidance, suggestions or advice from other women who have been in a similar position.

Me and my Wife are hoping to work a remote, part-time/contract job working about 6 hours a day for 2 days or in winter seasons to earn approximatley £7,500. Any suggestions would be great!

Context:

Me and My wife have recently gotten a smallholding in the UK where we currently cover about 60% of our total living expenses. We've calculated to be comfortable on the smallholding we'll need to bring in about £15,000 between us. So we're currently looking for a job that only requires a few hours a week or in the winter season as the farm is very busy.

I have a Bsc in Psychology and my wife a Bsc in Biology, good wi-fi and PC. I have a few years experience as a Data Analyst and my wife only has retail experience (We're both very young) but was hoping to hear a large range of options. I'm open to stranger positions. I prefer more introverted jobs but I'm comfortable talking to people. I love to learn and would enjoy trying something new.

I understand we're being quite picky so all suggestions welcome.

Thanks everyone!!!"

My latest idea is to maybe become a Project Manager in Tech/Software development? It seems like my pay would be the same initially but I would have much more income potential overtime? I believe I would have to take a Google Certificate course or something similar to learn and then pass a PMP certification?

I don’t have a background in tech but I can definitely show on my resume that I have project management experience, I was an Executive Assistant for 3 years prior to this role.

I don’t really care for Science as a subject of study, but I wish I did. I struggle immensely with Math, which apparently you need to use more than once to be a Librarian, which is a career I researched (googled). 

I read to be a Librarian you have to have “analytical skills” which like, holy shit, I am NOT analytical. Except for when I’m opening up &amp; dissecting all of my most embarrassing moments. 

Becoming a Librarian I considered in the first place because I have crippling social anxiety and nobody thinks a quiet librarian is weird. Also, I really do enjoy reading when I can detach myself from social media and actually focus on a book.

A little more info: Right now I’m about to start my first semester of community college at 19, and I’m majoring in psychology. I tell people around me that I want to be a social worker but I’ve started to think it may be too stressful a job for me to thrive in. I chose it because I myself am very mentally ill, so maybe I could help someone else with mental illness. But I actually think my mental illnesses severely impacts my ability to even help anyone else. I can barely help myself if I’m being honest. 

I feel as if there is no place in the world I could succeed. The next 2 years of College offer me a sort of escape because I can make it appear like I have some sort of life-direction, when really I’m walking around playing “pin the tail on the donkey” trying to locate the best career for me considering my average abilities. 

Worst comes to worst, I apply for disability and become a prolific part-timer. Or maybe I’ll sell my organs on the black market, we will see. (also I do think I might actually be disabled and the state sent me disability papers even, so don’t come for me for that plz)"

To sum up, I was contacted by a recruiter recently, and have received an offer for $120k from a new company. Current salary is $88k. After all benefits are considered it’s a TC increase of 30%, with slightly worse benefits (especially pto), but much better salary. While the decision might seem easy, I’m still feeling some conflict. I’ll elaborate:

Current Job
- high travel (60%), high stress.
- Interesting work, very dynamic. I like the industry.
- I’m learning meaningful new skills.
- There’s been a lot of turmoil during my tenure. My original boss did not provide direction, so I essentially managed myself for almost 1.5 years. We’ve had a restructure, during which my original boss left, and I got a new boss.
- I considered quitting, but I decided to stick it out after getting a new boss. Overall things have gotten even more stressful, I travel even more, but I’m learning a lot. My new boss seems fairly invested in my career.
- Salary has not meaningfully increased since I started. With inflation I take home less every month now than when I began.
- Overall I’m learning a very competitive skillset here, which could help me write my ticket in a few years. It is a high stress demanding role though, that has definitely left me feeling burned out.

New Job
- Much lower travel (10%).
- Work seems less dynamic, but still interesting.
- Role seems like a much less stressful environment overall.
- The company is progressive and growing. I loved the team members I met.
- New job would be a career shift. I’d be giving up a path I’ve been pursuing for the past few years. This is bittersweet.
- A new, high dollar industry. Strong potential career path.
- I’m concerned about job hopping, especially while the economy is shaky. This would be my third company, entering the 6th year of my career. Average tenure of 2.5 years. Money has never been the sole reason for leaving for me. I don’t want to be seen as a job-hopper, and do want to invest in a longer term career somewhere, I just don’t think if I’ve found the right place yet. 

In summary, the new job looks like a good opportunity from every angle, but I feel bittersweet about leaving my current role when things are finally improving. I also am getting married this year, so getting out of the high travel lifestyle feels appealing on its own. I’d be willing to stick with my current employer for a bit longer, because of the skills I’m gaining, but I want to know that there is a strong path here for me, not to mention I feel a bit underpaid. I plan to discuss the topic with my boss this week. What are everyone’s thoughts?"

16,2023-01-09,Girlfriend got laid off from her first (dream)job and feels heartbroken. How to move on?,u/RoughReset,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10765zg/girlfriend_got_laid_off_from_her_first_dreamjob/,careerguidance,"My girlfriend (22) got told that she would get laid off, together with about 10 other colleagues, last Friday.

She was working in a SaaS scale-up that had about 60-70 people working for them.

The company is facing uncertain financial/economical times.

She applied there in the summer of 2021, started her internship in March 2022, did very well, starting working there in June 2022 and got a fixed contract in October.

She’s really ambitious and legitimately hard working, but of course… it’s her first job.

She’s a pretty sensitive and introvert person that doesn’t always feel accepted or heard somewhere, but has loved working there since day one.

She actually also grew really fast from having a simple marketing assistant role to a role where she would take the lead regarding some employer branding and recruitment projects. She also single-handedly launched a podcast together with the CEO and co-founder, where she was the project manager that had to overlook deadlines of f.e. copywriters, designers, video editors, etc.

I’m an experienced marketing professional myself and I’ve supported, mentored and coached her through the last months.

When she got laid off, people at the company got told that she was the only one of the 11 people that got laid off, where it didn’t had anything to do with performance. She got told the same thing.

Long story short, the news was very unexpected and extremely heartbreaking, since she felt accepted since day one, absolutely loved doing what she did and all the chances and respony that came together with it.

She feels really scary about the future. Scared to not being able to find another ‘perfect’ company where she gets such a role and responsibilities, scared about not getting accepted as an introvert as much and scared about having to work in a company that she doesn’t really fundamentally loves.

Since I was next to her since day one, I basically feel the same anxiety, while I’m a really stable and mentally strong person in general.

She needs to hand in her laptop and iPhone today, and after that it’s done.

What can I do for her? How can I avoid her falling into a black hole without purpose?

We don’t live together, and her home situation isn’t super great… 

She loved having a somewhat busy schedule, being around great people daily and now she will be at home, without having a lot of people to talk to, without really having something to do,… 

It’s like she’s going through a severe and very unexpected break-up…

TLDR

Girlfriend got laid off for financial reasons at her first (dream)job and doesn’t know how to cope with it and move on."

&amp;#x200B;

|**Work History**||
|:-|:-|
|*Employment Gap* | I was able to secure a job at WNS Global Services Pvt. Ltd for Software Engineer in 2010, however, due to some miscommunicated error, things didn’t pan out. That drove me away from the job industry to entrepreneurial prospects. I ventured into Amazon Seller Program, freelancing, and other stuff. None of which sustained the test of time. During freelancing, I worked on a few major projects which are listed below for reference.  |
|**Notable Projects**||
|*Register Maintenance System*| The project requirement was to build a goods transaction register for the business entity, along with the ability to generate Invoices and Debit notes. I choose C# as the backend language and Windows Presentation Foundation Framework for the same. Since the register will be refreshed yearly with limited data scope, I used XML file as the backend database. In the application, a user could add/edit ledgers (sellers/buyers), enter transaction records, and also generate and print Invoices/Debit Notes for those transactions. Code available on GitHub|
|*Price Comparison Website*| I also developed a price comparison website using ASP.NET MVC framework with C# as the backend language. For data purposes, Entity Framework and LINQ were used to query the MSSQL database. In the backend, the admin had the ability to add brands, categories, products, and more. The goal was to show the current price of a product on various websites. This was done by scraping the product URLs (added during the product addition itself). I also made use of jquery elements during the UI development. Code available on GitHub|
|*Shopify Store Setup*|The project requirement was to design and set up a Shopify store as per the client’s vision. To achieve the desired result, I modified the existing template using HTML and CSS. Changes were made to the home, category, and product page as suggested along with adjustments for the mobile interface.|
|**Education**|Computer Science Graduate B.E|

Do you think any one of these Google certificates will add value to my resume and help me land a job? Or should I do anything else in the same field or new like Data analytics, ML, or AI?"

So the lowest I’d accept would be $106k.
I’d be asking for $115k

Any advice?,u/lobstersndragons,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/107a51s/graduated_with_a_bs_in_physics_five_gap_years_now/,careerguidance," I graduated in 2018 with a BS in Physics from India. Took a gap year to work on GRE and IELTS, certificate courses and to search for and apply to universities in the US that accepted a 3-year undergrad graduate (there weren't many). Finally joined a university in upstate NY for MS Physics in 2019. After one semester, I decided that high-level physics wasn't for me, and that I did not have a career in it. I discontinued the course and returned to India as 2020 began.

Now 3 years have gone by and I have not done a single thing career-related. No certificate courses, no internships, no work experience, nothing. Tbh for the whole of 2020, I was terrified of taking another step in my education. *What if I took the wrong decision again? What if I wasted more money on a bad career choice?* These past few years have been filled with self-doubt and confusion about which career path was best suited to me.

But now I have decided that the tech/CS field is what suits me best, and I would like to pursue an MS in an appropriate program in the UK (one year MS) this year. Probably an MS in CS that doesn't require a background in the same. Undecided on the exact specialization I want to choose. What worries me is that come May, I will effectively have a 5 year break (2018 - now) in my education where I don't have much to show for. Will this be a problem while applying to universities in Europe/elsewhere? Do I need to address this on my applications? How do I deal with this situation?"

I'm in need of some career advice and hopefully you all can help me.

I (30, male) have been working at my current workplace for 4.5 years now. This is my first proper/professional job, and I started out as a Management Trainee. It is a relatively small and I’m in a regional position (max is 50 employees for regional)

My current job:

* I like what I am doing, it’s slow pace and certain days I have very little to do but that how just it is.
* Working arrangement is still hyrid, and my direct boss/supervisor doesn’t really care much if I head to office or not.
* The working environment are pretty chill and very flexible, and people are great so far with very little politics.
* I have some opportunities for work-travel.
* Small 4-man team with amazing teamwork and camaraderie. All of different nationalities.
* Most staffs in the regional office have a good working attitude, no micro-managing, very open to feedback and willing to try new ideas from someone “lower in rank”
* The only issue for me is that they pay slightly lower than the average (not a deal breaker to be honest, since working environment is pretty great) and I just feel the need to be challenged mentally or workwise.

Recently I just started randomly applying for a similar position within the industry and got an offer.

* Hybrid-work environment (only 1 day in office)
* Salary is higher than average and $1,000 more than what I am earning right now
* A much bigger and more reputable MNC with thousand of employees.
* The team is small as well and are made up of local of the same nationalities
* During the team interview, it was mentioned that it’s a high paced work environment but there is still work-life balance.
* Slightly better benefits and welfare.
* Interesting job scope and slightly higher responsibility.

Here is my dilemma, I’m not going to lie but I actually like my current job/workplace/company. In fact, I’m in a regional leadership training course where only 10 selected individuals are part of it. My direct supervisor is a great guy who looks out for me and is a very chill dude. Old with huge experience but not a boomer. Obviously, the salary offer from the new place got to me and I’m conflicted if I should leave a place with great working environment just for much higher pay? A part of me is telling me that because I’ve been way too comfortable in my current position that is why I don’t want to leave. At the same time the jobscope of the new place is interesting and I want to challenge myself but at the same time what if I can’t live up to the expectations of the new workplace? At my current workplace, since it’s small, I know a lot of the higher ups and there is a very short line between me and them, but I don’t/have not capitalize on that.

So yeah, this is where I am right now. Still split 50/50 between leaving and staying and I can’t make up my mind. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated."

I'm 21 and I feel like I'm at a huge crossroad in my life.

For the past 4 months, I've been preparing a portfolio to attend an art school. It's a ""3D animation for Film and Games"" Diploma starting this fall. I've been in contact with alums and professors, and it seems like I have a decent portfolio. But last month, I was offered a complete web development grant at a Bootcamp. It's the top Bootcamps in my City, It would feel like a lost opportunity not to take this.

It's 3 months long and starts at the beginning of march around my portfolio/application cutoff. If I were to take this opportunity I would most likely balance internships or a junior development position while attending University. I'm terrified about the thought that my internship is going to take up too much time for class and networking. Or straight-up resign for my junior development position. Is there any point in balancing school while working in a different industry?

I live in Vancouver, and been told there are plenty of job opportunities for 3d animators from alums. I'm not sure about web development. I just know the internship/junior development acceptance rate for Bootcamp graduates is particularly high. (I have not been in contact with graduates)

I'm not particularly passionate about 3D animation or programming. Both careers feel neutral to me, so I wondered what other people think about the two industries and their experiences.

Sorry for such a long post,

I was still adamant about this and spent my final years at highschool following this one goal and busted my ass off. 

I wrote the selection exam, ranked wayy higher than I expected ( around 2000 out of  250000) and i also got selected by a good college. But got held back because I failed my physical exam (overweight and eyesight), so I had to take a year off and focused on my body. reduced weight and got corrective surgery for my eyes. I also wrote a selection exam that would allow me to take up Programming and web/App development(important for later) just to reduce the flak I was getting from my relatives.

But, at this period of time I started second guessing stuff. I went down a rabbit hole of researching the pros and cons and then I randomly found a video about programming. then as I started researching more about it, I started liking the idea of coding and all that jazz.

I am a young engineer who graduated last year. My bachelor is Mechanical engineering and I am very interested in mechanical design of components and mechanisms. 

My first and current job is in the IT department of a global corporation and I support and train engineers within CAD tools. I am grateful to have a job related to my field in times of uncertainty and rising unemployment, but it's not fully fulfilling to me. I have been at this job for about one year but would like to change to something more directly related to mechanical design in the future. 

Do you have any advice on how and when to switch position within the company without letting down my current team? Also do I first inform my colleagues or do I apply first? If I apply, will my colleagues know I applied?"

This means going from a educated job position (i have a master degree in my actual field) into something where the requirements are less and the job is simpler, more phisically tiring but more profitable.

Looking at the posts in this and other similar reddits I keep getting the feeling that Americans earns so much more than Europeans. I hear multiple stories of people making over 6 figures in the us in pretty early stages in their careers. On the other hand, it’s pretty common in Europe to see people still making around 50/60k around the same seniority level. 

Anyone with a little more to say about that?

The PIP was supposed to end later this month, but it ended two weeks early because I was told my improvements weren't enough to stay on. At the end, I tried my hardest to stall as long as possible and cast a safety net as wide as possible.  My confidence and self esteem took a huge blow because I failed the PIP earlier than expected. I was at this role for about a year. 

My previous role before this was a project engineer in the pharmaceutical industry. At the end, I couldn't see myself working in manufacturing for the long term. I left that role to take the tech consulting role so I could try something new, which gave me some coding experience. 

I'm trying to recover from being fired as the days leading up to it were full of stress and anxiety. I've never had to dread about work on the weekends as bad as this before and it affected my sleep. The stress and anxiety levels for this job was a lot higher than my college years because I knew my job was on the line. At the end, I was put into a situation where I wasn't going to win, and I feel my safety net aren't as wide as I hope for when I was let go.

At the end, I realized that consulting wasn't the career path for me. I feel lost as I'm trying to figure out what role should look for next. I came out of the consulting role with some coding skills, but the tech industry is not looking so good right now. I feel lost and I'm worried about my job search.

Nor would I ever want to. Also, this is gonna be a longer post, I'm sorry and thanks for reading!

With that out of the way - greetings y'all,

I'm turning 30 this year and, as is custom it seems, have been wondering what the shit I'm doing with my life.

At the moment I'm employed as a service desk agent (think callcenter x 1st level support) for a hospital. I got into that position (19k after taxes / year) cause I finished an apprenticeship in the field.
Then I went to uni to get degrees in history and English studies. Turns out, they're fucking worthless on the job market cause there's 0 offers in that field in any way, shape of form
 And no, I don't want to become a teacher cause I don't have the mental fortitude for that shitshow.

Be there as it may, I want to delve into a creative field. I'm a good and experimental cook, a decent creative and academic writer, like working with cloth and am currently teaching myself how to draw properly, both digitally and traditionally.

So, now I wonder, what fields and education could I look into? My biggest issue is that I can't quit work to pursue another college - public or community - education cause I need the money. Furthermore, most of the stuff that I could do is only during working hours or in massive blocks at night (like 5 hours each day in the evening every day of the week for three years).

I kinda don't want to stay in IT either cause what I've experienced of it is just *insanely* boring, dry, badly paid and has a massive barrier of entry for some of the more interesting things."

Worked at top investment banks and pivoted to a much smaller firm. Left because I was overworked but I loved my team. Bosses supported me. I was an associate. 

At my new job, it is for lack of better words, just a train wreck. I was hired as an associate but my title in the system is analyst. I have never had a 1:1 meeting with anyone. My “manager” (i think - still not clear after 3 months) is a 25 year old who half trains me on things. I have not had a single conference call since I joined. I sit on excel trying to figure out what my maybe manager half trained me on and send out reports. There is no social interaction as part of the job

In my opinion, there is really no pathway to success here. Im in a role for someone fresh out of college when I was running projects, leading analysts, and had a ton of support from every level of management. One other guy who started a year ago is constantly making mistakes and I feel bad for him because based on my experience he was simply never trained and pretty much has no manager either.

Im so miserable doing work I dont understand with no real management. Took so many steps back in this role. Only positive is the pay.

I have a non compete and a 3 month notice period. Im debating resigning because I think I can find something in 3 months (if I wait to find something they likely wont want a 3 month notice period). Im even debating paying an attorney to read over the terms of my contract 

Any advice? I cry pretty often thinking about my old job and how well respected and supported I was. I was constantly working but the difference was I understood what exactly I needed to do so the stress was different and I always had the support I needed. Ive had 2 internships and 2 full time roles in my career and none were like this"

So after I did a presentation at work. One colleague asked me a question.
And I told him “I am not sure, but I will find out and email you.”

A second colleague who does know the answer chimes in and then says to me “you should known this information”

And i responded, “excuse me, don’t speak to me that way” (that’s all I said)


And then later, the senior manager told me that wasn’t appropriate and I told her that my colleague didn’t have to say all that during the presentation.

Could I please get any thoughts or advice on if this was an okay response"

The other real issue I take is she pays my boss rent in a house my boss inherited. It's becoming clear that if it came down to me and this staff my boss would definitely throw me under the bus before her. I've tried to talk to her and all but I'm noticing a weaponized misery pattern. I've tried talking to my boss but get told to just get it done. As if the county I'm now running isn't the smoothest running in the state. I work hard and I'm proud of my work but this is a huge liability to me.

I'm on my third job in 6 months in three different specialities. With that being said, i just honestly want to get out. Before I chose nursing, accounting was one of the things i considered. But my dad told me its all numbers and stuff, instilling doubt. I know i ultimately chose the profession but I was so scared to do something else, my entire family is full of nurses. I'm just so lost right now. I'm jumping from different careers thinking I want to do them, like engineering (software, electrical, civil) to dental hygienist. The kicker is nursing has so many opportunities if I just get a year of experience in. However, I'm not even sure I can last that long, I just have constant dread and fear over this job. My anxiety and stress levels are exacerbated from this profession.

My personality is pretty quiet, i like working from home if possible. I also like focusing on one task at a time, preferably a slow paced environment. Any recommendations as to what I should do?"

I don't want to have to pickup new skills to stay up with changes.  I'm tired of the rat race.

However, I don't want my degree to go to waste.  I've been working with my current (very very small MSP) employer to work in different less technical areas like new client network discovery, which is nice, but it's not enough work to call it a position, it's just another task on top of my support work.  

On the other hand, moving to a trade skill sounds inviting, but I'm not sure what I'd even be interested in doing (ladders scare the piss outta me, so that takes out a lot of jobs right there)  Or something where I'm actually helping people (non-medical, like housing or food or something like that) but that kind of work in my area is pretty low pay, especially for someone starting new.

Just...not sure what to do."

The issue is that in my country, the legal system is not the greatest right now. Some cases go on for decades, to the point where the parties to the case end up passing away before the verdict. The judiciary is overburdened and there seems to be no solution in sight to this. 

I feel guilty saying this but I don't really want to spend my life working on cases that go on for years and years and years. For me personally, litigation is out of the question where I live. So, I'm thinking I'll get into alternative dispute resolution but that's not popular where I live so a career in it would not be viable. 

I tried finding out more about this but there's too much contradictory information and I'm getting very very confused. I could really use some help with this.

What are some countries where the legal system is really good, and there's scope for lawyers from other countries to practice in. Additionally, what are some of the places where ADR is popular and is a viable career option?

TLDR: I want to move out of my country to practice law, either litigation or ADR. What are some countries with a good legal system where I can work?"

I am confident in my preparation for the interviewing process, however I'm still unsure about job-specific questions they might have for me.

Immediately in the same conversation after shading her supervisors, she asked me in a belittling tone, “But you don’t have any teaching experience do you”? She kept pressing for me to answer the question and only later she seemed to realise she went too far with that comment and tried to brush it off as an innocuous question in a panic. 

In the moment I didn’t engage with her comment, but looking back I’m thinking I should have at least indirectly called her out on how inappropriate it was. This wasn’t the first time she made shady comments like this at my qualifications. Ironically for someone who can’t stop bragging about her decades of alleged experience while shading her coworkers, she’s pathetically devoid of basic communication skills.

Our combined comp was $425,000. I have not only been doing it all for 3 months, but now have additional duties of training replacements (now in the 3rd month, it's still just me alone).

I make $115,000 a year but am doing the work of the team leader who made $230,000 a year, plus my own job and a junior's job.  Besides my productivity being through the roof, I also lost all 7 vacation/holidays over December and early January because there was simply too much work and I had to do it instead of take vacation. (I am so n the States where, yes, your vacation can be denied.)

We get our bonuses at end of February.  I was STRONGLY warned that this employer may not give me a single penny more than they did last year.  I would resign on the spot - I am expecting at least double my last year's bonus as I have saved the company something like $50 - $60K over 3 months (when you combine my 2 ex-coworkers pay).  How do you think I should approach my boss about expected bonus?  Rumor is our company did better than ever in 2022 so that shouldn't be a problem.  Feedback on my performance over past few months has been excellent.

Edit: I do have a trump card.  My boss and I are the only two people in a department of 30 who have the license required to publish reports - and those reports are our lifeblood.  Even a person they hired who starts in a week doesn't have that license, and the fail rate for that license exam is high.  I am a nice person, but I basically have them by the balls until they get another person with that license, and in today's job market, that could take months.  I am also a woman if you couldn't guess and was 100% raised that *good work speaks for itself*.  After decades of being underpaid while outperforming peers, I learned that was a lie in the corporate world, and you get nothing unless you take it.

I just suck at negotiating -- I want double the bonus I got last year.  Help."

I lost my home in Hurrican Ida a year ago. FEMA did nothing. I got laid off. Since then I have been couch surfing. I'm actively looking for work, but nobody here hires very often, and the ones that do usually won't take me for my vision.

I'm looking for a career, or even a decent paying job that may be able to carry me through school at least.

Is there a profession that offers housing and training? I'm open to almost any option. If I didn't have this issue I would have probably gone back to the army for the job security and place to live. I'm out of options. I'm done being homeless. I want to move on with my life again."

I'm working two jobs to help pay off the resulting debt, a day job in IT, and a bartending job by night. At this point, my budget works and even lets me pay off a little debt each week, but my day job is pressuring me to come into the office now, after 3 years of working from home. This is not required of most employees, but for some reason the Powers That Be have decided to insist that my small team spend more time in the office. My boss was initially receptive to the idea of me working mostly from home and just covering for when no one else can make it into the office, but my coworkers are outwardly being defiant of this ask as well, since I've been working from home they don't want to come in unless I also come in (even though they have cars and easily make it into the office on a regular basis). It's caused a lot of tension in the office, one of my coworkers even started yelling at me in a meeting saying it is ""not fair"" that he has to come in if I don't. My boss shut him down quick and carried on with the meeting, but really didn't express an opinion on how he feels about the topic.

However, public transit in my city sucks, an 8 minute drive takes 2+ hours to navigate by bus, in fact it takes so long that even the first bus of the day cannot get me to the office sooner than 45 minutes late. During the summer I can and often do bike into the office, weather permitting, but during the harsh winter, my absolute only method of getting to work on time is paying for an expensive uber. It is slightly easier to take a bus back home (and it still includes a 45 minute walk in the cold), but to get to my second job on time I absolutely have to take an uber there as well. On average this would cost me at least an extra 300 bucks a week. Considering I make about 750 bucks a week at my day job (and maybe another 300 a week at the other gig, at least post holidays), this is something I absolutely cannot abide by.

The company I work for has generally been very good to me, and gives me a lot of room for growth. There are a lot of benefits to staying there full time. But if I do as they ask, I'm essentially taking a gigantic pay cut. Is it worth just downsizing my life to hang on a little longer and maybe get promoted out of this position and into a WFH one? Or should I just move on? I have enjoyed having a stable white collar job thus far, and honestly this is the only reason I've ever felt like it's been at risk of being lost. I'm finding myself indecisive here, when I know I have to make a decision soon if I don't want to be caught with my pants down, unable to make rent."

I’ve tried every avenue to resolve the issues, but nothing has changed. I have a meeting tomorrow with head of people and HR. I need help thinking of talking points so I don’t just whine/complain/cry the whole time.

Background: I am a software trainer. It is the first time my company has had this role. My manager is a very experienced user of the software, but has no experience in learning and development. I was hired at a decently low level in the company, but with an exceptional salary. I’ve only been working there 8 months. 
If it weren’t for the following pain points, I believe that this would be the perfect job for me. I love the company and the people I interact with on a daily basis, but management has let me down. 

Main pain points:

- I barely received any training on the software. I have only the most basic understanding, meaning any training I want to develop requires me to find other people to help create the training materials and lead it. I believe this causes my role to be more of a learning coordinator than an actual trainer. When I ask for training, it falls on deaf ears. 
- I have had to FIGHT for any additional support. Everyone is super busy. People who are knowledgeable about the software are staffed on too many projects to effectively help. 
- my manager doesn’t advocate for me or set me up for success. He is very busy and doesn’t really help guide in the direction I should be going with my training. I have plenty of experience training, but because I have no prior experience with the software, I don’t know what to train on. Any suggestions he gives me are way too far above my understanding to execute, or too abstract that I don’t know what to do. 
- my manager has said things to make me question my security within the company, including the fact that I haven’t produced much. a )I haven’t produced much because of the lack of training. b) we had a hiring freeze, and that impacted the new hire training I was developing c) because I’m in learning and development, there is a lot of work that goes into a deliverable, and I think that my manager doesn’t understand the process because he know nothing about L&amp;D 
- My manager probably couldn’t name more than one thing I’m working on right now. Because I haven’t been trained on the software, I’ve pivoted to other tasks that I can accomplish.

Any thoughts on how to structure this conversation so it’s productive would be great. 

Honestly, I’ve thought about leaving for a different job, but nothing in my area is hiring for the salary I need."

Meanwhile, their stock is doing fantastic! A few months ago, I was asked to take on a different role. When I asked for more pay to do so, I was told it would be a similar amount of work as my previous role, therefore the pay is in line. It is a lot more work. I explained this to my boss and told him I don’t know how much longer I can keep taking on responsibility without a pay bump. Also, that I feel wronged that I have received no more than 3/3.5% YoY for four years while inflation is 8% currently. Also, I’ve received positive performance reviews every year. I’m effectively being paid less. He was like “yea I understand. I think we need to catch you up this year. You are on track for a promotion”. So to clarify the title, this has not been offered, but mentioned. Should I hold out until my yearly review in March or just leave? I figure the better title would look good on my resume before job searching. At this point, I’m just kind of over this company, though. I have a bad feeling there will be some new excuse come March."

Hello, I just started my MPA this week (my undergraduate degree in criminal justice wasn’t very viable since I didn’t want to become a cop ), currently working for TSA - I was extremely interested in the TSI position (transportation security inspector). However I’m severely under qualified and it’s extremely competitive. With that being said , would anyone know where I could maybe start in terms of training or even positions? I was also interested in GRC/auditing but it seems hard to get into if your background doesn’t really complement it.

I currently live in SoFlo, but I’m moving to California for a while. I may end up in Louisiana eventually but that’s a different story and not anytime soon"

I work in higher education at a local community college. Several of my supervisors/bosses have recommended that I go back to school to get my Masters Degree because they believe that I can grow at the organization and could see me serving in leadership roles. It's not a guarantee that I would get these roles, of course - just that I would have more opportunity to move up if I had a Masters Degree. They see the work that I produce and would like to see me move up. 

My problem is that I have refused to get my graduate degree after I earned my Bachelors in 2015. I was working and going to school full time, getting about 4 hours of sleep per night, but making straight A's. I can do the work, but I'm struggling so hard to make the decision to go back on the off chance that it may possibly open more doors. It's also kind of a matter of principal. If you know that I can do the work and see potential, why do I have to jump through these hoops to move up? I know....stupid question coming from someone working in higher ed promoting that very system. But, it is frustrating. Has anyone else known that the only way to move up in their organization was to go back to school, but just couldn't bring themselves to do it? If you did finally go back, was it worth it and did it pay off? 

Thanks!"
1,2023-01-09,Anyone have advice about insurance roles?,u/KATEWM,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/107lut4/anyone_have_advice_about_insurance_roles/,careerguidance,"I’ve been a Workers’ Comp adjuster for a few years now and would like to pivot away from it. I know every job is stressful and involves multi-tasking, but there has to be something better than this. It is impossible to keep up with the amount of work and becoming more soul-crushing by the day. I think I’m a fairly organized person, but the only people who succeed in this job are the hyper-organized types - people who have color-coded their lives since middle school and make excel sheets for everything they do. (Respect) 

Insurance is one of the most stressful industries (according to a bunch of surveys and articles,) and claims handling is one of the more stressful jobs *in* insurance, so I don’t think it’s that I’m being lazy or unrealistic about wanting a lower level of stress.

So at first I was aiming to get out of the industry entirely, but I’m starting to think that’s not realistic. I think my odds of finding a good job within insurance are much higher. I’m very open to moving to a different line (casualty, property, life, etc.) and willing to train in an entry-level role. I luckily live in an area with lots of employers and openings.

So what I’m asking is 
- If anyone has made the switch from a claims desk to something completely different.

- If anyone has an insurance job that they could provide some insight on - what do you love and hate about it? What are the traits needed to succeed in the role? Some I’ve considered are underwriting, broking, and sales."

I’m 34 now and so feel like if there’s an opportunity to increase my salary significantly and earn a good living aside from promotion or becoming an MLRO (something that doesn’t interest me) that I should take it.

My background is MPCU and Dialysis, and I've been a nurse since May 2020. 



Location: Midwest USA, want to move to the coast within the next couple years, whether that's California or Florida



Schooling: I have a BSN. I'd greatly prefer on-the-job training but would consider going back to school if I had to. 2 year programs or boot camps are much more appealing than doing yet another 4 year program. 



Interests: animals/animal behavior, the environment, biology (especially marine), botany, potentially tech?, creativity (but I'm no artist)



What I liked about nursing: helping others, making a difference on an individual basis, fast pace/never bored, lots of tasks require working with your hands (as opposed to filling out paperwork all day). Teamwork is nice, but I also liked the independence. 



What I disliked about nursing: compensation doesn't match the difficulty of the job, rude patients, frequently dealing with human feces, charting is the most boring part of the job. Being on call bloody sucks and I'll never do it again.



Ideal job: salary of at least $60k (obviously more is more, and I'd love to find a career where I can get to 6 figures in 5-10ish years). I might entertain freelancing, but the lack of guaranteed income/regular paychecks is anxiety-inducing and I NEED good health insurance. Huge plus if I can work 3-4 days a week just like I do in the hospital now. Working as a team OR independently is just fine with me. Some paperwork is okay but I don't want that to be the whole job. I hate the idea of being a call center employee, and I'd be an awful salesperson.



I've looked at past threads on r/nursing on which jobs other nurses have moved to, but I can't seem to find one that I would enjoy/be good at that ALSO pays enough for me to feel okay quitting my current job. I don't want to do any more patient care, period, and I'd probably prefer to get out of the healthcare industry entirely, but I'd consider other roles. I've also looked at ISFJ career lists and again, I just can't seem to find anything that sounds appealing. I feel so stuck! Any advice??"

I was then blocked by my current manager, with the explanation that they couldn't backfill my position due to a hiring freeze. Eventually in December my current manager told me that I was free to move internally, but now the new hiring manager is saying she can't get the job req open and I'll have to wait longer.

Here's the rub, my current role directly supports my new role, to the point that it's making my life incredibly difficult. To effectively do my current role I am often required to be directly in opposition of the goals of the new hiring manager -- i.e. my current role is about enforcing processes and guidelines and the new role would be more pie-in-the-sky high-level thinking.

I'm at a point now where I feel like I can't continue working in my current role, but I still want the new job. I'm thinking of trying to take a leave of absense for mental health reasons (legitimately this is putting a lot of stress on me) and hoping this can be resolved when I come back."

I have a BSN nursing degree and a Doctorate in Pharmacy. I worked full time at a retail and specialty pharmacy for 3 years before relocating. I currently work full time nursing and PRN pharmacy. I started the nursing job when I couldn't find a pharmacy job after relocating. I have been unsuccessful at finding a full time pharmacy job. I even applied for retail jobs with no luck. I have had a few interviews where am told they like and are impressed by my dual degrees but never offered the job. I will admit, I am not the greatest person during interviews because am shy and reserved but am not so bad because I practice a lot. I have paid a professional to edit my resume. I have no problems finding nursing jobs but that's not my goal. I have considered nursing administration but i enjoy the clinical aspect of my jobs. I have been depressed lately because i went back to almost 6 years of additional schooling with 2 toddlers and enormous debt to get away from nursing but yet, hear i am. I fear the longer I stay at my current nursing job the farther I get from my dream of Pharmacy related job. While, I love what I do as a nurse I have recently been experiencing extreme back spasms and pain from all the heavy lifting at my job (Two nurses at my job recently underwent spine surgeries). I have applied to countless pharmacy openings for transfer at this job. Have had my manager reach out to the pharmacy leadership. Have reached out to pharmacy leadership. It's been almost 3 years but I have yet to be called for 1 interview. My yearly performance evaluation has been ""exceeds expectations"". I have considered going back to school but I don't want to incur anymore student loans and going back to pharmacy school was hard on my family in the first place. 
If you have read up to this point, thank you. 
What else can I do? Why haven't I been considered as an internal candidate for the pharmacist positions I have applied for, when in some cases they hired new grads. Any career change opportunities am overlooking? Am desperate and depressed because I spent almost 10 years on careers I love and I feel overlooked."

Let's assume I am 24F, finished a linguistics bachelors degree. I kind of love animals, but I cant stand seeing animals suffer. I love video games, and got a little bit into programming. I'm not a math genius though and I usually need some variety in my everyday-work-life because I tend to get bored by redundant tasks.

I dont care too much about financial security though, so I am fine with working on low wages and even at unreasonable times and such. I really just look for something that has purpose to do for 4-8 hours a day. :)

By the way I did an internship with a book publisher, book store, an art exhibition and I'm currently working for the administration of an educational institution. While all those tasks were somewhat nice for some time, they got me really bored after two months."

However, he made a vague comment that there has to be ""an open card in the next position in order to promote someone"" and that he wasn't sure there was one. I have not had my formal review or received a formal decision on this, but it would be very frustrating if that was the only reason I did not receive a promotion. 

Today, a coworker on my team who is a level up (the position I would be promoted to) for some reason told me they're planning to leave and are going to start applying to jobs. I would not ever want to throw someone under the bus, and absolutely do not intend to say anything about that to my manager, but it's hard to sit by knowing I may get passed for a promotion simply because there isn't an ""opening"" at the next level, while also knowing that someone at that level will likely be gone soon-ish but certainly after reviews have been finalized.

**So my question then, is there a professional way to let my manager know that a position at the level I'd be promoted to may be opening up soon, without directly telling him a coworker is trying to leave?** 

I appreciate any and all advice."

Since I have to go back to school, idk if I can push myself to so consulting and do school work.. but 100k is a lot of money for me. My plan is to quit work next year so that I can focus on school .. so maybe it’s good to push myself 1 yr and get 100k and gtfo? Or stay here and prep school well?

Many members on my team are also remote and live even further - some live 5 hours away, and even a few live in CAN. 


What’s the best way to approach this with my boss? I know I don’t need his blessing, but I would like to remain in good standing and not give the impression that I’m less likely to visit the office when there are important meetings or company wide events. That simply isn’t the case, I’d be living 10 hours away driving distance, but would be close to 3 major airports that could get me closer to the office. I’m probably overthinking it, but I just don’t want to come across like I don’t take the job seriously since I’m moving further away. 

Any advice or recommendations? I posted to /askHR, and so far the comments have said that there’s nothing to negatively perceive about moving further away, but I can’t help but feel like it would somehow.

Transportation infrastructure

I can commission into the military and be much more comfortable financially but that doesn't help my issue with the lifestyle and lack of choice on where I live.

If my goal were to work in Fintech or for traditional banking as a dev for major banks or even as a financial advisor, would pursuing the degree be worth it?  

To add: I have enough of my GI Bill left to cover the Finance degree at my current University and still have 4 years of Active Duty left.

My top choice, company A, wants a decision for a contract starting in May.  Company B wants me to start by February or March, and would likely allow fully remote work as well.  But that contract would end in August.  Company A would go until late September, maybe longer.

Today company A pinged me asking if I would like to move forward.  I assume I'm running out of time.  I want to ask the recruiter for a bit more time to make the best decision.  I would never knowingly take an offer only to rescind before the start date.  Behavior like that isn't easily forgotten in an industry as small as mine.  I'm drafting this email:

"" I would absolutely like to move forward, but find myself in a bit of a predicament.  My time at 'current company'  is likely ending sooner than I anticipated.  Company A is my first choice and I would really like to come back.  At the moment the issue is I'm anticipating wrapping up with 'current company' in February, which would leave a 3 month employment gap for me until I could rejoin the team at Company A.  I could just accept the break without much issue, but at this stage of my life and career I'm concerned about taking an employment gap.  
I'm speaking with another studio about a freelance that would allow me to work freelance for 2 months in between February and April, bridging the gap until I can return to Company A.  If I can make that work that would be the best outcome.  If not, then I may need to move forward with another opportunity that would begin in March to keep more consistent employment.  When would you need a final decision?""  


Is this even worth sending, or does it raise to many red flags about me as a candidate?  Company A really is my first choice, but having the start date be 4 months out really complicates things for me.  I'm trying to be straightforward and honest while keeping the offer open.    
I don't want to sign the letter this week and lock myself into a potential employment gap of several months, only to then rescind if I get another offer.  I know people do that, but that would irreparably damage the relationship, and I would essentially be blacklisted.  Any thoughts?  I assume I can wait 1 or 2 days to respond, but beyond that I need to follow up.  Total radio silence isn't ideal."

Tl;Dr: I‘m currently a bachelor student who is attending a very well accredited business university in Switzerland. For personal reasons, I ,need to‘ move to Columbus Ohio, if possible within the next 8 months, or just asap. I‘m graduating in June. Is this possible? How?

I‘m sorry if I sound desperate, but I‘m very helpless.

I‘m a bachelor student at a well known university in Switzerland and, for personal reasons that are long to explain, I‘m in dire need of moving to Columbus Ohio.

To my qualifications: I will soon be graduating (on track to graduating with honors) from a well known business school with a Business bachelor. Pre-uni, I have completed a professional baccalaureate degree, which included working as a front desk associate at a hotel for a year. During my time at uni, I have both completed another internship in marketing for Philip Morris International and have founded my own marketing company with a few friends, which is doing very well for something that started as a ,side venture‘. I speak three languages fluently (bilingual in german and english, fluent with certification in french) and have a wide range of technological experience (Programming: Python and JavaScript with low levels of certification, no traditional training; MS Office suite: Word, PowerPoint and Excel with certification; Adobe CC suite: 3 years of working experience).

I know that the US has a somewhat different approach to applications to europe and i‘ve redone my CV, cover letter etc. to fit this.

I don‘t like boasting, but I feel like I am qualified for at least some levels of jobs offered. The problem is that I have been applying for dozens (if not hundreds, at this point) of jobs, and most of the time, I haven‘t even gotten an interview.

My question is three fold: Is immigration into the US within 8 months possible? What kinds of jobs should I apply to? Am I missing some sort of crucial step to get me a visa more simply? I‘ve started seeing ,this position does not qualify for visa sponsorship at this time‘ in a lot of positions, should I apply nonetheless or could that backfire?

I‘m thankful for any help, I‘m slowly starting to go insane."

I can settle on my college loan debts for about 4 or 5000, and have about that much saved up, so I'm basically looking for advice in two areas:

1. Trying to get out of doing so much manual labor and subcontractor's assistant style of labor;

2. Looking for hospitality related work if I can get it, like a night auditor at a hotel; and

3. Hoping to set up a reasonable plan for effectively getting another degree in a STEM field and pursuing research and higher degrees in the field. I have some botany background and could survey if I felt experienced enough to get work in those fields, but I'm hoping to start in school and get a doctorate. Sounds like one natural resource can be used to get jobs in a variety of natural resource fields so I'm not sure how specific my plans need to be in terms of subject. (In other words, a botany degree versus a marine biology degree, maybe they interrelate and cross over in the job market.)

I have tutoring background from my first bachelor's which I received in 2017, and a wide variety of work/work trade experiences including organic raw milk production, and permaculture off grid living and training. I also know how to do some things involving crafting rope and basic textiles, bicycle/mechanical maintenance, and so on.

Lastly, I've lived in Hawaii before and thought I could potentially jump over there, work maybe in hospitality and go to uh Hilo for either of those fields. I just want to research something that will help people, and I enjoy scientific discovery. I could work with ethnobotany related stuff or like conservation of endangered Hawaiian plants, for example, but I'm not familiar with whether or not grants are available, for example.

So is marine biology or botany a good discipline to get involved with as a career choice?"

2. Says she fixed issues which would’ve been reported to our CEO had she not - categorically false. We write work orders for all troubleshooting and she had 0 to her name. This is because she never worked on anything directly, and the CEO wouldn’t have been informed regardless. 

3. Says she was in charge of the team - not true. 

4. Says that she had to work twice as hard as one of the few women on the team. We only had a few women on our team, but it was only her who hardly ever worked on anything. She’d arrive at 8:30 and leave at 3 everyday.

Here's the problem; In America I don't think being a teacher for a school is a good choice. I've seen thousands of examples of how teachers are given too much work, not have good benifits or used for their knowledge alone. Treatment of teachers **(Especially ones I've seen in my highschool)** isn't exactly great and the wage you work for as a American citizen is JUST enough to live off of. That means If I ever plan on living with someone I will need a far better paying job (I don't intend to be a loner forever).

**Is there a job or career I can look into that acts in the same manner that a teacher does but is more respectable and pays better?** I have already considered a professor job but I am putting that to the side in case there are any better options. 

I know a lot of people always say ""Don't worry about the wage"" but let me be honest I kind of need to since my financial support is pretty dicey meaning I need to make the right decision.

**TLDR: Are there any jobs that act in the same manner that a school teacher does but pays better and have good benifits?**

I also want to note that I always see myself as less than I am worth unfortunately, and I cant see when I am doing something that is not up to my skills or standards.

I obtained this position as an intern, so since I graduated about a month ago, I have been on an intern role, which is still very good. I was able to make my own hours as long as I got my work done, and I am making $16. Which is still above minimum wage, since it is currently $11 an hour in Florida. I also have certifications that I obtained specifically to increase my base skill set. I currently work in a purchasing type role, along with various other things, but today I had a sit down with my boss about my next steps. They expressed that a recent position just opened again and that they immediately thought of me for it. And from what I have seen, it may be an increased workload to what I had, to only move to $18 an hour. I also want to note that it is an hour commute each way with a bridge toll. 

My boyfriend thinks that I should look for something else, given my skillset and the ability to do so many things with my degree. I was trying to find something remote for awhile to settle down into my post grad life a little, but I have had no luck. I feel guilty even thinking of leaving but I know in the end I need to look out for myself and my career.

About 4 of them he's gotten laid off before his 2nd year anniversary.

He mentioned to me that recruiters ask him why he left certain jobs (that have less than 2 years) and he just tells them that he was laid off. But he gets the sense that recruiters give a disappointed ""oh"" when he says that. Now he's curious if having short stints from being laid off is actually a negative thing and seen as bad as job hopping. My friend is a decent employee and shows upward mobility in his career. But he keeps working for smaller/mid-size/start-up companies that aren't very stable and thus the constant layoffs.

Does this make him look like a job hopper and lower the number of call-backs he'd get? If invited to the interview, does he look less valuable as a candidate since some companies may think that constantly getting laid off means he's not the best employee? Any advice?"

I recently started a new job as an engineer a few months ago and I have been enjoying it. I get along with my boss and enjoy the company culture. Work-life balance is amazing and relatively low stress compared to my old jobs. The work is interesting and is ideally what I’ve always wanted to do.

I recently got another offer at an automotive OEM for 20k more than what I’m making now with additional stock options. This position is geared more towards finance so I feel like this is a step away from engineering. 

Both companies will be less than 10 minutes of commuting. 

I’d definitely want to continue my career in engineering but this offer seems too good to shut down. Any advice or things to consider when making my decision?"

Hi everyone. Just looking to get some advice. 
Some background: I graduated in December 2023 with an engineering degree but decided to go into the teaching routes 

Today was my (24F) first day as a HS teacher. Starting out second semester. I am not teaching quite yet as I don’t have a background in teaching. I’m going to be shadowing classes for two weeks and will then be given my own classes to teach. 

I am excited for this new journey and I’m excited because this is an environment I feel like I’ll enjoy. I like working with kids and I like to teach. I have a great support system and all of the teachers are super helpful. 

However. I deal with horrible anxiety. I had an internship (engineering internship) before I graduated college that was meant to be in person (cubicle job) and i hated it. Mostly hated the cubicle and feeling so alone. It made my anxiety crippling and it made me feel trapped and lonely. I have been struggling with the idea of the 8 hr work week 5 days a week for the rest of my life and it gives me horrible anxiety. Due to my anxiety, my internship allowed me to work from home which significantly improved my mental health and anxiety. 
However, I did not want to pursue a career in engineering as i fell out of love with it and felt like I could really enjoy teaching. 

But now I’m back to working 40 hrs a week monday-Friday and that anxiety is back. I’m not sure how to deal with it or how to manage it. The anxiety is horrible. Just knowing i have to be at work 8 hr ever day mon- Friday gives me so much anxiety. 

I don’t want to resort to working from home to get rid of this anxiety. I want to be a normal functioning adult. I’m afraid of wanting to quit weeks/ months in bc the anxiety will be crippling. I don’t want my only option to get rid of this anxiety to be a WFH job. 

Has anyone else gone through this and gotten over it? Or any advice that can be offered?"

I did keep my research reddit centric and I did read this a lot. I'll keep it really short and simple:

TLDR; I have a Physiotherapy student, need a bill paying job so I can write on the side. What jobs I can explore?

I am a final year Physiotherapy student, but I don't want a career out of it. I want a bill paying job so I can write on the side (creative writer). A year ago, I thought there was not much I could do. But then I discovered the diversity of jobs out there and I thought I should explore that. Also, we started our hospital rounds now and I am really not interested in patient care. I just cannot see myself doing it for more than a year or two. 

So I did a lot of research and here are my options (there could be more than this, but I have not seen them):

* MBA in hospital administration
* Medical Tech company
* Medical writer (I have a personal blog)

My question is, which have the most potential? It could be out of these three, one of your suggestions and also, something totally out of my field (something like a data analyst, marketing or graphic designer) but  I feel like going deeper in my field is better than to switch. These 4 years can come in handy."

I did this then sent a conceptual version to our team for feedback.  My boss immediately emailed the team and said don’t review this, I haven’t vetted it yet.  He then emailed me and told me we needed to talk so that I could understand how the company “does things.”.

The job title I applied to over the weekend was simply retail associate/bud tender, so I had pretty tempered expectations going into it. The hiring manager himself, as I learned today in a video interview, works in wealth management, and he had the idea that because I was responsible enough to have supplemented my income with stock trading the past couple years, I could be store manager material. I was almost caught off guard by how quickly things escalated in my favor, and probably stumbled a little, but regardless, I'm coming into the store Saturday for an in-person interview. 
He didn't say I would be hired for store manager right away, mind you, but that I would be in high consideration for it it I could prove myself as an associate first.

I was told that they would re-evaluate if they are keeping the position at the end of the year. It sounds like it’s still being worked on but that’s a completely different topic.

In talking to a coworker that also received the interim role, he advised he was given a tiered promotion to his current title as compensation for his interim role 3 months ago.

I’m frustrated and feeling undervalued. I want to bring up my desire to be fairly compensated in a more firm manner to my boss by of course noting the qualities for why I think this should occur. Part of me also wants to mention that I am aware of my coworkers promotion as compensation. Is this appropriate? I don’t think I would normally call out a promotion for a coworker, but looking at it from the interim role perspective is what’s throwing me for a loop. We are both performing a different role than our titles (note: our working titles are the same, our different roles are the same) but one of us is now getting compensated for it while the other isn’t.

I would love some new career ideas. Willing to pivot to something that can use my current education (unlikely) or start from scratch. 

I am Deaf with cochlear implants. During 1-on-1 conversations in a quiet room I do fine, but in group settings or in noisy environments I totally struggle, so being able to work independently or 1-on-1 with people would be really ideal. Better yet, working remotely then using captions for video calls and phone calls. 

Location: Washington

Desired salary: Hopefully at least 60k.

My bachelor's degree is in Speech and Hearing Sciences. I was originally going to do audiology, but that fell through when my local schools stopped offering it. I'm not really interested in Speech therapy, especially due to my hearing. (Degree is useless by itself). 

My master's degree is in Applied Behavior Analysis, and I currently work as a behavior technician with kids on the autism spectrum. (Another degree that is useless by itself).  I love psychology and the science behind ABA, but I absolutely hate the field now. Difficult parents, noisy working environment when I'm at the clinic which makes it tough for me (screaming kids, bad acoustics, echo, non stop people talking, etc.), the practicum experience is absolutely ridiculous (takes forever, depends on your employer giving you projects, most experience hours are unpaid and on your own time), having to chase kids down and change diapers, etc. It just doesn't seem worth it to suffer through the practicum experience for at least another year or two, just to get a credential I probably don't even want (board certified behavior analyst). 

I would love to be challenged in healthier ways rather than constantly being drained due to barriers with my hearing (people wearing masks, poor listening environment, constantly being approached by random people) and by my own personality just being really irritated all the time with the background noise and having to chase kids down, clean up toys, etc. The science and analytical stuff in this field is awesome to me, but I hate feeling like I work in a daycare center. It would be awesome to work with adults who have disabilities, but I have not been able to find anything I qualify for or that pays a livable wage. Currently, ABA is very narrowed down to Autism early intervention, career wise. 

I'm unable to go back to school in person, but would be willing to do an online asynchronous program with another affordable-ish degree. 

Skills / interests: organizing, planning, budgeting, tech savvy, problem solving, puzzles, critical thinking, multitasking, love sitting behind a computer, enjoy deep 1 on 1 conversations, psychology, disabilities, photography, animals (esp dogs), nature and outdoors, photography."

About 10 months ago we hired a member of the staff who I have to work very closely with. I had serious concerns about his resume (very easily verifiable lies) and about his personality (all talk and no substance) right away. My boss was adamant he be hired, though. 

He has taken ownership over 5-6 important projects over the last 10 months and botched them all. I have gone in early enough to salvage the mess ups in all but one instance. In all but one instance, he has turned it around on me and said I had not trained him well enough or that he does not feel welcome in the organization or this or that. I have tried to spoon feed him and begged him to do work and he just doesn’t seem to care. 

The most recent one completely burned down and has had horrible fallout for our office and my morale. I basically missed Christmas with my new wife and in laws trying to salvage the project to no avail. He refused to help, halfassed areas where he did, and even though I sacrificed my time to try and fix all of his missteps, he’s furious at me for being “disrespectful.” All the while, he put tons of work into a side project of his while I’m doing his work over the holidays (he posts about it on social media). 

I told my boss and supervisor that I have had enough and cannot work with him anymore. When I told my supervisor, he told me he lost sleep over me leaving and would rather have me stay than this guy. It’s become apparent they have no intention of getting rid of him nor do they have any intention of putting the burden of learning his role more in his hands (be more proactive). I feel completely used, unappreciated, and worn out. For a long time I have agreed it would be best if he turned it around and became good at his job and worked well with me but at this point I think I’m too exhausted to overlook the inconsiderate and unprofessional behavior. 

I love my job but I feel like quitting. 

Is it worth it to stick it out?

He is a carpenter. I am a college graduate professional. The ideal is to both work 3 days a week when the baby is born (after leave, ofc) so we both have time with the baby, with just each other, and some time alone-as family is fine to watch them one day a week. It just makes sense for the first so many years, because we want to be quite equal in parenting and working. We love our careers! 

So, coming down to the question: is it common or even realistic to work a carpentry type job part-time, he is really only aware of full time positions they don’t really have time on jobs to accommodate part timers.  But, it’s 2023 so, I figured I’d ask people’s lived experiences, or advice!  The world is just not cut out for 1 person incomes or working mothers, and we are trying to plan around it 🥲"

When we moved in, I was looking for a temporary job to continue to pay the bills while I keep applying to engineering jobs…

Well, I ended up getting a job delivering packages in the rocky mountains for fedex, and kind of love it for the most part. I love being out in the sun or the snow seeing nature (Moose, deer, foxes, even mountain lions! oh and DOGS!!) all day, listening to my favorite podcasts, and staying active. I’m at my lightest weight since high school and I’m in the best shape of my life purely because of this job. And it’s not too physically demanding compared to most other routes, since it’s mostly rural, the stops are more spread out and the boxes are typically lighter, but i do get my steps in all day on steep driveways and stuff.

The best part of this job, though, is that i can pretty much choose when i want to work, so I choose to have three weekdays off. That way, on my days off, basically nothing is busy. I can go snowboarding every week without the traffic, campsites are never full, traffic to/from the mountains is never bad. 

I should say that the pay is not bad, I take home about $800/wk AFTER taxes if I choose to work 4 days or 40 hours. If i work 5 days, I take home ~$1100. Meaning if i worked 5 days all year, gross income would be $70k. and i get a $1/hr raise almost every month so if i stayed for the rest of the year I could probably reach $85k working 5 days. *Starting salary for engineers in the area is pretty much equivalent to what i’m making now…*

For that reason, now I dread having to work M-F in any job, even if I enjoy the job, because so much of my personal life would be compromised.

I don’t want my degree to go to waste, and I think i could find a position that I could enjoy (it would need to be pretty hands-on) but the rest of the world runs on M-F work weeks so it’s basically impossible to find an engineering job that has any weekdays off, and that sucks for me…

Also, I am dreading having to jump back into the whole interview process, because I just know i’m so bad at it. I tried so hard for so long (200+ apps, 15+ interviews) that it just beat me down so hard and gave me constant anxiety during that whole process. I really don’t want to go through that again, especially since now my coursework is fading from memory already, and I feel like i wouldn’t be able to answer any technical questions asked. (I couldn’t before either but at least i could come up with an answer)

This post got long fast and i know i’m all over the place. I’ll try to sum it up though…

TL;DR: I got my degree in aerospace engineering, couldn’t find a job, moved to a place i dreamed of living anyways, got a temporary job for fedex delivering in the beautiful rocky mountains, now i’m in the best shape of my life and have 3 weekdays off to do whatever i want without the crowds. I get paid decently. basically the same as junior engineer salary. I don’t think i ever want an office job M-F now. Also i don’t feel confident in my ability to have good interviews or do the job of an engineer."

I enrolled in it but when i researched more about it. I realised the subjects and the feild are not in my interest. And like it's 2023 so i think it's not worth to spend 5-6 years doing a course which offers less salary compared to iitians and mba graduates. Hence, i dropped the idea of going for it. I know i have interest in finance feild but i want to explore more. This college won't give any opportunities. Now i am thinking to appear for CUET again so that i can get admission in top college like SRCC, HINDU, HANSRAJ etc. Is it worth? Am i going on right path? 
My sisters and family members are saying college doesn't really matters. Do your graduation from the local college and than do MBA from good college. But the college i am currently in is the worst college. No opportunities, no exposure, no internships, no extra curriculars.

I have had a good relationship with the CEO over this time however there are certain administrative tasks that I did much earlier on in my career that the CEO thinks only I can do or so I am told. 

I last completed these tasks in October 2021 where this was my last payrise after handing in my notice and staying with a 25-30% increase plus a company car. However, after changes in personnel I’ve now had to pick this task back up since September 2022 that pretty much leaves me incapacitated to do my own role that I loved doing over the past year to that point. 

This has quite frankly made me miserable and a pretty poor attitude to work and extremely bored from not being challenged or being able to prove myself to excel further. 

Another thing to mention is that the company is now in agreement to be sold within the next 6 months and completing over the next couple of years when I’d at least expect the senior management team to be moved on.

Clients include SpaceX, Raytheon, Lockheed-Martin, and Intuitive Surgical. Only reason I include that is to give perspective to the level of standards we are supposed to adhere to and the level of stress that comes with it. 

I started at this company in Feb. 2020 as an temp production associate and have clawed my way to a respectable, salaried position. Only reason I have the job I do is my boss took a chance on me after hearing good things and a stellar interview, and the fact it is 3rd means minimal competition. 

They recently brought in a 3rd shift supervisor after a year of not having any members of Operations. Prior to them arriving I've had to fill a lot of the gaps as a liason between HR and the 3rd shift associates, submitting tool requests, and even having to call the police on suspicious people on the property.

The manager they brought in has accepted a job on 1st shift in a different department and I'm thinking I want to apply for his position once it is available.  I have 4 years experience, one of which was in my salaried Q E Tech role and one, which was before I started here, I spent as an Injection Molding Operator responsible for whoever was assigned to work for me on that day.

The thing I'm worried about is Production Supervisor postings here state that either a Bachelors or a HS Diploma and 5 years manufacturing experience is required.

I have an Undergrad Certificate in Engineering Technology and am working towards my Bachelors in the same field. I'll have my Associates this time next year. I have a good reputation with the Site Director and 3/4 managers I have to work with. I never call in and try to go above and have came in on day shift to fill in whenever asked.

I originally planned to stay in this role until I had my Bachelors and then start applying for Quality and Test Engineering roles. My boss said I have good chances at getting either role once I finish school, and even offered to let me switch shifts for the entirety of my last year of school if it would help.

The company overall is pretty great. 9 weeks parental leave, decent benefits, great vacation policy, and regular raises.

Both career paths pay around the same but the upward mobility is better as a supervisor. I just worry that I'll embarass myself or commit some kind of professional faux pas that I'm unaware of by applying or even after I get the job. I mean I'm still scared I sound dumb in my emails and proofread them 3 times. I've never had a white collar job before this, always blue collar. I'm still new to professionalism and have been taking classes about hard conversations in the workplace and how to communicate in a workplace effectively. 


Should I bide my time and wait till I finish school and deal with the decision then or should I go for it now?

Yesterday, I received an official offer and want to take the new job. However, I do not know how my parents will take it. The way I see it, I could go one of two routes:

1. Honesty - staff welfare is poor - pay and other perks - for me and other staff, no structured training and development, no autonomy, etc. This might ruffle some feathers - particularly with my Dad. He probably won't make the necessary changes, so there isn't a point in telling him.
2. Partial honesty. It has been exciting and challenging working with my family. However, I feel the need to branch out and try and learn in a different environment.

I have been at my current job for 7 years now. I am currently a Shift Supervisor, but have an opportunity to advance into an admin role. I am currently paid hourly with overtime. In my profession, we have lots of overtime opportunities. The promotion that I applied for is a salary position. The starting pay for the admin position is only about a dollar more on the hour for the first year and then you get a raise each year.

My issue is that yes, the admin role would give me another title and I want to continue to advance myself, but in the grand scheme of things, I am going to take a pay cut in my first year because I am losing my overtime pay. Our schedules work to where we get 8 hours overtime every check, so automatically, I will lose that. We currently are understaffed so I would more than likely remain on a shift until we get fully staffed so I could come off a shift and work my 40 hours a week. If I have to stay on shift, I would be working 8 or more hours overtime every check and would be forced to comp that time to take off later. I currently get paid holiday time because my job requires us to work holidays, so I would lose that money as well, but would just get days to take off later.

I really enjoy my job and want to continue to grow, but I also work to make money and not work for free. I have talked to several mentors and they really don't know what to tell me either. Yes, it is an advancement and a better title, but they also get the hourly vs salary as well. I am tore on what to do, and I don't want to make the wrong decision. I don't want to take a position and end up having to work way more hours for less money at the end of the day, because money is the only reason we actually work, right?

If you've made it this far, thank you for reading and any advice would be much appreciated!"

But then last semester, i overwhelmed myself and took with the hardest professor statistics and took 3 other major courses so i started hating my major and then one of them was data structures and algorithms using C++ i also did not enjoy that at all. Digital system design and electronics were the other courses which where fair but i really couldn’t manage to study for them or be on track so that’s a thing. Okay so i noticed that i dislike most programming problems unless they are math programming problems. In school, i enjoyed chemistry and mathematics(most) and physics but the last year i ended up enjoying physics and hating chemistry(organic chem) and also for the record i hate memorizing anything( adhd). As for my personality, i love talking to people and understanding them and helping and i love mentoring people and i’m also alot involved in my extracurriculars and i’m also an advocate for own and other students’ accommodations and try to help them in any way possible. As for reading, i enjoy philosophy/self-help/human behavior and I also took philosophy classes in uni and i loved them. I don’t know what to do, i’m taking a statistical simulation course online and it’s nice. I don’t know what to do at this point. My ultimate goal is entrepreneurship ( i chose my major to be able to be innovative) but i don’t enjoy things like web dev and i tried learning basics of web design and every minute of it was boring as hell."

I’m excited about this new job and I believe that it will contribute positively to my professional career and development.

I didn’t see any issues with that at the beginning and I didn’t share my intentions with my new boss.
But when I started the job and I’ve seen the amounts of efforts and training materials that are being put to develop me and make me ready for handling tasks, I started feeling guilty! 

Am I right or am I wrong?
Is it really professional life always like this way? Should be completely emotionless? 
Should I consider the team efforts? Or should I consider my desire to grow professionally and even personally?

I don’t know if I should draw a line and act like everything is normal or i should do something towards the feeling of guilt."

I’m currently a Freshman in university majoring in Health Sciences. What I’ve wanted to become career wise has been occasionally fluctuating since I’ve started college but has generally stayed in the medical field. Because of this (and a few other factors including the fact that what I went to uni for has changed) instead of community college, I went to a university. To clarify, growing up lower to middle class and wanting to support myself / those I care about, money is a big factor for me but is not my main motivation. So, I considered travel nursing. My issue is that I’m already in a university and I know most RN’s start at community college to get their pre-req’s since a BSN is not required. I’m not sure what to do. Is there a way to become an RN without a BSN while being in community college?

I live in Israel, and for the past year and 2 months I've been working in a tiny start-up company in the automotive industry. I work as an integration manager, my responsibilities are mostly revolving around making sure design and manufacturing is aligned and happens as expected, and on the QA side I plan, design and execute tests, alongside with designing, purchasing or manufacturing any equipment required for the company. 

It is a job I love, in an amazing environment which i'll be pained to leave. I get paid decently, and I have some stock options I got a bit after I signed, vesting. I work full-time and don't have any other profits. 

To the current situation:  
A bit over a week ago the CEO took me to a private conversation, saying the company is in bad shape with cash-flow, and they're not going to be able to keep me in the current contract. He asked me to think outside the box of a solution that will allow me to still work with them until they raise more money and could hire me back full time. I didn't like the options that he mentioned, expect maybe staying part-time. 

I got offered to lower the capacity to 50%, which leave me with a barely livable wage if i accept.  My question is that - considering they company will be able to extract itself from the shitty situation and hires me back in the next few months (very likely in my opinion since there are some very big entities interested in investing/collaborating/acquiring us), what kind on benefits should I demand to agree to work 50% capacity, which limits my chances of finding another job that will require me full time?"

So Skillbridge is a program for military where, at the last 6 months of their enlistment, they can go intern for a company while still being paid by the armed forces. There’s not a whole lot of jobs that I’d enjoy doing through this program except for a vocational welding school. Which I don’t even really want to make my career but will be nice to have as a back up plan. 

My thing is that I just want to make good money for my family. I’ve been looking into federal jobs that could possibly pay 100k a year, which I would like. Maybe even being a cop. Something with more purpose, where I don’t wake up hating my job. 

Some of my family really wants me to do 20 years in the military for my retirement and benefits, but fuck all of that. I’m holding onto my last shred of sanity in the military. There has been no career progression while I’ve been in. But finding a federal job I can stack my military years on to my next career for retirement.

Unfortunately, the skills that I have gathered are not very marketable outside academia. I expect that I will need to learn some new skills, just not sure what to focus on.

I would appreciate insights of others on what you'd think might be a good fit for someone in my position. Ideally something that I can pick up on my own and wouldn't require me to go back to school.

He has a personal training business but we are considering that as a sideline, as people are not consistent with training. 

He just finished his bachelor's degree in business administration, and is going straight to an MBA. The school where he did his bachelor's and will do the MBA with gives a 15 credit waiver for students from ASCB accredited schools, and he will get a scholarship, so it makes sense to us.

Due to some mental health issues, he strongly prefers to work from home. I feel he has a lot of knowledge, but we aren't sure how to best utilize it."

I worked for a city agency from 2016 to 2018. I was not a perfect worker, but I did good work. I got all good reviews from my supervisor. But they very crudely let me go with no reason given, right before I was supposed to become permanent. This was after passing all tests.

After years of no contact, recently emailed this supervisor if she could give me a professional reference. I not no reply. Then I saw that she unconnected with me on LinkedIn. I sent a new connection request, and see it was declined since there is no longer a pending request.  I do see she is only connected with only one previous coworker there. So I am not sure what's going on.

I heard she left the training department and moved into a different area. But this does not explain why she will not give me a professional reference. She would have at least replied, unless, of course, she has a new email.

She was alway so nice! I am hurt and shocked that she has ghosted me like this!  At least the other coworker will give me a refrence.

How do I deal with the hurt from this?"

I’m currently 21 M, newly graduated with a BS in pre-dental / dental hygiene. I have a passion for the field of dentistry and have wanted to pursue becoming a doctor of dentistry since high school. I’ve decided that if I do follow this path, it would only be through the military (Navy or Air Force) as an officer since i’ve got an undergrad degree.  Currently I’m working on obtaining my dental hygiene license as well as preparing for DAT’s, my resume, and applying for HSPS (military medical career path). After shadowing and my education i’ve written off going to dental school and immediately entering the private sector. I love helping people, and am adamant about oral hygiene and what not so I really thought i’d be 100% sure that this was the field I wanted to be in. 
However, my love for aviation, planes, etc. keeps creeping up in the back of my mind…I’ve gotten to meet a few pilots, I love flying,    I use microsoft flight sim (closest I can currently get to the experience), and have just dreamed about becoming a pilot someday. Regarding this career I only know what i’ve read, heard in videos, or from pilots etc. and it does seem daunting to forego my current path and pursue this instead. 
Im just looking for anybody with experience in either field or just with their own perspective/ advice. Ultimately the choice is up to me and I will have to make up my mind soon about which field to go into. Thank you in advance. 

TLDR; undergrad degree in dental hygiene, do I pursue dental school with military, or become a pilot which has always been of interest."

Help?,u/Outrageous-Ebb5192,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/108dcxy/i_am_stuck_help/,careerguidance,"This is a throwaway account because i do not have the balls to do this on my real account. For reference I am a 18M from Wales. I have  applied to university this year but have had my heart set on Oxford knowing I have the potential to study and succeed there, but I did not convince them of this as today I was rejected. It was not a great surprise and my interviewers were cold in my interview and it felt like me being there was an inconvenience for them, but nevertheless I am upset, but also stuck. The other Unis I applied for were UCL, Kings Coll London, Queen Mary's London and Liverpool.  All great unis in their own right and I have received  offers from the last three, just waiting on UCL, and this is my issue. I needed AAA for Oxford, same with UCL and Kings. ABB for QMUL and UoL. I got ACD in my As results. I dropped the subject I got the D in and am resitting one exam I got the C in so that could bump my As Grades to AA if I get an A in the exam I am resitting. I am doing two years of RS A level in one as I dropped a subject. I was prepared to go through the academic hell of trying to get AAA for Oxford as it is the only uni I have ever envisioned myself going to but I don't know if I am prepared to do it for anywhere else. My ABB offers include Welsh Bacc which is technically my fourth subject but no AAA  offers would include it; I will get at least a B in Welsh Bacc in my sleep so I am not worried at all about getting ABB. This is where my first problem lies. Do I go through the torture of doing ten+ exams in the summer to go to UCL or Kings, do I drop a subject and just go for ABB, or do I do all my exams and see how my results go, potentially resitting again next year so I can apply to Oxford or Cambridge again?  Coming from  a small town with a family whom's parents don't earn a combined wage of £42,000, I don't think London could be the best option for Uni for me, but I always thought I would go to Oxford so there was no need to think of that before. I am just stuck on what to do as my heart has always been set on Oxbridge. Additionally, I have applied for history at undergrad, with the idea of doing a conversion year into law to go into the legal world that way, but is that just stupid?  I may just be doubting every decision I make now due to the rejection but rejection is not anything new to me. I could not speak until the age of five so nobody expected me to do much in school anyway and not many of my secondary school teachers thought I was smart, not even when I got GCSE results that would rival nearly anyone's in the UK. None of my family have even been to sixth form let, alone uni so I have always felt like the underdog and of the three whom applied to Oxford from my school, I was the one who received no help as they did not think I had a chance at an interview, let alone getting in yet I was the only one who got an interview. When I told my teachers, only my two history teachers cared. I am just stuck on what to do and where to go next. I am ambitious and want to succeed on a scale incomprehensible to what most people have ever thought of me and I am just stuck. I do not know what to do next so any advice would be deeply appreciated, I wish you well and thank you for reading this."

I’m in my early 30s with an undergrad and masters in psychology and psychological well-being but neither of these came with accreditation to be a therapist. 
My previous roles were in support, care, crisis work and in 2021 I got a trainee role as a psychological well-being practitioner (pwp).
The trainee roles require 1 year on the job training combined with a uni degree both of which need to be passed to fully qualify and keep my job. 
It’s not been a smooth ride and the uni has not been supportive, I currently stand at a course fail due to difficulties with academic writing. I only failed 1 piece of work but the uni are not allowing me to retry. 
My work has been great and supportive but if the uni won’t budge then they will have to let me go as I will be in breach of contract.
I’m preparing for the worst, looking at what roles I could do.
I ideally want to keep working in the same field but if I go back to the roles I did before I will struggle due to the cost of living rising, those wages won’t be enough to live on now.
Anyone know of any roles that pay £20k or higher that I may have the skills/experience for?
There’s more to the story but I don’t want to go on too much."

I was called for an interview where I gave them a detailed presentation of their challenges, and how. I would be able to help the organisation in my capacity. We had. wonderful discussion and they said they'll get back soon. 

Yesterday, I got a call from them congratulating me and offering me the position.   
Now, I am on a student visa in the UK, but I also have the graduate route visa which will allow me to work in the UK until January 2025. I told about my situation and they took the offer back.

According to their ""policy"", they can't offer me the position as it would leave THEM in a vulnerable space after two years. 

This seems very exclusionary and almost racist to me as a policy, which effectively would only employ people who have permanent visas, or are from the europe, which leaves a whole range of people from the global south to never enter this space.

Grew up in the area, never left. Bought it a couple years ago with somebody, but as of now, it's just mine. Ideally this would be great to live in as a family starter, but now I'm back to being a 26 year old guy on his own in a suburb.

This had me thinking about outside cities to move to. The thing is, Pittsburgh is so LCOL and I already own a home despite it being in a pretty dry location for a young guy on his own. I really have been thinking about kind of starting my life over again because there's so few people to meet where I am.

Just recently I was offered a job in NYC. Software Engineering position. The details are something as follows:

* $135k base salary
* Hybrid (2 days a week in office)
* Comparable benefits to my current ones and similar retirement contributions
* Looking at between $2k-$3k rent for a 1 bedroom

My current job/situation is:

* $59k base salary
* Fully remote
* Benefits and retirement similar in both
* $1200~ for mortgage payments

Running the numbers, I'd be left with more money every month over in NYC despite the higher cost of living. The issue is mainly this house. Do I rent it? Do I sell it? Do I pass up on this career opportunity in a new city while I'm still young? This is a tough decision and I'm not sure if this is a big leap in my career to fully try again elsewhere or if I should just take what I got here and try to scale within my own city.

I'd essentially be trading a 1300 sqft house with a yard and about $600~ left over every month for likely a 500 sqft apartment and about $2000-$3000~ left over.

Tbh, I’m not quite sure if I really like this position (sales) and if I have time to do this internship while doing my MA program full time. Based on what the company had told me, the workload will be heavy (seems like they are giving the intern a junior specialist’s workload). But it’s PAID (£2000/mo).

I’m not desperately in need of the money, and I’m not quite sure if I like/am fit for a sales position. Should I say no to the company now or wait after the final round of the interview? And how should I say no? (I feel bad because I feel like I wasted their time for not taking the offer)"

I really just want a stable 9-5 with some benefits, and opportunity for moderate advancement after time.

Employer A has a lot of problems, induces burnout in employees that care about their work, and can be perceived as having a ""shoots-and-ladders"" system of promotions/demotions. I was in a relatively high position within my department and enjoyed my work, but got burned out from the lack of progress and help (they have since acquired some help, but my old position is still vacant). I filled in for the top departmental position for a while (while never applying), and left shortly after a new dept. lead was hired. 

Employer 'B' is just ok. The pay is better and the job title looks good. But the work is boring and I'm very disconnected from the outcomes. I'm not really developing new skills or using old skills to their fullest. Unless I relocate out of state, there is no promotional opportunity. In contrast to my prior role, I have no leadership, managerial, or supervisory responsibility (not great for future career opportunities). I show up, I go home, and don't have to deal with anything outside of work (which is nice). 

However, the top departmental position at employer 'A' is open again. I realize that while not much changes in 6 months, the position with Employer A is much more fulfilling and better aligned with my long-term career goals. It would be a bump in pay, resume prestige, and accountability. 

Does anyone have anything to share about going back to a former employer in a new role, and how that turned out (for better or worse)? Any other input would be appreciated."

I am 26 y/o and currently working as a environmental consultant, which I am ready to transition out of. I was extended a tentative offer for a GS-12 Biological Scientist position back in August &amp; and recently got my request for 20 days of leave approved. I have just heard that my final offer should be coming in shortly. During this time I was contacted by a large service provider in our industry for a sales engineer position. Interviews went well and it sounds like an offer should be heading my way. The earning potential and upward mobility for this position is much higher. Both of these positions are local to me.

I am extremely conflicted as I feel like this is a once in a lifetime opportunity with the government position and the benefits sounds great, although, I have always wanted to try my hand at sales as I believe I would do great.

So I made a post recently regarding my desire to finish my degree and I spoke to an academic advisor today which left me feeling depressed after because of how much time has passed since I was last a student and petitioning grades won’t be easy anymore. 

I’m really overwhelmed and hating myself for not finishing the degree and now all that time is gone. I started in sociology but didn’t have any clear outcomes. 

My work history has been a mix of retail, manual labour and recently as a contact tracer. I’m not even sure where to go with that. My goal is to make a difference in someone’s life through my line of work. Healthcare would seem like the most obvious choice but I need to take into consideration the labour market trends as well. 

Can someone help me through this confusion that I am experiencing? I want to stop feeling like shit and find something I can work on instead of paying back tuition on a major I never finished and working dead end jobs."

We had a portal for some internal things for our company. But employees were sick of that shit portal. So after a long series of requests manager agreed to work upon that problem.

I shared those scripts with my colleagues and one level up seniors. I don't know why it blew their minds. Everybody is happy now except manager and his one subordinate they are still pushing their release to tackle a problem which is now already solved. And their solution is a bigger mess than previous portal to process.
Should I talk with my manager about this as senior people don't find him coordinating and won't confront him over this. One colleague told me to do only what you are paid for, don't interrupt management in their process they don't care about innovation.

26F w/ a Bach. in social work. Been out of the workforce bc of my health since Jan. 2018. I’m somewhat better now, but I don’t want to go into Social Work field anymore. 

I have applied to jobs that only require a HS degree, relevant experience, and references: (i.e., customer service roles, office, and retail jobs). Unfortunately, I don’t have any references anymore because I’ve been out of the work force so long! I also very minimal *relevant experience* for these types of jobs because my background is an autism services - a field which I’m no longer interested in working in. I feel I’m getting beaten by the local retirees and high schools kids in my town because that’s who I see working when I’m out and about. ***I can’t move towns because of my husbands job. 

I’ve been applying to the types of jobs above regularly since Aug. 2022, but I only got one reply for an office job. the people in the office, we’re extremely rude to me throughout the entire interview process.

-I have no connections and there’s no where to meet anyone (I don’t go to church) and I can’t afford to pay money to do any of the other social things in my town. 

-I had my resume professionally reviewed twice. I use keywords on my resume. I’m applying for jobs that I think I’m qualified for - some that I’m even over-qualified for. Yet, I’ve only received 1 interview request.

-working from home is not an option because my Wi-Fi is too slow for every single job that I applied for last year. Maybe I could get a mobile wifi thing? 

-Working at a call center or from home making calls it’s not an option because I can’t sit all day due to my health. 

note: I have no car and Ubers are too expensive. The bus doesn’t go all the way to neighboring towns. Maybe I could Uber until I can afford a car? 

What’s next for me? All I can think of to do is to get some certificate in a specific skill (which just so happens to be highly desired by companies in my area) OR to go back to school to get a masters. However, I don’t want to invest time and money (money that I don’t have) into something I’m not really interested in, just for the sake of survival."

I'm studying gamedesign in an online university, but I seem to make no progress, because of a lack of motivation.

I already switched my uni multiple times, and even when I think that this is the right thing for me, I seem to not find any motivation.

All the time I see myself doing something, it always has to be something that is challenging me and has some kind of competition or some numbers going up.

I had alot of these things that grabbed my attention in the last years, may it be some game like chess (where I constantly have a challenge and a way to improve, while seeing confirmation by my elo going up and competing with friends), some idle games (constant optimising of numbers and trying to get the best out of it), something like racing games (constantly seeing the improvement in time getting better), tetris (also seeing increase in speed and pattern recognition) and so on.

All these things and more seem to get my attention really quickly and I don't mind investing tons of time into them, especially when I have somebody to compete against. The thing with all those things, even when I would consider them as fun and not a waste of time, I still seem to be stuck and not able to progress in life. I'm still living with my parents and not even earning a little money to live independently of them.

I constantly seem to look for something that catches me like chess or other things I mentioned, where I can constantly work on and either make money or progress for a future career, something where I can see how I get better at it (making me see that when I do it more I get better and better results and increase my income for example), something where I can work on whenever I feel like it and being able to for example invest extra time to get extra reward out of it, something where I have multiple ways of improving different aspects of the job or career (compared to chess it would be just playing games, solving puzzles, watching videos about it or learning and experimenting, everything will improve my skill in another way and I can work on my weaknesses or specialize in my strengths).

I would like to have a career where I can constantly track how good I am at what I'm doing and directly see it in the results.

I attempted alot of other things that interested me like making music (the better I am at it the better the results and the more income, but it involves a great risk and the entry requirement like learning the programs is very high), graphicsdesign (same like with music if working for yourself), Gamedesign was a little bit of a compromise, because I thought I could make use of my creativity, but in the same time I just can't find motivation to get through this learning programs and everything part (which we don't even learn on the uni it's more a general thing).

I also like doing something with other people, even though I'm introverted and have social anxiety, I love to help people and I'm a good listener, but I'm really bad at convincing them of something and it's also not what I would like to do.

In my dream view I would like to have something that I like to do and constantly improve on, no matter if it is my own skill, or my whole business, where I can optimize more and more and be sucessful and especially motivated in the end.

I constantly feel behind in my life esepecially when I see my friends already finishing uni or working in a job, making progress in their careers, while I'm just wasting time, thinking of how to find the right thing for my life, my purpose and learning some skills that maybe make me happy, but won't bring me further in life."
24,2023-01-10,"My boss doesn't communicate, then blames me for mistakes I make. What would you do?",u/Vapor2077,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/108ibmr/my_boss_doesnt_communicate_then_blames_me_for/,careerguidance,"... Before anyone says ""get a better job,"" ... trust me, I'm trying! But I'm currently trying to finish a tech bootcamp and in the middle of moving, so I have a lot on my plate.

I'm on the marketing team of a relatively big company. We all work remotely. I've been there since May of last year. To say that this company is disorganized (or at least the marketing arm of it is) is an understatement.

IMO a lot of this boils down to my boss. It's clear that he's overworked. He cancels almost every meeting that's scheduled, whether they be 1:1's or team meetings. He often takes days to reply to emails. He replies to IMs usually as briefly as possible, often with only a couple words.

I have never worked in marketing before this role. I'm trying my best, but a couple things are causing major issues ...

1. Once I turn in a project, I'd say that on average, it's at least a week before I receive edits back from my boss. If I ask for follow-up clarification, it's at least a day before I hear back from him.
2. My workflow is generally that I receive a project from my boss, do it, wait for his feedback, tweak project as much as necessary, get his approval, then pass it on to the next step in the process.  
A couple months ago my boss asked some coworkers and I to create a content calendar. We did, and he responded a few days later with a bunch of feedback. He liked some of our ideas, didn't like a lot of them. We took his feedback into consideration, made changes, then resubmitted the calendar. It appears he never gave it a second look, because he never reached back out to us about the amended version or ""approved"" it.
3. Recently my boss scheduled a meeting between him, me, and one of my coworkers about the marketing plan moving forward. It was originally scheduled for last week, but he rescheduled this meeting to today. Then he canceled the meeting this morning, saying he was going to meet with the Chief Marketing Officer and get back with us (I don't expect him to ""get back with us"" any time soon). I was REALLY looking forward to this meeting, because I was hoping he'd clarify what he thinks of our content calendar. I've also turned in a few content projects in the last month that he either hasn't looked at or hasn't given the final approval to. So ...

Recently, I've been trying my best to make content with the limited info I have. This morning, my boss IM'd one of my coworkers (not me directly, for some reason) telling her that she and I need to ""pick up the pace"" and ""be more proactive."" However, it seems to me that HE has not been proactive with giving us feedback and direction regarding WHAT content he wants us to create and WHEN he wants it.

I'm frustrated because I feel like I WOULD be more productive if 1) He was more expedient with his feedback, and 2) He made it clear to us what he expected. I tried to state this diplomatically in an email. He just replied and said we'd talk about this more in the meeting, which he said will happen ""sometime this week.""

What should I do here? Should I turn in assignments and then keep bugging him until I get his feedback? I've avoided this because he often talks about how ""BUSY"" he is, and I don't want to bother him/disrupt his work, but ... I'm tired of feeling like I'm doing a bad job bc of his lack of communication!

This post turned into a bit of a rant. If you're still reading, thanks."

You know old school C-level people struggle to understand social media's value.

Hello all,

I am a finance student with one semester remaining and am unsure of how to proceed. I have worked in wealth management and operations as an intern throughout college and have a specific passion for investing for a younger demographic. I worked for a large wealth management firm, and understand you have to pay your dues and learn from those with experience, but I have always wanted to work for a company like Robinhood/WeBull/Coinbase. I enjoy the process of motivating my peers, who are of college age, and those uninformed to invest and think ahead.

Also, I have taken classes at my university to sit for the CFP exam whenever but am unsure where to look for and start a job post college. Especially given the loss of wealth, not many firms are hiring entry level positions. I have a very outgoing personality and believe I would also thrive in a sales role which would also allow me to gain experience. What I am seeking advice on is **I don't know where to start**, I want to ensure I have all the credibility as well for future financial advising endeavors.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I'd like to know what you think about my job-seeking struggles. I'm 24F, for context.

This is a wall of text, so I appreciate anyone who reads it!

I graduated in May 2021 with a quantitative field. I didn't anticipate joining the job market immediately; I hoped to continue my education. I couldn't continue the academic path because of a lack of preparation in the application process, not finding a funded program, and needing a clear goal of what I want to pursue as a career. Also, I slacked off on my major courses in college (due to several factors, including lack of motivation, losing interest in the field, etc.) and was hoping to get a fresh start with an advanced degree.

After graduation, I realized that my major was only helpful in the industry with technical skills. Throughout college, I avoided learning the skillsets needed in the job market for my field: I hated my major and couldn't switch (for various reasons). Afterward, reality hit me; I also got stuck with my chosen field because of my student visa status. I joined a technical boot camp and registered for online courses to learn the required technical skills. I also joined a program to assist me in resume building, interview prepping, etc. Like many job seekers, I applied to hundreds of jobs and worked on my interviewing skills.

Six months after graduation, I started working for a small startup on a project-based, part-time condition (similar to a contract but not bounded by time) and had the chance to apply what I learned. However, the disorganization and uncertainty of the tasks I get assigned and the meager compensation discourage me greatly. I continued applying to more prominent companies but have not been successful yet. However, I had the chance to interview with two top companies. I couldn't proceed to the final rounds as the hiring managers told me I needed to be more knowledgeable in business concepts (like giving recommendations) and preferred more senior people with experience. I was applying mainly to not-so-technical jobs because I'm always uncomfortable with those requiring solid technical skill sets. That's why communicating with non-technical people is needed, and I was told I needed to be stronger. My student visa status also raised sponsorship questions, and I got rejected by small companies quickly. And the big companies grilled me a lot. Because of the nature of my chosen field, there's always someone with all-rounded and better communication skills who is more culturally fit than me. Or there's some other reason I don't know.

Come this May, and it will be two years after graduating; I look back and feel shattered thinking about my decisions, perspective in life (not prioritizing money and talking about passion and doing something you like), and stubbornness ( I refuse to learn technical skills just because I don't have any interest; that's not a good reason, I know!) And my bad luck! In real life, I couldn't find anyone with a similar perspective on life or lack of interest, so I started thinking I am one of the rare people struggling this much, even with a so-called college degree.

Can anyone relate or give me an opinion? Please understand that purpose and interest are my driving factors in life, and that's why I struggled hard when I got stuck in a field I couldn't learn to like."

This was originally posted in r/Biology but I think this is a better place for it.   

I (21F) am graduating this semester with a bachelor's in Biology (and a minor in criminology).  I applied to a six-year Ph.D. program at a dream school and to the MS program at the university I am still at. I just got my rejection letter from the Ph.D. program, which makes me anxious  about my MS program. I'm a pretty good student overall, I have a 3.5 GPA  which, while I know isn't perfect, I'm highly involved in greek life,  in charge of multiple clubs, and do a lot of volunteer work in my community. I also worked as an RA for 3 years, which takes up a  significant portion of my time.

It isn't as though I really want to go to graduate school, I just don't know what to do after college. All of the lab jobs that take plain old bachelor's degrees require 2+ years of experience in highly specialized fields that don't have any entry-level positions, and none of the  university lab jobs are full-time, but still require enough time that I  couldn't take a second job, and so I would be unable to support myself financially.

The feedback I  received from my application stemmed from a lack of real lab experience,  despite being a decently qualified candidate, other candidates were  also qualified AND had lab experience. I feel like it's a catch-22. How can you get lab experience if you don't have enough experience to get a  lab job?

If anyone currently working with biology degrees has any advice, I would really appreciate it. I love genetics, I love microbiology! Some of the most rewarding college experiences were in class labs. I feel like I wasted 4 years getting a degree I can't use. I'm in AZ and I'm willing to move somewhere else if I have to.

There were two technical portions, a python portion and a SQL portion. I did the python question first. I'm not sure what happened, maybe it was the nerves, but I froze during the python portion, needed a lot of help, and was not able to finish the question. I did much better on the SQL end, I nailed that section, and answered all of their sql related questions.

After the technical portion, I asked thorough questions and gave a very passionate speech on why I would be good for this job and why it's my dream job, and I mentioned how I can learn coding continuously. They said they wished I had shown more aptitude during the python portion, but agreed that I can learn it and that I'm clearly very passionate about this job. I walked out of the interview not feeling great.

Later that night, I went ahead and decided to give the python question one more shot and was able to solve it on my own. Once that happened, I emailed them a thank you email, but also told them I decided to give the python question a shot on my own to prove that I'm capable of coding in python. I sent them the code I wrote and explained it in great detail to prove I knew what I was doing. I mentioned that this may not help my chances but I still didn't want to leave the question incomplete.

Anyways, the lead architect who has been interviewing me and has been very communicative, always responding within the hour has not responded back. Should I take this as a sign and cut my losses or is there hope for me?"
2,2023-01-10,Should I go back to college?,u/LayZBabe,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/108kf0r/should_i_go_back_to_college/,careerguidance,"21F I was in college when I first got out of high school but then dropped out because I was depressed but also felt like it wasn’t for me. I went to a community college in my home town and it was small like I had 3 classes with the same person and she was also my advisor so I honestly felt like the days just never ended and it was the same thing day after day. I eventually moved to Florida, I got a welding and pipe fitting certificate at a trade school and have been working as a welder/fabricator for a year now but now after working in this field I realized that I don’t particularly like it but I do enjoy welding on my free time. I’ve dealt with lots of sexual harassment, creepy men and a lot of people thinking I don’t know what I’m doing and with all that it started to make me hate my job and welding. I’ve tried to look into other jobs but I end up with no luck so I’m at the point where I think I’d like to go back to college again and really put in the effort but I’m not sure if I should do online classes or go back to school. Online classes might be easier with having to work full time but I feel I won’t take it as seriously and it might be harder for me to focus. With going back to an actual campus I’m not sure I’d be able to make enough money to keep up with my bills. I don’t know what colleges to even look into or where to start. Anyone have any advice? I know a couple of things I would be interested in going back to school for but I don’t want it to end up being a waste of money like I feel like it was for me to go to a welding school. I’m interested in doing maybe something in accounting/finance or maybe teaching?"

I've lost my passion and desire for having a business career",u/darrens1lverman,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/108kvfy/how_to_get_my_mojo_back_ive_lost_my_passion_and/,careerguidance,"A few years ago, I was business major in college, with dreams of working in a big company, having a fancy office job where I get to dress in slacks and button up shirts, be considered smart, educated, and financially successful. I had dreams like a little boy who looks up to Mickey Mantle or Michael Jordan, except I idolized business people. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do, but if it could be summarized in one word, I wanted to be a yuppie. Yep, that old outdated term from the 80s/90s, young urban professional. I wanted to be Chandler Bing in Friends, Mel Gibson in what Women Want, Christian Bale in American Psycho, Tom Hanks in Big. I didn't know what they did for a living, but all I knew was they didn't stink coming home from work, they dressed classy, dated hot babes, and had cool apartments in big cities.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was an aspiring student, I had so many dreams of finally working in a office job, after being dusty ass warehouse worker, dishwasher, fast food server for so many years. I used to walk around Times Square on early mornings when it was still dark, looking up at the Ernst and Young sign, praying that I'll be up there one day. My alarm clock was ""Fly me to the Moon"" by Frank Sinatra, not because I liked the song, but because it reminded of Bud Fox commuting into the city at the beginning of the movie Wall Street. I used to tear up at the end of Pursuit of Happyness, thinking that must be the greatest feeling in life to finally get the job, have a fancy office job where people will respect you. I thought life would be amazing - it would be hard work for sure, but manageable, doable, and coupled with a better lifestyle. I had so much drive and motivation - I looked forward to the day I could bring my pillow to sleep in the office, so I could brag to my dumb loser friends in my small hometown, that investment banking requires 80-100 hours per week, and only the strong can survive.

&amp;#x200B;

That was around 2017. Fast forward to today, I'm unemployed, have been fired from all my professional jobs that I've had, and have never been promoted. My main blame is that I started my career in accounting, thinking it was the hardest, driest, most boring of the business subjects. I took pride in understanding complex boring topics - I considered fun colorful business majors like marketing to be for people not smart enough for accounting or finance. Turns out, I sucked at my job, I hated my job, I hated the people at my job, my immediate team hated me because of this, and my confidence was tanked ever since. They would treat me like crap, and I had no defense because I was always skating on thin ice because of my subpar performance. I had nothing in common with any of them, they were socially conservative people who talk about the weather, their wife and kids, and football. They thought I was weird and resented me for being into eccentric things. 

Eventually, I moved into B2B sales which I like much more, and I'm definitely better at, but still not where I want to be. Problem is, when I made the career move, 3 life events completely changed my mentality:

\-getting shit on by my accounting co-workers tanked my confidence

\-I turned 30

\-I experienced a bad injury 

Turning 30 meant that my dreams of being a cool young guy filled with piss and vinegar, the world at his feet, ready to grab life by the horns, to now, I'm a ""mister"" who now has grey hairs, seen as too old for the hot babes of NYC, too old for entry level jobs, less of a desire to work his ass off and make millions, lower testosterone so less drive and risk appetite.

The injury was even worse because the largest part of my confidence comes from my physical fitness. After being so excited to start B2B sales after leaving accounting, I completely bombed my first B2B sales job because I couldn't go to the gym, couldn't do my favorite hobbies, I was constantly in pain, seeing doctors, instead of focusing on doing my job well. On top of this, I suffered more debilitating injuries during the pandemic, and was unbelievably stressed with my living situation, so it affected my second sales job as well. (I'm mostly good now and rehabbed - but the psychological effect plus having aged 3-4 years has changed me)

And my bad experience working in accounting made me feel like the dumbest person on earth. Some of my co-workers would joke about how the CPA is not even that hard, and can't understand why some people can't pass it. They constantly ragged on me, and the most annoying thing is that I'm used to blue collar work environments, where if men disrespect or get aggressive with other men, they do so with the understanding that they are liable for their words and may have to back it up. It was infuriating knowing that these dudes only had a pair of balls because I was the worst employee at the firm, and would never speak to me that way outside of the office context. But at the end of the day, I came in thinking I was smart, and left thinking I need to go back to wearing a hard hat and swinging a hammer in the sun.

Now, I finally have some experience in my desired field, but because of my prior experiences, I find that I'm giving less of a shit that ever before about hitting it big in business, and living that dream yuppie life. I absolutely despise corporate slang, (""to give you more color"", ""circle back"", can you ""ping"" me later, etc) don't care about stocks, don't want to read Zero to One anymore, I've lost my hunger. I remember seeing one of my former young co-workers getting all excited when we finally got the Bloomberg terminal installed in our office, because he was going to finally play with the toys that the big boys on wall street use. I was envious of the passion that he had, and remembered when I spent weekends studying to get my Bloomberg terminal certification, so happy to learn about anything about finance. I wish I could muster up that enthusiasm again, because it would not only make me happier, but it's very good to have in sales.

My question, have any of you guys gotten the passion back after losing it? I had an opportunity at a job that was absolutely perfect for me - it was working with the stock market, pitching to hedge funds, learning about finance. I would have killed for such a job back then. I wish I went straight to sales instead of trying to prove something by working in accounting (to show that I'm good with numbers I guess?). My lack of interest and passion shows in my performance, and I just want to be that bushy tailed young graduate again. So I'm here at reddit for maybe some advice or words of encouragement.

TLDR:

\-OP was a starry eyed young student looking to work in some kind of fancy office job, any job that was considered smart and difficult

\-OP tried accounting, sucked at it, hated it, had all his confidence zapped from this experience

\-OP went to sales where he thought he'd do well, but a series of physical injuries zapped his confidence even further, and affected his work performance

\-OP has gotten to a pretty good place, B2B sales in fintech industry, which checks off all his ""sexy"" business job requirements, except he is now jaded and has lost motivation to be a fancy office guy. It's hard to even be motivated by money.

\-OP wants to turn the clock back and be the naive young guy again who used to listen to Warren Buffett interviews, read books on fundamental analysis, be hungry to consume all information on business. 

\-OP seeks reddit's advice. Whether it's ""go learn a trade, you're too dumb for business"", or ""stay in sales but sell to a blue collar industry"" or ""watch this movie/TV show, it'll pump you up"" or a motivational story about taking several jobs to find the right company, and now life is excellent."
1,2023-01-10,Can someone give me thier perspective?,u/b_33,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/108kwc7/can_someone_give_me_thier_perspective/,careerguidance,"Started a job (with another employee in similar role, this will become important later), seemed welcomed at first (Heads of departments and senior staff taking the time to say hello and or had casual friendly conversations with junior staff). Provided equipment for role (first red flag: not all software required for role on computer made it difficult to do job).I rationalise no biggy, sometimes companies aren't 100% ready. 

Get placed on project, have meeting with project manager (second red flag: it's barely a briefing no outlining of deliverables, timing and or ownership of work). I rationalise, maybe they just weren't ready in time they will fill in the gaps.

So time passes with me not being sure what I'm required to do and manger too busy to provide direction and project manager seems primarily concerned with covering ass (incidentally, red flag number three). I rationalise, I'm grown they probably expect I show some initiative, so I do just that.

 As time progresses, I start trying to get acquainted with staff on my level. Most conversation are met with silence or a clear lack of desire to engage(fourth red flag). I rationalise, maybe I said the wrong thing maybe people are just reserved. Time goes by, and the person I was hired with is let go (fith red flag). Now, this person was slightly more experienced than I but now thier work becomes mine (maybe sith red flag). I rationalise, they said he was on a contract and could no longer afford him and hey I now have something to do work wise. 

Time goes by. The person who was let go worked closely with another coworker whom I now had to work with but the change ownership of responsibility (after being a nice person) starts being critical of my work and knowledge (seventh red flag and I have no idea where it came from).

I start to also notice, a feeling of being increasingly isolated from the rest of the office. My manager suddenly starts to engage more with me, sort of how am I doing how are things going sort of thing (eighth red flag, maybe). I rationalise he was busy and this is just part of his job and he now has a chance to do it. 

Times goes by, and a junior staff member joins my team and they are ultra competitive. They throw little condescending comments and seem intent on proving they are better than me. I keep my cool and they decide to leave the business as they are seeking a promotion. At this same time, the negativity of the workplace (criticism of work, cold shoulders, poor communication) seams to increase (maybe a ninth red flag, maybe someone is dragging my name through the mud and if I'm honest I'm thinking the junior staffer has something to do with it as they seem to rub shoulders with everyone). 

My manager still checks in, but seems to increasingly asks things like what is your workload like, suggests projects but then says you are too busy so asks others to do the work...fast forward to today, I'm staffed on a project only to have the deliverables of that project given to a staff member from another team (despite being initially consulted about the deliverables) the excuse being you are to busy on another project.

Time to leave? Being pushed out? Set up to fail (for context, junior staff want promotions and senior staff also seem to be chasing promotions)? Bad company culture? I'm just a big baby?

TL:Dr exposure to projects being minimised, feeling like I'm being pushed out but not sure how I got here."

I know my salary won't increase any time soon, but the workload is getting bigger each week for the ""*survival of the company*"". 

I work for a small web design/marketing company. The HQ is located in Europe and I work for the offshoot in the U.S. 

Everything is poorly run and micromanaged by the owner who only monitors company profit (when we have it) so he can build additions to his farmhouse and remodel all the rooms within it (I know him personally. I also see the P&amp;L statements.). 

I'm at an impasse. I've started to apply for account management and sales positions at larger tech companies as I feel that's my best move financially, and for my future. I have a strong work ethic and I'm always ready to learn new skills. My applications haven't been successful yet, But now I have a horrible feeling I might be overlooked as my resume only details positions held at my current company and the skills/ accomplishments are not relevant to those I'm applying to. Also, no college degree. I've fallen out of love with this industry I'm in, so it's time for a new challenge.

I've held senior positions in 3 key areas; Web Project Management, Sales, and Operations. I'm self-taught in small business operations as there was no one else capable at the time. My knowledge of this grew extensively with the gradual hiring of employees and the processes, policies, and onboarding that follows. 

What would you suggest if you were in my position?"

It's a bit tough applying alongside a full-time job.

That wouldn't sound like a great reason to my HR department of course. My organisation does offer career breaks, but you need to have a good reason which I understand can include stuff like wanting to travel the world which I think is the most common reason.

I probably wouldn't do much travelling though - I'd probably just run, swim and cycle and spend more time applying for alternative jobs.

What is a good reason I can give that isn't a complete lie? If I say I'm going to travel loads and then don't travel at all it may be a bit of a slap in the face to them. Of course they probably wouldn't bother verifying, so I could still use that reason, but I'd prefer a less strong lie if possible.

EDIT: I suppose I'd look to take something like 3 months and would hopefully find an alternative job in that time so wouldn't actually look to return..."

While the position is interesting, pay is okay and the job would allow me to move closer to my family, I am doubting my decision because it is not exactly what I wanted for my career. I  have an interview for another position ""B"" open, which would be my favourite, since it would probably be better for my long-term career (more competitive environment, which I would be eager to dive into at my current point in life-although I do value a good work-life balance)

Now I am debating whether to stick with position A, since it is a very decent offer, or back out before signing and continue the draining process of interviewing. I currently have a job, so technically no hurry, but very unhappy in mycurrent job and far away from my family - so going with position A would be a quick fix.

Any guidance? My gut feeling has provided no help whatsoever at the moment. I know some people say it is possible to back out again even after accepting, but this is very hard for me ethically and I am very worried about my reputation, since the field I work in isn't huge (but not too small either). Then again, I already started my last job with a lot of doubts and don't want to make the same mistake again and stay true to myself."

Well, I’m inclined to believe her about being a great fit, because it’s now 5pm and I’ve been contacted by 5 different recruiters today who wanted to represent me for this exact same position. I’ve thanked them all for reaching out and informed them that I have already been submitted for the position, not thinking much of it until just a few minutes ago when I was contacted yet again. 

But this recruiter actually included details about pay rate, and to my surprised she is quoting over $6 more an hour than the recruiter who has already submitted me. 

I don’t know what to do with this! I know that I can’t change my mind and go with this new recruiter now. I know it’s extremely unprofessional to do something like that, and that my resume is likely to be thrown out by the client if they see me being submitted twice by two different recruiters.

But, the difference in offered pay here is substantial enough that I feel like I shouldn’t just ignore it. 

Let’s say that everything goes great and I end up being offered this job. Would I be in a position to try and negotiate for more than the $32/hr I was submitted at? If I do try to negotiate, should I bring up that I was offered more by another recruiter as part of my justification, or should I not talk about that? Is there at all a risk of the client redacting their job offer because I tried to get a higher pay rate? Would it be best to just take the $32/hr and keep my mouth shut?

Any and all feedback would be really appreciated. Thank you!

This has been going through my mind for the recent months. Little backstory, started there in December 2021 as before the pandemic hit, I was self employed doin small work here and there. 27yo Male with a BS in business administration and management.  Ever since the pandemic quit I took a small break trying to figure out a path in life, and the break turned out for over 18 months. I took this job upon a friend that worked there, as they needed some help in the office.

This is a small trucking company, over 30 trucks, but the office consists of 5-6 people. Mostly close friends and family. I started there as I didn't have much expenses at the time being, and wanted to try something new. At first I enjoyed it. I was learning something every day, and trying to excel at every task given to me. Months passed by,  I got back on my feet,  moved out alone this past summer, and       feel like every week that passes by I feel like I cannot sit at this place any longer.

As this is a company where everyone is older than me, each person has their specific job, and there is me filling in for everyone else. I can't complain about the money anymore too much, as I have gotten many pay raises, but it's far different from your traditional ""company"". This is an European small business.  I feel like I have learned to do every skill here and while I'm not a master of any, I feel like everything is part of my responsibility now. Even the accounting department which consists of one of the bosses and two ladies, come to me with issues that should not be done by me, and only by them. At first this was enjoyable, and I do not mind helping others, but I feel that there is no sense of individual workloads at this company. When it hits the fan, everyone is to blame. Total chaos at times. I tried to quit this past fall, giving a notice to the boss, that I really appreciate the chance they given me, however I might not be the person they looked for this position. He persuaded me to stay, by giving me a day off each week, and just slightly cutting my pay. I feel as this backfired because even though I am not there, and could do everything at home each day given it's an office job, the other employees sure do talk a lot about it, and others, and I feel the tension sometimes.

I am scared to finally put my foot down and look for something else, because the bills and payments alone scare me If I did not find a job soon enough. I'm scared of everything turning out to be ""Grass is greener on the other side"". I just cannot go there everyday and pickup workloads for people and feel like this is my responsibility. With no clear workload and personal responsibility each day, and with no possibility of promotions, maybe that's the ""type of person"" they were looking for in this position?

Has anyone else been at a crossroads like this? Feeling something is not right, but just being to complacent with your current day to day, and scared of the unknown? I feel like I get handed the things that even the owners don't want to take care of, and feel like it should be my responsibility where I don't even have the tools to complete those tasks.

I worked my way up to the head chef position, which I accepted in mid-October.  They asked me to promise them a year for stability sake, and I agreed. I didnt however sign any paperwork when I took on this new role. 

The job isn't really what I signed up for. I don't have any real power to make significant changes. The owners don't include me in food costing or menu changes. I work an excessive amount of hours, and I get msges from the minute I wake up until well past midnight. I work through any holiday time I might have, and the owner is on my case day in and day out, overly emotional making decisions with out telling me or firing staff they don't like even if it's killing the moral of the team and against my better judgement. 

My mental and physical health is suffering, I've put on 20lbs, my exema is out of control (it's stress related) and I pinched a nerve in my neck because I just can't relax... ever. I'm becoming a chef who yells at people because I just can't emotionally self regulate. I'm burnt out and crying at home constantly and am just entirely overwhelmed with trying to look out for the best interest of our staff as well as the longevity of the restaurant.  

I have some opportunities coming up that are more in line with the food I want to specialize in in the future. Working with a chef, I really respect. I want to go to him and ask if he is looking for staff for the restaurant he is opening next month. 

Is it okay for me to give my 1 months notice even though I promised them a year? I feel like they havemt held up their end of things by making me a glorified sous chef and a punching bag for their bad decisions."

My situation is pretty tricky since as a unionized department, ‘promotions’ are essentially waiting for a higher job title to be posted internally and applying for it. 

We also don’t do performance reviews so there isn’t a good timing to talk about why I deserve a promotion. 

My team has been pushing to my manager and I’ve had several talks about career progression and made it clear I’m going for this role, which I’m qualified for and have already been performing. I’m very ambitious and had glowing reviews from my team and my manager. Because of my qualifications, when I got hired I was told I would get this promotion once I finish probation. (Which was almost a month ago)

Recently I’ve been assigned many new responsibilities beyond my role and every-time I bring the job posting up, I get told “soon”. I am new-ish and these new responsibilities benefit me career-wise, so I don’t want to decline or make demands. To add more insult to injury, someone quit and now we have a vacant role, and with how the structure works I am next in line. Perfect set up, right? Everything seems to align in my favour.

However, its been months and they still haven’t posted the job posting, I understand this may be a budget issue, but I have a feeling they may be trying to delay this for as long as possible to save money since this role needs to be filled eventually.

How do I bring this up the 4th time without sounding a whiny toddler? My last resort is going to the union but I don’t want to tarnish my relationship as I want to grow within the company. I am not the best at negotiating and is terrible with confrontations; I fold easily. Any advice would help!!"

I only had a year of experience in my past role but was ready for a promotion and I received it. My past role I made $93K which was inflated, and this role I was offered $105K. My manager said he knows its on the lower end and not what he wanted for me but 15% is the allowed salary bump for promotions now as the company is not in a great financial position. I talked to my director and she already asked him to give me more as well and he said this is the best they could do and thinks it wont get me anywhere but I could ask if I want.

Is it worth me asking for more, or just accept it for what it is and gain experience?"

I'm 27 and have worked in facilities for 5 cumulative years at two different businesses, and my current position is not paying me what I feel my time in trade should be compensated at.

I also initially took the job as a lead position with hopes and promises of moving away from the actual labor part of facilities and moving into more organizational lead work. However after about a year at my current job, I got a small raise (from 20/hr to 23/hr) and a title change to ""Facilities Engineer"". I really haven't gotten any chances to lead anything or step away from just being another facilities tech and being boots on he ground. 

I can already feel my body getting used up, and it's becoming increasingly clear that there isn't any type of progression where I could make this a career. 

I also haven't set myself up for success with other avenue of work, I only have an associates and my only long term skills have been built out of maintenance/facilities work.

Where should I look for change? I dread the thought of being stuck in this field or taking a pay cut to start over.

Any ideas on industries that would be a good transition? Unfortunately neither of my jobs in this field have offered to pay for any professional certification in anything, so I feel discouraged looking at other job postings where I feel like I fucked myself by not having their minimal requirements.

There isn't a single subject that I could say I excel at nor do they interest me very much, although I enjoy chemistry, I am pretty average at everything, math isn't my strong suit and I sometimes stuggle with it although i think I could get better if I put more effort into it. I like spending time researching things in-depth, learning new stuff, though sometimes it is hard for me to concentrate on actual work. Something I would like in the future is to work by my own schedule, though i wouldnt mind grinding it out, doing the 9-5 , but only up to a certain point. I've been looking into various fields, (salary seems pretty important to me), some of which piqued by interest, those include

* **Pharmacy**
* **Forensic Sciences**
* **Psychology** (Forensic?) (Psychology degree into Finance? I've seen people talking about business degrees being useless and something you can learn on your own)
* **Finance/Business** (don't know if its related, I did some trading, stocks, cryptocurrency, i enjoyed making research and seeing profits)
* **IT/Computer Science/Software Development/Computer Engineering/Data Science/Cybersecurity** (I've seen that these degrees require lots of maths, as I'm not really good at it, would need to study more and get better grades. I like working with computers, don't have much experience, enrolled in some programming language courses, I enjoyed them, learning new things, but kinda dropped them because lacked motivation and discipline, would like to learn more and need to look into what each one does)

I was hired about 6 months ago by a very well-known public transit agency. I was so happy to get the job coming out of grad school, but have since had multiple things go on at work that have left me questioning whether I'm being set up to fail or whether I'm just bad at my job!

As soon as I started the job, I learned that my manager was on parental leave for an extended period. Then 3 months into getting hired, my coworker (and the only other person in the entire agency that could do my job) left for a better opportunity. I was only given a few weeks of training to take on what is a very critical role at the agency. Recently there was a major project that left me incredibly stressed, overworked, and where it felt like I made some mistakes that could have been avoided if I had gone through a project of similar nature with someone guiding me, prior to doing it myself alone. My manager recently got back and I've had this strong sense that he doesn't like me, which is not something I typically sense with many people as I try to be very friendly. I have since also learned that my position has high turnover, with the last three people in my position not lasting past a year before leaving. To make matters even worse, my manager doesn't even know what I do! I'm considered the expert in my niche at the agency, despite only being here for half a year.

I wanted to ask if anyone here has gone through similar struggles or have any advice/insight into how I can improve on this situation. The job is considered a ""good one"" due to the money/agency, but I'm struggling to find out if it's worth staying in with the stress/high expectations."

Timeline:
I started in 2019 as a coordinator, promoted to senior coordinator November 2021, applied for 1 of 5 open analyst positions. Applied and interviewed in September 2022. Was denied promotion then promoted to a new position created ""just for me"" as an associate analyst, plus my duties as Sr. Coordinator (November 2022).

I referred an employee to replace my coordinator position who was hired in April 2022. My trainee (white male) applied at the same time as me for the analyst position and was promoted in September 2022 to the analyst position. There are 2 analyst positions that have yet to be filled. 

Descrimination History:
Trainee was assigned a ""high priority"" state that I assisted on (aka prepare everything and having the director approve before filing) for 2 years. I even trained the previous analyst how to do the job. 

I am a Hispanic female. The coordinator/admin positions have been filled with Hispanic and white employees for the past decade (at least) but only the white employees have been promoted to salaried positions. Not one Hispanic employee has ever been promoted to a salaried position in my department, that's 20+ years streak. There is one non-white salaried in the department and they were just hired. 

I am coincidentally the only ""analyst"" who is an hourly non-exempt employee; performing the same job as previous salaried analysts. I'm getting paid $20,000 less than my trainee now. They won't even approve overtime for me, I am seriously expected to do two jobs in 40 hours. Instead, I've been instructed to ask my manager to finish any of my tasks left at the end of each day. It's still extra work to delegate those tasks and sometimes they don't get done which then gets blamed on me!

I complete my associates degree in paralegal studies this month, but a college degree is not required per the job description. 

My education and/or race are the only two possible explanations for why I was denied the promotion. When the director met with me via video chat to let me know that I was denied the analyst position and would be promoted to a newly created associate analyst position, she said it was because she and the managers thought I would need too much training. But she is apparently fine with training a new employee who has only 5 months of experience on the hardest job on the team.  Starting to feel like opposite land yet? 

I haven't received any negative feedback on my annual review in 2 years. 

***********

I want to email pretty much all of what I wrote here, albeit more concisely. 

At the end I want to lay out some acceptable solutions:
A) Promote me to a ""real"" salaried analyst position and assign me CA. 
B) Promote me to the new salaried operations manager position.
D) Give me unlimited overtime each week to complete both jobs.

They will probably fire me under the guise of being 1 minute late clocking in or whatever. But if they do then I will file a complaint all the way to the top. I'm planning to find a new job anyway, just can't leave this month. 

I've already spoken with an employment attorney and following their instructions. But this post is mostly to vent, hear about similar experiences, and advice on how to phrase my points listed above.

Thanks!"

I am trying to find a new job because my current job won’t let me decline their health insurance and bring my own private insurance. The only way that they will allow me to decline their health insurance is if I am married or have military insurance. 

I have reported them to everyone. I have went to DOL, my states DOL, I have been to the news because I have felt discriminated against, and I have even complained to my governor, and right after I did this a few days later they gave me a $1.30 raise, but no help from any organization. I cannot afford my works insurance and private insurance from the healthcare market is cheaper than my works insurance and better.

I am beginning to look for a new job ASAP. I have even told my boss that I honestly cannot wait it out and that I am going to look for a new job and he seems very understanding. Can I post on my LinkedIn publicly that “I am looking for help finding a new job, and here is why I am trying to leave my current position”?"

1,2023-01-10,Moving back to IC. Sensible?,u/Difficult_Swing_5112,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/108s18v/moving_back_to_ic_sensible/,careerguidance,"I work as an analytics manager at a big company. I’ve been there for a year and I’m about to be laid off for big-company-sort-of-BS reasons (they’re merging teams and they want the other team’s manager to take over my team, even if he is not qualified).

For context, I’ve been managing teams for 5 years, very successfully. The people I have led tend to grow, learn, deliver valuable work, and become more confident. I have great relationships with my team members from previous roles and some of them have even followed me onwards. I love managing people. That said, I hate management bureaucracy and politics, which seems to be the only thing I do these days. I’m also incredibly bad at upward management. I’m constantly feeling drained and numb after full days of meetings about meetings, deciding things by committee, etc. The more senior I get, the less intellectual my work becomes. I’m borderline miserable. 

The upcoming layoff is actually a blessing in disguise because I’m not happy in this role. I was just comfortable. My manager is also not very good to me and I think I deserve better than that. 

I’m almost sure I want to go back to being an IC. My main reasons:
1) doing intellectual work instead of menial office politics 
2) by investing in hands-on skills, I could eventually work on a project/contract basis to balance work with hobbies, travel and family. I could do this internationally as well. There are more options. This is very exciting to me because it signifies freedom (millennial here!)

The problems are:
1) I have impostor syndrome. The people I manage are much better analysts than me. Don’t get me wrong, I’m better at the big picture, strategy, roadmaps, and generally what needs to be done. But I’m not as great in execution anymore and I don’t know if I can go deep anymore because I’ve been doing superficial work for so long. I’m scared this is going to set me back
2) There are few IC roles that pay a managers salary
3) I fear this might look bad on the resume. It might be bad optics (unless I justify it properly, which I definitely can do)
4) People always tell me I shouldn’t give up on management because I’m excellent at it. They do have a point. Seems like a waste of a (rare) skill
5) What if I want to return to leading? What if I realize I’ve made a mistake?
6) I’m scared I will not want to take direction from my new manager because they’re probably going to be less experienced and knowledgable than me at this point 
7) I’ve moved jobs a lot lately. I think it’s part the nature of the tech industry, and I also have valid reasons (like this layoff, or the bullying in my previous company, or the incompatible job/industry before that), but will moving to IC make me look directionless?

I’d really appreciate insight on the above points from anyone who’s been in a similar position, or any general advice from anyone who wants to encourage or dissuade me from making this move. Thanks in advance, Redditers!"

I work for a corporate bank &amp; I have recently won an annual reward at work which is a trip to go to Florida USA for 3 days.

Unfortunately, at this moment I am not capable to go on the trip due to personal circumstances. I did write to my manager and kind of hinted in a professional way... if there may another way of getting recognized but... the response I got back kind of ignored that part... the manager just went to and on congratulating me on my great achievement.

One of my friends who worked for the company did choose to take a cash incentive rather than a trip (Not sure how).

Secondly, during COVID they canceled these trips and paid them in cash.

I just feel like I should be compensated in another manner? How shall I approach this? Shall I continue to try to look for other ways to be rewarded &amp; do I speak to HR or how shall I go on about this?

Part of my dilemma is I'm facing a bit of imposter syndrome and I figured I'd ask random people of reddit on their opinion.

Job Offer:

Salary 120k/year plus bonus. I wasn't disclosed how much the bonus would be but I'd guess not much.

Benefits: Better than current job but about the same. This is not as big of a deal as I am on my spouse's insurance.

401k: Match up to 6%

PTO: 20 days (including sick days)/year

Overtime: Does not pay overtime

Current Job:

Salary: 93k/year, expect this to go to 99k ish in March. Does not include bonus.

Benefits: See Job Offer above.

401k: Match up to 3%

PTO: 25 days (including sick days)/year

Overtime: Pays 1.0x hourly rate

I currently do not work any overtime really for my current job, but based on reviews for the company for the job offer I suspect there is a good amount of overtime.

My current job is super flexible with working from home when I want (i.e. I don't need permission) and makes work/life balance nice. I also enjoy the people I current worth with and company culture is generally very good. I do not have a good understanding of work/life balance of the job offer, but I suspect it less than my current job. I also do not have the best understanding of company culture for the job offer.

The type of work that I'd be doing is also different, so I'm worried there will be a big learning curve and I will essentially look stupid in front of my coworkers (hence imposter syndrome).

I am in general very nervous about potentially switching jobs and needing to learn the new systems/design aspects. I am also happy with my current job aside from my pay. I also have very few friends where I live and most of them come from my current workplace. I'm nervous I will lose them as friends if I leave.

I guess I'm just asking for general advice about my current situation or other aspects you may consider?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I forgot to say, I am questioning whether I am mentally ready to accept this new position given that it'll be more work than my current position."

1,2023-01-10,Recent graduate feeling lost and doubting with very little success ?,u/Wanna_make_cash,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/108ubzl/recent_graduate_feeling_lost_and_doubting_with/,careerguidance," 

I graduated from a public university with a bachelors of computer engineering back in may 2022. I did pretty okay in school I think, but I was not prepared for the 'real world' whatsoever by my schools program. Very basic stuff in the courses, so even though I graduated with an okay-ish GPA (3.53), I had absolutely zero knowledge of front end, back end, APIs, web development, etc coming out of graduation. It turns out, those are all very very important things for job listings and its hard to get noticed without those skills. Instead, my school only taught basic C, Python, and Java, and absolutely no mention of related technologies like Spring and Spring Boot for java. Good luck finding a java job listing that doesnt list either of those, or also require React to handle front end stuff with java on the back.

Still, I threw applications where I could. My resume gets some responses. Not many, but some. Ive worked with my schools Career Services center on my resume the best I can. Most of my applications get rejected. One company I got in to a technical interview with, but I bombed a very simple task and looked like a complete idiot. Another company ghosted me after an initial phone screening. Another company gave me a take home assessment to create a little game like Mastermind, and rejected me after submitting it without telling me what I could have improved upon or done better, so I have no idea if I just suck or what. Really demotivating though, I'll tell you that.

I've been trying to self-teach myself stuff like Spring Boot and restful APIs, but it is really hard to find the time, energy, and ways I can effectively do so. I keep thinking of 'pipe dream' projects I can add to my resume, but its difficult for me to be motivated to watch videos and read docs on this stuff I was never introduced to in school while also dealing with a lot of recent stress from life and maybe some poor mental health thrown in. This is making me think that this field isnt for me or something. Im not sure. I wouldnt know what to do with my life if I cant land a job in this field and tough it out or something. My degree isnt really transferable to other stuff, and while I dont have a lot of debt (thanks to Pell grants and scholarships, I only had to take out 4,000 in student loans across all 4 years of university), but I still dont want my degree to be a waste. I am still trying to slowly watch these multi-hour long spring boot 'tutorial' videos and project examples, but its tough to sit through it all and understand anything. Nobody seems to explain the whys or whats of these things, just ""you do this thing"".

I know job hunting is only going to get harder as more and more time passes. Itll be an entire year after graduation before i even know it, and eventually ill be looked at like a weirdo for having no experience a year after graduation.

Maybe it's just a numbers game, but unfortunately, I cant just spam applications at every company that exists in the country because of a key issue: My life is not in a position where I can relocate at the moment. I live with my only parent and help him out because he doesnt make enough money to live on his own, so I have to help out and spend money that i earn from part time jobs and such just to help us make ends meet. I am also not evenly remotely prepared to live on my own due to no savings and no experience, but even if I was, I wouldnt want to leave my father alone for the time being. point is, I am restricted to local-ish companies and my city isnt the greatest for tech. It's not middle of nowhere Kansas, but its not LA, SF, or NYC either. This isnt an excuse, but life just has circumstances for me now and it feels really bad and theres a lot of financial stress on me and my dad which is making me reconsider things and find some random full-time job or something, im not sure. Anyway, this also rules out the garbage 'last resort' efforts where you suffer through a WITCH or revature since those force relocation.

Anyway, I'm not giving up yet, but life and all it's stressors lately and some disappointing failures in the few chances ive gotten just have me pondering what ifs and whys. Im still throwing applications at every place that seems evewn remotely entry level even if I dont actually know half the technologies they list, so maybe Ill eventually land something.

This was really long winded but I kind of just need to sound off and maybe read some advice from people that made or, or maybe some solace from seeing other people struggle too."

I looked up what most teachers make in my area it's 38,000 a year. 

I've looked at several posts that have indicated that employers are now no longer looking at whether you have a bachelor's degree or not but if you have the willingness to learn.

1,2023-01-10,I need to work for 1 year to receive “promotion” to a job that I currently perform. Should I stop doing it?,u/PresentHuckleberry74,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/108uxuc/i_need_to_work_for_1_year_to_receive_promotion_to/,careerguidance,"I hope this makes sense. 

I applied to job title A. I was offered job title B at a wage significantly lower than expected.  I was able to negotiate a little higher and accepted the position because I was fresh out of grad school, this would be my first time working in this field, I really liked the vibe of the company, and I wanted the experience.

Fast forward to my 6 month mark. I look at my personal career growth chart and find out that the job I’m titled at is 2 positions below the correct position that fits my job duties.  Essentially, I perform both jobs A and B that are indisputably described in job C’s description. I should be making literally twice what I currently am.

In hindsight, on paper I was offered and signed accepting the title of job A not my current title. Additionally, I feel there was a bait and switch by the HR person who hired me at the time. I think this was done purposely to get more work for less money.

I printed up all these job descriptions and brought them to my supervisor and expressed these concerns. They told me, I was right and that they would speak with HR about it. I later spoke with HR separately and they told me they were working on it but it definitely wouldn’t happen until the new year because, budget.

So here we are in the new year and I’ve brought it back up. The answer now is that they’ve put it in the budget but they are waiting until I reach my one year mark (May) to give me the promotion since this is my first time working in the field. I am extremely annoyed by this because have a Master’s degree and have been performing position C at an exceptional level, as indicated in my 6 month review.

Now I’m feeling very conflicted. I am tempted and have been advised by friends and family to stop performing the duties of job A until May when they are ready to fairly compensate me. But I actually really love my job and my supervisor and don’t want to put additional stress on them. Because if I stop doing this job duty they will have to do it themselves.

But I was really banking on this promotion this month and this will be setting me back. I live at home and with my current wage can’t even qualify for a 1 bedroom. I’m also beginning to take this personally. Because I’m literally doing a job that I’m not being paid for. 

My supervisor told me they really don’t want to lose me and to come talk to them first if I make a decision to leave. Would I be wrong to send an email detailing my concerns and informing them that I will no longer perform the duties of job A until my promotion?"

My concern is I live in a tiny studio apartment, so basically all my room is on display when doing a video chat from my desk (things like my bed, kitchen area, etc). This strikes me as unprofessional looking.   
  
I know with Zoom you can blur your background, but it doesn’t work all the time and some apps might not have this feature.  
  
I’ve thought of some solutions, including a backdrop hanging from the ceiling (which might look tacky), or just cramming myself into a corner (in a way that would be uncomfortable for me, but look decent on camera). My desk is big and not many alternative furniture arrangements are feasible.  
  
Do you have any suggestions about how to look professional in video meetings while living in very tight quarters? Have you seen any creative solutions that might help?  
  
Or, do you think I’m worried about something that isn’t a real problem at all?"

I am hoping to find a career that offers remote work opportunities so that I can travel. Money is not the top priority. My partner and I don’t have financial commitments or dependents. It’s important that I find something that is relatively meaningful and stimulating. I enjoy working with people but I also work well alone. I like problem-solving and helping others. If I could make a positive impact on the world, whether it be environmental or human rights issues, that would be a bonus. My gut instinct is that I need to freelance or start my own business, but I am not closed-off to the idea of working for someone else. Ideally, my career would evolve and/or be scalable to bigger and better things.

In terms of skills I possess, it’s kind of what you’d expect from an engineer (i.e. technical skills like math, physics, problem solving, statistics, research etc.). I’ve tutored university level calculus and physics and I’ve found that to be enjoyable, but tutoring is something that maybe doesn’t scale well or offer me long-term career development (could be wrong). Probably my stand-out skill is my project management capabilities, but beyond that I am empathetic, organized, personable and have decent writing skills. I could learn coding if need-be (my partner is a programmer).

For additional context (not sure if it’s relevant), I am also a yoga teacher, I have my blackbelt in taekwondo and I teach from time to time, and I speak both French and German. I am not afraid of hard work if I see a pay-off, but I am very weary of burn-out and would like to work less than 40 hrs/week long-term (again, money is not really my motivator here). I have enough capital and credit to my name that I would have access to financing from a bank to open a small business loan or something if I really needed to. I guess my main problem is I really don’t know where to focus my search and in which direction to go. In short, my priorities are: remote work, flexibility, positive impact, and at the bottom of the list is money. Plz help!"

We want to find entry-level jobs that she is eligible for, given her qualifications and circumstances. I'm personally looking for jobs for her that offer a decent pay and are in a field that allows for career growth. Would love to hear any and all advice!

**Qualifications**: She herself is communicative, emotionally intelligent, friendly, and creative (enjoys visualizing the narrative theme of a project). In her words, her ADHD makes it very difficult to concentrate on one task for extended periods of time. She's much more partial to emotive/personally engaging projects, as corporate/commercial-type work can be tedious.  
She graduated with a *B.S. Communications degree in Media Production*. She knows how to write for media, and has created anime-style content that has generated views online.  
She is experienced with *Adobe Premiere Pro*, is open to learning more, and has edited comic dubs, simple VFX (lightsabers), video game content, and color guard show reels.  
She can use *Audacity/Pro Tools*, and has edited podcasts and music splicing work.  
She was secretary and VP of a university music ensemble, and coordinated rehearsals/performances, made executive decisions alongside members of the council, and has written both meeting notes and recorded information in spreadsheets to organize information.

**Circumstances**: She would much rather do remote work, a car isn't easily accessible. We're looking for a media production job that doesn't involve field work. We're looking for something that (ideally) wouldn't quickly become a repetitive chore, and would allow for some creativity.

**What we've found so far**: We searched for jobs tagged ""Video Editor"", ""Media Production"", and ""Human Resources"". Since she's personable, I also suggested ""Social Media Specialist"" and ""Public Relations"". The only two remote entry-level listings we found that work for her are Podcast Editor and Video Editor (Wedding Video Editor excites her but it has high prerequisites). I was hoping to find more entry-level listings or fields that seek personable creatives or audio/video editors that don't ask for such specific past experience. I'd like to ask Reddit if there is some field or job we haven't considered that may be worth looking into. Thank you so much!!!"

I am needing a little bit of perspective/advice (on what I should focus more when making my decision) and maybe a little bit of courage (if some of you have similar experiences to share). 

A bit of background, my decisions up until this point of my 4-years career has always revolved around financial considerations. For example, due to lack of money, my default mode was to get a scholarship for my tertiary education, which in my home country, scholarships come with a pre-selected field that you should study, and it's always geared to the STEM field. As such, I forgo-ed the field I'm actually interested in exploring, which is to be a Japanese interpreter, which does not have an education market in my home country and would require overseas study of which there are no scholarships to fund. 

My employment in the business strategy department is part of the employment bond that comes with the contract that I signed with the company in return for their scholarship, and after I graduated, they were only left with corporate positions. It was so far-left field from the STEM subject that I was sent overseas to study, however I have to fight tooth-and-nail to secure this position from other candidates, because not being employed by them would mean a breach of contract and as such, I would have to pay back the amount that they have spent on my education, of which, again, I have no money for. 

For the past 3 years, it's been a challenge to be put in a position where I have to re-learn a lot of things and keep up, and while it is not the best, I have managed to learn to cope. The surroundings of the company are not the best, but good enough at that time, that it doesn't add on to my mental health problems while they are more inclined towards learning how to cope on where I am and what I have to re-learn for the sake of money. The past year however, there was a change with management, and it has bred such a toxic environment that it completely blew all the progress that I made with my mental health journey, that it felt all of my hard work is falling back and now I have to deal with the rapid loss of motivation because this is not where I want to be, while also dealing with navigating the currently toxic environment. It's gotten to a point where I am so anxious to come to the office that I lose sleep and my work suffers.

I am in my final year of my employment bond, of which I am no longer bound by the scholarship contract, and by the end of this year, I can leave this company debt-free. I have considered it at the start of my employment, but that consideration now is only made stronger due to the environment I am in. However, my dilemma is this. The money is good. It's given me enough, that with some careful planning, I was able to afford my own apartment unit, which in the current economic downturn, I have heard how difficult it is for my peers in other places to do.  

And I guess, where I'm coming from is that I love languages, really I do, but if I go back and try to pursue my passion, the fact that I will be going into debt, in this economy, when I have gone through hell and high water to avoid it back in high school; I guess just leaves me with a bitter feeling towards myself like, why do I do all this then? If I could summarize, staying means choosing stability over sanity, however, I'm a bit scared and I guess apprehensive that my sanity won't crumble if I lose that stability when I leave.

Maybe I'm a snowflake, I don't know. But I really would appreciate any advice on what I should do next, what I should think of more to weigh my options, what I could do next or maybe some perspective if I'm not seeing things properly. If anything, it feels nice to just let all the bitterness I feel in this one year go through this writing. Thanks for reading and do share should you have similar experiences."

Hello,

I am currently based in Cincinnati and have been interviewing for a job in Baltimore/DC. We have discussed moving expenses and salary range in the previous interview. I have one more interview lined up for tomorrow and I have a feeling that this topic will come up.

So, a few questions:

1. How do I phrase things to maximize the upfront payment (sign on bonus and moving) without looking like I am doing a cash grab?
2. How do I go about asking/discussing lodging accommodations for 45-90 days? Is that a reasonable ask?
3. How much is a reasonable sign on bonus for $100k/base, avg. 10-15% year end bonus. I was thinking $5k. How reasonable/how to ask for it up front, from day 1. Is that normal?
4. How much is reasonable moving expenses? I was thinking a moving truck would be about 2-2.5k. Is it normal to get that before one starts?

I got screwed out of a nice sign on bonus by a previous company and want to be protected. I am low on cash and credit (thanks divorce) and would like to be able to use this opportunity to prop myself up and cover any costs that might come from this move. This would be a great step up in my career and I am looking forward to the work and moving."

Hi, I finished my training period last year at my company and was allocated a new team. I've been working with them for about 5 months now.

One senior member of the team who i am supposed to assist in her projects is giving me criticism almost every day. She is supposed to train me to be able to do tasks myself and i am. We have a meeting in the morning with other members to discuss doubts in our work and if i ask her for advice on a few tasks (stuff she's done before) she scolds me. Today she told me i am not proactive enough and that i don't deep dive into tasks. She said this feedback will reflect in my appraisal and compensation too.

But she is not my boss. We share the same boss but she is one level senior to me. I don't know if the feedback she shared are her analysis or she is echoing what my boss said. How do I handle this? My boss doesn't handle day to day work and expects her to get work done by us.

I feel like i get reprimanded for asking valid questions to her. it's just everything here is so disorganized, people shift blames all the time, no one knows how to do basic tasks or perhaps don't care enough to do it. They expect new hires to figure everything out and quickly find solutions through this mess. When they get stuck they get scolded. 

I feel very demotivated to solve problems this way especially when she says i am not proactive :(

The job market is really bad here and i have loans to pay so i am holding on. Today she scolded me again and i had to hide in the bathroom to cry. What should i do?"

So I'm looking to move back to the US in the next couple of years (am a US citizen). I'm starting to look at what companies I'd like to apply to. I have a BSE in EE and a Masters in electronics for embedded and will have 5/6 years of experience in embedded software in aero. I'm not married to the idea of working in aero, so open to most industries.

My number one requirement is a good work culture. A company that is good to it's employees (I'm a woman and am so over sexist work places). Another must have is partially or fully remote. I would also like more than standard vacation and 4 day weeks or every other Friday off.
This may seem like a lot, but I won't be in a rush when job searching, so I don't mind being picky.

I was seeing a lot of jobs at GE Aerospace which have great salaries and are fully remote. Does anyone have experience there?

I am also interested in smallest and mid-size companies as well!

Married with a new baby. I’ve got a bachelors degree in psychology and have recently completed my MBA from Wilfrid Laurier University. I’ve been working with one of the big 5 banks in an advisor and business account manager roles for the past 2 years. Prior to that I have been a B2C/B2B sales rep for 6 years.

I’m having trouble finding meaning in my work. I was the person that was always trying to better themselves to get a better jobs (e.g. volunteer work and continuing education). I’ve completely lost all that motivation. Not 100% sure why but I’m having trouble being passionate about my work. I feel like I’m going to work just to pay my bills and don’t enjoy what I do.

Does anyone have any advice on changing my career paths or advice on getting roles in a new field without having that exact work experience?  Does anyone have a job they find interesting?The other thing I worry about is taking a pay cut as I’ve done this before when I switched to banking and my wife is on maternity leave. Currently I make roughly $70k.

Thanks in advance."

1,2023-01-11,Should I stay or should I go? Need to make a decision tomorrow morning. Help!,u/testturkey,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1090kgf/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go_need_to_make_a/,careerguidance,"Tomorrow morning I’m going to have a conversation with my boss that will have a massive impact on my future. I’m partially verbalising what I’m thinking so I can be confident about my decision but would really appreciate people’s insights if at all possible.

For context I’m a 47yo change management practitioner that has worked at the same mining company for the last 25 years. I have been working on some large-scale technology projects over the last 9 years and completed my professional accreditation in change management during this time. Prior to that I was working in property services in a number of customers facing positions. My managers have always rated me at the top end during performance reviews and having been at the company for the duration I have, I have built some excellent working relationships which significantly help me with change management activity.

Despite being successful in the organisation, I have not felt motivated or enthusiastic about it for some time. I felt like I fell into the role having been identified by an amazing leader some years ago who gave me an opportunity. I felt compelled to stick it out largely because of the fact they had given me a chance, and that I worked with some amazing team members. With the organisation shrinking, many of those amazing team members have left and I have felt more and more like its not the place for me.

The project I am currently working on is almost complete, and in a couple months I will go into a pool of resources within the organisation to be allocated to various small to mid-size projects (given organisational constraints there are no new large-scale projects on the horizon for some time). The team I would be working with seem excited for me to join them and while the team’s manager is accommodating most people don’t rate them highly professionally for a number of valid reasons.

The main issue is that I am currently the sole income earner and the organisation pays above market rates, so it really feels like a gilded cage. If I leave the organisation, having explored the current market, it will take me 3-5 years for a comparable role to get the same level of income. The other aspect is I feel really tired, and the thought of a similar or higher role is extremely daunting. There are times I feel like I could be happy if I packed it all in and got a job in a hardware store for example.

I have had an interest in psychology for some time, doing a few online courses over the last few years. I feel like they are quite complimentary to my change management role and I am excited by learning about what makes people tick. I spend a lot of my time coaching and assisting others through change and am considering taking a course in counselling. I feel like, with appropriate training and guidance, I could help others needing support and get work as a counsellor.

So where am I going with all this (and thanks so much if you have read my brain dump this far, I really appreciate it) tomorrow in my initial performance review meeting I am going to let me current boss know that I am going to take the next 6 months to focus on myself and undertaking study. There are two potential options, the “Safe for me, but unlikely to be supported by the business” option of me requesting 6 months leave to undertake this. The other option, the “Get rid of the safety net and take a leap of faith” option is to just give my notice and resign.

I have 4 months leave that would be paid out to me if I left, or if (unlikely) approved I could take it at half time and if I tighten the household budget with savings I could make that stretch for about 9 months before needing to find work.

I feel like, even if they approved my extended leave, that the safety net of the gilded cage could draw me back in and if it did I would end up feeling the same again in 12 months. The other option of just resigning and jump into study is a lot of risker but feels more exciting (in a teenager driving way past the speed limit type exciting – stupid but still thrilling).

I’ve talked to family and friends and half have said to follow my heart (leave and study) the other half follow my head (either ‘stick it out for another 15 years’ or ‘see if they grant a leave request and you can always go back if it gets too hard’).

I would really appreciate anyone’s thoughts or insights, or if anyone else has been in a similar position. Thanks very much for getting to the end too! 😊"

This results in missing out on weekend plans and having random Lieu days in the week. As a result I find it hard to have consistency in my life as my work life isn’t. 

Additionally, my commute to work is 1 hour each way. Most days I get the train but with the strikes I have been having to drive. My home life is starting to feel like a hotel because of this. I miss the structure my old role had with working from home. I am currently allowed to work from home for one day a week. But, I would benefit working from home 3 days a week and going into the office for 1-2 days a week. Roles that can offer this would be based in London and would make my commute 2 hours each way.

Hi! This is my boyfriend’s situation, I’m just want to figure out how to end this.

So he is working in hi-tech as Support Engineer for a year and a half approximately. Studied as software engineer but didn’t finish his degree.
He was promised help to move into another department by his ex-manager. And got an offer from developer’s department. This is when a new manager appeared. Then after huge laid-offs that department was dismissed. 
He got another offer to move to Front-end department but declined because he was very salty about developer role cancellation (didn’t know about laid-off).
Moving forward he got another offer from Frontend department and also an offer to move to tier 2 of his current role (there no tier 2, my bf is basically created this tier by accepting this promotion), Frontend could figure out how to get him so they advised him to get that tier 2 promotion for now.
Recently he got offer from another kind of developers department, idk. And his manager refused to let him go there. The manager told him that he will be here one more year. (The guy from developer department is lower in hierarchy than my bff’s manager.)

Even though he was promised a promotion a half year ago, now this Tier 2 is counts as this promotion I guess. His manager let him has “side project” with those developers.

He does the job of Tier 1 and 2 at the same time, now this side project is added, but he can work on it only 2 hours a week. So he works overtime on this so called side-project.
Also he heard that his managers were speaking about future tier-3, so there won’t be any department change.
There is huge laid offs, 50% was let go.
He wanted to look for a new job but needs more experience to get a job in this developer thingy position. He doesn’t want to get another Support role.
So he thought to work on this side project till it will be something. But there an exponentially growing pressure from Tier 1/2, shit is burning, he is one-man-team kinda, the only one that makes it work.

I’m very far from corporate world, and hope it doesn’t sound confusing.

Graduated from Rutgers in 2016 with a BA in biological sciences with the pre med classes

Did a lot of internships, volunteered at hospitals and did research at medical universities in NJ.

Went to podiatry school afterward for 1 year in NYC passed the first semester and failed the second.

Then started studying for the lsat did not do well, then did a coding bootcamp learned CSS, HTML, Javascript, got a job as an IT auditor at HSBC in a contract role for 12 months. Due to the economy was let go after 3 months and this was not performance related as my supervisor wrote me a great reference letter. Got let go second week of oct 2022 and since then been trying to figure out what to do. I have some money saved about 30k in student loan debt from medical school and non from undergrad. I worked and still have my substitute teaching certs that can provide some income although I hate doing it. 

Right now I am going back to study for the lsat and have signed up to take it in April. I don't want any regrets and feel like I could combine my bio major with law school and do patent law. 

In case that does not work out, I am also applying to the Rutgers B School MBA in professional accounting program which is for students who have no background in accounting. It is 14 months and has an internship in the winter break period. It will also set me up to take the CPA exam with the 24 accounting and 24 gen business credits. The program is 14months, 60k tuition and is 20 min from my house.  In this scenario, if I get a good lsat score I could apply for next year and in the meantime do this program and down the line be in a great position to work as a tax attorney. 

I just wanted to know what you think of this plan and is it a good one going forward for someone in my position. I enjoy business, tech, and law but I also understand the value that comes with having a license to do something for example in accounting and law you can get the cpa or bar license. 

I was also looking at going back to school to get a bachelors in computer science from Rutgers and I do get instate tuition discount for that as well as the masters program. But that would be a bachelors degree and from the admin person I spoke with it would take 2-3 years to complete. I do not know if they have any programs for people in my situtation with a non tech degree to do possibly a masters. I am really confused on what I should do with my life and so writing this post is kind of cathartic in a sense. I am just not sure if I am making the right decision going into law and accounting. I spoke to my sister who does data science at a big 4 accounting firm. She did IT then masters in DS. She is so busy and so doesn't have time to talk sometimes. But she did say to try for the lsat and if it doesn't work out I could always do tech through these online masters programs or other shorter online programs. She says not to go back for a bachelors as it would not be a good look and to get a masters.   My one issue with this is the loans being higher for a masters than an undergrad but the time would be saved. I am going to turn 30 in June so my family is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on me to figure out my career and have stability so this has been so stressful that I can't sleep at night due to the worrying and my hair is thinning."

Currently, I’m the most Junior of the group in pay and title which has been fine as my responsibilities have been lower. The other three hold the same titles, one above me. I applied for the two higher positions, but was passed over because they had more SQL experience (I have 8 years, they have about 20). The job also requires knowledge of putting info into Microsoft pivot cubes, a large, complex process itself. I have 5 years with that while they had zero. I was told with original member there the cube part was covered and they wanted the sql skills more which is why they passed on me twice. I was very annoyed, but overall fine given that my responsibilities were light and my work/life balance was good. 

Fast forward to today… The founding member is leaving. Over the past month, more and more of his responsibilities are being passed down to me because of my department and cube knowledge. I’ve taken lead on all his projects and new ones, manage project timelines and workloads, fix all cube issues now, and do all monthly reports while still cranking out sql code as well. The other two have been very open, with me at least, about not wanting to step up to take his position or do any of his work as they want to focus mainly on coding SQL.

How to I approach my boss about recognizing all the extra work I’m doing as the most junior on the team? And, What if they decide to hire another person, who’s paid more, and expect me train them up?

I don’t want to be stuck in the position of carrying multiple parts of the department while others who are making 35% more and do a 1/3 off the job."

It is a super broad program and I was very unsure of my direction. I am having no issue at all doing well in school I just have no direction as soon as it's complete. I have however thought an excruciating amount of time about what I want to do and I have concluded a few things.

**I have always enjoyed working semi-on my own schedule.**

I am happy to have long hours or lots to complete I have just never enjoyed being forced to be somewhere or do something at a certain time.

**I am willing to do anything as long as it is good value for my time.** 

Working on an oil rig or hard laborious trades work is never off the table, it just has to feel productive enough. Working a simple job that requires a few hours of very skilled or very finite work that pays well or is enjoyable is also very intriguing

**A massive amount of money is not mandatory**                           

Obviously, money is important and the more the merrier I am just willing to sacrifice a lot in pursuit of a somewhat enjoyable work life.

**Conclusion:**

I am not trying to come across as arrogant to the workforce or anything similar. I understand this is very vauge and I am not expecting job ideas (but they dont hurt) I am just hoping for ideas and suggestions. I feel like I have a rough understanding of the basics and I am just looking for some potential help/advice. I am very stressed about the future but am very willing and eager to do what I need to succeed and enjoy life best.

Thank you for any help."

I did support and I tried not to interfere a lot with their tasks and do just what that team's manager want. 

I ended up doing most of the initial process structural for most of the mini projects and do all the work that they threw at me ( the unsexy, the one that doesn't make anyone shine). 

They loop me out and minimize what I do but I ignored it. Anytime a client says that I did great job, the next day they either take the work or cancel and stop what I am working on. 

As the new year started, I thought that all of this is gonna end but no, now they are starting a new process of of looping me out by sending work docs in chats and when they speak to senior management they loop me out. 

Since my geo location is the same as senior management and those people are in different countries, they started to act more isolating towards me ever since they heard that we will be back in office and that there are new roles opening that might be given to me. 

Anyway, senior management told me last year that they were happy with my work despite knowing what those are doing to me. They also told me that as soon as the project ends ( it ended) that I shall work on different things, I was also promised a different client and different team ( but still waiting in client signature for the whole thing). 

My question is what should I do to those who are looping me out? Especially since I can see their petty moves to get ahead of me. 

I really don't want to go to their pathetic level because all of their insecurities are been shown with each action they do. At the same time, it seems I might be working more with them and I want to put an end to that.

Does telling senior management helps? Because this project manager is enabling them as well and she is just as insecure as they are."

I'm currently graduating from life science and wanted get an art degree. I was thinking about ocad's drawing and painting or Sheridan's illustrations or animation since I live in Canada.

But recently I learn about Al art, and I'm kind of worried should I even go to school for another 4 years and just being replaced by Al.

I know art degrees are hard to get jobs and I suck at networking. I didn't expect to earn big money, just enough to maintain a life. But the Al art is making me freak out of getting totally replaced. I guess I'm afraid because my skill is not top level, and I already lost 4 years
in life sci which can't lead to a job, and I don't have that much money. I do like science though, don't get me wrong, but | guess research or professional school are
too hard for me. My GPA is 3.9, but my extracurricular sucks. I tried to find a internships or research - failed. tried to network with the professors - failed.

For art, I also like them, I used to draw in high school and applied for Sheridan's animation. Unfortunately I failed and was kinda pushing myself to do a uni, that's how I get into life sci. Now I'm back at the starting point, my art
teacher told me it's better to go to the US for art. However, I don't think I have the money to go to US.

Should I still go for art as a job or switch paths. I don't have relatives or friends that is in the art fields (beside my teacher, who is old), so not sure what is really like for them. Advices plz!

Edit:  Thank you all for these advices, it’s really heart warming. honestly I gonna cry for all these response, recently I’m so emotional at night and cried a lot. I really feel I’m worthless and sad for my parents and myself.

I was .... almost at that point. 

So after completing 2 years I took a mental health leave of 1 year and it was the best and most nerve wracking decision, mostly because I came to the realisation that I just don't like healthcare as a profession on a whole. While I have a heavy respect for it, it wasn't and isn't worth crying after all of my classes because I hated my future.

Literally on my birthday, I saw an advertisement for a nearby University for a 3.5 year programme for a graphic design degree and it actually intrigued me and I can see myself doing it. 

But my mother is heavily discouraging me from doing it while also saying her opinion doesn't matter as much as mine. She says the market is saturated and I won't find a Job and that I will struggle in the future and that she was proud of me getting into med but she won't know what to think if I transfer. 

The thing is, I don't KNOW any graphic designers that I can ask for their guidance and advice. Maybe my mom is right and this is a huge mistake

I love the organization's mission, but hate the current job environment I'm in, so this seems like a good choice. The only problem is I'm not sure how this would fly.

Our affiliate and the national office aren't super close, they meet maybe a couple times a year. However, I'm worried about National telling my boss that I'm looking for a job. I may not be that important, but also not totally sure. Am I overthinking things?

I've looked around on Linkedin and it seems like many affiliate employees have found jobs with National, but none who have worked as little as I have for their affiliate so far. Should I go for it anyway? TIA!

Hi all. I am a masters student currently doing my thesis as I am reaching the end of the thesis I am reconsidering my initial plan to do a PhD as a next step. I am coming from a middle class family in a developing country. I want to choose a career that offers me better financial stability. Also I think PhD might not suit my lifestyle as it requires a lot of commitment and sacrifice.

Masters to PhD always seemed like a natural progression for me and I have wanted to stay in academia. I like science and I love doing science. But I feel like my mental health is plunging because of long working hours and having to work even on the weekends (even on New year's :(, this is because of the model system and the nature of the research question). I am currently applying for PhD but I would like to know my options if not PhD. I am also looking forward for roles abroad preferably Europe.

For more context I am a masters student in biology, I have had experience working with mouse model systems and perform confocal imaging on a day to day basis. I have done basic molecular experiments as per my lab course, but would need some more practice. I also have managed international collaborations and have organised a bunch of events in my uni.

I am considering jobs as Research assistant for now. I have heard of other fields such as project management and science communication. But I do not know how or where to start. What are the other roles that I can look into? Have you gone through a similar experience and what did you do? And how and where do i start looking for opportunities?

Non-academic: Nothing! 

I have never had a job. I'm currently working as a graduate student, and I want to explore careers and hopefully experience a job outside of academia before I settle into it as I'm very unsure about it. I have some programming experience but haven't worked on anything in particular that could be deemed as worthy to be on a portfolio. I have some teaching experience, but don't want to become a teacher (as in, a high school or below teacher. I don't mind teaching at university). I have some experience with design (internship) and photography, which is completely unrelated to my major. My work so far in academia hasn't prepared me for the real-world but that is hardly surprising. I'm obviously experienced in research, writing to some degree and presenting. 

I feel like I really don't know what to do mostly because my education so far has been mostly abstract ideas and not application-based, so I haven't had the chance to actually be in the industry. I'm not a good enough programmer to be getting Software jobs. I'm not good at management stuff, so I don't want to go into consultation. I'm not really well-versed in the world of business either, so not sure about Business analysis either. Data Science is way too broad, and I feel that people with specific field knowledge have a better chance of getting data science jobs than someone like me with more technical knowledge. Like I can explain every single ML algorithm there is with the math behind it and all, and I can probably implement it IRL on general data, but that's about it. But if the data is in the medical field, I have no idea whether my skills are useful or not. Does that make sense? 

Not to mention, I'm not a PhD student and have no prior industry work experience. I feel that nobody will hire me as I'm a huge risk. (no experience is a risk, but a no experience fresh college grad is less expensive than a PhD.)

I started out at management consulting after graduating from the top college in my country. I was a founding team member of a startup that grew to over 50 million USD at the time of my exit. 

I setup couple of my own companies after that and those however, are not doing as well.
However I have now taken up a full time job leading sales for an education startup. I am heading revenue for them.

However, even after applying to maybe a 100 jobs in the UK I still cannot get any interviews.

I have applied to early stage and growth stage startups as well as management consultancies. What am I doing wrong?

My experience is quite generalist. But I feel I have very high quality experience.

I feel the mistake I am making is that my resume is only 1 page where it is impossible to detail all the different things I have done.

Any suggestions?"
2,2023-01-11,Should I pursue a Bachelors in Business Administration or Computer Information Systems/Technology if I don't know precisely what I want to do?,u/Th0mathy,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1098tcd/should_i_pursue_a_bachelors_in_business/,careerguidance,"Hi, I'm graduating from community college in May, and am looking to attend a university afterwards. I'm quite confused on what I want to do, but I know that Business and Tech are my primary interests, and I'm hoping I can find a job to combine the two. The few jobs I'm looking into are Business Analyst, Financial Analyst, and Systems Analyst. I'm also looking into SysAdmin and being a Scrum Master.

The primary reason I don't want a job in just tech is due to coding. I'm willing to learn code, but I'm quite awful at it, and would much prefer a job that isn't centered around it. That's where many of these analyst jobs come in to play.

However, since I'm not sure of what I want to do, I'm wondering if Business Administration or CIS/CIT would be a better bet for me. BA seems to be more general, which may be less useful, but seems to cover a wider variety of jobs if I choose to specialize in a certain role down the road. What are your thoughts on this? Any help would be appreciated."
1,2023-01-11,Favoritism at Work?,u/asapclueless,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1098tcy/favoritism_at_work/,careerguidance,"Hello all, this might be long so bear with me. I am currently working as a medical assistant at an urgent care facility. I have been working there for almost a year and a half. The entirety of this time I have been dealing with what I would consider favoritism by my boss. There is a fellow medical assistant coworker who is full time but is allowed to continually miss work due to her children, being sick, allowed to not show up to work on an assigned holiday. When she does show up for work, she’s late, sits in the back and hides so she doesn’t have to do work, and she has even sat in my boss’s office, with my boss, while I’m on the floor pretty much doing all of the work. My coworker also makes the schedule, giving herself all of the best shifts and making the rest of us work sometimes 7 days or more in a row even though we only work 35 hours a week. All of this has been brought up to my supervisor by several other coworkers and nothing is ever done about it. This would also not be allowed for anyone else, hence the favoritism. I am trying to hold out as long as I can, as I am waiting to hear back from a graduate degree program I applied to, however this job is starting to affect my mental and physical health. I am unsure how to proceed because I could talk to my supervisor about what I am experiencing but she is the one who allows this to happen and, to my knowledge, is also friends with this particular coworker’s mother. I am about at my wits end and some advice would be greatly appreciated."

1,2023-01-11,Shall I switch back to the older job or stay?,u/eebs123,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10990dv/shall_i_switch_back_to_the_older_job_or_stay/,careerguidance,"

I recently switched from a county job to a city job. My only issue with a county job was the pay which was 45k after 3 years of working there. My workload was a lot but boss was very very nice and flexible. I spent two years WFH so it was okay while it lasted. This job is civil service. 
I switched to a city job, specifically in NYC which pays 70k but they are pretty inflexible (coming from a person who has a 4 year old) and the commute is long. This is not even the bigger issue, the issue is the environment of the office. I do sense some racism and also everyone is overly protective of their work; even though they hardly do it. I am supposed to be a back up for one of the positions but learn everything else too incase they need me. One of the person I work with hardly shows up for work, maybe 3-4 times a week as she has a lot of time saved up but I have been told she will eventually be a supervisor. Most of the staff is older then me to the extent that 3 of them are close to retirement and they’re still stuck on their old ways of doing things. No one really talks to me unless they need something done. I am very professional but I am told repeatedly that I am shy, whereas I am not but I don’t believe in getting loud to get my point across. 
Let me come to my major dilemma, since the old job is civil service, I did have the option to go back since the exam results recently came back. I told them I am coming back but then 2 weeks before joining them I said no and asked my ex boss for a raise or promotion since the work I did their was basically supervisor level. He tried his best, and he was able to get that promotion for the people who were there already but for me, the administrators said no since I left. I might still be able to go back but it’ll be to my older position and older pay. 
My son is due to start school soon and the older job is very close to my house and his school, I am unable to afford a nanny or daycare. My mom takes care of him currently and my husband too but lately, circumstances with my husband seem to have changed and he’s least interested in helping me anymore. I pay my own bills and all the bills of the house, he’s only responsible for rent, but I see his ways are changing and I don’t know where the relationship is headed. 
I need advice as to if I should go back to the older job or stay here. I am planning to ask my ex boss if eventually a promotional position ever opens up will he be able to offer it to me since I’ll be there already and not just ‘walking into the door’. As for the position here, I really wanna ask them if they can allow me to work from home 2-3 days but I think it’s highly unlikely they would ever allow me.
I am very confused. I really only have my husband to talk to about this but whatever he says is usually just based on what he wants and not what’s good for me. 
Thank you so much. 
PS: my post is very specific so if you do know who I am please don’t go IRL."

I realized that I was still drawn to this field of work because someone mentioned that they simply just taught English in a country that has been quite developed. So I know I want to travel and immerse myself in cultures all across the world. However, I would love to study and document these cultures for educational purposes. By educational purposes, I mean I would like to record aspects of whatever culture I would be immersed in for the purpose of the knowledge gained to be used in textbooks/books/magazines/etc.

So something in the field of journalism and anthropology, I presume. Anyways, thank you, as always."

Pays $24.5/hour = $51k (because it is hourly, you get paid for any overtime that might happen, although overtime is discouraged) super lax. You can flex your schedule very easily, leave early/come in late as long as you meet 40 hours (within reason). You can take any time off (doesn't need to be approved, as long as there isn't a meeting you must be at that day you can go), very very easy work days: can spend a good chunk of the day being unproductive. Good benefits, 10 days PT + 5 sick days immediately available after 90 days. Comfortable and easy peasy. 

Job 2. Pays $65k, salaried, no OT. Not lax. Strict 8-430 hours. Have to get all time off approved. Higher work load, same benefits as the other job. 18 PTO days + paid week off between Christmas and New Years off = 23 PTO days. PTO accrues by 12 hours/month, so it is not readily available. New, so not comfortable quite yet, most likely will not be easy peasy. More likely to have room for growth than Job 1.

What helped more than anything? Making these two lists:

* On the first, list out all of the specific tasks, responsibilities, and work stuff you've ever been paid to do. And I do mean ever. Babysitting, house cleaning that one summer, selling girl scout cookies, warehouse work you hated, that time you painted houses for 2 months in 2014 near the beach...all of it. Keep job titles, but try to break down every ""job"" into a cluster of tasks, so you're just looking at a list of activities. Once you've got a list of all the things you've done, go through them, deciding which you really liked, and which you'd pay money to never have to do again in your life. The goal here is to remind yourself of jobs you forgot you did &amp; clarify which stuff you really, really liked doing. You might surprise yourself with what you come up with.

* Once this is done, make a second list starting with the stuff you like, and all of the things you'd wanted to try professionally. This list doesn't need to be ""reasonable,"" if you want to be an astronaut, put it down. Try to do the same thing with job titles, keeping, but breaking them into tasks like ""spend 5 hrs a day doing coding &amp; fucking around on FB."" Make this list without sanity checks. It doesn't matter if you have no shot at getting into Avengers 5, the goal here is to put ""want to paper."" Putting ""want to paper"" is writing things you want to do, affirmatively writing things you like doing vs. the stuff you only kind of dislike from the first list. The hope is to avoid bias of the 1st infecting the 2nd, and to focus on positivity, not ""least negative."" Once this second list is completed, the real fun begins!

* You can probably search for every single job title on your list and the overwhelming majority of the work tasks on List 2, somewhere on Glassdoor, Indeed, or LinkedIn. After running a few dozen of these searches, what you find will bridge your understanding of what you think a job would require vs. what the job actually demands. Getting job descriptions from LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed, Monster, and others will flesh out what is required.

This turns the nebulous ""what do I do?!?"" mass of questions into ""for these jobs I'm thinking about, resumes need to look like this, and the progression is like that"" and all of the related processes/what you need to do, falls into place. This turns the overwhelming thought of starting over into discrete steps you can take, and plans you can stick to!

You got this. Put on music you like, make tea/coffee, and get to list making!"

However let's be realistic.  A lot of that I feel is University propaganda that's pushed heavily to the youth in order to make it seem as positive as possible, to the point you're considered less of a person in the job world if you don't have one. I don't believe that, and I hate the mild gatekeeping system related to University Education in the USA.  So I don't want to do it if it doesn't directly benefit me, because I just don't agree and don't want to support a system that isn't more welcoming of higher education. But I'm only given one life to live and I want to make the most of it, so maybe my hands are more tied than I might want to admit. 

Back to details... Currently I'm employed as a Cable Technician Foreman, BICSI TECH certified, making $32/hr in a relatively inexpensive area to live. Some college (Mech E.), but no degree. I dropped out due to severe depression and suicidal tendencies in my very early 20s.

I own land and apartments that net me another 50k per year or so revenue, a bit over 30k profit not including appreciation in the market. I'm not going to count unrealized gains as income.

I'm very comfortable with life at the moment, but I feel incomplete and like I'm not living to my potential. I love to tinker and work on technical stuff.  I've learned a bit of Linux, taken HTML, CSS, JavaScript classes up to a point where I built a calculator myself in a web browser, great solder work, multiple keyboards built, GPUs repaired, hard tube PC water cooling, modding Guitar Hero Controllers with microcontroller for PC use, Pi Hole, etc. I'm always looking for the next project. 

I've been thinking about embracing Networking with a CCNA or going for CS degree. I get that Developers are the highest rated job satisfaction right now which is why I'm interested, but I struggled so much in Uni before; I do have a lot of reservations about trying again. 

I guess I'm just looking for some advice about what to do and what to expect. Am I stuck in my role forever if I don't change anything?  If I go Networking and get CCNA, will I forever be held back from promotions due to not having an official degree?  Is all the expense and effort even worth going back to college now?

I'm not even sure of the best questions to ask you all.  But I know I need some help.  Thank you so much for taking your time to read my post."

Been here for about a year and not done a single deal (vs the estimate of 10-15/year when I was hired). 

 we did layoffs recently (including losing a junior on my team) so my lack of work makes me concerned about my future. As a result ive started looking for work outside my specific focus (M&amp;A) to stay busy and add value to other parts of the org. 

I get the sense my manager does this because he is also slow and wants to add value for himself to our internal clients and his manager. So I don’t fault him. So how do I talk to him or others about this? 

I’m also applying for new jobs since I doubt this will let up."

I am a PhD student and currently going through mental health crisis due to personal reasons (loss of my father, both paternal grandparents, divorce, medical problems in family) and school related (my first advisor moving his lab to another state, my former advisor bullied me a lot, not support from administration or program, keep getting negative data, pressure from school, shame from changing labs twice). I had a mental break down and I am getting treated for it. But, my school is pressuring me to graduate. If I don't graduate by end of March, I will be put on leave of absence with no stipend until next semester.

So, I am trying to write my thesis by end of March, but I am afraid I won't have any income in April and I am coming from a lower middle class family living in a poor country, so I don't really have any support. It scares me so much that I cannot focus.

I guess I need two alternative plans for either case. For not getting my PhD and for getting my PhD. I wanted to switch my career to business side of biology, I specifically wanted to go into biotech venture capital. While doing a PhD I have worked on getting experience on that, but I keep getting rejected from companies, I just don't know what to do anymore.

My former advisor bullied me so much that I am scared to do bench work, what kind of a career would you recommend?

If I cannot get my PhD, I will have to wait until September to defend my thesis, what kind of a job do you think I can find (aside from gig work)?"

My company does not pay out PTO when you quit, I'm wondering if there is an ethical way to go about getting it? I need to put my 2 weeks in, could I technically put 4 weeks in and just use PTO for the last 2? Or should I just take the L?

I just can't imagine putting that request in. ""Hey, here's my 2 weeks, but actually can you make it 4 weeks so I can use my PTO?"" Seems silly. Do people do that?

I was saving my PTO for a series of trips I had planned in the next coming months, I wasn't expecting to be offered a new position elsewhere. Additionally, **my start date for the new job is 18 days from now**, so I don't really have time to take 2 weeks off and then put in my 2 weeks notice, unless I submit my notice while out of office.

I also do not really want to leave without giving notice. I really like this company and they have helped me tremendously with my career, that just seems like bad juju. I also love my coworkers, and to leave without helping them transition would be a nightmare for them.

Even if I put in a PTO request RIGHT NOW for 2 weeks, it would take quite a bit of working around as I have several patient visits (I work in healthcare) that my colleagues would not be able to conduct in my place. I would need to either reschedule a ton of people or I would have to break up the PTO into pieces.

Clarification: The handbook states that PTO will not be paid out to employees that quit, it doesn't say anything about not being able to use it once you give notice.

The new job is a 27% pay increase, to turn it down just to try to use up some PTO would not be wise. Technically, if I am terminated they must pay out my PTO. I'm not going to do something that would result in be being fired though, so there goes that. "

1,2023-01-11,Should I take a leap/pay cut to a startup?,u/Wolf_Popular,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/109c399/should_i_take_a_leappay_cut_to_a_startup/,careerguidance,"Hi all,

First, apologies if the below problem sounds like a non-problem here. It's been bugging me for a few weeks however and I need other people to talk to about it. It's one of those things where I probably know the answer, but need to hear it from other people.

I currently have a stable tech job at a big company that I have some occasional frustrations with, but where overall the work is reasonable and the pay is great (about $300k TC). I also do well and am appreciated by the team. My job appears to be stable and very unlikely to be hit by tech layoffs. I also have an infant who is about to turn 1, and my wife who's taken time off at least until September with no pay. I've been in this job for less than a year, after leaving a previous job after only being there half a year.

And yet, given all of the above, I've come across a tech startup that's doing exactly what I want to be doing, seems to have an amazing culture (from knowing people in the startup), and that is currently hiring for a role that I think It'd be amazing at and lines up perfectly with what I want to be doing. The role would pay about $200k however, and is obviously a leap into the unknown.

I tell myself it's stupid, that I should stay where I am at least 2+ years before jumping again, and if this startup is worth their salt they'll certainly be around and hiring in 2 years (and if they're not I shouldn't be going there). But I still keep thinking about putting in an application everyday. 

Should I try applying to this startup now, given all of the above? Or is a better course of action stay where I am, wait a few years, and then try to join that startup if they are still around/still a cool place? (Even though then I'd be likely a much later employee in the stack)"

The reason there are so many minor options is due to my transfer credits. I will get a math minor regardless, and any coursework into EE would get me a computer engineering minor. My previous college experience was 2 years as a Computer Science major and 2 years as a Data Science major. I had to drop out due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I also have experience with multiple student robotics organizations, have worked in both a computer science research lab and an electrical engineering research lab, and work with small robots and 3D printing as a hobby.

My target career is to program and build robots,  embedded systems, or other physical devices. I know that I can get into this with an EE degree, because I have friends who have done it. What I really need advice for is whether I can easily get work in those fields with a CS degree, or if an EE degree would be preferable. I'm not too worried about tuition costs, but I suppose switching to EE would likely delay my career by another year or two."

We work in different departments, but collaborate regularly. My issue is that I think they all suck. The best amongst them is very low-effort and their output is mediocre at best. The worst amongst them I believe is a legit narcissist. The rest are simply wildly incompetent in my opinion. One of those has a huge ego and refuses to work with me on things already built and insists on things being his way or he won't really involve himself. The last is just really incompetent and doesn't produce.

I'm a one-man department and frequently outperform all of them. I get more done and more quickly. This has definitely been noticed by upper management, and they have found subtle ways of communicating it to me, without throwing them under the bus or alienating them.

To be honest, if I were in charge I'd fire all of them. They have worked together for almost two years and have virtually nothing to show for it. No real output, no delivered products.

The situation is a bit tricky obviously. Naturally I'd be inclined to be honest in the hopes they finally get rid of them and replace them with people worth half a shit. But my comments will be made available to them, they will be able to see what I said about them.

What should I do? Lie and play nice and let management just deal with what is ultimately their problem to solve? Maybe find something nice to say, even if it means stretching the truth?"

I went straight into higher education after high school (at 20, because of a special language programme I was enrolled in, so high school was a year longer than for most), then 4 years of university due to a year abroad.

I didn't have to work throughout all of it because my parents wanted me to focus on my studies and other things that interested me. It is something that I'm truly thankful for because it gave me a more or less carefree childhood, but now I feel like I'm behind everyone. I did a couple of internships with NGOs like Amnesty and WWF. Since I study International Relations and I was really interested in this field it made sense at the time to gain experience there. But now I don't want to do anything with this career path (just as a side note). I also did a part-time administrative student job during my last year.

It might be due to my starting and finishing university later than most, but I feel like a huge failure and all I can think about is that if I had made different decisions about my high school and university studies I could have been working for the past 3 years.

I was supposed to start a master's in September 2022, but I had to defer it to next year due to unforeseen circumstances. I obviously didn't plan on working this year and I spent the summer just relaxing and preparing for university. So now I have been trying to get a job for the past couple of months, possibly at the worst hiring period.

I know I could have done more in terms of gaining experience during my studies, but I was already really overwhelmed by it. I moved to a different country to get my degree, so I was basically all alone. I have been suffering from depression and social anxiety since I was 18, and as it turns out I also had undiagnosed ADHD."

Very interested in the position, but during the first interview the HR dude mentioned the salary (exempt position), and I was not thrilled. They are now in the process of scheduling the 2nd interview with the department head(s) whom I would report to. 

In the meantime, following the first phone interview that I mentioned above, they emailed me all the details about benefits, PTO, and whatnot. Very nice benefits. 
And in that same email they stated in writing the amount that the HR guy had mentioned to me briefly over the phone. To which I didn’t respond, because we were talking about other very basic topics, like what the role entails, my background, etc. 
Now I’m wondering - should I have said something right there and then? Personally, I was of the opinion that it was a little bit too early to start “complaining” about the offered compensation, but now that they have sent a follow up email with the amount written down, I kind of regret not having said anything earlier.
How would you proceed?

The video conference with the department heads will be scheduled soon, and I’m planning on going through with it, and I am thinking that I’ll just try to negotiate afterwards, if they want to hire me. Just not sure who’s in charge of salary negotiations. The first HR guy doesn’t seem to have a very important role, even though I could be mistaken, but the way he said it was to the effect of “this is a 35-hour remote position with an annual salary of soandso…..” - to me this sounded quite definitive and like he was given instructions. And almost like there’s no negotiation possible. 
And like I said they put the number in writing in the follow-up email as well. 

I am scratching my head. Do they assume I already accepted the salary, in case they later make me an offer? I am kicking myself for not having said something right away, that was a mistake. What would you do? I really am interested. It’s exactly my field. Good org. But the money most likely won’t work out for me."

Unfortunately, I had to do this over email as both my boss and HR are on holiday, they return Monday. It's a small company I have worked in for a year. I like the work and get on really well with everyone, but it's unsustainable for me. It's unsustainable because there is a 45 minute commute both ways (30 miles each) and I get home 6 without any time to spend with my young family or even go to the gym. New job is half of that and more pay.

Anyway, that's not what this post is about, I haven't had a response from my boss yet but I just know he is going to be pissed off/unhappy/shocked. I'm actually really nervous to speak to him and I certainly do not want to burn bridges, I only wish them the best. What advice can you offer for remaining professional and finishing with class if a boss is unhappy with it?"

I applied for a promotion close to 2 months ago, and I had an interview 1 month ago.  I received an email 3 weeks after that initial interview saying that they would be moving forward with me in the hiring process, but they are still in the first steps.  Is this reasonable?  It feels like it’s been a very long time since my application and interview to still be in the “first stages”.  

Is there any way to ask what the timeline is at this point?  I don’t know what I have a right to ask as a candidate, but given that I already work for the company, I do not believe this drawn out process is typical for our hiring practices.  The job I’ve applied for is a brand new position in the same department if that makes a difference."

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to Psychedelics, I have reached my career goal (Dean) in my current field (Higher Education) at a pretty young age and now I am bored and ready to start a career in what I am actually passionate about. Psychedelics has helped me in my life tremendously and I want to spend the rest of my life helping others use it to transform their lives. I am not sure where to even begin a career or what my options are. I did do a little research and to be a psychedelic therapist, I would need to already be a healthcare professional (I have a Masters in something unrelated). I did see a company called mindbloom has opportunities as a guide/coach but they have gotten very negative reviews plus they don't pay very much. Does anyone have any tips/suggestions/recommendations on how I could have a career in psychedelics? I'm in my mid 30's and I can't imagine doing what I am doing for the rest of my life, I am just not passionate about it. I have helped many friends and family safely use psychedelics, helped guide them through their trips and helped with the integration process. I feel like I have a real gift in helping people with psychedelics and would love to work in this field.

Any info would be much appreciated! Thank you! :)"

Job 1 In Field - Jul-Nov 2020 = 4 months

Job 2 **Unrelated Field**, held concurrently with Job 1 due to crappy pay, Jan 2016 - Jun 2022 = 6+ years

\-please note the fat gap between jobs related to my field, which is already a red flag IMO-

Job 4 (new, same title as job 3) Starting end of Jan 2023. 

One year from now I want to move up, either within the company of Job 4 or elsewhere depending on the opportunities at the time. 

Is this sporadic employment going to hurt me in the long run? I'm trying to decide if I should stay with Job 3 for a tad longer, however Job 4 is more than a 25% pay increase and if I plan on having a new title within a year anyways, it makes more financial sense to go with the job that pays more in the short term. Job 3 will give me a raise once I hit 12 months, but it will definitely not match the salary of Job 4 starting now nor will it offer a higher title.

Due to travel restrictions at the time, I did this fully remotely (based in my home country), and possibly missed out on some connections and opportunities available to me if I had been able to attend in person.

I would like to gain experience in research before potentially beginning a PhD (my degrees so far have been by coursework, so I do not have a lot of research experience). Where would I start looking for universities/ research groups that would accept international applicants (with no exisiting work rights) for research roles? Are universities generally open to accepting an applicant who is not already enrolled and would require visa sponsorship, over a current student, e.g. for a research assistant role? I also don't have much research experience, so the odds seem stacked against me.

In my months of job hunting I have faced a sort of catch-22 where I am required to have work rights in order to be considered for jobs overseas, and would need to have secured a job (/offer) in order to seek work rights. How can I untangle this if I strongly prefer to work in research abroad?

Hi all,

Title kinda sums it up, was just laid off today with 4 weeks of severance pay and 5 weeks for health benefits. I have yet to receive the package but was told I'd have vested shares from my stock options transferred to CARTA (1110 shares approx) as a part of severance. The company I worked for is a startup and to be honest I don't think it will go anywhere/be successful due to various factors. I'd much rather negotiate a higher timeframe of severance pay than keep the shares I'm gonna get. Does anyone know if this a valuable proposition/can be done?

Any other tips on severance negotiation would be great as well, this is my first time being laid off and idk how the intricacies work.

Now here for a few months before I do something else and need advice on how to mend some work relationships and leave on a good note.

I've been at my company 2+ years. I hit the ground running, became an extremely driven, efficient, reliable high performing worker. Got promoted, got a raise, company is great, things are going well, etc.

At some point in early 2022 I realized this was not the place for me, work is boring/repetitive/doesn't require a lot of critical thinking, and there were huge barriers to moving around internally to do more interesting work. I basically hit breaking point around that time (let's call it burnout/mental health problems and didn't really have the ability to address it in a healthy way), and totally 180-ed from being a high performer and asset to company/project teams. I failed miserably on a couple projects which deteriorated relationships with a few coworkers, resulted in poor work quality, and already-strained people had to pick up my slack. Not really being able to cope with the work environment and not having a better plan, I took an unpaid leave of absence for 6 months to work a (paid) temp job I had prior to starting at company (working ridiculous hours and doing backbreaking work, not quite a ""break"", but good for separation from my role at the time).

I returned from LOA this fall in a much better mental place, able to rationally deal with my work-life balance and physical/mental health. However, I had my annual performance review recently, and in contrast to last year's glowing feedback, (not shockingly) this year, it was not good. A couple coworkers who really suffered in the wake of my poor performance had written really detailed and helpful constructive criticism, which I want to thank them for. I also believe I owe them an apology. I don't want to make excuses for myself, nor do I really want to be transparent about what a shitty spot I was in mentally for the first few months of the year (I don't trust corporate management)…but I also don't want to seem like a POS that totally abandoned them for no apparent reason or ""lack of motivation"" after they grew to trust and rely on me. Also, I am transitioning managers because of company restructuring, and my new manager was there, hearing this all, which was quite awkward and embarrassing. At the end of the day, this job is not for me and I am leaving in a couple months anyways to pursue a different opportunity, but want to at least give it my best (I'm very grateful for the opportunity to take a LOA) and learn as much as I can when I am still here knowing there's a light at the end of the tunnel, and leave on good terms in case I need them for a reference down the line.

So…

* How can I (or should I) apologize to coworkers I let down months ago? The feedback they gave (nearly a year after things went south) was so detailed, I can tell this affected them a lot, and I feel very guilty about it.
   * Important note: The feedback from my coworkers was passed to me from my manager, so they don't know that I have read it. I found it very helpful, and am using it with only positive intentions to get better as a person and worker, but still think it might be awkward to bring it up with them even in a gracious way considering the things they wrote.
* How can I start on the right foot with my new manager after he heard basically what a horrible job I did for four months?
* Paraphrasing a comment from my manager in the review: ""we all have to do work we aren't interested in doing so suck it up"". I’m coming from 10+ years working physically difficult, very uninteresting, and often high-risk jobs to make ends meet and never having a performance issue - I find comments like this very belittling. I've tried to clarify that I have no problem doing uninteresting or miserable projects as long as there is a redeeming quality, or it doesn’t take up a significant portion of my workload. But it falls on deaf ears and I am again told basically ""suck it up"". This is really the only criticism I am interested in defending myself on, so I'm not leaving them thinking I'm someone who is only capable of working on things I'm interested in. Is this an unreasonable expectation?
* Any other thoughts?"

I want to make a career change since I really didn’t enjoy the constant socializing (I’m most definitely an introvert) and lack of work/life balance of real estate. 

I’m considering two very different options: do a UX bootcamp (Avocademy) or go back to school to get a master’s in Psychology and become a licensed marriage and family counselor. I like the appeal of UX design being a higher paying career and the bootcamp being cheaper than a master’s, but I wonder how difficult it is to break into the industry and whether it would be something I would enjoy doing. 

I’m also curious to hear from people who do marriage and family counseling and whether you consider it a worthwhile investment to go back to school. 

The main thing is I’m a low energy person (CFS) and am trying to find a career that pays relatively well and isn’t absolutely miserable for me. I’ve been struggling mentally and am completely broke living with my parents. I really need to get something started so I can get my life on track.

1,2023-01-11,Alternatives to a graduate degree in design &amp; technology and/or UX?,u/SmolAndHaveNoMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/109ht2o/alternatives_to_a_graduate_degree_in_design/,careerguidance,"I received my BS in Mechanical Engineering in 2020. Obviously this was a terrible time to graduate but I already knew I was unhappy in the field before then. I was a very creative and artistic person before undergrad but I stifled that part of myself because it wasn’t valued in my program. I’ve since realized that I would do much better in a career that combines STEM and the arts and have spent the past few months applying to grad schools. To give you an idea of the type of career I’m looking for, my top programs include NYU’s ITP and IDM programs, as well as the Design &amp; Technology MFA at Parsons. Obviously these are very competitive and costly programs, but I’m intent on living and working in NYC. I chose these programs because they would give me the opportunity to explore different areas of interest and combine engineering and the arts, whereas a standard degree like UX,UI or Software engineering may be too limiting.

The problem is, I’ve been dealing with some serious health problems over the past year that have me worried about my ability to complete a degree and get a job that would enable me to pay back my loans. Because of this I don’t know if its worth the gamble of attending an expensive graduate program. I’ve heard of people doing UX certificates or coding boot camps and getting a job without going to school for it, but I don’t know where to even start when it comes to looking into that. I would still love to be able to explore different fields like ux, game design, etc. but with so many horror stories about students taking on a lifetime of debt, I don’t know if grad school is really the right move.

I have experience with 3D printing/ digital fabrication, web design and some coding experience, so I’m open to hearing any suggestions people may have as to how I can work towards the career I want."

I feel hesitant to getting started even I'm already regretting so much about my life right now in the back of my mind. It's like I'm aware, sooner or later I have to start. And if I don't start now and take action than I will have to face consequences and regret as I age. 

At times I feel ashamed and not proud telling others that I'm trying to get into a radiology tech program as I want to become x-ray tech and go into MRI or CT techs. Because I feel like they don't make lot of money and not much opportunities for growth. I see so many people nowadays going for tech because of the job opportunities and income wise. Sometimes it's important to have a passion or interest in something and pursue that as a career but nowadays, everything just seems about money and survival. It's like I'm overthinking so much about my life and career choice. Overthinking has made me realize how much I'm procrastinating and it's affecting my life. My inner feelings just want some sort of the right path or someone to tell me that you're going in right or wrong path. I don't wanna end up regretting it in the future. Sighs"

I am testing negative now, and I told them this, but I’m still feeling some symptoms. I have a little bit of that nasty cough left and some chills. Definitely feel better than when I first started experiencing symptoms but I JUST stopped taking medication for it yesterday too. I work making smoothies, drinks, stuff that other people CONSUME. I don’t wanna be coughing up a storm and have to spit out my phlegm while I’m making drinks. However, my employers expect me to return to work tomorrow even if I told them I’m not feeling completely well yet AND they said no mask is required, which of course, I won’t be listening to them on that. 

Anyways, would I be wrong in asking for some extra days until I’m completely healed? I really don’t wanna potentially get anyone else sick even though I’ve been testing negative and I don’t wanna be coughing up a storm while I’m making DRINKS for people RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM bc that’s just gross.

1,2023-01-11,What is the standard conversation rate in pay for transfer from contract to full time?,u/Ok-Albatross6794,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/109i98e/what_is_the_standard_conversation_rate_in_pay_for/,careerguidance,"So I am currently working as a W2 contract employee for a pharmaceutical company. The way that works I'm a W2 employee for the recruiter that contracts me out. 

I've been excelling and I was told by my manager at the pharmaceutical company that they want to make me full time with a promotion. I anticipated a paycut from the contract pay to full time to account for benefits but it's a 50% paycut. And if I wasn't offered a promotion the transfer would be a little over a 60% pay cut. I was expecting and would have been fine with a 20%-25% paycut, it's hard to rationalize taking a 50% paycut for a promotion with more responsibility and longer hours. Also, I did the math and it doesn't even come close to that much of a cut to account for benefits, and that's not even considering the cut the recruiting firm is getting. It's hard to rationalize taking this much of a cut, has anyone else been in this position?

I'm thinking of breaking down my current salary and cutting out the value for every possible benefit and countering with that figure.  3 weeks vacation, 15 holidays, 6% 401K match, $12,000 yearly health insurance premiums, and 400/month for miscellaneous benefits. Anything else I should consider?"

I started in early October and took the lead on a bunch of their clients. Clients have seen growth, and I always have got good feedback from clients &amp; team. The bosses' actually said how happy they are, how well I fit in etc etc 

However, since the holiday break, it’s all shifted and I am super confused now! I got ignored all last week, they don't talk or respond on the group chat anymore, and I am not being invited to zoom calls anymore. After ten days of this, I finally got a call today to say they aren’t happy with my performance. They want me to treat their business like it’s my own and give it 1000% helping them find new clients, posting on my own social media, and generating leads and they are mad I haven’t been doing that already (despite never being asked)

They then proceeded for an hour to tell me everything I was doing was wrong, but a lot of it contradicted stuff I’ve been explicitly asked to do in the past (for example they told me to use these specific brand guidelines, then today asked why I was using them?) I tried at the time to get further clarification on this, and have tried since but she stands firm that I have misunderstood tasks (I have in writing things that contradict what shes saying now but I don't want to be argumentative)  like I say they always have been super positive and still my work is being actively used and scheduled till March. 

It ended with them telling me I have a month to improve (I’m still not exactly sure what I’ve done wrong, again I have asked for more clarity so I can take steps towards improvement but they still aren’t being fully clear) 

I’m just a little blindsided because before the holidays and after it's as if there has been a major change that I am unaware of. The atmosphere is now so so so different.

I’m happy to take feedback on board (that's how you grow!) and make improvements but I’m so anxious and on edge that they’ve made their mind up about me now without ever giving me a chance. And I’m still not completely sure what I’ve done wrong to cause this shift over the holidays.

I have tried asking but I don't get concrete answers, and I have since found out there have been the usual meetings, I just haven't been invited to them :(

Sorry for the ramble, feeling highly anxious. I am basically wondering has anyone been in this situation that has any advice?"

Somehow I have managed to avoid self-evaluations in my career up until this point so I had to start from nothing. I always save brag emails for jobs well done, etc. so I had a lot of collateral. The part that I started to struggle with was the 1/3/5 year planning portion.

My particular title/job description is a new-ish role in the industry. I would say it's only really been a thing for about 5 years formally. I had what I thought was a good idea to pull job descriptions, requirements, and skills from Job Reqs on LinkedIn that I thought were interesting and then use those as a roadmap for my career plan because there is not a prescriptive path in my company/department. The plan sort of fell apart when I realized that my skills, experience, and responsibilities were very well aligned already to Manager Titles (I am currently an Analyst, not even a Sr. Analyst). So I am struggling to put together a plan, when my responsibilities and title need to right-sized already.

My last long-term employer was the type that never promoted anyone, ever, and it was supposedly all tenure based but there was no expectation on how long was long enough-- a lot of carrot dangling happening there. As such I campaigned for a Sr. title for 3 years, without success despite my value and responsibilities which were acknowledged but met with budgetary obstacles. Now that I am in a company where that is not the case, how do I plan my career while waiting to get right-sized from a title and responsibility perspective? Especially when there is no path laid out for my role yet?

That is all to say, what tips, tricks, and experiences do you have with these sorts of career planning exercises? Both from a personal planning and goal-setting perspective and a ""I have to submit this paper"" perspective?"

Not sure exactly which path to take next. Here is my info.

Graduated from Rutgers in 2016 with a BA in biological sciences with the pre med classes

Did a lot of internships, volunteered at hospitals and did research at medical universities in NJ.

Went to podiatry school afterward for 1 year in NYC passed the first semester and failed the second.

Then started studying for the lsat did not do well, then did a coding bootcamp learned CSS, HTML, Javascript, got a job as an IT auditor at HSBC in a contract role for 12 months. Due to the economy was let go after 3 months and this was not performance related as my supervisor wrote me a great reference letter. Got let go second week of oct 2022 and since then been trying to figure out what to do. I have some money saved about 30k in student loan debt from medical school and non from undergrad. I worked and still have my substitute teaching certs that can provide some income although I hate doing it. 

Right now I am going back to study for the lsat and have signed up to take it in April. I don't want any regrets and feel like I could combine my bio major with law school and do patent law. 

In case that does not work out, I am also applying to the Rutgers B School MBA in professional accounting program which is for students who have no background in accounting. It is 14 months and has an internship in the winter break period. It will also set me up to take the CPA exam with the 24 accounting and 24 gen business credits. The program is 14months, 60k tuition and is 20 min from my house.  In this scenario, if I get a good lsat score I could apply for next year and in the meantime do this program and down the line be in a great position to work as a tax attorney. 

I just wanted to know what you think of this plan and is it a good one going forward for someone in my position. I enjoy business, tech, and law but I also understand the value that comes with having a license to do something for example in accounting and law you can get the cpa or bar license. 

I was also looking at going back to school to get a bachelors in computer science from Rutgers and I do get instate tuition discount for that as well as the masters program. But that would be a bachelors degree and from the admin person I spoke with it would take 2-3 years to complete. I do not know if they have any programs for people in my situtation with a non tech degree to do possibly a masters. I am really confused on what I should do with my life and so writing this post is kind of cathartic in a sense. I am just not sure if I am making the right decision going into law and accounting. I spoke to my sister who does data science at a big 4 accounting firm. She did IT then masters in DS. She is so busy and so doesn't have time to talk sometimes. But she did say to try for the lsat and if it doesn't work out I could always do tech through these online masters programs or other shorter online programs. She says not to go back for a bachelors as it would not be a good look and to get a masters.   My one issue with this is the loans being higher for a masters than an undergrad but the time would be saved. I am going to turn 30 in June so my family is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on me to figure out my career and have stability so this has been so stressful that I can't sleep at night due to the worrying and my hair is thinning."

I am interviewing for a job I never thought I would apply for. It's an hour away through back highways that may not have the best snow maintenance (I'm in southern Ontario) but offers 1 day remote after training. It's also an $ 11,500 pay increase. there is upward momentum to the marketing or sales department (I would prefer the marketing department because I'm sick of sales)  

These are the benefits they're offering

RRSP Matching (you mean I may actually get to retire?!?), Benefits Package, Profit Sharing (I don't even know what this means lol, never had it before), Performance Bonus, Yearly Attendance Bonus (yuck, I don't agree with attendance bonuses because our health is important but it's sad that I would get this, I haven't been sick in 4 years), Office Clothes Allowance twice a year, Company Social Events (I do love free food)

I just had a preliminary phone interview with their HR &amp; it went really well. I have a full interview coming up.

I would be supporting their inside sales &amp; marketing department. My background is admin so if they're willing to train, I'm willing to learn. 

Do you think it's worth it? I'm a bit scared to go so far outside my comfort zone. all I keep thinking of is the drive, the gas, the 2 hours I'm losing a day, the fact that there is so much of the job I don't know (but can learn) my last job was 35,000 with a half hour drive. 

I don't like to count my chickens before they hatch but I need a job lol. I'm also interviewing next week for a small office doing what I had done previously for 5 years. I wouldn't need training and can walk to work (it's a long walk but doable) but they didn't tell me what the wage was so I'm guessing between $15.50 (min wage)- $18/hr tops, the last place I worked at doing that job paid just over minimum wage which was around $12 at the time &amp; my only wage increases came when min wage increased (2015-2020)."
1,2023-01-11,Is my new job a bad fit?,u/Sea-Flight-5983,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/109kkrg/is_my_new_job_a_bad_fit/,careerguidance,"I left my previous job of seven years in communications for something of a career change into academia/research. There were multiple reasons I left -- lack of opportunities for progression in my previous role, unwillingness to raise pay, feeling stagnant after a long time with the company.

I was feeling a bit uncertain about things before the new year, and have come back to the news my manager is now leaving the team to work on other projects which has left me quite dispirited. The manager is lovely and one of the people on my interviewing panel. In this same week I've also learnt the new hire at my old job is not doing well at all, which has me thinking about what I left behind // the possibility of returning. 

I have been here coming up on six months now and am worried it is a bad fit.

I have enjoyed:

- Learning to code, which is helpful for the job. I have been teaching myself as I go.
- Friendly colleagues and a positive workspace (but also had this before).
- Work which is not especially stressful or demanding (work before was more intense but not especially so).
- A flexible work environment in terms of WFH and WLB (bit better than before).

But there are lots of things I have found difficult and didn't expect:

- The work is very independent and isolated, with little collaboration or even communication. 95% of my work is done alone. I am used to working a mix of independently and in small teams and thought there'd be at least a bit more of the teams work in this job.
- Project timelines are unclear or extremely (months/years) long - there is little sense of a drive or urgency to complete work. It doesn't seem to matter when things get done. I am used to juggling multiple, changing deadlines each week.
- Team meetings are just a series of updates from each person with little thought or discussion given to what we are doing or why. Often there is a fixation on minute details and process.
- Little/no training or instruction on how to work.
- Little/no supervision, oversight or feedback, not even on a weekly or monthly basis.
- Pushing work forward relies on super-busy and distant higher-ups which means I can often be waiting weeks for something small to get the project to the next step.
- Often feel directionless or with little to do most days, but wary of asking for more in case things gather pace (it seems a bit quiet/busy/quiet phases over weeks/months, and have made that mistake before!). 

My last job was quite unusual so I'm not sure if this is the typical picture of research and how most teams work? Or if I should be thinking/approaching the work in a different way? I got very positive feedback on my probation review but it doesn't feel like I've achieved much at all.

For me, I guess I could (1) knuckle down and see how it goes over the next six months at least or (2) consider moving back to the old role, but this feels regressive or (3) chat to other networks / apply for other roles and see what's out there in my previous profession.

Any advice very welcome!"

1,2023-01-11,Am I overreacting? Or are my concerns valid? (production artist),u/-Faydflowright-,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/109l7qs/am_i_overreacting_or_are_my_concerns_valid/,careerguidance,"Hey everyone, I am a full time illustrator who works with many different clients. My main client brought me on full time this past year (woo hoo!) to work on our microbusiness... however I lately have just been feeling like I've been going crazy.

I know I am working on my own end about time management, I work from home and as an Illustrator, sometimes one has weird work hours. But, lately I'm just not sure if my concerns I've expressed to my boss are valid or just more related to me trying to be better at time management in my own life?

We are working on a book which I personally thought we should have had done back in the summer. We went back to the drawing board a few times since boss wasn't quite sure what he wanted. Again, I'm full time with him, so he can use my time and skills however he wants. This caused some tension since we kept going back and forth which halted a lot of the process. I also think he wasn't getting the correct answers I needed from the printer in order to get the documents ready for print. So this lead to more fixing and waiting for him to get back to me. (He's got another job so it's not always perfect on time). It was so much of me explaining that we need to work on the full book and not keep fussing about the size of margins. (Easily spent a month staring at a blank page where ""AD GOES HERE"" was written on the document...)

None the less, we got the book done. YAY. Printer had one edit and we got it sent off a couple weeks ago before the end of the year. Double yay! Now the next step of any book project/brand especially at the beginning of the year is to start just looking ahead. Do we want to hit the holiday season? Summer? How will we have a book launch? Soft launch? Major count down? Etc?

We've already been flexible throughout the entire project so far and he says his goal is to make money, so having these deadlines are a sure fire way to make sure that we get things done!

End of the year comes and goes, I ask back once the work week starts what we're doing... his response is that we're just going to take one day at a time. Again, one day at a time is great and all, but we have a literal PRODUCT coming to us (which he tells me is actually going to be here by the end of Feb). Sweet! This means we can take product photos, get working on marketing, etc. I keep asking him are you wanting to hit the Holiday market? His response is that he doesn't want to think about future stuff.... just focus on getting money.

Boss man... I tell him... in order to make money, we need to now think about how we're going to sell our product. Our website is unfinished, our side products on the website aren't finished or represent what we've been doing lately, and above all... this is an art project aimed at families! Do we want some animated gifs for the product to help promote? Animation alone takes time along with our other stuff I have to work on weekly.

Don't worry about it.

I just am sitting here another week going surprise pikachu face. Like, artists work to the speed of deadlines, so I feel bad when we don't hit our ""lets take it as it goes"" deadlines.

We used to post our artwork online too, but now we're not even doing that... it's pretty much I'm creating work that I *can't* really talk about online or show people cuz it's pretty much being constantly worked on. 

I guess part of my frustration and wondering if I'm going crazy is that, this is literally my job. I went to school for this. I have a freelance business. I've been doing illustration professionally for nearly a decade now. I *know* what goes into a good campaign, brand, and book. It's part hobby and part career! He hired me because I could not only draw what he's been looking long and wide for, but I""m such a vital and valuable part of his business. This literally is my dream job too!

Sure, I could go to other places and get paid more, but I'm doing what I love, with a great schedule that allows me to work from home.

Part of me is like, is he just unsure about things himself? Is he not trusting me? Or am I going crazy?

Idk, sorry for the vent. I just have dreams and goals to be a senior project manager of sorts some day. And literally, I am the art director of this brand... but seriously.. how hard is it to just say ""hey we want to hit the 2023 holiday market and we want to have two books, an activity book, a website, and a store all set up by then."" Then if it's getting closer and we haven't hit those main goals, then we adapt!

Idk... do any of you have any advice or thoughts? Should I just give up this fight and just go back to focusing on my own work/business and treating him like a client?

Thank you!"

I would prefer to stay with this company given they are great to work for and very flexible. I can pay my bills and save money but it’s a stretch to meet my financial goals.

I have a mechanical engineering degree (Venezuela)... I have like 4 years of professional experience in procurement, including 2 years in an American transnational. I was living abroad (Chile) and was fired so I made Uber for 1 year and then move to another country (USA) just when the pandemic began... Without any job and trying not to be infected I decide to work from home, so take advantage of having banks accounts in 3 different countries and with cryptos exchanges working doing remittances, and create an Instagram account to offer the services that help to make steady $1000/mo (helping my savings) then when pandemic craziness ends I need to earn more money and put food in the table and worked 6 months as a solar panel tech, then when recession shows the head I decide to look for a recession-proof job in case everything gets worse and worked 1 year as a plumber apprentice, I am a few months from being released as an official plumber with maybe $24-26/hr to begin.

Now I have my work permit ready (always worked under the table )  and I want to recover my career, one friend said me to extend the duration of my last professional job to show myself better, and another friend said to me invent a consultor experience. To be honest I feel uncomfortable with lies. I have been reading about transferrable skills but am not sure how to write this in my Resume and if this could affect my eligibility to land my first professional job in America. 

Thanks in advance for all your support,"

8,2023-01-11,My boss keeps lying to me?,u/MaximumAsparagus,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/109ma4m/my_boss_keeps_lying_to_me/,careerguidance,"I'm so frustrated and I don't know what to do. Okay. Let me try to explain. 

My boss (I'll call her Sarah) lies to me almost every single time we talk. She'll say things like ""well, Annie says you spend 8% of your time on this project."" When I say ""Oh that's not right, let me talk to Annie about this"", she says ""Wait, no! Let's discuss on zoom next week.""

Well, Annie is my key stakeholder, and it doesn't seem right that she'd underestimate my work that way. I bring it up to her, because I'm sick of the way Sarah silos information. Annie says: ""I didn't say that. That's what last year's budget says. I told Sarah I couldn't estimate your team's work because I didn't have the expertise."" I know that Annie is telling the truth; I have known her for five years and she has always been honest, clear, and forthright. 

I'm now stuck in a situation where I can't go back to Sarah and press the issue without revealing that I've talked to Annie. There is work I won't provide (I do not have the expertise; no one on the team does, because _Sarah just laid off the person who does_) that Sarah's expecting me to do, based on ""Annie's"" false estimate. 

Where the fuck do I go from here?

It's insane. I can't figure out what's going on. Every time she lies, I'm like ""well, this must be true, because it's so easily verifiable"". And then she's lied again. 

I brought this up with HR two months ago. A coworker who's also been lied to a bunch made it very clear he was quitting because of Sarah. And nothing's changed?? What the fuck. 

I could deal with this if she was rude and horrible nonstop but she ends every meeting with a speech about how transparent she is and how glad she is that we trust her. I'm losing my mind."

I’ve been at my current company for two years. All employees are fully remote and spread out geographically. 

The company has always been on the toxic side with a lot of management issues - and changes in leadership and in my team over the past six months have made things even worse. I was hired based on my niche skills and expertise and my work is vital to the company running smoothly. 

Six months ago, my manager left and his replacement, “Jill,” brought in a team of people she had worked with for many years, including “Kim” who was assigned to work with me in a lateral position - providing much needed support for a heavy workload. 

However, I soon found myself left out of key meetings and projects, subjected to discriminatory comments, and blamed for errors that were completely unconnected to my area of work. Things got even worse when two months ago, Kim was made my supervisor. Some examples of recent events include:  


· Twice, Jill criticized me for making mistakes without being willing to share any useful information about what errors she or others thought I had made, but the information she DID share related to processes that I don’t manage or work on. When I pointed this out, she seemed to accept that the errors had not actually had anything to do with me, but she refused to correct this with anyone else and allowed the larger team to think I was at fault. 

· In a team meeting, Jill referred to me verbally by a derogatory comment relating to my religion (which is different from the rest of the team).

· Jill asked me and Kim to meet (virtually) with a colleague in another country. She then changed her mind and said I did not need to be in the meeting due to the fact that I have a family and it was on a Sunday (a typical work day in our colleague’s country). As it happened, Kim scheduled the meeting for a Monday and did not inform me.

· There is an upcoming company-wide conference out of town that my entire team is attending and I have been excluded from. First I was told I didn’t need to attend because I have children. Then I was told none of our team was going – which was a lie. I pushed to be included and was finally given permission to attend, and made travel plans. Then I was told my flight and Kim’s had been canceled because we needed to work on critical projects during that time. I have since learned that Kim’s flight was not canceled, only mine. Spoiler alert: there is no “critical project.”

I am hurt, miserable, and dealing with all this drama is making it very hard for me to concentrate on my job.

I’ve thought about making a discrimination and bullying complaint to HR but these incidents occurred verbally and in front of people who are loyal to Jill so I don’t have any proof to back them up – and I’m concerned about it making things worse. Despite all of this, I love my actual work and I’m learning so much in this job. I could stick it out until I get fired, but if there’s any way to actually salvage the situation and make things better I would rather do that. Changing teams/managers is not an option because of my role."

Starting working at a small business as the sole engineer for that company in my field which is very niche. I completely started up the process for my department and my manager and the higher ups were very grateful for my work.

About 6 months into my job we hired two other engineers. 1 of them is very nice but the other is not and me and the nice guy have had many issues with him.

Basically after 3 months of putting up with him I explained all that had happened (outlined below) to my boss and asked him to fire him and he said no, then I asked if I could get promoted to lead engineer so the employee would respect me more and my boss said no, then I asked my boss if he could talk to the engineer and tell him to stop and he said no bc he ""didnt want to make him mad"". (btw my boss agrees with me that the mean engineer has a lot of issues and is a jerk.)

Now like 3 months after initially talking to my manager I asked my manager again if I could get promoted and he said no citing the time I wanted the other employee to get fired as the reason for why he believes I'm not ready for a lead position.

Was he right? please tell me your thoughts.

Examples of disrespect from the mean engineer:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Us 3 engineers decided to buy a couple of large plants for our office. Me and the nice engineer took 20 - 30 mins setting it all up once they shipped and the mean guy did nothing then we politely asked if he could simply throw out the shipping boxes on his way out, he said no.
2. He randomly left work one day for an hour at like 2:30 pm without telling anyone and when I simply/politely asked him where he was he yelled at me ""I don't have to tell you where I was!""
3. We had a disagreement because he was wasting a downstream teams time by sending them work that I thought he should have done himself and simply told me to talk to my manager. I explained that the manager isnt familiar with our processes and that we need to get into the habit of atleast trying to resolve these things ourselves first before we bring it up to the manager and he just ignored me.
4. Recently I polled our engineering team for the amount of hours of work we currently had assigned to us prefacing that a lot of new tasks were piling up and I wanted to ensure that they were being distributed fairly. I went first and said \~30, nice engineer went next said \~30 and mean engineer went last and said \~20 and asked what assignments I had for him. I then assigned the mean engineer a few tasks totaling no more than 3 hours with one of them being highly critical and also short in duration \~10 mins. I then posted a comment on the associated ticket requesting this be done by COB (it was like 11 AM at the time) due to the highly critical nature of it, He responded saying ""I \[myself\] could have just done the assignment in the time it took to create the ticket"". I responded saying that wasnt true. he proceeded to never do the task .
5. I was sending him files for a certain process that he could use as a template for a different process he was creating and when he was having problems and would send me the files back i was wasting time finding it on my computer because he never changed the filename from the old process (the one I was working on) to the new process (the one I was working on) I asked him if he could stop doing this and said no.

I could go on and on but this is the jist of his attitude towards me and the team."

Since I joined the company things have gradually gone downhill, starting with high turnover, then people getting laid off (around 10 people as of now), and now events being cancelled. 

The problem is, I really like my role, and the company does afford me a flexible work schedule, unlimited PTO, pets in the office, free snacks, great coworkers, and other benefits that are difficult to find elsewhere. 

However, the company has let people go as mentioned, and they have not communicated this, leaving me in the awkward position of only realizing when I try to send them a message or when I mention them in a meeting. Some of these people were friends of mine, and I'm having trouble not feeling angry at the company for letting these people go/wondering why I was spared. This makes it hard for me to focus on my job, and I feel like I've entered into more of a survival mode mindset being ready for every day to be my last. 

I've stopped trying to form relationships at work with my coworkers because it feels pointless if they may disappear. I have started to look at other job listings, but nothing seems to have as good of benefits as where I work now. 

Should I start applying anyways or should I wait to see if the company goes down or if they lay me off and enjoy the benefits while they last? I have enough savings to not be in immediate trouble if I were to get laid off, but I also worry about the emotional toll."

Details are the following:
Job A (current job) - financial services industry 
-Have been here for two years.
-Slow pace.
-Been talking with boss about potential for promotion in 1-2 years, which seems normal for this job and industry.
-There is an annual bonus of up to $10,000.
-17 days of PTO, 4 days of sick leave, 11 observed holidays (US).
-There is a pension that becomes vested after 3 years.
-Freedom of schedule unless there are meetings or deliverables.
-Hybrid work environment where I go to office once per week.
-Have been looking elsewhere mainly because of the slower pace and sometimes have frustrations with my coworkers.

Job B (offered job) - healthcare insurance:
-Offered a job where at first I turned down because recruiter gave wrong job details but my potential future boss called me directly to explain it better.
-Would be very fast paced and more exposure to senior management, much more busy.
-Deals partly in project management elements and on the surface level that is not what I want but could be very different from what I’m assuming.
-Described as fast tracking to the next level.
-Annual bonus of up to 7.25%, and I’d earn about $4,000 more per year (although I will likely get a raise at my current job in a few months that will be closer to this).
-21 days of PTO, observes 8 holidays (US).
-Completely work from home.
-No pension.

My initial thoughts were to accept the job because in terms of more exposure there is opportunity to move up. However, when thinking on it more, there is that possibility at my current job just a bit slower paced. There is no pension at the new job that has me hesitant as that tends to be rare these days."

I currently live in my fathers house along with my step mother and my 26 year old step brother(That moves out and back in often enough). My father works 90+ hours a week as an electrician. He has been pushing me(obviously) to get into a serious career field. I of course want to as well. I currently work at an auto parts store and have been for 2+ years since I moved to my fathers. The pay is not good enough to rent an apartment and everything else that comes along with moving out. I have been looking into apprenticeships for a while. I looked at and applied for an apprenticeship at a welding union but I was not in the jurisdiction.  I also tried to go to tech school for welding but they wanted $50k because I was out of state. I am looking into the IBEW near me to become an electrician. Only problem is if I get in, it is a 4-5 year contract and I can't get out of it if I don't like it but can become a journeyman after that 4-5 years.  My whole family is electricians and I see how much overtime they worked over 30+ years and they don't plan to stop. I am honestly looking for something that I can do for 10-15 years till I can save and find a way to work for myself. I love the trades but I don't want to be stuck working in them till I am 65+. I like working with my hands just want to get into the right thing that can also pay the bills. What do you think?"

However,  after graduating in May, the company went under some financial  difficulty and was not able to offer me a raise or full time status at  my 6 month mark of employment. It's now a year since I started and  nothing has changed; I'm still part time with the same raise, and I  haven't advanced anywhere within my department.

Hey everyone,

I'm here for some encouragement and advice.

I'm 24 and don't have a college degree. I had straight A's in High school and community college, but didn't go to university due to my dad breaking his promise of paying for me. I was scared of debt. I use to own an organic small farm with 7 employees. It was just ready to expand due to my buyers list really exploding, I just needed a few more months of profit to fund the growth. However, my business ended late 2021 due to my parents divorcing and my dad running off to another state leaving my mom with nothing. I had to decide whether to help my mom to get a place and start paying her bills until she got back on her feet or choose my business and let her go homeless. I decided to choose my mom of course. All my savings are now gone.

I now work in property management that pays decently well due to me having Office Administrator and Customer Service experience. My plan was slowly get promoted over time and my bosses are already training me to be a Supervisor only 4 months in. The problem is, the company structure is changing so there are less and less opportunities to get promoted. I'm not sure how long it'll take now, though I don't mind waiting for awhile.

I feel like I am a determined person who works harder than a lot of people I meet. I am willing to put in the work, even if it means long hours. I just don't know what direction I want to go anymore.

Should I stay the course and wait extra time to get promoted? Is there different careers that I can look into that can get me to 6 figures eventually? I want to go to college but paying my bills and some of my moms, it makes hard to save. I am going to get financial aid but I need to see how much I can get.

My real goal is to be making 6 figures by 30. What are some career options some people might recommend? Any advice?

TLDR: My life has been turned upside down last year and don't know what path I should be going on anymore. Any advice to eventually get to a 6 figure career by 30?"

1,2023-01-12,Should I Take a Lower Paying Position?,u/SpiritofMesabi,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/109tfdo/should_i_take_a_lower_paying_position/,careerguidance,"I have been working in the hotel industry for 4 years now as an overnight front desk clerk (night audit). In 2020, I enrolled in an online Computer Science BS program. and I am set to graduate in spring of this year. I already have a BA in political science and history.

I recently interviewed for a position for an accounting clerk role at the property I work for. It seems like I might be offered the role (they're calling to discuss tomorrow).

In the last 6 months, I've been applying for tech roles that I'm theoretically qualified for. Ideally, I'd like to become a full stack developer, or really just a java developer. I like the idea of getting into the game industry as well. I could also do IT, but I'd really need to be trained for it.

Anyways, my dilemma is this:

If I take the accounting clerk role, my salary would be between 41k-51k USD a year. BUT, if I wait for a software development, or IT role, I would be set to make more, even just starting out. Additionally, a lot of the tech roles are work from home, better work life balance, etc.

Additionally, my work wants a 2 year minimum commitment for the accounting clerk role. I'm not sure how punitive this would be, but it was one of the things they really talked about in the interview.

On the tech side, I've heard that getting one's first gig in anything tech is quite hard. I've spent my entire college experience not even able to find an internship. Additionally, I've seen news report after news report talking about layoffs in the tech industry.... i.e. experienced people entering the market en masse.

But most importantly, I don't know how confident I really feel in my demonstrable current technical ability. I spent the first 2 years back at college learning the fundamentals, and I'd only say that I've just now gotten to the point where I'd be confident to really produce anything. My github repos are pretty bare, and I really don't have much to ""show off"" in terms of things I've done. It's not that I'm not able to develop software, it's just that between a busy life, burnout, and a barebones program, I've been slow to really get any projects finalized. I'm hoping if I take the accounting role, I could build out a portfolio in my spare time.

My last consideration is this. I'm so burned out. I've spent the first half of my 20s working absolutely crap jobs, and I'm not sure if the Accounting Clerk role will be much different. The pay isn't much better than what I'd make doing full time now (37K USD), and while the role seems decent, I don't know if I'd be able to really work on personal software projects if I took then position.

So, it really comes down to this for me. Do I take the accounting role, or do I try and hold out for anything in the tech industry when I'm fairly certain I'm a subpar candidate for anything there?

Any advice from software developers, accounting clerks, or people in similar positions?"

I’m not sure if I need to thicken up, but I do think it’s an incredibly toxic environment.

Our head of the team comes across as belittling and demanding over emails - they’ve never yelled at anyone in person at the office, but they’ve torn into people on public group messages within the company. They want instant results with no mistakes, despite the work being fairly complex.

My coworkers aren’t great. They constantly tear people down in private conversations and on private chats, which I’ve seen glimpses of from their screens. 

In terms of how I've done here...I think I've done well on paper. I've gotten several raises and a promotion, people have said I give high quality work. At least that's what's said to my face...

However I'm absolutely miserable. I have a hysteric breakdown at least once a month where I'm riddled with anxiety over messing up or being ridiculed. I've stopped finding happiness in doing the things I used to love doing outside of work...because I just find myself dreading work all the time.

I've been job hunting for a year but the market's been cold. I had an offer with higher compensation, but it was at what I suspected was an equally toxic environment. I've had offers rescinded due to layoffs and hiring freezes..and I had a recent rejection which really hurt my confidence and self esteem.

Some days I genuinely don't want to exist. And what's sad is that my life is going great otherwise - I have a supportive partner and furbabies that we love so much. Unfortunately quitting is not an option, especially with how long it's taken to find another job. 

I know I won’t be here forever but I feel like there’s no way out."

I'm 22 years old male and I have worked as a customer support for 1 year and currently working as project manager for few months.

I've been getting bored fast at my jobs and right now I have some free time in my current time and would like to know what to do next.

When I get home, I go to gym and after gym I watch a YouTube video and follow along WordPress web designing with woocommerce + elementor in the hopes of becoming a web designer and do freelancing aka work from home which I like. Current job allows me to work from home for 2 days max and have to run Hubstaff software which is basically a spyware and should be illegal.

My hobby is playing soccer and disc golf. I play disc golf on summer season and soccer any season, whenever there are enough players to play with. 

I would gladly just play sport my whole life without doing anything but that's just a fantasy.

I don't know what I really want to do with my life. I don't feel any freedom, just slavery and constantly cycle of going to work, gym, learn something else outside my work, sleep, work, gym, learn something outside my work and repeat that loop until I die?

Life is not fun currently unless I am able to play soccer or disc golf. Everything else is boring and not fun.

One goal is to have financial freedom so I'm able to do what I want after waking up from bed without worrying that ""hey, I gotta go to work today or I won't be able to pay my bills this month..""

Just some freedom would be nice to have..

I don't know what career to pursue either.

I am early 30s, I have around 4-5 years of work related driving experience (cab and delivery), about 2 years of Domino's shift lead experience, and about 6 months of Domino's GM experience. A couple years of factory labor experience, and about a year of sales experience (between 2 jobs, one car sales, 1 timeshare sales). 

My education is pretty lackluster with a GED and 1 semester of college.

I am just completely burned out. I often work 60-70 hours per week, plus constant unpaid work because as the GM, I am basically constantly fielding calls from my employees, or the store owner dealing with questions, or setting up interviews, etc. 

I am in need of something that fits my lackluster skill set, but doesn't involve taking a massive pay cut. I average about $30 an hour after OT and bonuses. I could realistically drop to about $25 p/h at 40 hours per week and still manage my bills. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do best in task or project oriented roles. If I am doing the same thing over and over day in and day out (most factory work) I wake up every day just absolutely miserable. Pretty much every new job is always super fun until I learn it and get good at it, then I can't stand waking up anymore. My years of dealing with the public has also just made me bitter towards people. I need a way out, but as far as I can tell, I'm pretty much backed into a corner at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

If location matters, I'm in eastern MO, near STL. I can relocate pretty much anywhere in Missouri, but not much more than that because I have a child with a custody arrangement. I don't care how good a job is, I wouldn't be willing to leave her behind unless it somehow paid enough to come back to MO every week, but I'm pretty sure that job doesn't exist either.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do? Do I have any options?"

Easy answer seems yes but a little messy, but also maybe overthinking it. 

Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place for this type of question.

Updating my resume and I'm stuck on what to do around listing changes within my job.

- For 6 months I was in an acting role, taking on higher duties whilst my manager at the time also took on the acting role above. Manager was granted an acting title and salary increase however I never was (even though expectations and role changed) - can I still list this on my resume? 

- I was also seconded to another role for 3 months (sub branch of company) whilst they recruited. I continued working my normal job for 3 days - secondment 2 days. A similar role/duties. This was also never an official title change - and company I was seconded to happens to be my previous employer. 

Basically - does adding either of these experiences add value to my resume or will it just be confusing and messy to someone external? 

There was some crossover between the secondment and the acting role - I'd like to think if nothing else this proves good time management.

- Been in current role for 18 months 
- Both acting / secondment roles were similar skill set to current role but more duties and management

Thanks for any thoughts."

I'm currently under significant stress...whoch is why I'm struggling to make a decision. Also, fearing of making a wrong decision again. I spent my 20s chasing a career that went nowhere. 

I do some freelance marketing work so have some marketing experience. I am being told marketing world can expand and I have potential of getting a 65+ a year after pursuing education - a marketing diploma.  At the same time, I am being told software development is blooming and I can work up the ladder there and potentially make 85+ a year. I have some software development experience from like my highschool days. 

If I pursue software development, will be able to make good decent money bases on just finishing a diploma not having a master's degree? 

If I pursue Marketing, will I be able to make good money or work my way up to Maki good money just based on finishing a diploma?

Do you have experience in either field and can share some insight? 

Is marketing or software development trending in the Labour market?

I just don't know which route to take. I'm a fast learner so going through school and studying won't be a problem. I would very much appreciate someone to give me some advice who might know a lot more about the employment works than I do.

I'm an 18 year old fresher working at an well known automobile manufacturing company in India.

I'm going to be working on 3 shifts at my company
1st shift - 7.00am to 3.30pm
2nd shift - 3.30pm to 12.00am
3rd shift - 12.00 am to 7.00am

My daily commute to work takes around 30 mins via our company's bus.

I wanted suggestions to manage my time and work-life balance. 

I'm currently living with 4 of my friends renting out a house. They don't have this shift based working as their work hours is constant 8.15am to 5.30pm.

They have a better work-life balance and seem a lot happier than me. And I'm feeling kind of left out living with them. This has taken a toll at my mental health as I've been dealing with loneliness, anxiety and depression. 

I currently have no idea to enjoy life as I always feel I don't have enough time with me always. I might have to work overtime which I can't avoid. 

As a kind request please share your thoughts like how do you enjoy life despite working on shifts? How to develop meaningful connections with people when you won't meet people at their free timings?

Please share your suggestions as to how can I improve myself.

Also, I am worried about the work environment. I heard from someone that my manager at this new job has temper issues.
 
I would like to ask two things:
1.	How to deal with the feeling of being unworthy of the job? The worst I fear is that I will not be able to handle the tasks given to me since this job requires a new skill.
2.	How to behave knowing that the management is quite hard to appease? And how to properly have a good relationship with my coworkers? I am quite an introvert with not-so-good social skills. So I appreciate any help.

One pays a good salary, high commissions, benefits but fairly long B2B sales cycles. (So deals can take 2-4+ months to close) 

The other is high ticket, quick turnaround, commission only B2C sales. (Get paid within 2 weeks of your sales) I’m working directly with a real estate investor selling his program and also getting some free help from him at the same time which has really benefited me on my investment journey.

I feel guilty because I’ve been spending a little more than 50% of my day at the commission only job. 

It’s good money so I don’t want to give up the B2C job completely because I’m great at it and the top performer. 

The problem is I’m having a hard time deciding on how much time to focus on each job. With the commission only job, the more time I spend on it the more I make but with B2B I only need a few heavy hitting accounts to make 50-100k in commissions on top of salary. (Granted it’s much harder to close deals)

Some advice/clarity would be great here simply because I want to give my full effort but it’s tough since they both make good money in their own ways."

Prior to my second child being born, I had to leave my career-path job (proposal manager/executive assistant to a large, global defense and commercial maritime company) which had a 2-plus hour daily commute to find work locally because my oldest was starting public school. The jobs I found were really only secretary/general admin positions and a few rungs down on the ladder I'd been trying to climb.

In looking back through my experience and education, a lot of the skills and experiences I acquired centered around organizational development and design, operational excellence, process and procedure development, etc. In looking into that path, a lot of resources say master's degrees are required (like psychology or human resources). I have a B.A. in English Language and Literature with a focus on technical and business communications.

My first real coding job was for an in-house XML framework. I built applications using the XML framework. It was at a start up, so it was kind of the Wild West. 

I helped build up documentation and even created a training program because when I started the training was “here’s some examples, figure it out.” Also helped standardize the code and content. 

From there I moved on to team lead/QA, project management, and now Scrum Lead. 

I want to go back to development. I casually code in my free time from the basic HTML/CSS/JS to PHP, SQL, Python, etc, but I don’t have “work experience” to back it up. 

I feel like with my additional experience as QA and PM I could be a valuable Developer. 

The big problem is that I am the primary source of income for my household and would need to make at least $85k/year. Most developer positions earning that require a bunch of “work experience.” I’m not sure how to get back into the field.

I’m a chemist with a PhD and I’m currently working in an R&amp;D role. I hated quality control (QC) work right after my bachelors and got a PhD to get away from it. After a few years working in development and validation roles I’m feeling ready to apply for management. I don’t see a lot of R&amp;D manager postings, but I do see some QC manager postings that I’m probably qualified for. Long term, I’m much more interested in product development than working up through the ranks in a quality assurance role. 

So do you think I’ll get pigeon holed as a QC manager if I take that type of role? Or do you think it would be easy to make the transition back to R&amp;D after getting management experience? 

Worth noting that I’m comfortable where I’m at, I just like to push my career.

Lately I've been feeling a little bit more erratic. My entire life pretty much has no meaning. I have a learning disability and was picked on and emotionally abused most of my life which has left me pretty insecure with no friends.

Being 36 and no friends definitely takes it's toll but I just stay busy. I ended up graduating with about 4 degrees just to prove to myself I can get it. I finally landed a ""dream"" job but I despise my career. 

I may be making decent money but deep inside I've been just thinking the worst. While in undergrad/masters, I focused solely on just passing so I had no social life, no friends, and definitely didn't learn anything about myself. 

Being 36 and not knowing what I enjoy or still having no niche is definitely making me consider extreme things. I feel like I've missed out on everything and chose and spent a life on stress for an opportunity to make a healthy living. I also take care of my mom so leaving and starting all over is definitely not an option. I just feel trapped and robotic.

Just venting it out, any suggestions/advice will be appreciated."

Hi everyone, 
This post, if not in the right place, feel free to remove. I just like sharing this as I am sure I am not the only one. I have been with the same organization for 16years.  It has some good people working for the organization,  however, not a single good director, CEO,CFO,CIO. They all like to flex their ""power"".
I have 2 masters, working on a third, and have been overlooked for many positions.  Why? Not sure. For a fact, I know I have qualified for everything that I have applied for internally,  and still nothing.  My immediate manager, who also is  the CIO, told me to go for a certain degree because he sees the need for that knowledge.  So I did, and when there was an opening,  I was overlooked, again. I met with The COO, to express my interest in moving up, doing more, I am willing to learn and help in other areas. He brushed off my sincere interest in improving professionaly...he did not even suggest anything.  NOTHING! Instead of trying to work with me, ""take advantage"" of an employee who wants to do more...,  he completely killed my motivation. So this quiet quitting thing, I have been doing it for about 5 years. The last 3 years I had enough,  and started interviewing outside.  The problem,  I stayed in the same position for 16yrs.and that pigeonholed me. I had my reasons why I stayed for that long,  but NEVER AGAIN!. Loyalty means nothing these days.
So, for the last 3yrs. I interviewed like a maniac. 1st, 2nd,3rd . rounds but no final call, until yesterday.  An organization with which I have interviewed 5 times with, for various positions. I was offered same pay as what I currently make (.which I am happy with) a good yearly bonus, great benefits,  my immediate manager is a great  human being, if I go by the way he was during the interview. I also have 3 days work from home as an option, which I did not have before.
FINALLY!!! So, to all of you that are in the same boat, do not give up , keep pushing. Do anything that you can to stay motivated just enough to get by, until you get another opportunity. 
Sorry for the lengthy post...but I am ecstatic!
On to bigger and better things! Happy New Year!"

I've been working an admin front desk job since graduating high school, always thought i loved maths and science but ended up graduating in something unrelated while working. This job is not giving me enough stability so i feel like I need a better one. 

I'm in my late thirties and I keep thinking that I might want to change career, try something new, maybe get another degree but I really can't decide which way to go, I just fear I could spend years studying something new and not go anywhere with it, and find myself 5 years older and with no job or life stability. 

I think I might want to study stats/ds/ml but I don't know if i could do it at this point in my life, it seems really interesting to me but I haven't touched any math in decades now. 

I'd also love to go fully remote so obviously i thought i should go the coding route, with self study/certs possibly, but i wouldn't know where to start with all this. I also fear it might be a very stressful environment and that I might not be able to handle the stress. 

So why am I posting this? I'd like to have an external point of view and advice on my situation as I've been reflecting on it for years, found many alternatives, but I don't know if they make sense, and maybe there are better ones I haven't thought of. So yeah, thanks to anyone wjo might read or reply to this.

I (23M, don't know if its relevant) recently graduated here in Mexico from my master's in operations research. I did mechanical engineering for my undergrad. I've always had the dream of permanently moving to Europe. As I'm single and just starting my career, I thought this would be the perfect time to try it.
One of my main areas of interest is data analysis and business intelligence. I've even taken additional certifications and courses to work in this industry. Thinking I would be doing exactly that, I reached out to a relative who's the CEO of the Mexican division of a small Spanish IT consulting and digital transformation company.
I got the a one-year contract offer to work with the Spanish team and started mid-December. I've hated it every single day since then. It really seems I've bit more than I can chew. They have me taking certifications on cloud computing and informatics, things I didn't study in university and only have a very basic grasp about.
The company, I guess through my relative, agreed to help me with any documents I need for the Visa process to move to Spain. 
To make matters worse, I'm doing 100% remote work right now. Due to the time difference, there's a very small window of time to ask questions. For the rest of the day, I'm stuck trying to understand the material on my own.

I'm starting to second guess my decision. I definitely think I can eventually move to Europe via another path, maybe a corporate management job once I have more experience. And I know there are plenty of data analysis and BI opportunities here that would make me a lot happier, allow me to get to know people in a real office, and give me experience.

However, I feel like I have my hands tied. My relative helped me get the job in the first place and I feel I'd leave him in a very bad position if I suddenly decide to quit.

Any advice?"

Unfortunately, in my field, to make much money, you do need a masters and certification, so working in my field is sort of out of the question (unless I’d like to make 30k in New York City which is not any money). I am stuck between two fields

Graphics Operator — I’ll get to work in sports trucks and using graphics machines to make live graphics during sports games. This job, once I get into the union, makes a ton of money ($58 an hour plus overtime when games run over). However, I’m not a huge sports person, but I can get the job easily, and get into the union easily, because my uncle works in this, and his boss is willing to let me try it out. (By not a huge sports person I mean I don’t really know statistics and players well, but I can follow any sport and explain rules). I do get to make my own hours, and pick the games that I want.

Car Salesman— this is a lot more to my passion. I absolutely love cars, and I know once I get my masters I will never be able to work in this field. It definitely makes less money, but I would enjoy this job significantly more. 

Just wanting to know some guidance on what you think I should take. Neither of these jobs will advance my career, and I’m OK with that. These are temporary jobs for 1 to 2 years.

TLDR: job that makes money, or job that I would love."

With that said, I have several questions for experts/project managers (if only you have time, I don’t mean to impose). 

1. What industries could I possibly enter into? 

2. Aside from a Google Project Management certification (which I’m currently learning from, what courses or resources do you recommend for a beginner)?

Also, if you’re looking for someone to give you a hand on several tasks (related to project management, just so that I can understand the swing of things), I don’t mind helping out!

It's a slight raise (~10%) with similar benefits. I have a significant background in this product. This probably would offer better work/life balance. 

When I gave my notice, my boss's boss, and my boss's boss's boss each setup 1:1s with me. They offered me a similar design position. They apologized profusely and said that when they hired me, they didn't realize the talent I brought to the team and my contributions have been noticed all the way up. The higher up said that even if I don't want the position, he'll do everything he can to keep me in the company, even if it's not in his department. They offered me even more money, but this was never about the money. I'm not qualified for designing these products, but the entire design team vouched for me and said they'd mentor me.   

I don't know how to make a decision here. I don't believe the current company is lying to me, because it's an engineer's market now and they know I could easily find another job. Both companies are decent culture, both similar pay, I know people in both.

I'm afraid that I will lose the work-life balance that I already have, and take on responsibilities and tasks that I am just not thrilled about. Basically, I look at what my manager deals with everyday and I think to myself ""thank God I don't have their job"". 

But I am also worried that if I stay in the same level of role, no one is going to want to hire me anymore, or assume something is wrong with my performance. I kinda feel ashamed about my lack of ambition. Recruiters keep offering me management roles and I just don't know what to do. I know this is something many people want and I feel bad complaining about it.

Edit to add: As someone pointed out, it might be helpful to add my industry to this post. I am in supply chain within the medical device/healthcare industry. 

With that said, I still appreciate hearing about others' experiences in other fields! What is it like to manage other people? How have you moved to an individual contributor role?"

I have reached a mid-level, non-managerial position in my finance career. I make good money, but I struggle with my day to day responsibilities and it overall is just not for me. I know I need to change jobs, and preferably careers completely. But I am 1000% lost and afraid of the prospect. 

For one thing, I live on a single income and don’t know if I can afford my condo if I change careers and get a reduction in wages. 

And on top of that, I have absolutely no clue what I would even pursue if not finance. But I do know I can’t stay in my current job because I am very close to being put on a performance review, and I don’t know if I can even improve, thus ensuring my inevitable firing.

I'm  in a new grad job for about 6.5 months now (first job out of College  with CS degree) at a well-known (although old) tech company. I would say  for the first two months or so it was pretty slow and just trying to  meet with people in my team and after that I started receiving very  small tasks related to programming/development and working with the  existing code-bases and trying to learn things from the business  perspective, like how the work we do on our team connects with other  systems etc.

I would say a lot of  my feeling of being inadequate/lost is that there's just a lot to digest  and learn and it is a little bit confusing to make sense of on my own. I  say on my own because most of my team leads are busy throughout the day  and it's hard to get time with them. Additionally, there's a lot of of  the tech stack I'm not familiar with or have worked with before and I  usually spend a lot of time trying to get proficient in that area,  usually spending time on Udemy and then working on my own through the  problems.

Additionally, I say I  feel lost because meetings have ramped up for a new release and a lot  that gets discussed during meetings just sort of flies over my head. Of  course, I'm going to have this conversation with my manager in our 1:1  meeting. But, I was wondering if this is a normal experience to have and  go through? My worries are that I'm stagnating and should be doing a  lot more, but I don't really know what ""more"" is in this context.  Or if  anyone has advice for things I could/should do to make myself a more  proficient SWE (hard to say with not much information given but I'll  take anything). I left out a lot of details in this post, but I just had  to see if anyone else has had a similar situation.

**TL:DR  - Just feeling lost and inadequate in new SWE job due to how much there  is to learn and make sense of and worried I'm not really on the right  track to improving over time.**"

I work in IT currently, and am looking to move into Cybersecurity, or out of my current role since I am about to get my associates in Information Technology. After that, I'll be getting my BS in Cybersecurity as part of the same program.

So, I found a job on Indeed for a job at Home Depot as a Cybersecurity Engineer. It asked for no experience, no degrees or required higher education and no specific requirements for knowledge/skills.

It offers between $80,000 and $130,000 and its remote.

I looked up the reviews of corporate Home Depot and the reviews were pretty average. Some good some bad.
Nothing to frightening.

Does anyone have an insight into this? Is there a catch?

Am I missing something? Like I said, I'm about to have a degree in less than a month and I have 4ish years of industry experience in IT (not Security)."

25 M Bay Area, California 

I am currently (paid training) studying for a banker position for my SIE, Series 6, 63 and life insurance. My base will be an annual 60k and first year bonus 12k. Meanwhile I’m currently being offered a position as a sales consultant based 40k but with a bonus of 40k totaling at 80k. The bonus last for 18 months which I suppose it totals out 60k? Both Bonuses are distributed monthly. 

The banker position I can walk to my workplace meanwhile the sales consultant position is essentially remote for the most part. Both jobs have commission which allows me to earn more than what’s shown above. I’m wonder which of the two provides a better career path. Because on the banking side there’s essentially three route: Manager, financial advisor, and mortgage banker. As for the sales consultant, maybe senior sales consultant or sales manager? I am currently leaning towards the sales consultant position because of the pay difference, remote and more flexibility in terms of investments and trades. I will be interviewing for the sales consultant position next week.

I’ve worked at my current firm for a little over 3-years, and to-date I still earn the same salary as I did on the day I started. I should note, I absolutely love my job and I am very successful in my role. On multiple occasions my supervisors have made it clear to me that when a promotion becomes available, I am first in line. However, that hasn’t materialized to date. 

While I love the job, the pay is becoming significantly important. My firm does not have an annual review process in which I could advocate for a raise, we do not receive any annual bonuses and we do not receive and inflation adjustment nor a standardized percentage based annual raise. 

Yesterday I approached my boss and asked for an after work sit-down discussion, which he was happy to arrange for tomorrow. 

Our working style is very casual, our team treats everyone equally and we would all regard each other as close friends. As such, I was wondering if anyone may have pointers as to what I should avoid saying, and what they’d suggest I say.

Maybe it’s different depending on whether it’s a BA or an Msc, i really don’t know. 

The course that i’m about to start soon is based on digital media, so some of the classes focus on human-computer interaction, AI, and the general increasing prevalence of digital media in different societal settings including politics.

I have an Associate’s degree in Criminal Justice and currently enrolled in a Bachelor’s degree in accounting, which I probably won’t finish due to mental exhaustion caused by my current job.

I currently work at a Call Center for a pretty big insurance company as a Customer Service Rep making $55k/year, although the money aspect isn’t my main motivator. Applying to this position was a dire desire to break into the corporate world of America and I’ve been here for 4 months so far. 

I love the environment, I love the corporate culture, the little perks and bonuses such as pizza parties and comp time for working on June 19th. The holidays off, stable schedule, all that. 

What I don’t like is the actual mind-numbing work that I’m doing. Call after call, with absolutely no breathing room in between. The timed bathroom breaks to the SECOND. Saying “thank you for calling x, my name is y, how can I help you?” 80 times a day.The fact that 90% of my day-to-day activities at work can be done by customers only if they registered through our website. 

I love the job that people above me do, and I’m not even talking about a supervisor level. Anything that involves talking with us, scheduling internal meetings, pulling data or even doing QA (quality analysis). All of that seems very interesting to me, and I don’t even care about the salary bump coming with those positions at my company. I was told to wait at least 3 years before even applying for either one of those - won’t happen. Being here for 4 months only makes my sanity level drop consistently every day. 

What would be a natural progression from this job by applying somewhere else? What are my realistic options at this point. I’m planning to stick it out until 6 months in at the very least, if possible. Our retention levels are at 28% for people staying longer than 12 months. What job titles can I look for that would better suit me, if any, in your opinion?

I do have previous managerial experience for 7 years (small esthetician salon), I know how to use a computer and every “office job” aspect of it. I enjoy talking to people, but not for 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week without a breather break in between. I love sending emails, solving problems, looking at simple data. 

I also like atypical schedules, ranging to the late, late evening hours (I currently work 1pm-9pm) although that’s not a major factor for me.

TL;DR mentally exhausted working a corporate call center job, love the environment but hate actual responsibilities of the job. Want to stay in the corporate world using a computer. What are my options? 

Any input will be appreciated."

Mental illness has been a huge part of my life for well over a decade. I’ve come to terms with it, I have a psychiatrist &amp; therapist and I am medicated. I feel like I’m in the best spot mentally, then I ever have been! I feel a bit helpless when I look at the fact that I’m almost 30 and I only work PT as a retail cashier. I thought I would be much further in life at this time of my life. I do my best to remind myself that I was dealt a different hand than lots of others. I have had an awful life! Keeping it short, every damn traumatic event you can think of someone going through, has been my entire life so far!

I have graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree last april and started working in august up to now. I am a mechanical designer for a small machining company that makes manufacturing systems. I do not like my job. The hours are too long the commute is a pain. I am considering a career switch as opposed to just getting another mechanical engineering entry level job. Throughout university I enjoyed programming a lot (intro to programming, matlab, robotics etc.) and am hearing nothing but good things from my software engineer/computer engineeer/cs graduate friends. People getting 90k+ offers out of university working 100% remote. Canadians getting jobs with American Companies getting paid American salaries while living in Canada. I live in Toronto and most mech jobs are paying $25-$30/hour which is barley enough to survive.

I am considering moving back in with my parents and taking a fullstack coding bootcamp with the U of T. My parents promised to pay for this course as long as I make the most of it. And I plan to do just that if I end up signing up. Other options i've l considered are engineering graduate college programs like this industiral automation &amp; robotics program at Conestoga. 

Looking back I wish I had pursued computer/software engineering over mechanical but now that im in this situation there's no sense in looking back. I really want a job that is remote even if the pay is not good. I think programming is what I would enjoy most.

Any and all help is appreciated."

He suggested that I go away for 3 months and try if I like living there, to eventually stay...

I have doubts about going to live there... but apart from that, I would like to know what should I requested when they ask you to relocate for work: How much income increase? What per diem and living expenses should I request? What should travel expenses include? Trips to visit my family?

Hi Reddit, I've been a long-time lurker and now finally hoping to get some career advice from this community. 

I am a Digital Marketing Coordinator and have been in this role for 5 years. I am responsible for basically updating anything that is on the company website and also building/maintaining Wordpress sites. Tasks would be:

* Building content in HTML CSS and very rarely JS/jQuery
* Basic wireframing for new website UI
* Evaluating tools like wordpress plugins or digital software
* Miscellaneous things like A/B testing, basic Google Analytics and process improvement

I don’t do **most** of what a traditional digital marketing coordinator does and have little interest in Marketing. 

I like my job as it is laidback and I have sort of become the SME on my functions. However, if I want to **get to a higher salary**, is it worth it to still become 1) a front end developer? 2) a UX/UI designer?

**Or will I be better off trying to become a manager of ECommerce or Content etc. and not pursue the ""executing"" roles?**

* I have basic JS skills - ex. if/else statement for something to change in a web element or something
* I have less than a year or so worth of wireframing experience
* I have a BA in Communication

I make around 68k in Canada (so less jobs and lower salaries compared to US) and would like to at least make 25% more as I get ready to start a family.

Any feedback is appreciated - thanks!"
0,2023-01-12,Should I change careers or stick it out?,u/s3xysocialist,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10a9vkb/should_i_change_careers_or_stick_it_out/,careerguidance,"I am 2 years out of college and 7 months into my first professional consulting role. I serve in an emerging industry that is pretty much guaranteed to grow quickly as a result of federal regulation.

My job is fully remote and my department / team is brand new (~1 year). I didn’t realize how new and under experienced my team was until it was too late.

My bosses are knowledgeable in the industry but they don’t have experience in their roles and can be very difficult and disrespectful. As a new department, we are experiencing a lot of growing pains, most of which fall onto me to deal with. Additionally, since we’re fully remote we have very limited team communication and support. 

I am paid well and learning a bit but I am doing the work of 3 other people and the job/boss-related anxiety is ruining my life (can’t eat or sleep, always checking my emails etc). 

This industry is taking off and I know if I stay I will be making 6 figures in less than 3 years and will hopefully be able to work more independently. But I am so over it. I want to quit as soon as I can land another opportunity.

However if I leave I will almost certainly take a pay cut. Plus companies may view me as a flight risk for leaving so soon. I’m also worried that I won’t enjoy any job, meaning I would be throwing away a well paying career for nothing.

This job is ruining my life but I don’t want to ruin my career. 

I can’t do this job, apply for new ones and work on improving my mental health all at the same time. It’s my hope that at the very least a new job will give me time and space to reset, hopefully with the help of more experienced leadership.

So do I stick it out (and hopefully profit) or do I just accept that this isn’t the job for me and begin transitioning careers?

Given the state of the world, should I value my mental health or my savings more?"

I (23 M) graduated from a university in Ohio with a degree in Marketing, with a focus on Digital Marketing specifically social media and search engine optimization (been living at home since graduation). I’ve applied to countless jobs through LinkedIn and revised my resume too many times to count. 

I’m feeling lost. None of my job applications go anywhere and if I do get an interview, it ends up being a scam/fake company or doesn’t get past the first interview. I think my resume is pretty decent, except for that fact I never got a real “internship” at college, but I do have good real life experience to make up for it. I used to apply mostly to remote jobs but after never getting anywhere with those I’ve just been looking for anything solid in my field. 

At this point I’m not sure what to do next. I’ve always been interested in doing my own thing, like starting my own marketing agency or company but it would be nice to just a real digital marketing job to gain experience and save some money to then start my own thing. Also starting your own digital marketing agency is just like the new “drop-shipping” scheme on YouTube and feel like the market is just over saturated at this point with losers. It also seems like most of my friends from college who got solid jobs got them all through connections they had - I don’t really have any professional “adult” connections and kinda on my own. 

The only way I’ve made money since I graduated is by selling clothes online, where I’ve managed to make a few grand every month but most of it gets spent on expenses and fixing my car and I haven’t really been able to save a lot of it. 

Am I just not trying hard enough? Should I just settle for a shitty cold calling sales job? Should I start doing my own thing and give up on the job search? Any advice or help would greatly appreciated. Thanks to anyone who replies."
4,2023-01-12,Do LinkedIn Articles Help Your Career?,u/Shannon_Quinn,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10aa4yw/do_linkedin_articles_help_your_career/,careerguidance,"A long time ago, I heard that if you have a professional website with a blog with topics in your field, it helps to establish you as an ""expert"". Some people even write self-published ""books as a business card"". With that being said, I know that LinkedIn allows you to write articles on your platform, which I'm assuming shows up somewhere on your profile. I can see how this might be helpful, because it shows potential clients and recruiters that you're experienced in the field, and it might convince them to work with you.

I am a full-time freelance writer. Since I write all day every day, writing LinkedIn articles very much feels like ""work"" that I would be doing for free. If it helped my career, I would definitely do it. But it also feels like it could potentially be a waste of time.

On a related note, do I tell HR I've been laid off?

I’m a full time student so it’ll be much harder for me to endure those 10 hours and 30 minutes. I should’ve listened to my social worker.

I thought there would be more breaks than just two. I met some co-workers of mine and they were all nice, the supervisors were nice too and managers! 

But it’s the schedule for me. I thought it was going to be part time/flex but it became full time and I ended up going out of guilt. 

It was fun I swear, the conveyor belt is my favorite (stowing) but I didn’t like the picklist as much. 

Ok main topic, I’m quitting and my social worker just suggested I don’t show up for work. Is this a good idea or should I let them know and have the badge and stuff (safety vest etc) sent back? 

If I don’t show up, will another Amazon company (not the one I applied to in my location) still hire me? Can they see my employment history? 

I’m really scared about them being disappointed about me wasting their time and all. They were all great hard workers and I feel so bad. 

But if I went with this shift from 1:20AM to 11AM, I’d be up for 15+ hours including my school after work. It’s too much and I get paid $16.25 +2.00 (18 buck). It’s good pay but I’m a student and I should’ve thought through clearly.

Please give advice…

And I also tore a muscle or something in my leg because it’s throbbing crazy and painful. I’m always afraid of disappointing so I kept quiet, I was gonna tell my manager but seeing how hard working the others were, I felt bad. And this is one of the reasons why I am not fit to be an Amazonian…or just a good worker in general."
1,2023-01-12,Am I crazy stupid to refuse those job offers ?,u/LividTranslator7944,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10abami/am_i_crazy_stupid_to_refuse_those_job_offers/,careerguidance,"So here’s the story :

I’m in my last year of uni, and to pass the year I need an internship to prove I have learned and can employ said learning in the professional world. I started looking at job offers pretty soon, right now I stil have 4 to 5 months to find one, so I’m not under a lot of pressure.

But still, I started looking pretty soon, and recently got 5 interviews in 5 different companies, and all of them made me an offer.

One of them I had as a backup plan but didn’t feel it from the start so I refused their offer after an interview that confirmed my choice. But the others…2 of them are not as close to what I want to do with my career and there’s no real opportunity to get a full job after the internship, so I wanted to decline too. (Haven’t done it yet, I'm still considering my choices)

The last 2, were the ones I had pretty high hopes and expectations in. They were exactly what I was looking for as a job, and the companies are pretty well known in the industry the operate in. So good names to have on a resume. I was hyped, and so happy to even be considered as a potential candidate. To me it was big, I don’t come from a big school so that kind of opportunity is huge, in theory.

But then, the interviews happened. And my whole perspective shattered.

Company A was offering a nice job on paper, but when they explained it to me in details, it wasn’t living up to the theory. It felt like it was mostly staring at a computer blankly, like I couldn’t get what they were actually doing all day. And the person I talked with felt very immature, she spend more time talking about how everyone was nice and how they were hanging out than what the job actually was. When I asked how she felt in the company, if she was happy there, she once again focused on the after work activities and parties. Also, the pay wasn’t great (for the real job promised at the end of the internship). So I didn’t think I would actually evolve and get a good work experience going there. I declined without guilt. I wasn’t feeling it. So that good opportunity wasn’t as good as I thought. I was already feeling pretty down.

Then company B. This time the job is a real job. Real missions, and responsibilities, even for the intern. Great ! The interview goes well, the guy is happy with me. So we go on to more casual talking, and once again the dream fades. The guy was very nice but started to be less nice. He told me how his colleagues had no back bones, that they were quitters and bad at team work. Why would you say that to me ? I asked once more a question about how the person feels in the company, with his job, and if he was content with it. He doesn’t say yes, instead he goes on to tell me that not everyone can get along with the manager. That a lot of people leave the company after only a few months, and that he even thought about leaving himself, more than once. So that’s not a good sign. He then proceed to tell me that he was working almost everyday until 7, and he though that you could only make it if you shut up and keep you head down, about how it's because he didn’t say anything and let people leave (so he could get their clients and missions I presume).

And ok I get you need to be resilient in the workplace but still ? If people leave so quickly it means there’s an issue, right ? And he ends it all by saying that his goal was to make money with nft and crypto (you do you) and that he doesn’t know if he’ll stay there long. I appreciate the honesty but that doesn’t make me want to accept...Especially since choosing this company would mean move to a new city, far from my family and where rent and living costs are extremely high. It kind of feels like a lot to sacrifices for a company that doesn’t sound that great.

So here I am, with 5 job offers and not one that I want to accept. I still have time to look for something else but I feel like I’m ungrateful ? Or entitled ? I have the chance to have those opportunities. I get to pick but am I allowed to say “none of them please” ? I know I might regret it, if I don’t find anything better but I feel like even if I accept I’ll end up regretting it. And if I regret my choice then I prefer to regret it in a place where my support system is, and where I can afford to live. I don't know how to feel.

I am looking for a new career as a deaf/hard of hearing individual. I am currently an HR professional with a few years of experience and  have a Bachelors degree.  My current job is so phone heavy (50 phone calls a day average) that I struggle daily. I wear hearing aids so they help a bit, but it is not enough considering. If I can do HR with only emails, life would be a lot less stressful. I have spoken to my employer about all of this and there is not much they can do to help me unfortunately. I also find that as a hard of hearing person, I'm often shunned at work so I really would love a career where I can work on my own and not have to be ""part of the group"" to do well.
Anyways, enough rambling! I'd love to know if anyone has suggestions for careers that don't require too much phone use/follow-ups? I live in NYC if that helps? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day!

The senior managers of the department were all let go and the org is moving to an Agile model. As part of this, the new manager (C-level) informed all of us (former reports of managers let go) of the positions that are being created.

Our new manager has set 1:1 meetings with everyone for a week from Monday, and she says she wants people in their new positions by the end of the month. These 1:1 meetings would be used as pseudo-interviews to get a feel for everyone’s skill set and determine where they fit.

There is a position that she described that I am very interested in. It is pretty senior compared to my current station, but I feel I have a great case. My worry is that she might have already preemptively placed me somewhere and that these 1:1s are a formality.

Would it be out of bounds to email her and state that I’d like to be considered for the position in question? Or is that too pushy, and I should just wait for our scheduled 1:1 in just over a week?

Thanks!"

I graduated from university in 2018 with a computer science degree, and am set to finish my computer science masters in 2024. I worked in the field as a full-stack developer for two years for some semi-big companies prior to co-founding my startup about 3.5 years ago, which now has \~17 FT people in the GTA and 3M+ valuation. Aside from this I also have 10+ years of Canadian reserve military service.

Would be amazing to get some life advice from people with experience in this forum.

**Option One:**

I accept an offer for one of the most reputable companies I have ever worked for. It has the highest social standing compared to my prior positions, and though this personally doesn't mean much to me, I understand that this is something that helps future mobility. I would be working as a solutions engineer (with close client contact), a role possibly horizontal or one below where I believe id sit but would be compensated greater than my last role and also believe I would work my way up quite easily due to it being in line with the industries of my past work.

**Culture**: High reputation, hard work, high value delivery to customers

**Option Two:**

I accept an offer from a well-funded and recently acquired company in Norway, that gives me a role that is responsibility-wise a level above Option One, an Engineering Manager. I have never lived abroad and always wanted to do so in the military, however, never got the opportunity. The company seems just as exciting (almost ruling out a comparison need), though I believe is less renowned than Option one and wont be as recognized in future situation, or directly align with the industry I have worked in thus far.

**Culture**: High team autonomy, service to the team, and team success and growth

Any insights that you could provide would be greatly appreciated, or if you believe there is important information that I left out here please let me know so I can both consider it and add it to this post."

I just switched to business analytics and marketing. I am so worried that I won't feel ""fulfilled"" with my career. I am an introvert at heart but I do love helping people and teaching, especially children and younger people. Nursing made me very unhappy; I think it was a combination of my school and the career. I didn't enjoy the role of a nurse; I like to teach and help people, but being responsible for new patients every day didn't interest me. I think watching the same people improve over time is better for me, but that is just an idea.



I like the idea of working from home, which is one of the many reasons I switched to business, but I am terrified that I won't feel fulfilled. I dread the idea of sitting at a computer alone in a cubicle all day. 



I like science, but the small details involved in it have always intimidated me. I like learning about anatomy and the big picture of science, but I get intimidated at having to learn about things on the cellular level because I can't see them. They almost don't feel real and it's hard to imagine. I like to teach and explain topics in simpler terms for classmates to understand. I like to help people, and I love working with children.



Money isn't everything, but it is something. I don't think I would feel satisfied with a teacher's salary. I have considered physical therapy because it combines everything I like, but for some reason PT doesn't jump out at me as something I'd love.

I’ve considered switching to finance, which is similar to what I’m doing now, but it feels like there are less job opportunities in finance than in analytics. Analytics seems more broad. I’m in an introduction coding class and it doesn’t feel like the right fit for me. I struggle with being taught hard skills like that."

Education: 1 year collage trades degree in computer networking.

Work experience: 5 years corrections. Previously a supervisor for a an inventory company (generated reports, managed time sheets, billed clients, organized crew ect.)

Family/mobility: Due to having a child soon and the proximity to family I would like to stay in my town and avoid travel.

Interests: Building &amp; repairing computers. cooking, video games, reading, Fixing things, Finance, Helping people

Personality: Very introverted

&amp;#x200B;

Some thoughts concerning a few jobs:

Policing does not interest me for many reasons even though it is a very common transition from my line of work.

Sheriffs are an option but I would likely get posted outside of my town.

Police dispatching would be a decent fit but the pay is less then desirable.

&amp;#x200B;

My current pay will max out at 66K a year with me currently sitting at about 61K. Hourly the pay is good at 36.79ish an hour but only 35hr weeks.

I'm in my first year of university and studying to become an engineer. This means I could get a safe job that makes a good amount of money after I'd get a masters degree. I never had much trouble in high school and I'm pretty capable of completing my studies if I put my mind to it
However, I've been finding it hard to give it my all and study lately because I don't see myself working in this market. I lack the passion for this major. Becoming an engineer doesn't feel like my calling. Even though my parents think I should keep on studying, my interests are in a different market.


You see, I started DJ'ing over a year ago and it truly feels like that's my purpose in life. The feeling I get from spinning records and getting feedback is just indescribable. I know this is a market that's hard to monetize, but I'm prepared to take a risk and follow this dream. It's no problem for me at all to spend hours working on my mixes, marketing or networking to grow. I'm always motivated to work on my DJ'ing because it's something I could do for the rest of my life and love every second of it.


I came up with a plan:
I would take a leap year, get a daytime job and work on my DJ career as much as I humanly can. If I don't make any improvents at all, I'd go back to uni knowing that I tried. If my DJ'ing would start to bring money to the table, I'd double down on it and see where it takes me.

What do you guys think? Every piece of advice is welcome! Thanks for your time &lt;3"

1,2023-01-12,What should I do to keep my life from falling apart?,u/lost1boy,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10agi12/what_should_i_do_to_keep_my_life_from_falling/,careerguidance,"Hi,

I'm 19 soon-to-be 20-year-old male from Eastern Europe, attending a college that I don't like (Economics) because I didn't get accepted into the only college I actually liked (Film School) because I didn't prepare well enough for the tests.

Exactly 4 years ago I landed a client for whom I would edit videos for YouTube, I just started middle school, earning money by myself, life was great, I was in my small town IT middle school, studied very VERY little - almost nothing.

Passed middle school with flying colors because of my basic coding knowledge and advanced knowledge in PC building and everything tech, worked with my professors, troubleshooting PC problems across the school, one of the professors assigned me to make HTML/CSS/JavaScript assignments and step-by-step instructions for my classmates, etc.

Moral of the my middle school story is that I didn't study 50 hours in total for 4 years. In my free time, I was focusing on editing videos and getting new clients.

4 years later, I still do editing and youtube channel management stuff for clients, on a bigger scale, but it's on/off, no constant work - no constant pay. Currently, I don't have any work, I have clients that put me on the hold, but at the moment nothing. I know it's typical for January to be a weak month for my work stuff, but that would be the only piece of mind that would steer me away from going crazy, and currently, I might be losing it.

I hate formal education, hate it. I have exams lined up starting in 10 days, I can't pass a single one, I don't know how to study for them, I don't know anything. The worst part is what kind of perspective I saw by attending college for a few months.

Without a degree, these college pricks will look down on you like you're nobody, doesn't matter if you have more skills or knowledge or if you're better than them in any possible category, except for memorizing and studying for the exams.

It's super hard to sit in a room full of people who only study and watch TikToks in their lives and you are the stupid one because you don't know how to memorize stuff but you're able to edit a movie and make money.

Haven't opened my soul to many people, just my mom and girlfriend, they don't understand me, and no one does. My parents say you're young don't give a crap about making money now or whatnot stay in school study then you will get a good job and be happy, yeah right. Probably you guys think the same, I'm too young to worry and stuff, but I can't live like this. I can't live like a parasite, like a bum, and waste time and money, and youth. I can't wrap my mind around the fact that I would need to live off my parent's back for 4,5,6 years until I graduate and become ""someone"".

I haven't asked my parents for money for 4 years, I didn't throw away money on stupid things, I've saved and invested into gear and used it for essentials. It's hard for me to sit in some apartment far away from home and just think about wasting my parent's money because they pay the rent/bills. It's killing me.

I'm working on getting myself a constant income with which I can shut up my parents and everyone around me that's passively making fun of me that I didn't get into the college I desired and everyone else did. But most importantly it would give me a piece of mind and mental security if that's the thing. I struggle with thinking due to this I don't know how to call it anxiety, or depression something is hitting me hard I don't feel mentally stable.

TLDR: I Freelanceed online across middle school years and now don't have the study habit, I struggle to operate in the college space because I don't like college, and hate the formal education while I can't secure constant income that will give me the courage to drop out and pursue my career. No one understands me, I'm very anxious and have a thousand things planned to do but my problems are in the way. I'm not too young to have this kind of problem skip telling me that.

I feel a tiny bit better."

I got hired with a very big healthcare company that I've wanted and tried to get into for so long and finally did. I had previously worked for them through a temp agency and I loved it and all the people I met. I was sooo excited to be internally hired finally. Fast forward to starting the job…..It's WFM call center..which I did not have previous experience in only F2F customer service. I thought it would be easier as WFM but I wrong..very wrong. Back to back calls all day, abusive members every other call if not almost every call and there was no support from upper management or leads who were supposed to be assisting but never got any help. I was crying everyday. My new hire group and people started dropping like flies. I lasted 2 1/2 months since my home situation is awful right now I live with way too many people who are inconsiderate of other peoples time or polite requests to keep it down while I was trying to learn/work. Which is not ideal for WFM.
They let me know that if I resign I can always be hired back just not with that department which I was MORE THAN FINE with. The NEXT day I had gotten a call and voicemail asking if I'd like to interview...for that SAME company but this was a job I had applied to months before the one I had just resigned from, it even showed me that the job posting was closed. So I was surprised that it happened so quick. This job is also call center just a different department. Which I had discussed with my bf and he asked me ""are you sure you want to do this AGAIN?"" I though it has to be better ..it's in person, full-time and I have a set shift, in person sups and management. Well it was the exact same thing. Throughout this whole year my dad has been very sick and on dialysis, my living situation as previously stated has been mentally draining. Call Center work has been the cherry on top of a s*** sundae. I just resigned today AGAIN. I do love this company but these departments were crazy micromanaged, disorganized and just the work itself mentally tapped me out within a few months. I do want to work for this company again just not call center, but now I fear that down the line when I want to apply in a different department for this company they'll see I resigned twice and won't want me anymore. I feel awful about it. I wanted to make it work so bad but I just am one of those people who does better with people in person. It's actually easier for me. Then with all the stuff going on in my personal life I tried not to let it seep into my work life but it did. I just need some guidance guys..some positivity maybe some reassurance I didn't permanently f@*$ up my chances of working for them in the future. Thank you to anyone who responds."

I've worked with my family retail business for 13 years. I pretty much ran the store from fixing the ballasts in the light system to ringing up customers, stocking to setting up display racks where ever I saw fit. I have no ""real experience"" aside from running the store.  I no longer work there and now have to find a new job. 

I'm considering 

1)car salesman, 
2)some position in the culinary field where pay is decent (50k and above), 
3)truck driver. 

I have 2 requests

- I'd appreciate if anyone could suggest to me any career paths I can start now at this age with basically no experience bc I'm trying to stay away from retail but at the same time, I want a realistic career I can begin right now all be it that I continue my work ethic and stay ambitious.

- I'd like to ask anybody who actually are in 1 of the 3 fields I mentioned above and could maybe offer a suggestion on how to go about achieving that position realistically at the age of 30 with no experience (I'm willing to start as high of a bottom I can get to and work my way up)  --- and also how you enjoy that field and what a typical work day is like for you.

I live in a low cost of living area. I'm 37 with a 14 months old son. My wife works as well but her job is demanding. Family time is important to me as I was raised by my dad and I want to be like that to my son.

I make $174k all in, company gives us 25 days off, 7 stat hols and 15 sick days a year. Medical benefits is the traditional plan with no out of pocket for my family (max co pay is like $4k). I don't worry about job security as I'm the only pseudo data analyst/scientist in my group. Coworkers are great and company benefits are getting better - they periodically roll out new ones (things have been better on that front since I joined). As a relative example, they approves and pays for courses and a master degree and I've been taking advantage of them (the degree will bolster my skillset - I have a accounting background but wasn't formally trained in data science and statistics so this will help, but I think (correct me if I am wrong) my pay is above a junior data scientist.)


I've worked for this company for 5.5 years due to me being the only support staff (my coworkers and boss's expertise are in different fields) my skill expansion has mainly been self taught. (Its also been a downside as I've had no additional coaching) My relationship with my boss is decent - at times I can joke with her and I feel comfortable sharing about my desires for development and promotion. However my development has not been a priority for her and I've had multiple discussions about it without any resolution or direction. It usually ends with her saying I'm doing great and I'm on the right track, just no promotion right now (although I don't think she pushes very hard). No clear path is discussed as well. Other people in different departments that started around the same time as me has moved up or switched roles. (My role is unique so no I can't switch departments)

The work itself is very basic, I'm not sure if I do even 25 hours of work a week. To be honest, if we turn the clock back 3 years (I.e. me when I was 2 years into this role), I can probably do what I do still.

I had some medical complications in the past, this company was very supportive (my department head and boss was also supportive), I was on short term disability for 5.5 months and they held my job for me. Due to my health I am also not looking to be in a high stress environment (no Tesla or hedge funds for me)

I feel like I should be happy, but If I must be honest, I am unsatisfied with the lack of career path and growth so far. On the other hand, as our company is expanding I think there are going to be opportunities down the line...Just I don't know if I would mentally last that long. I hate looking at LinkedIn because I would see XXX peer of mine has just been promoted or moved on to something bigger...While I've been in the same role (even at my prior 2 companies - I did 2 lateral moves and doubled my salary but no title bump) and just feel like I stagnated. There are days on the job that I just don't give a F. On the flip side I am too 'lazy' or lack the mental capacity to go to a new company and start over and forfeit all my sweat equity. I also value the low work stress as I can easily handle the work and treasure the time I can spend with my son. (Time is important to me). On good days I am thankful for my job and the lack of work stress. On bad days I am stressed about my job stagnation and frustrated about my movement. (One can argue my stress is self inflicted - maybe if I'm at peace and accept my stagnation I might be happier)

I would appreciate your advice. I provided a detailed account of my background as I feel that it's not a simple question of should I stay or should I go. I would also appreciate advice on how to come to terms with my job satisfaction. Thank you dear internet strangers."

I'm over the age of 30 and need to find a different career than computer science, as I currently am failing as a software dev (5th job that im underperforming in due to lack of programming talent).  

- Have a forgetful short and long term memory and forget things constantly.  Similarly I have poor analytical skills and foresight.  Barely squeaked by in college with at 2.92 GPA despite putting in a good amount of study hours.  
- I have never been good with my hands and don't have any hard physical skills. For example wiring and soldering things always confuses me and I have ruined electronics by trying to work on them myself.  Have been told that I am bad at doing physical work when I have done it.  
- People tend to dislike me, so highly social career paths (sales, management) are probably a bad fit. Although I try to be friendly and prepare well for presentations etc, I unfortunately have a very ugly sounding voice and am regularly told as such. People will tend to bully me into being quiet or say I have a dreadful voice when they hear me talking. Even when just briefly interacting with me, people will act disgusted (eg: going thru a drive-thru).  It's rough but true.  
- Have played music for 15 years, but still am bad and told that I am bad by people when they hear me play.  Despite putting in thousands of hours of practice and studying/knowing music theory very well (even advanced stuff), I am still bad.  Plus music is almost never a steady career path.
-  Takes me a long time to think.  Typing this post out has taken about 45 minutes so far.  
- My IQ has been tested at 114 measured by 2 separate, different style IQ tests, so I am basically just slightly above average in terms of raw intelligence.  Not bad but not talented.  
- I am also autistic and have schizophrenia.  This obviously doesn't help overall, although I dont find it to be a big deal, but have been recommended i could be eligible for disability if I wanted to.  But I want to earn more than that.
- At many jobs I have had throughout life, I have been called a dunce, dolt, moron, loser, etc by other people, due to poor work performance. Both white collar and blue collar jobs.  And this is despite not being lazy and generally trying pretty hard, putting in extra hours, etc.  
- I have had people tell me literally that ""he tries so hard but he just isn't talented"".  Other comments similar to this.

You may read the above and think that I am simply having a low self-esteem, but these are things I have been told by other people consistently.  Although I have a good overall feeling about myself, I must accept that your value is determined by other people for the most part.  I have currently never earned above 65K which I would be happy with but I am about to be laid off for underperforming."

The thing is, I have a ***Technical Assessment &amp; Pre Work*** in 2 weeks and I'm not sure if I need to full stack experience for my assessment and prework. So my main question is **..what can expect from this assessment/pre-work?  Has anyone experienced this type of process for a training program?**   


I am hoping it wont be as advanced as an actual Junior Full Stack position, but not sure if I need to cram in 2 weeks of non-stop learning before this testing. I have about 1.5 years of HTML, CSS (some basic JavaScript) and experience with Netlify, Git, GitHub, Bootstrap and have worked on a start-up for 2 years with Front-end and Back-end teams. 

They mention the training is designed to build tech talent at scale, with a commitment to bridge the IT talent and equity gap in communities. SO I feel somewhat safer that it is a training program designed to bridge the talent gap  


Students who successfully complete the program will interview to be considered for a full time opportunities on our team as a Jr. Full Stack Software Engineer supporting an enterprise partner.

I have a bit of a unique situation here – I'm a senior at a well respected U.S. university studying a major that incorporates both humanities and computer science – took courses up to discrete math and data structures. I'm also fully funded for as long as I am in a ""bachelors"" program with roughly $50k left in the bank that I can only apply to tuition and housing. After I graduate this semester, I can no longer use that cash. Might be able to be a bit cheeky here...

**Should I take another year (fully funded, 2 semesters,) of school in a CS post-bacc if it's fully funded, or should I take an online masters while I work ($8000 out-of-pocket, 2 years-time)?** I'd be forgoing a decent salary next year (TC: \~90K) but I know I want to be more technical down the line and I'm sure I could break into a better role if I had another year of school, either in engineering or product management. 

My background:

My major is mostly a pipeline into law school, and I decided I didn't want to go to law school a bit late. When I made that pivot, I took on a product management internship and really enjoyed my time, I'm taking another product internship this semester. I also have a job lined up as a cybersecurity consultant at a tier-2 consulting firm for the upcoming fall with decent work life balance. I also might be able to push the job a year out, but I'm sure I could find something better in that time. 

My end goals: 

I've enjoyed coding quite a bit, I'm not excellent at it, but I know I could improve if I fully applied myself for a year. I could probably get a part-time job in the area as I only need 8 classes for my post-bacc. I absolutely wouldn't mind being a software developer, but I'd rather be a technical product manager because it plays better into my strengths. I have experience so I could break into a start-up. My end goal is to be a technical co-founder. As a consultant, I could build domain knowledge while doing the graduate degree as well, or just find a better job this semester. I'm really at a loss and my career center is utterly useless. Would love all your help! 

Thanks so much!"

I am considering starting my own construction/contracting business in Sydney, Australia. I do not have much experience other than labouring and painting for about a year and working in an office for a few months at a construction company. I am starting university this year to study Construction management.

I really want to start my own business with my dad who has a carpentry background and does mainly handy man work but recently got his contracting license. As he does not speak English well and not good with the business side of things, he is happy to let me run the business and him work for me. I would plan to do any work I know how such as demo, painting, as well as my dad knows plus sub contract out any complicated work. I would not have much money to start up but my dad already has most the tools and van.

I would greatly appreciate any advice anyone could give me. Would it be unwise to start with such little experience or learn as I go and work my way up to bigger jobs?

Thanks in advance"

I work at a startup. The experimental side-product I have been working on for the past year is going to shut down probably, as reported by my manager. He said he will try to adjust us in some other team. 

Recently, I snapped at my manager for making us work too hard over the weekends and normal days to the extent the only time we would get time off is when we sleep. I didn't shout or sound sentimental, but words were harsh. Rational discussion worked though and he isn't pushing us more now. Not just because of I complained, but also there is no more need to. The sensitive customer deadline has been passed and we have delivered to the customer.

After that I had a normal 1:1 with my manager as usual. Now I see in my calendar that CEO has sent me invite for 1:1 meeting. I am getting a very bad anxiety, especially while considering above scenarios and keeping recession in mind. 

Should I ask CEO what is this meeting about? It will really help me enjoy the weekend. I asked my juniors in the same team whether they have received the 1:1 meeting invitation from CEO, but they haven't. I am the most senior engineer in this team though."

Truthfully, retail banking isn't an area I find myself building a career around. The industry gives me a nice safety net as, once done school, I can easily land a gig as a financial advisor for $60,000+ a year and slowly work my way up the retail ladder.
Although considering this, I have far bigger career aspirations.
Financial planning, wealth management, commercial banking and management related roles have all crossed my mind. Curious if anyone has any insights/recommendations they'd like to provide given my current academic and professional experience? | see many recommending IT related roles but truthfully I have never been interested in programming or any of that sort of thing.

I am suffering from extreme social anxiety from last couple of years. I have physics degree. I haven't gotten degree because degree clearance needs rote test of last twenty Quran chapters. It is one on one test.So because of anxiety I have not given test. Its been one year since I have got degree completed status but I have not gone through official process of getting transcript because of this issue. I was also getting training in Web development from a good institute. Technical training has completed and now we are going through job training period. Where we send proposals on upwork with sample apps. I have this issue from last two months that I take hours to create sample app and then I don't apply on upwork because I have to record video describing sample app. So I rarely actually apply and waste all the efforts It took to create app. From last two weeks I am using pills that doctor have suggested which helped me to go through this video recording part. I was genuinely getting better in making video. Then today I had live presentation in which I had to explain how I created one project. It was supposed to be hour long presentation .It is not for client but just part of our job training. I was having lot of anxiety so I took pills in double amount then suggested. Then I started to have nervous breakdown despite of that and I completely dissappeared from zoom class. So I don't have to give presentation.
My question is what job I can do that does not involve communication of sorts. I just do the work and get paid. Because this freelancing thing need lot of communication so It is not going to work for me. Suggest me options according to skills I mentioned.  Web development or Physics or something related."

Some weird things happened like I made a presentation for a meeting, was told it wasn’t good enough and to move the meeting to try again. When I re did the presentation I was told some tweaks were needed which I completed and sent over for review on the Friday. Monday morning I had an email with a further 30 changes needed, talking with my manager she asked me if I could make the changes in the hour I had before the meeting, I felt sick and said yes. She said I couldn’t and that she’s worked over the weekend to re do the presentation.

This was my last emotional straw, the job had ruined my mental health and I had nothing left to give so I handed in my notice. I start a new job in two days in a field I am qualified and knowledgeable in and love. But I’m scared of the past mistakes and feel like I’m just not ever going to be a good worker.

Has anyone else been in a similar position? I want to bounce back but it keeps haunting me and I want to put it town to just a job that wasn’t for me and I wasn’t happy"

I'm being interviewed in quite a big FMCG company. I've already been through two interviews and a test assignment, they always were getting back to me almost instatly (the same or the next day). After the test assignment (which I blew to my opinion, while they said it was quite good) they told me that they'd get back to me in January (all of this was happening right before the New Year).

So here's January (there were bank holidays here, so everyone started working on 9th of January). I contacted them on Tuesday asking if there's any update, to which the recruiter replied that they'll get back to me ""probably tomorrow"" and that there were no update so far. It's been two days and they still haven't contacted me yet.

The main reason for the last interview being shifted to January for me is that the person that would interview me the last was OOO until, well, January. Or at least that's what they told me.

I've applied through a career website. I've checked the position and it says it has been archived, meaning that they're no longer hiring or at least are not accepting new application for this position.

So what do you think? Should I wait until Monday or contact them today and ask them what's going on? My guess is that they made an offer to someone else and are waiting to see whether they'll accept it or not.

UPDATE: I reached out in a week and they called me back to say I didn't get the job. However, they mentioned that they'll consider me for another vacancy in the same team that they are negotiating to open. Not too sad as I'm employed so I'm not waiting for them and it was a cool experience anyway. Thank you everybody for the advices!"

I am a full time student but I have my share of working experience in customer service or marketing. I had to resign from my previous job due to a long university research trip. 

After that I decided it’s a good time to get a job again. I’ve found a promising one: an internship in the biggest bank in my country. They didn’t list the tasks I would be responsible for but I applied thinking it will be great because the bank is great. 

They were very vague when recruiting me, just saying I will be working closely with the clients and the employees and learning the basics of banking. After I signed the contract they finally said my job will be basically me standing next to the entrance and greeting clients and asking them what do they need. I was like uh, I thought I will be maybe learning banking. 
So now after working for two full days I’m basically just telling clients hello and printing out a number that the other worker will call and actually help them. The only thing I actually did that was useful was activate a card in an app for one client. Most of the time I was on my phone bored out of my mind.

My family is telling me it’s such a good opportunity for later and that I get paid for not doing much but that’s the thing I want to be useful and do something if I’m working. Greeting people when there’s legit a number machine is pointless. But I don’t want to seem like a quitter. I don’t know am I being unappreciative of this job? 

Would love your opinions and advice
Thank you

EDIT 1: Someone in the comments said I sound snobby 💀 I am sorry in advance, english is not my first language… I am not trying to sound this way, I genuinely just want to use the youth I have to get the best opportunities and I want to learn in any job or internship I have.

CV up-to-date and have been casually looking but thinking about ramping up new job search.

Arguments for switching:
- Current employer just had a laid-off. Morale is low and daily work is disrupted.
- Not expected to get my yearly bonus or raise for 2022 due to company performance.
- I don’t particularly feel appreciated, as I was hired as a data analyst but company culture seems to value soft skills much more.
- Manager denied the above to be the case, gave good reviews but rejects most of my suggestions.

Arguments against switching:
- Current pay is above market average so unlikely to find better pay at the same level.
- Hybrid work (WfH 2 days a week)
- Bad economy —&gt; fewer job postings and potentially layoffs with new employer.

I am actively looking anyway but any suggestions welcome."

Context: I joined a start-up last year as an intern. I had only intended to stay for the internship's duration by the end of which was hoping I'd have an offer from a more established company with well-defined roles.

 Anyway, I got promoted and now my boss wants to talk about my growth, signing up for online classes, that kind of thing.

I still want to leave though - I want to be less of a generalist and more of a specialist. Plus I walk on eggshells around them (major passive aggression). My plan was to stay till I hopefully receive another offer.

 If I tell them I want to leave, I'm screwed. If I take up these classes, I'm locked in. Before anyone suggests quitting, I can't. In my country, jobs are quite hard to come by if you don't come from privilege.

What to do here? Thanks"

I’ve got a loan on me so I need to be able to stay in the UK and look for work opportunities. I cannot afford to go back to India.

This has left me in a very vulnerable position because according to my university, I am neither a current student, not have I completed my current studies, which is so confusing and leaves me in a weird space.

Hope you're all well. I would like to ask for any advice or guidance from you all. I recently resigned from my job and is feeling a little burned out and lost at the moment. Any advice, suggestion, or personal stories on how you overcame similar issues are greatly appreciated! 

To try to sum things up as best as I can, since my college years I've been a bit laser-focused getting into the field that I was in (Psych grad, working in HR field). After graduating amidst the pandemic in 2020 and struggling to find a job for some time, I eventually landed an internship, which then continued to be a full-time job. I was in the company for almost 2 years, but after a while I realized that the job is not a good fit for me. I tried to hold on thinking I might just need time to settle in, but it led to burnout and it started to affect my personal wellbeing as well. Eventually, coupled with some unforeseen circumstances, I had to resign from the job earlier than expected, without any job offer on hand or even any idea on what else I want to do next. I honestly feel quite defeated and lost at the moment. And while I try to keep my mind positive, I can't help but feel anxious as well about finding a new job amidst the current economic situation, and a bit scared that I won't be able to find something that speaks to me too.

I guess I'm keen on learning from you all, especially those who might have experienced feeling lost after a career ""fail"": 

* How did you get out from that ""lost"" feeling? What were some of the first steps you did to find a direction to go to?
* What kind of exploration process did you do to find your next career? 
* What did you do to ensure that your next career actually aligns with your passions/purpose? (context: upon reflection, this is one of the reasons why I don't feel my previous role was a good fit for me)

Thank you very much beforehand for your advices, I really do appreciate them!"

However, it feels that although I'm trying to respect their opinion that I come across as unable to handle them or that even *I'm* the problem as why else would they get so worked up.

I'm unsure how to handle this as I have taken a very positive attitude and constantly praising them and generally reminding them that we have certain limits that we'd have to work around and I'm looked down on as the enemy. 

How do I strategically handle this, without undermining myself and still make active progress ?"

It is remote and pays 35K. I currently live at home and my biggest goal is to move out in a few months.

I NEED advice on my next steps...

Basically I have all this free time from now until I move out. So career wise should I focus on gaining additional certifications even if they don't pertain to my current field of marketing?

&amp;#x200B;

I love coursera and did the Google Digital Marketing certification and am currently working through their project management certification as well.

&amp;#x200B;

My rational is to gain more skills to potentially get a higher paying job, by finishing the project management cert, doing their IT cert, data analytics and advanced IT cert.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT is it even all worth it? As I now have a job and income, would it be a waste of time working on certs that would realistically get me just entry level jobs, as opposed to using my free time for other things than professional development, and set my sights on getting promoted in my current job?"

376,2023-01-13,Lost Everything at 31 - How to Start Over?,u/skanhunt8642,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10b120g/lost_everything_at_31_how_to_start_over/,careerguidance,"Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this.

I guess I’m writing this is mostly to get it off my chest. If anyone can relate, or has any advice for me it would be appreciated. 

So in a nutshell, I’m now 31 and I’ve lost everything. By everything I mean my mental health, my entire life savings, my home, and the love of my life. 

Back in 2016, I had my own business. It wasn’t given to me, nobody taught me how to do it, it was entirely on my own. I had made 100k in a year, profit. Most of it was cash so I didn’t have to pay any tax. Don’t judge me. 

I then invested in weed stocks right at the beginning, I doubled my money and held. Because my business died off because it was based on a temporary trend, I thought I would keep holding on until I made more. Long story short, the weed stocks crashed and I held until the end. Not only did I lose all my gains, I actually lost 97% of my investment. I had no money left. 

Fast forward to 2021 January, after a few years working for $16 an hour I gave stocks another go. I studied hard, and found a secret strategy that would eventually make me 150k in 2021. It involved pink sheet stocks exclusively. Great right? Well in September 2021 the SEC implemented a new rule where basically all the trash pink sheets had to comply with stiffer rules or get delisted to the black market where they can’t be bought. 

So guess what? I had to abandon my pink sheet strategy because all the stocks I would trade were no longer available to trade. So in 2022 January I figured I was ready for the big indexes. Little did I know we were about to face the worst bear market in history, I was also naive and overconfident from the money I had made. 

One month after another, I lost 10k, then 20k, etc. By May 2022 I had lost 80k. I then realized if I filed my taxes I would owe 45k, and they would be basically all my money gone. Of course I believed I could make back my money, so held off on doing my taxes. 

Fast forward to November 2022, I lost it all, through thousands of day trades. I thought if I stuck through I could turn it around. I really wanted day trading to be my lifetime career, I loved what I did for the first time in my life. 

So I got a letter from the government, demanding I file my 2021 taxes. So I went to my bookkeeper and filed them. I then found out I owed 61k. Late fees included. By November I had lost almost everything and only had 10k left, and owed 61k. On top of the fact I had lost 140k in a year I was ready to hang myself. The only option I had was bankruptcy. 

2022 was nothing but anxiety, depression, anger, and frustration. This of course, took a toll on my girlfriend of 6 years. During the whole year, she was there for me, she knew what was happening, she would do sweet small things like make me a healthy breakfast, force me outside on hikes, encourage me and show me love. She’s was sweetest soul in the world. And for the most part, I paid her back with neglect, because of my deep depression. 

I think she ran out of mental energy after the end of the year. I also hadn’t given her a ring in 6 years, I would change the subject or shut her down when she spoke about kids and marriage. How idiotic of me, I realize now. Selfish I was. It hurts and pains me to think about hurting her the way I did. 

In November she wasn’t herself, not being there emotionally or physically, I wrote it off as she’s just stressed like me. I confronted her late November in the middle of the night. And asked what was wrong, very long conversation short, she was done and wanted to pack up, move out and leave forever. 

For 6 years she was constantly in love, treated me like a king, would kiss me, love me, and cherish me every moment. She was faithful, hard working, honest. She gave everything she had to this relationship and frankly carried it for so long. What she said really stunned me. This was not something I ever imagined she could even feel. I realize what I did wrong. In my worst times I forgot about the people who really matter.

So it’s January 2023. Starting the year off with 61k debt, barely $10k in the bank, moved back home with my parents, with no means of making money, no education, no skills, no career. I’ve spoken to the suicide line almost every week because I just don’t think I have it in me to be successful anymore. 

My heart aches, and I feel a lump on my throat every time I think about her, how I hurt her, how I let her down, and the thought of me not being able to give her back all the good things she gave to my heart crushes me. I am covered in psoriasis, which I never had before, I used to be 200lbs jacked, I’m now 175lbs skinny, I used to workout 4 days a week, I haven’t worked out in 5 months. 

I genuinely want to die, I feel like a loser at 31 living with my parents, I have nightmares about the amounts of money I’ve lost two times over. I could have bought a condo without a mortgage if I had saved it. My girlfriend went from being the most loving soul to being a complete stranger. 

Sure. I could go work a labour job and make $25 an hour. But it would take me 4 years of full time work at a job I hate to get enough for a down payment in this inflated housing market. The average home where I live is 800k. And even then I’ll be 35.. pushing it a bit late to start a family. 

To anyone who actually read this whole thing I thank you, and I hope you take a lesson from this. If you neglect those who love you, you may lose them, and if you have something good, nurture it and take controlled risks. 

Thanks."

I’m currently applying to grad schools for a Master’s in Health Administration, something that I understand wouldn’t be covered by the company (which I’m fine with), as it’s something I’m extremely interested in and want to pursue over an engineering type career.

I don’t believe I ever signed a statement saying that I would explicitly go back to school for the company when hired full time, but used the education program as a reason why they should hire me on instead of letting my contract expire. Overall, I’m just wondering what/how I should tell my boss, and on top of that expect to be fired because of it? I’m just wondering how I should tell my boss to lessen the blow, and try to keep my job and benefits throughout my schooling.

I have a masters degree in business and I got my six sigma green belt about 6 months ago. I’m trying to find a better paying job with a better progression. I’ve been at the same company for about 10 years and I kind of want my degree to get me in a better job. I am currently working in the automotive industry.

I want to break out into politics. But I want to know what direction I should take that would lead me down that life path. At this point I’m trying to get project management roles that are as close as possible to political positions. Maybe someone who works underneath the mayor or someone in Congress. 

At the moment, I was told that I should get my PMP and Dispute Resolution certificate in order to bolster my resume. 

My questions are

1) is there a credible yet affordable recommendation for these two certificates?

2) should I get any other certificates to make myself more marketable?

3) what administrative positions should I look into applying to in order to put myself in the best position possible to achieve my goal?

1,2023-01-13,How to progress in my career when management keeps lagging behind?,u/kerfufflewhoople,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10b1mn8/how_to_progress_in_my_career_when_management/,careerguidance,"I work as a marketing exec in a startup. I joined a year ago, and I’m a high achieving individual with a considerable output as a copywriter, media specialist and community manager.

I work under a manager (let’s call him Manager) that is considerably younger and less experienced than I am. This doesn’t bug me in the least in theory, but over the past few months Manager has shown a noticeable lack of organisational and strategic skills. 

Example1: whatever I do in the job, I must submit it to Manager for feedback and approval. Manager hasn’t had the time to review anything I’ve done for months, so technically, nothing has officially come out of my pipes. I have followed up with him on multiple occasions, and he keeps saying that will soon, but he still hasn’t had the time. Other departments will then accuse me of lagging behind and not delivering. This makes me feel terrible, because it isn’t my fault. Manager is in these calls sometimes, but does not take ownership for the backlog, and makes it sound as if it was me that didn’t complete one of the steps. 

Example 2: Manager will give me a set of guidelines and I will do as requested, but during meetings with different departments, I learn that what I did does not match their needs. I will be accused of nothing doing my job properly, and again, manager will be there, knowing perfectly well that I did what I did as per HIS orders, but subtly twist things to make it sound as if it was me who had the wrong approach.

Manager is a nice person, and I don’t want to get him in trouble, but I am being seriously held back in my job and in my progress, and other departments risk seeing me as incompetent. I don’t want this to happen because I genuinely care a lot for this job and this company. How can I handle this professionally?"

I was doing simple tasks like getting to know the various projects in my job, and I got to work on a relatively simple one.

The past few months or so, I got moved to a difficult project. I'm still not sure how a lot of this works, and the application itself is a complicated one, to boot. I also got moved to another application, an old one that I needed to update, which is also a bit of a learning curve.

I'm really struggling to finish some of the issues or tasks I'm working on, simply because I don't really understand the projects. They seem way over my head and I constantly have to ask for help. I'd Google but I'm so stumped, I don't even know what to look up.

Additionally, my coworkers are busy, so it's hard to pull them aside to get help.

I'm panicking because it's 3 years in and I still don't really feel like I know much. I'd start applying for other jobs, but I'm worried that I don't have enough knowledge for the amount of years I was here, and I'll have a hard time finding a job because of my incompetence.

I think I'm getting exhausted and stressed because I don't understand what's going on, I'm having a hard time understanding even when I do get help to the point where I'm wondering if I'll ever understand. And then I get so stressed, my mind can't rest and it results in mental health issues and I think it's contributing to how unreliable and forgetful I am. And then I end up doing worse at work as well as at home.

Any advice?"

Today I was informed that a senior colleague of mine is leaving the company. This is a huge loss for our team, as they are individual with the most institutional knowledge of our company and industry.

I was recently scouted for a role by another firm, but I turned them down because I felt that the mentorship I’d receive from my current boss would be more valuable to my career long term. 

My colleague’s departure has me fairly concerned. It is the latest exit by a senior team member in the last year. In total, 6 senior colleagues left my team after there was a reorganization early last year where new upper managers took over.

I still believe my boss is a good potential mentor, but I am a bit concerned about the stability of my organization long term. The company that scouted me told me the offer is still on the table, and I am considering taking it as it is from a very stable reputable firm. My boss is just one person, and I am worried about another restructure happening which could make their potential mentorship pointless. Not to mention, my workload is going to get far more intense and stressful.

If I left, it would leave my boss in a bind as I work for a small team that would be even more short staffed, and would obviously be terrible timing. I am considering giving notice next week since I have a good offer on the table. It sucks, because I’d be totally blindsiding them so soon after my colleague’s exit. How do you guys think I should handle this situation?"

0,2023-01-13,I did not do well in my technical round. How much hope should I have?,u/CoookieHo,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10b4fae/i_did_not_do_well_in_my_technical_round_how_much/,careerguidance,"I had a technical interview on Monday for my dream job as a data engineer for a professional sports team. There were two technical portions, a python portion and a SQL portion. I work religiously with SQL but rarely with python. In preparation for this interview, I took a python bootcamp and felt pretty good about it, I also took two SQL Hacker Rank certificate tests which I passed and bought a book on data science that I studied. Needless to say,  I went HARD on the interview prep. 

Fast forward to the interview with the Lead Architect and the AD, I did the python question first for the interview. I'm not sure what happened, maybe it was the nerves, maybe it was the lack of sleep for the past few days, but I froze during the python portion, needed a lot of help, and was not able to finish the question. It wasn't a terribly hard question either, it asked to write a function to validate a unit test. I just think I was thrown off because of the nerves and I went into the interview assuming i'd be asked to write a logic based function like Coding bat or Hacker Rank. I did much better on the SQL end, I nailed that section, and answered all of their sql related questions.

After the technical portion, I asked thorough questions and gave a very passionate speech on why I would be good for this job and why it's my dream job, and I mentioned how I can learn coding continuously while on the job, but what I bring to the job is my work ethic and passion. I mentioned to them all of the resources I used to learn in my current job, and all the prep work I did just for the interview. They said they wished I had shown more aptitude during the python portion since they use it heavily, but agreed that it is something that can be learned and that I'm clearly very passionate about this job, and that I have a strong SQL background. I walked out of the interview not feeling great.

Later that night, I went ahead and decided to give the python question one more shot, without any stakes, and was able to solve it on my own. Once that happened, I emailed them a thank you email with my boss's and senior data engineer's contact info for references. and also told them I decided to give the python question a shot on my own to prove that I'm capable of coding in python. I sent them the code I wrote and explained it in detail to prove I knew what I was doing. I mentioned that this may not help my chances but I still didn't want to leave the question incomplete.

Anyways, the lead architect, who has been interviewing me and has been very communicative, always responding within the hour, has not responded back since I sent the last email. I'm not sure if I should cut my losses or if I should hold out hope. Other than this past Monday and Tuesday, they'll be in org meetings all week, and then they'll resume technical interviews next week, and will give me an answer the week after. I told my current boss about this (he knows it's my dream job and pushed me to go for it) and my senior data engineer, and they both agreed that I took good initiative writing a follow up email with the solved code and a thank you, and that they would at least expect the courtesy of the interviewers acknowledging my thank you email.

Apologies ahead of time for spelling and formatting.

I work in a semi-niche field within the theater industry. I was previously working for a local midwest company doing installations, programming, and training of theatrical equipment all over the US, but mostly around out local region of the Midwest.

I have a BA in theater, and have worked several summer internships and jobs at summerstock companys before I graduated. This was my first real job right after college however, and not what I saw myself doing forever, as I had wanted to really pursue working with IATSE or a full time production house possibly.

I ended up staying at at this company for 3 years working full time. During this time I went from a starting wage of $14 and hour, to $16 and hour after about a year. 6ish months before I left said company, my pay was once again increased, after me and the only other tech discussed our pay and both went and requested raises. At this time also, I went and interviewed with a rival company, and was offered a position that I turned down at $25 an hour. Both me and my coworker were given raises to $20 an hour.

My coworker soon left two months later for a position at a local performing arts center, and I was left holding the bag on a huge project that went sideways almost immediately. Due to this, I actively went job searching and got hired at a college as an instructor for similar pay but salaried. I however made an agreement to stay on as a temporary employee for $30 an hour with the old company. They have since given me a consistent weekly 5-8 hours of work a week. Which has been nice additional income for me and my wife.

It's been 6 months now and I'm unsure about my new job. I'm nervous as I'm teaching my first class starting next week and the hours and travel involved have not been great.

My old company now has asked what it would take to get me back. They have stated they recognize that I'm the only technician in the state who knows how certain software functions/programs, and that their current hiring of new techs hasn't gone well.

There are a number of personal and worked related reasons that I'm reluctant to even consider going back, that range from the stress I was under when I was there, to the lack of communication in managment. The fact that they seem to want me rather desperately, and the money would be a huge help to me and my wife must be considered.

I'm happy to talk in the comments more about the personal reasons, but I need advice on what to request if I do make an offer to go back? 

My old coworker who left said I should request $35 an hour with an increased match on 401k (previously at 3% with end of year profit sharing), but I don't think they would agree to that hourly. I'm unsure what I could request that would match that worth to me however, or what number lower then that I would trually consider worth it. Another stipulation I believe I would mandate would be that I must be given and trained to be a project manager, as I do not want to be a technician forever.

Please help, and thanks in advance!"

Today, I was offered different position at the bank. It comes with a nice pay increase as well as a great résumé booster. It was also talked about that I would take over as a chief officer when the current one retires in 3-5 years. My company has already promoted me a few times and has been very encouraging helping me work my way up the corporate ladder. The only problem is that my new would-be boss is a grade A bitch. I’ve seen her belittle fellow coworkers, talk shit about her employees, and give little to no direction on projects. I’ve worked with her on a few things, and although she is nicer to me than others, has treated me like an imbecile.

It started great because I was outstanding in whatever work I did given my industry experience, I could either solo or lead teams in projects and never miss a deliverable. After 2 years, the promotions are slow and I seem to be pigeon holed into whatever project needs staffing. My main motivations to leave are:

* Stagnation in knowledge, lack of autonomy/visibility
* Compensation progress
* Dislike general  staffing culture where people fake skillsets or CVs just to get staffed. General distance from colleagues since everyone is remote.

Trouble is, I am very unsure what my next role should be and how it would fit into a larger career path. Roles I am considering:

* **Tech Business Analyst Consultant at another industry (IT, Cloud, Finance)** \- I like the idea of learning a new technology and leading teams again with high visibility and impact. However I have been getting rejections, likely because my experience is largely in payments.
* **Functional Business Analyst** \- I am quite unsure of this since I seem more tech inclined but I am thought to apply for these to cast a wider net.
* **Product Owner/Product Management** \- Much like the BA role, I like the idea of being functional and tech focused. Though it seems very difficult to break into.
* **Project Management** \- This seems like a natural route to go for the cash and an easier life but my concerns are that I am not a peoples person and while I have done what PMs do, I don't have the actual PM title in my resume."

1,2023-01-13,Good enough reason to leave comfortable job?,u/Anxious_Hamster_3968,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10b7rbu/good_enough_reason_to_leave_comfortable_job/,careerguidance,"I was hoping to get your take on whether I am justified in leaving a job where I'm comfortable, content, well-paid and have a decent manager to pursue something similar but with more possible reach.

I am a 29 year old building services engineer in Boston. I work on a small team (3 of us) doing large, decent construction projcects. Recently I was headhunted and interviewed for a position at the local office of a large European firm. Their philosophies resonated with me, and the people and nature of the work really appealed to me. They have an innovative spirit and we really clicked on the interviews. The offer they gave isn't much more money, but significantly better benefits and the opportunity to do work out of other offices worldwide on much more diverse projects, with better continuing learning opportunities. I turned them down back in September but they reached out again, so it's now or never time.

I've felt sick the last week at the prospect of leaving my current manager. It really feels like a personal betrayal, since we worked really hard last year on some crazy deliverables and got reasonably close (have hung out outside work etc). My current firm is pretty social, and everyone is friendly with each other and since I've been there a while I'm in a position of mentoring new people and have a lot of hours flexibility. There's no one that I don't get along with and I know my manager will take it really personally if I leave. However the other place seems too good to pass up, even if I will have to start at the bottom again learning processes and getting up to speed on projects.

Is the prospect of working for a world-class organisation with the possibility of doing more innovative work and ability to do work in other countries worth leaving a comfortable position at a locally-respected company that has treated me very well, with a manager that I don't want to disappoint?

I'm grateful for any insight."

A bit about me. I'm 42, happily married, mother, small town midwest. I have a degree in English I didn't finish until I was in my 30s, but I'm very proud of it, and it has served me well.

I am a copywriter, digital marketer, etc., but I'm finding myself feeling very desperate for a change. I don't hate my work, but I don't feel the slightest bit fulfilled. I know that it's a privilege to even care about that, and I'm very aware of my privileges. Anyhow, I just...want something different. I sometimes wish I had learned a trade instead. I want to build something or make something or make something better.

I want to do something I love, at least. I'm good at what I do, but I don't love it. I love writing, but I never write for myself now that I do it for work.

There aren't a lot of volunteer opportunities near me to fulfill this need, either.

I don't need to make an amazing amount of money. My husband's job takes care of us enough so that we can survive, albeit without a lot of cushioning.

There has to be SOMETHING out there that would be good for me. I'm hoping maybe someone will just happen to have an idea that's inspiring. Or maybe someone else will find something in the comments that inspires them for their needed change.

Here are the things I'm interested in or passionate about:

Missing people (finding them, obvs, not losing them), advocacy for marginalized groups, antiques, fossils, stones, bugs (as a future food source!), history I can touch, animals, writing, reading, giving unsolicited advice, sitting on my ass and playing video games more than my 10-year-old, building a community, helping my small community in some way, libraries(!), genealogy, genealogy, genealogy, spooky shit, crafting badly, attention (from a distance), and simply feeling like something I did made something better in any small way.

Boring details. I really only need a career/job/talent that brings in 30k or so. I'll win the lotto for the rest later. :)

I hope you all find what you love or are already doing it!"

I feel like if I say no, it’s political and frowned upon..I do really well wrapping up others deals, somehow wow the world, and then I basically run to a different company bc I start panicking that my good reputation will be tarnished and they will Figure out I suck at sales.

I win awards, Im close or exceed to quota, etc. I’m not saying this to boast. I need to know how others feel. Everyone around me sees this proactive, perfectionist, willing to help 24/7 AE (and I am). The other side they don’t see is a person losing sleep/nights sweating bc they hate presenting, anxiety 24/7, exhaustion, and therapy. I don’t get excited to travel. I hate presenting. I hate having ZERO control of my schedule and doing the job of 3 people. The odd thing is when I’m inside, I enjoy it. I just hate being the guy and “on” 24/7z

Example- I have a large preso that I have to do in a month or less about a large deal. I’m terrified. I obsess. I’ll do well I’m sure but I’ll be in anxiety mode until it’s done. I get this way about QBRs, customer in person, all of it BUT I manage it and I make more than I ever thought.

Do y’all Think like this? Do I keep going and do what I fear? I know I need therapy and I go lol. Just not sure I’m AE material OR if it’s normal for a sales gal/guy to feel this way. And this is not a poor poor pitiful me post or me wanting sympathy. That ship has fucking sailed. I do my shit and get shit done but I need other’s opinions on if this is normal and sticking with it or if it’s time to go back to something chill when I got kiddos and a life lol"

Literally open to anything that makes decent money, ideally 6 figures which I know might be unrealistic. Some things I’ve been thinking of doing are go to college to become a massage therapist, teachers college to become a teacher, or become a pharmacist if my
marks allow me to. I also have thought of opening a business a carpentry trade that I currently am working in but it feels bad not using my degree. Either way I’m open to any suggestions, college would be ideal or anything that my degree will give me an advantage in."

However, I have always wanted to be a quant, I just find the role so cool and I’ve been interested in it since freshman year of college. Unfortunately, I was never able to get an internship or anything in the quant field due to my school not being a target and my GPA not being up to par for the school I’m at. This past application cycle, I DID get a couple of quant offers, but they both weren’t feasible for me given their location. So, I ended up taking this consulting internship which, don’t get me wrong it was cool, but my mind is still wrapped around the possibility of being a quant. 

So, with ALL of that background. Do you think I should turn down the full time offer and continue to apply for quant stuff, or should I just take the offer and be happy with what I got? Thank you!

Currently on unemployment after being let go from a job in the trucking industry and I'll detail my issues below.

Where to start? I've always had a pretty passive personality but around age 30 I went through enough depression and anxiety about this to try to turn this around. The good news is I have become more assertive and learned to stand up for myself, but I became hypersensitive to any small thing that may lead to someone bossing me around to the point that ""Let me know"" was a problem. I've since worked on this issue with family support and have done better about not letting social things bother me, but it's a work in progress and I get highly stressed working with other people. 

I can't afford therapy now but I've noticed at my last few jobs after a couple years I get burnt out with work and am more willing to challenge management on issues I disagree with, and this has gotten me fired before. I was reliable, showed up on time, etc... but if I felt like I was doing something immoral, unethical, or being screwed over by supervisors or co-workers, I let them know. Following my heart is a problem since imitating Gandhi or MLK doesn't pay the bills.

I have a Communications degree and was dead set on being in the radio/media field, but being a public figure was really stressful and being more on the introverted side didn't help me. I was fired from a TV station for production work and two radio stations for on-air work.

I also have a Spanish degree and am relearning it on Duolingo so trying to be productive with my time even when out of a job. I've done fast food, janitorial, grocery store, gas stations, sub teacher at public school, post office, and many more.

My last job was a bad fit, fast paced corporate environment full of ex cons and Type A personalities. Confrontation and competition was also encouraged by management, so I toughened up but was glad to be gone after a couple years there.

I'm in my mid 30s and am trying to figure out how to succeed at work, have never advanced beyond entry level at any job, and I've had a work to live mindset like ""do my 40 hrs and go home"". Hobbies like guitar and working out have helped, but they also don't pay the bills.

Long post but this has been on my mind and would please appreciate advice on succeeding at work after a lot of failures."

Or would you hold off and wait for the right opportunity?  


After being laid off from my company whom I was with for 9 years, I find myself again in another agonizing job search.  At my prior job, I was getting paid pretty decently, and had the luxury of working from home, as my company was in a different state. When I say I was paid ""decently"", I was being paid a salary fitting for the cost of living in a northeastern state where I recently moved from, compared to the salaries in the southern state that I recently moved to.   


So anyway... I am looking to get back on my feet with a job again.  I received a hefty severance, so I am not in a rush financially.  However, this sitting at home all day is getting very old and tiring, and driving me crazy, and causing tension between my girlfriend and myself, as I am finding I am leaning on her to help be the bright spot in my life, which isn't fair to her at all.   


Cutting to the chase... I have received some interest from recruiters and hiring managers at local businesses to whom I have applied for their jobs.  The pay compared to my experience is so much lower, and I would not want to take a job full time and prevent myself from days during the week with which to keep interviewing.   


I am getting to the point where I might just take any job offered... one, to get me out of the house and doing something productive.  But also because I need health insurance to continue with medical appointments that I had to put a hold on when my insurance lapsed (I am still within the COBRA election window should I need it).   


If you were in a similar position, would you take a position with a business, knowing that you might end up screwing them over and leaving them should something better come along?  Or would you hold off and wait for the right opportunity?"

I recently graduated with a degree in Recreation and I'm hoping to eventually get my SUDP certification and MSW. Currently though, I'm really struggling. I spent six months trying to apply for jobs, before settling on the only one that stated that they wished to hire me. The issue is it's through Americorps, which pays dirt cheap. I decided to go through with it, but after doing training for it and then having my first day in person (really in almost three years), I broke down. I had a bad day (in which my supervisor shared some really personal stuff with me, which I don't really know them and it made me triggered and uncomfortable). But I also noticed how much the lights, environment, everything, etc. Was so overstimulating and overwhelming for me. I have been doing everything online (including work) since lockdown started so it's a lot for me. But basically, I'm considering just seeing it gets better in the next month, but I'm also just thinking of looking at different positions. The issue is that when I apply I usually get interviewed and not given the position. I feel like I'm good at interviews, but English is not my first language and of course, I stutter a little bit, or slur my words. So I don't even know if it's worth the effort. Does anyone have any advice or tips? I just feel really sad and lonely, but unsure what to do, especially as I don't really have any other individuals in my life that would be able chat about this (and I can't afford to see my therapist atm sadly). Thanks and I hope you're having a good day :)"

So, I am currently in the process of interviewing for new positions, and will likely have an offer soon. I've been at my current position just under a year, and I am leaving because I don't feel it is a good fit for me. With that being said, this company did provide a bonus and relocation with a stipulation that if I leave prior to a calendar year, I have to pay it back. I am less than two weeks from my anniversary, and by the time I would give notice, it would likely be around a week away. That would put my final day after my anniversary if I work that last two weeks.

My concern is this - is there still a way I could be roped into paying this back? How likely is the chance they would dismiss me before two weeks and force me to pay things back? Any advice how I should approach this?"

Hose clamp is a product widely used in all kinds of vehicles.

Along with my experience in operating Special Purpose Press machines named BMS, Ingyu &amp; Finzer; I also have knowledge and experience in solving of problems related to the process of production of hose champs. I'm good in 8D Problem Solving. Problem Solving was given to me as additional responsibility by my manager.

In nutshell, in last 9 years I have learnt only 2 skills viz :- 1. Operating the machines BMS, Ingyu &amp; Finzer. 
2. Problem Solving using 8D methodology.

But now when I'm searching for new job, I'm never shortlisted. It seems probably the skills that i already have are not enough. 

So, I have decided to learn new skills. As I'm working in production department, of an automotive company; I wouldn't like to know what are the new skills that are highly required in the Automotive/ Auto Ancillary industry???"

My big concern is that I have chronic kidney stones. I've seen doctors, had the stones analyzed, etc., and basically I'm stuck with them. There's nothing dietary etc. I can do to prevent them there's no medicine I can take. They're unpredictable, so I could go years between having one, or it could be a month since the last. 

I'm pretty sure this isn't considered any sort of disability, so it's not covered under ADA...? I don't even go to the ER unless I'm out of pain meds, because the stones have always passed without any intervention, as they're thankfully not large (by kidney stone standards, they feel like spiky watermelons). It's just a day or two of debilitating pain.

My current employer is understanding. They don't require that I provide a doctor's note, or that I use my PTO. It's honestly the main reason I've stayed with this company despite paying less than industry standard. I'm worried it will be a reason to not hire me.

I was wondering if anyone from California has pursued an LMFT/SW with an ABA master's degree recently. Did you have to take supplement classes at A JC or get a new master's degree?  

I tried looking on the board website and it's not quite clear so I tried contacting the board to clarify. However, after several months and several unanswered emails, I've gotten nowhere so I figured someone on Reddit might be more helpful. I also didn't want to pay their fee to apply just to be denied if they're something I can do.

I don't know if they'll allow me to complete some psychology classes at a community college or if they're very strict and want a specific degree.

I appreciate any information you may have!"

Started off as a graduate engineer assisting leads on new products and now have had the chance to be lead engineer as well as solution owner (responsible for any technical plans and solutions) on one of our products. 

Lately I’ve been very intrigued by trying something different in the more business oriented aspects. For context I really like learning about businesses and am very interested in investing and capital allocation, pretty much every free minute I have is spent learning about companies and their business models. Strategy seems like an interesting field to me but I don’t have any experience in that other than my curiosity. 

I am wondering what would be the best path from where I am to where I want to be I.e. strategy developer or someone making decisions for where the company deploys capital. Just want to hear from others in strategy or similar roles what kind of education/experience they needed to be in that field? Should I try getting an mba ? Should I take a bunch of online courses in strategy/operational excellence? Should I find a junior position in strategy that would give me the right experience ? Thanks in advance."

I have a bit of circumstance complicating things. I’m a bio grad with a BA working as a cannabis cultivator. I have two going on three years of experience in my field, and I seem to be doing well at my company which is a startup in its infancy (year 3 since start) considering I’ve only been at this company 6 months. My concern is the pay ceiling. It would seem mid tier managerial positions pay what I can only dream of making at this point (50k-80k) but my concern lies in getting these jobs takes a minimum of 5-10 years experience usually. And I don’t have the best of luck getting promotions throughout my working career (I’m 26) I’m worried that despite being told I’m about to be my bosses right hand man for this coming outdoor season that I’ll find a way to fuck it up (because I can hardly stay sober and perform at 100%) i already seem to be surpassing my equals despite having been at the company less time than them, but that could all be a facade. Being led on potentially I mean. Then again my superiors seem to trust me with a lot more and managing my own projects involving multi thousand dollar budgets. So I guess I’m just concerned I’ll never ascend here and if my efforts are better spent searching for other jobs I might be qualified for at other companies with higher pay ceilings, effectively leaving my chosen industry. I love what I do, but I can’t be a bottom dog forever. Coming from being my own business owner before COVID, it’s killing me. I’d rather make more money than love what I do? Am I crazy? I feel like I’m way over qualified for my job, I’m told my communication skills are what hold me back by my boss hence why I’m trying to get sober."

My immediate team is great, the general culture of the company is great, and the company is doing very well so I've had numerous pay increases over this time. I started there in 2020 just before going into lockdown, so for a lot of 2020 and 2021 we were forced to work remotely and I did well doing so. I also exercised more and lost 10kg.

I'm close to being promoted to an Adviser role where I'll start to be responsible for my own clients rather than assisting my manager with their clients. The promotion is imminent, although I've been asking about it since mid-2022. The manager is also expecting his first child in late April, so there would be an expectation for me to step up by then to fill in for him. 

There is a culture of high performance and an expectation that advisers network with other professionals to build referral partner relationships for future client growth. It is also expected that say you spend 2 hours in a day networking, you'll make up that time for client work elsewhere (I.e. Your own time). Currently the arrangement is 4 days per week in the office 1 day WFH, and my commute ranges from 1-1.5 hours each way, so a total of 8-12 hours commuting each week. I don't exercise as much due to the commute and time demands of the role so have gained weight. 

My immediate team is small of 4 staff including me (4th staff member only just started a few weeks ago) and I've felt like I need to do a lot of Admin work on top of Client-facing work due to the volume of work we have. Our processes are very manual which adds to the inefficiency of having a small team. The overall company is 50+ staff members and they're quite established, with my current team being a newer and smaller part of the business. 

Late last year I was contacted by a recruiter for an Adviser role at a different company which would be an instant promotion. While I hadn't been looking, it looked appealing due to the company being 100% remote and the adviser being required to do client-facing only and no Admin. I could move interstate and still work for this company if I wanted given there is no physical office, and they have team members in multiple Australian cities as well as in the Philippines. I also knew about the company and that they'd gone through exponential growth (a team of 9 at start of 2022 to a team of 26 currently). I've done 2 interviews (second one on Tuesday just past) and they've already sent me the employment contract, although they also know that I was happy at my current company and that I'd like to see what a promotion would look like there so I can weigh up both options. There are no other candidates at the moment as it's a specialised role, and so it's been more of a headhunter/2-way interview process in that they've also been trying to convince me to make the leap. While it is a promotion in role and title, the salary package is about $5k less than my current package, although they said this would be reviewed in 6 months after probation. They also said there would be no requirement for networking as they have so many leads coming through that it's not required or expected of advisers to do this. They have been very transparent with me and have clear processes in place for everything. 

I arranged a time with my current manager on Thursday to ask about the year ahead and when my promotion would be happening as I had been approached by a recruiter about an adviser role that looked exciting. I didn't mention that I'd gone through the interview process yet as I just wanted to see how he'd respond to me without making it confrontational. He said it would be happening shortly but couldn't give a clear timeframe as he needed to discuss how clients would be transitioned over to me and what the role would look like. I mentioned concern about support for the team we've still had to do so much Admin work, and they haven't already begun hiring for someone to fill my position if I'm promoted. Again, couldn't give clear answers other than they'd budgeted to hire an Associate in February and that this would happen. He asked if I was promoted there would I still leave, and given I'm still undecided I said it would take an amazing opportunity for me to leave. 

I was a bit frustrated as I know he needs to seek approval from above for any decisions made, and there isn't a clear timeline for when things will happen. Yesterday he acted as if things were just going to continue as normal as if I would still be there months down the track, and it doesn't appear as if he's spoken with the directors of the company about being concerned about my loyalty. Whether he's been oblivious and unable to read between the lines or just didn't know how to respond to the situation, I'm not entirely sure. 

On Monday morning I will need to be upfront with him about having received a job offer as it doesn't seem like anything will happen urgently with the promotion unless I'm direct. But I'm not sure how I should approach this given I'm unsure whether I would stay even if they made a counteroffer? I would at least want to give my current company the opportunity to show me what the adviser role would look like as I had no intention of working elsewhere until I started interviewing for this new company. I didn't realise my grievances with my current role until I went through the interview process. 

It's essentially a case of Company A (current) vs Company B (proposed). 

Company A:
-Likely higher salary although not sure when promotion is happening 
-Security having been there already and knowing what to expect
-More additional work required due to smaller team and manual processes
-More commuting
-Less work/life balance due to commute, work expected and networking 

Company B:
-Lower salary at least initially
-Instant Promotion 
-Going into a new work environment
-More support giving me time to just focus on client-facing and not Admin
-Established processes increasing efficiency
-No commuting
-Better work/life balance

I feel like Company B really is the better move, but I also have the concerns with not wanting to let my current team down, the salary and going into something unknown. 

TLDR: How to approach my manager on Monday about having received an appealing job offer?"

The job pays $15 hr at first, then a $1 inc after 90days,  10 hrs a day, it is only 22 min from my house, I would be able to get a AKC wellbred beagle after 6 months for a very reduced rate or free if it is older, and it is a 1099 employer so I will have to figure out my taxes if I decide to work there. The only thing keeping me from saying and enthusiastic yes is it is 70% health and wellness (vet tech) &amp; 30% kennel tech based for the first 3 months. I have hip issues at least 2-3x a week and have been trying to get away from physically strenuous jobs so I don’t hurt myself and from the kennel tech based things I did the other day I’m not sure I’d want to do that 2-3x a week considering most of it is outside work. 
The other job is caregiving, it pays $15 hr, 12 hr a day or they have a in home part of the job where I would stay at a clients house for up to 3 days and that pays a bit more. It is a W-2 employer with bonus pays once a year and the usual health based pluses (although I don’t know if they’d even be affordable for me or not).
The only thing keeping me from saying yes to this job is I would be doing plenty of driving from place to place and while they offered to pay for mileage (sometimes) if I drive more than 35 miles somewhere I’m not sure that will be enough. I also just don’t have as much experience in caregiving as I do with animals and would be quite sad if I got hired then didn’t like the job as much as I thought I would. As you can tell I have a heart for caring for all people and species so finding a job that includes that and pays well with good benefits is hard. Does anyone have any advice for me?

I am a recent grad and I got a job at a multinational investment bank about three months ago as a data analyst.  I really enjoy my job and the work, I get paid decently well, especially as a new grad, and I have a good relationship with my manager.  I think that it is important to note here that he is relatively new as well, as he began only a few weeks before me, and he came from a different bank that expected high efficiency and long hours (ie Elon's hardcore mode).  He is really advocating for me, such as inviting me to meetings with influential people within the org and allowing me to get exposure to different parts of the business so that I can understand what happens at different levels.  This is helpful for me because I do not know what I want my career progression to look like just yet.

This position is an hourly position wherein my set hours are 8-12 and 1-5, and I must work a 40-hour week in order to keep benefits.  During November 2022, the team was slammed with work, and so I was allowed to take as much overtime as I needed.  Today, though, my manager told me that I have to keep overtime below 2 hours per week, with 3 hours being a hard maximum. 

Currently, my work schedule has me already hitting at least 2 hours of overtime per week.  I routinely work an extra 1.5 hours per week because I have meetings one day beginning at 6:30am.  I always have at least one other meeting per week that is before 8am; sometimes the meeting is at 7am and other times at 7:30am.  Sometimes, I am expected to come back from my lunch break early, leading to another 30 minutes of time on the clock.  My manager has a tendency to send tasks to me in the afternoons that need to be done urgently either by EOD or by the end of the next day.  During our conversation today, it seemed that he was implying that, moving forward, I don't log hours after I've worked 43 hours in a week.  I don't mind working overtime, but I do not think it is fair to expect me  to work for free, especially because the company brought me in as an hourly worker eligible for overtime.

Thus, I'm wondering how I should navigate a conversation about this with my manager.  I think I should to talk to him and establish clear working hours for myself to comply with his expectations of my overtime.  However, I don't want to ruin our good relationship or give him a reason to stop advocating for me.  Do you think I should even talk to him?  What would be the best way to go about this?"

(Web Developer),u/tercet,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10bfjw3/how_to_handle_a_large_job_gap_due_to_poker_web/,careerguidance,"So I have been a web developer on and off over the last ten years since college (5 years exp, 2 jobs of 2.5 years) and I have a 5 year gap since my last job ended amicably (Jan 2018). During the gap I played poker as a primary source of income and was fortunate to travel a bunch.

During my break I did some web dev classes, projects, tutorials to stay up to date and not fall behind skill wise. By my account I am a an intermediate level developer, and I’m definitely asking for under market salary wise in my applications.  I have gotten some interviews, probably like 10% callback/screener ratio which is ok, but honestly I thought it would be higher over the last few months.

My question / dilemma is how do you guys think I should handle the gap on my resume / cover letter? On my personal website and cover letter I mention poker briefly, but perhaps I need to add it in more detail and even add poker to my resume?

My fear/thought right now is that some hiring people just see the 5 year gap and instantly toss my resume/application aside, hence my thought of mentioning poker more in detail on my resume.

What does everyone think and how should I handle this interesting situation?"

Always. Lets say someone is facing an issue with Microsoft word(just an example), I can always find the solution to that problem, either by digging into its menus or by Google-fu (which I'm very good at). It can be any software, given enough time I can almost always solve the problem.

Another example, Autocad was not working on my dad's PC. It said some .dll files were missing. So I did a Ctrl-F on the PC and those .dll files were present in another location. I just copied them into the installation directory of Autocad and got it working.

To give you another example, my boss had given me a repetitive, time-consuming task in Microsoft Excel. So I Googled ways to do it faster and came upon ""macros"". I had never heard of them earlier. So I simply strung together multiple macros taken from the internet and hacked them to automate the time-consuming parts. I guessed I saved 2-3 hours for all my team mates.

To give you yet another example, my teammates refer to a website called Sattista for information like market numbers, charts etc. However, once they access an article from that website, they are blocked from viewing a second article unless they take a paid subscription. So with trial and error, I realized that simply restarting the web browser allows you to view as many articles as you want from that website.

So how can I describe this skill in my CV or interviews? I mean what do I even call it? Can I call it troubleshooting?"

They call it manager but I'm more like a supervisor or ""the guy that checks if you are actually working and has to snitch to upper management"" and on the daily I have to defuse understandably disgruntled and motivate unmotivated employees. It's taking a toll on me and I kind of hate it.

I would like to move to a more senior position (an actual manager that can do something) but realistically speaking that's gonna take at least 2 more years.

Now have the opportunity to change job and join a better company. The money would be slightly less and I would be an individual contributor again, in a few words it's some kind of ""high level"" customer service with good pay and fully remote, which is nice.

Growing  in my current company would be good but Im getting more dissatisfied every day. Also my job history before I joined this company is irrelevant, and I heard that not changing places would make my resume look weird or fake in the future.

All considered, do you think this change is worth it? Is my experience as supervisor/manager gonna matter at all in the future if I go back to IC in another company or I will have to work another 5 years to move up?\*

BSc Nursing is a three-year undergraduate program that prepares students for a career as a registered nurse. It is a popular choice for students who are interested in the healthcare field and want to make a positive impact on people's lives.

The [nursing program](https://dmimsu.edu.in/about-srmmcon) includes classroom instruction, laboratory work, and clinical experience in a variety of healthcare settings, and provides students with the knowledge, skills, and hands-on training they need to become effective nurses.

However, it's important to note that to be eligible to enroll in a [BSc Nursing program in India](https://dmimsu.edu.in/about-srmmcon) , students must have passed their 12th standard with Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and English as subjects and should have scored the minimum percentage as required by the nursing college or university.

It's also important to consider that the nursing profession can be physically and emotionally demanding, and requires a commitment to patient care, compassion, and the ability to work well under pressure. If an individual is not suited for the profession, they may find other career paths more fulfilling.  

Other healthcare related fields such as, Medicine, Physiotherapy, Occupational therapy, Medical laboratory technology, etc are also an option for students who are interested in healthcare but not necessarily in nursing.

BSc Nursing is a good option for students who are interested in the healthcare field, have the necessary qualifications and are suited for the profession. It's important to research and consider your own interests, career goals, and personal circumstances before making a decision. It's also important to research the curriculum and the structure of the program that you are interested in."

Most of the time they try to bend the truth or somehow overestimate themselves .
All and all they are just trying to overshadow the truth through ill tactics and sometimes just do that unknowingly.


I hate these things, it used to happen in my previous company a lot.
And i believe the majority of the corporate world is like this.
But anyways I don't care.
The only thing besides this is i know I can teach in some University or should I quit and become a monk.

It can't be that the only way for me to progress in this field is through paying money to work, I feel really discouraged as I worry even if I managed to pay for one of these experiences I would end up back where I started.

I'm 26 with no degree and I want to start saving for retirement, so something that's full-time eligible and *secure* would be great. If it's applicable to the nonprofit sector too, I'd especially love it. Grant writing, customer service, virtual assistant jobs, etc.

I am really interested in programming. I have learned a lot of java (not spring) and have made a few android apps so I know a bit of xml.. 

I was already thinking of ways to bring some programming into my job so I've been learning vba as the role is heavily excel-based, dealing with data and creating reports etc.

My question is has anyone got any experience with this kind of thing? Would a data analysis/scientist route eventually get me to a software engineer type of role? Should I go the route of quality management system engineering?

I  went into work today and tried to work productively until I was called  into a meeting (about 1.5-2 hours into my day) with my boss and another  employee (that has literally no management title, nor are we in the same  ""department""). My boss opened with ""I wish you had waited until today  to discuss this with us rather than calling on Friday"". I simply  replied, ""I wish you had spoken to me and given me a performance  coaching rather than post my job online."" She went onto to say that she  understood I felt disrespected, and I replied, yes because you  disrespected me.

She and this  other employee went onto list things that they felt I didn't meet the  mark at. All of which, were untrue and inaccurate and I countered as  such. They went onto to complain that I asked a co-worker too many  questions... which ""was good but no one should have to answer your  questions by this time"". I countered that I had no proper training or  job description. At this point, I realized it was a mute point to  counter anything further. I informed my boss that it wasn't fair to my  coworker to have to keep retraining people the best she could, and next  time they should council if there was  a small issue with someone that  is ""smart and capable"" like me.

Yes,  they told me they knew I was capable to complete my job tasks, but  decided to twist it on me and said they were letting me go because it  doesn't seem like i want to be there, again untrue. They requested I  stay until the end of day tomorrow, but I declined and left at lunch  today. They're still paying me the week and my letter states I was  terminated due to not finishing my probation period or whatever.

My  coworkers were really upset and some said they were absolutely  disgusted. That they've seen a lot of people come and go and know I  didn't deserve this.
I have a few bites that I will follow through with on my job search and I hope I get something soon. Thanks for the advice, all!

----- 

Yesterday morning, my friend sent me a job listing that was exactly the same as my job. I’m within my probationary period at my job but have actively streamlined communication processes and overall made a lot of day to day operations a lot smoother. I’ve been met with nothing but compliments from my bosses and coworkers. There are a few coworkers that enjoy micromanaging duties and talking down to me, but I’ve done my best to do my best to work with them.

I’ve asked if anyone needed help when I’ve had nothing to do, etc. I was with my last employer for 5 years. I’m college educated and know what I’m doing and do what I do well. 

When I saw the ad, I called my boss (owners), on my lunch break, to ask them about it. They misheard me and told me to definitely follow a new opportunity (with excitement). I explained again that it was the ad for my job. To which they said that they were very happy about a lot of my talents, but there were a few things that get pushed on the wayside and that we should talk on Monday. I asked if they thought I needed to seek a different opportunity, and they said yes.

I have never been fired or ever had any issues like this with a job before. I came here because the money was a lot people and they made it seem like there was a lot more growth. My first day I organized employee fires and saw how bad retention was and how much they dispose of employees, with no thought. I gritted my teeth and tried to not think about it. I was never provided with actual training or clarification of my duties, even when I’ve asked. I’ve witnesses several meltdowns from the owner towards employees, business partners, and customers, even threatening to sue them. They’ve gone through countless people in my position, and are never happy. I’ve asked coworkers what they think may be the problem, and they were upset about the news and don’t know. The only thing I can think of is when I politely tried to explain to my boss that something he was doing and asking me to do was upsetting customers and we should figure out a better way to handle it in the future. 

I got into a really bad car accident and still came into work the next day and have not missed a single day. Even with them knowing my injuries, they still asked me to complete tasks (like deep cleaning and scrubbing the fridge and selves… etc) that aggravated my injuries further but I still did it.

I’ve started seeking different opportunities but am scared as I’m the sole provider for my family. I’m seeking advice on how to handle this conversation on Monday, especially when I know this opportunity is dead for both parties.

Edited to add: When I was hired, the girl I replaced was fired after they sent me an offer letter. They did it behind her back, and never brought me to the office to interview. Which now I see as the biggest red flag ever."

Got through the background check and salary analysis and was about to receive the final offer when I suddenly got an email from the hiring manager saying that they realized the grant had run out of money and they would need 2-3 weeks to secure more funds for the position. Manager seems to think this will be granted without any issue. He said he was “90% sure the additional funds will be approved”

It’s a weird situation as I have no clue how they could offer employment to me without knowing if they had the money first. Very strange. 

Anyway, I’m disappointed but it’s an amazing opportunity so I’m willing to hang on for another 3 weeks if that’s necessary before getting the final offer. Is that crazy? Is this a red flag?

I was privileged enough to attend the European comparisons to Ivy League universities, but always worked within the start-up environment. All certificates are great and shiny, won prizes and medals and all the “Tamtam”. My last job was my own company that I founded four years ago. The startups went from failed to well to okay.

I am 30 and a little bit worried because I do not have a linear career or niche expertise. My self-esteem, for that reason is rather low which might impact my possibilities. That is why I might consult somebody, also to find something fulfilling, because I have literally no clue how the corporate world’s jobs are. 

My background is in healthcare and business. My previous roles were COO/ CEO/ BD. Yet, I also hold a Masters degree in design and enjoy business roles less because I believe to learn more new things within the creative space. Would also love to learn more about video production..

Happy to hear any other recommendations and advice."

1,2023-01-14,Advice on recruiter behavior?,u/del_escorpion,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10bwfop/advice_on_recruiter_behavior/,careerguidance,"Hi, this situation is probably something normal that I'm just out of the loop on or overthinking. I am a moderately experienced job seeker embarking on a new job search for the first time in about 5 years, and I am noticing a trend I haven't seen before. 

For every 20 applications I submit, I get 1 interview (which is expected, see context below.) And the unexpected part - I also tend to have 2 or 3 in-house recruiters reaching out from their direct email addresses to reject me. The emails give the typical vague reasons for the rejection whilst also saying something like ""I hope you don't mind if we reach out regarding any other roles that you're a good fit for"" (or something else along those lines.) These are not firms I've interviewed with. 

Last time I job hunted I would only get automated rejections with no contact info unless I had interviewed with the the company so this trend is surprising to me. I don't have any direct reports in my current role and haven't job hunted in a while so this is probably a totally normal thing that I'm just out of the loop about or overthinking.

Is this an invite to connect? If I respond, is it likely that they will provide any details on what types of roles they see me as suitable for so that I can make sure I'm targeting the right roles. 


Note: My job title is kind of vague. I feel Ike that might be relevant because outside recruiters have been reaching out about all kinds of different roles, from entry level minimum wage jobs to manager level roles with an average salary equal to 80-100% over what I make currently. So I am a little confused about what recruiters might be thinking in general.



CONTEXT:

I am expecting a low response rate during my job search because:

- I am only targeting remote jobs
- I live in a HCOL area, so my salary expectations might be higher than some other applicants competing for remote jobs
- I am a generalist in my field so I am not targeting the types of highly specialized roles where you  expect to have a lot of negotiating power 
- I switched fields a couple of years ago (via internal department transfer) so while I have about 10 years of professional workforce experience and 5 yrs at my current company, I only have about 2 years of experience in my current field
- It is common for folks in my current field to move on to a higher level role after gaining 2 or 3 of years of experience. A lot better f the time they will be promoted internally. But don't forget that happing at my current company 
- I am only applying to roles for which I meet all of the posted criteria, and I am only applying if my salary expectations are within the bottom 50th percentile for the posted range. If salary is not posted, I usually just don't apply unless I'm particularly excited about the company or role
- I am not very well networked"

My eventual question is... Could I be doing better?

I am an aerospace engineer by training. Graduated about 11 years ago and have stuck with the same (big) employer. 

I have really enjoyed my career so far (on the whole). I have done detail and system design jobs, customer facing technical liaison jobs, safety investigations, integration etc. Been involved with all sorts of ineresting problems, people, organisations and customers. 

I'm not really a detail engineer, my strengths have been in doing that integrating bit. Bringing different people/tools together to fix complex problems. 

The last few years I have been doing a programme management role, responsible for a decent (multi million/year) budget and delivery. More recently I am now a manager grade running a large team, with dozens of direct reports from different disciplines. The programme (and job) is exciting, busy, chaotic. 

My question is.... I see loads of people here posting about how they make this much or that much... My full comp is around £60k and whilst I'm happy at the moment getting some great experience... I see others posting about their six figure salaries and Im starting to twitch a bit. Am I being low balled?? 

I feel I've got a great mix of credible (and customer facing) engineering background, proven pm delivery and now the team/org leadership too.

I'd really appreciate any comments from anyone else with similar backgrounds and whether they stuck engineering or moved away, or stayed in technical companies but did something different. How do I improve my earnings (do I need to move!?)? I understand U.S. salaries are higher on paper but have all extra costs of living to pay."

I live in Northern Ontario, but I've been offered a great job out in Northern BC. My current position is stalling out in terms of growth. The new position pays $12, 000 more per year. It is better suited to  
my skills and education and the future direction I want to go in my career. There is lots of opportunity for growth with the new role.

However, I just bought a house here in Ontario. I get the keys to move in on Monday. All of my closest friends live here and my family lives in a remote town about a six hour drive north.

I am single. My parents are healthy, but they are in their mid-70s. My brother and his family live in the same town as my parents, so there is immediate support there if anything were to happen. If I were to take the job in BC, it would take two full days of flying/driving to visit family. They do offer flexibility to work remotely in situations where a family member is sick and/or you want to work remotely for a part of your vacation. 

If I moved out west, I would have to rent my house in Ontario. I've been offered the option to work remotely for the first three months in the new position, which would allow me to address any issues with the house. After that, I would have to relocate to Northern BC. I plan to use a property manager which, even with their fees, would cover my monthly mortgage payments.

If I stayed in my current role, I would be able pay my mortgage, but I would be pretty house poor for at least the first couple of years. I could potentially take in a roommate and I have a side hustle that would help me make some money part-time, but it is not always a reliable income and varies month-to-month.

If I took the job out west, I would be renting an apartment out there for around $500 less than my mortgage payment per month. So financially, I think that option makes the most sense in the short and long term...because I would be making more money, save money on my housing costs, and it would be career progression which would likely lead to higher salary down the line.

I have written out the pros and cons many times, but I am having a hard time deciding what is most important to me. My values are growth/learning, helping others, family, friends, and adventure. I've realized that each option satisfies my values in different ways, but also there are sacrifices that come along with each option too. Perhaps that's why it's been so challenging to decide.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated."

I have a permanent contract in France which includes a very annoying... 3 month notice period (it's huge!). I will be leaving soon to Canada and I was seeking for advice on what would be the best moment for me to begin applying for my next job to both have chances to land a job &amp; be smart with my personal finances (in order not to live in Toronto with no income for too long).

\- Is it approx. two months before my notice period when I'm still in France ? (but haven't got yet my Toronto address on my resume, which can be a turnoff for recruiters I guess ?)

or

\- Is it when I'm already in Toronto ? (my personal finances may suffer!)

What's the smartest way for me to work around my 3 month notice period but still be smart with my personal finances ?

For context, I work as a data analyst, have Canadian PR and have already worked in Toronto before.

A very warm thank you to anyone kind enough to provide insights or an angle which I haven't seeen, really appreciate!

Currently a self employed lawyer in my mid 30s living in a big city. Truth be told I went to law school as it was my parents' wish that I get a ""good"" education and enter into a ""respectable"" career. I went to an average school as I had no desire to aim for top tier schools. My schooling was paid for so I cannot complain about that. I have been practising for almost 10 years and have little to no interest in it. I work enough to make a decent living. Being self employed with my own practice, the schedule is good - pay is based on how much or how little I work. In essence, I get paid to take on peoples headaches and issues and try to resolve them. l always thought of this as a stepping stone career therefore did not invest into growing the practice or getting employees, etc. I do feel that my education and legal career to date is a valuable asset and has given me a decent network.

Ideally I would like a career change - something that would excite me. My career change would not upset anyone at this point.. the problem is I dont know what to do. In fact, I am fortunate enough to say that I have some savings and the ability to make a switch without serious consequences. Moreover, given the way my legal career is, even if I experiment with a new career/venture I always have a fallback.

I have tried to think long and hard about things that interest me, but I dont see them leading to any careers per se. For example, I have an unreasonable love cars - Vintage ones. I have owned mulitple and still do. They are only $5k-20k not expensive collectible vehicles.

I enjoy spirits/whiskies. Not just consumption but the history, fermentation, the distillation (craft distilling), production, flavors, taste profiles, marketing, etc. 

I also enjoy gardening, farming, like animals, livestock, etc. Everything related to a farmlife intrigues me. I see real value is organic farming (but real estate is unreasonably expensive to even try a venture where I am).

Growing up I was a very ""hands on"" person, wrenching on cars, building decks, installing pavers, concrete, etc. As well as an Outdoors person - I still enjoy outdoor activities.

I am fully aware that people would kill to be in my situation and perhaps I should shut up and continue on as a lawyer while trying to enjoy my passions as a hobby...but I have always envied those who are excited/passionate about their careers. I also appreciate that no career comes without its set of headaches and issues."

I’m starting to look at other opportunities that I could potentially move into that is more strategic in nature and less about “putting out fires all the time”. 

Recently I found an internal position that is a director role which focuses on organizational strategic planning and operational enhancement. I spoke to the hiring manager for this role and it sounds like it aligns with what I’m interested moving forward in my career. 

I’m having a hard time deciding to apply or not. On one hand, I feel that I need to stay in my current role to continue to learn and grow as a leader and manager. I have an awesome boss and team who have been coaching and mentoring me so I feel a sense of loyalty. On the other, I’m tired of all the negativity with the job itself and all the interpersonal mush. 

Since this is an internal position, my boss may catch wind of it and I’m afraid it would jeopardize my job. Is it worth telling them that I’m exploring other options? Should I stay and wait it out to see if things get better? TIA"

This is an oddly specific question, but I had a final interview round mid-Decemeber for a position I'm a great fit for. By that point I'd done nearly 4 hours of interviews, given work samples and done a timed ""assignment.""

As I was closing with the hiring manager, they mentioned an extended trip they were taking for the holidays.

Since then I haven't heard anything. I've emailed and called politely asking for an update on the search and no response.

Since it's been a month, I feel like I've been ghosted given my multiple attempts to contact.

Normally, I'd just move on, but this one felt perfect and the fact of their trip is giving me a lot of hope/cope.

My first job when I graduated college was at my current company, 8.5 years ago. I have been promoted to a role that pays quite well, has great job security, and is not stressful – yes it is a government job. I know a lot of people would be envious of my position. 

However I have constantly had this urge to leave. The area I am in does not interest me, my colleagues in my department are all nice enough but 10-15 years older than me, and most of all I just feel fatigued from going to the same place all of my life. I am single, 30, no dependents. I feel like I wasted my 'adventure/risk' years, both professionally and personally. 

I have applied for many jobs in a field I am interested in, but the downside of my current job is that it doesn’t seem to have any market value. I have been on three interviews in 6 months of applying, one of them progressing me but I turned it down since I didn’t have a good feeling about the manager and it was offering half my current salary. 

I keep hearing that there are so many jobs, but I am really finding it hard. It feels like my only options are to stay in this uninspiring job or just quit and start my life again from the bottom of the ladder. But that feels so stupid, to give away a well paying job with nothing lined up. Sometimes I almost feel I wish I got fired so I had no choice. Has anyone else felt like this? What did you do?"

EDIT: Geographical context - I’m based in western Europe, and where I am, the Psychologist title is protected and to be one I have to go through 3 years of Bachelor’s and 2 years masters (competitive entry). That and internships and further specialised training if needed to get experience or set up private practice

Since I was 14, I always knew I wanted to become a psychologist. Life happens and I never actually even got close to it. Long story short, I’m on a completely different career path. I have a bachelor’s in media, a master’s in business, and I am now working in marketing. 

I’ve always had mental health issues and this is why I dreamed of being a psychologist at such a young age. My family isn’t such a simple one, everyone’s pretty dysfunctional mental healths. Even now that I’m relatively better than I was, because I tried so hard to be where I am now I still do have those days. 

This week I took a sick leave from work because I am sick and couldn’t be bothered to work on my job. I feel like I don’t see the point in my job at all. I moved across the globe and many would consider me lucky having this job, but I know deep inside - it doesn’t make me feel fulfilled. I am a bit skilled but it doesn’t feel like my calling.

If I were to really take on this long-term goal, let’s say I can start studying psychology in late 2024. It would take me 5+ years where I currently live. That means I would be done in 2029, 33 years old, with zero work experience in the field. Is it going to be worth it if I shift careers?

I know of what I want, but I do not know much of the reality. So, help me understand the weight of this… Why should I not take this path? Why should someone not be a psychologist?

A little description of me. I have always been in fields like communication, social media, and jobs needing people-skills. But I’m someone who has social anxiety (not diagnosed) and it’s not really a disorder, but yeah I have anxiety when it comes to people. But when it comes to really knowing ‘people’ I enjoy it, and I really lose all the anxiety when it’s about topics that make up the person I’m talking to (their thoughts, their story, their worries, etc.). But I am afraid of people knowing about me so I never could connect in that sense. I enjoy it being one-sided and being of help in understanding them and helping them understand themselves. My colleagues joke about having free therapy sessions with me and they say I would actually make a good psychologist - even though I never really told them anything about this. I’m the silent, shy, introverted type but due to my job I have to fake extroversion and I’m pretty good at it.

But I’m tired of this. I want to do something fulfilling with my life and something that I will enjoy. Then again, I might actually be clueless of what I’m asking for.

And yes, I did go to therapy for some years on and off.

Any advice or truth bombs would be welcome! Should I become a psychologist? And if not, why shouldn’t I?

And so I came to the idea to ask here, if any of you have a career/job to recommend where I could do this.

I'm kind of torn between going into art (theater director or language teacher/author) or psychology. (Or even journalism, since I really like to learn about different topics and share knowledge)

Thank you for any tid bit of info!

P.S. sorry about being a bit all over the place😅
And, in case it matters in any way, I'm in pharmacy school at the moment, but I am quite ready to quit, just got to figure out the best alternative."

I currently work as a digital marketer for a small company in New Jersey making $40k a year before taxes. No benefits or perks. I'm not really motivated to do anything while I'm there because I'm not interested in the job. I do things related to my job maybe an hour at most on a normal day. Aside from that, I mostly do things like play 8 ball pool, do crossword puzzles, watch YouTube, check sports news + my fantasy teams, sleep and go on my phone. I also work a part time job at night, making \~$5k a year. I've been at that job since 2016. Graduated Montclair State Univ. in 2019 with a degree in Communications with a concentration in Journalism. Haven't used it at all so far.

I'm very good at saving and have $57k in one savings account, $5.7k in my checking, $10k bond in Disney, \~$20k in another savings account, and another \~$20k currently sitting in a CD. Plus another $2k hidden in a shoe box. I started working at 13 years old and haven't stopped since. I've been working hard but not smart, and I admit fault for that.

I still live with my parents, only reason is because rent prices are insane in NJ. Currently have no girlfriend or any romantic interests. I have friends who are nice people and have jobs but are not necessarily go getters and don't seem to care much about me. I really never did any networking.

I have seen people and who've worked not nearly as hard as me get afforded better opportunities and other niceties for doing little work at all while growing up, and that has made me see the fault in my ways. It's also made me think that hard work is pointless, so I've really been lacking drive lately. I want to change my life around this year and am interested in attending WGU online for software engineering or accounting, or exploring a medical profession at an in person institution. I've been so lost for so long it feels like.

So be truthful with me, would a be classified as a loser based on my current life situation? I blame no one but myself and accept responsibility for my actions and missed opportunities. Thank you in advance to all who answer. I will answer questions providing any other information if necessary."

So here are the not so basics of my history.  Apologies for the length,  but this is something I am very serious about and I tend to give lots of  detail.

Father was military. He  retired to a small town not terribly far from an Army base in Kentucky.   Kentucky, if you guys don't know, is not the most productive of places  for opportunities of advancement.  I detested the state from the moment  we arrived when I was in middle school until I was able to leave over 20  years later.  I have since lived in Reno for a couple of years, but it  was just too expensive for my wife and I to stay, despite us loving it  there.  I now live in Michigan with family

Now  back to the beginning..  Just before I graduated high school ('97) a  friend of my dad started teaching us about computers, when personal  computers were really first starting to become a thing.  My father  started a computer store and I was the primary and usually only tech.   Family business failed after 6 and a half years, I bounced around  computer tech jobs with a couple of random jobs mixed in.  I went to  school to be an electrician, but figured out that it wasn't for me (I  did electricity in trade school, I enjoyed wiring up house frames but  had zero interest in crawling under houses and in attics, etc).

While  I was in school I learned PLC programming and was extremely good at it  (for any who don't know, PLC programming is absolutely nothing like any  other kind of programming there is and I have never been interested in  other types of programming).  I was contacted by a headhunter agency for  a job where I would have been a PLC programmer writing programs for new  lines being contracted to this company by factories.  Just as they were  going to hire me, the depression of '08 happened and they put out a  hiring freeze, as did every other place that did that kind of work aside  from some company in Ireland, and they would only hire if you made your  way there on your own expense first.  If you couldn't tell, I was a bit  broke.  PLC programming now is not the same as it was.  There are no  companies who hire for that anymore.  They want that to be just one  small part of a ton more stuff that you will do.  Mostly they want  someone who is a mechanic that knows just enough about the program to  make sure it's working properly to maintain a line in a factory.

Back  to working on computers I go.  Did it for several more years, getting  more and more disgusted with the whole thing as time went on.  The most  recent store I worked at went out of business and I started working for  the security department of the local hospital.  I was not actually a  guard, I worked in the camera room.  I somewhat enjoyed this job, but  the hospital was a hell hole and they did zero practical training for  self defense or anything else that would be security related aside from a  single CPI class (Crisis Prevention and Intervention, basically showing  you how you can get out of a hold someone might put you in and telling  you to talk nice to people even if they are trying to stab or shoot  you). Yay Kentucky! /sarcasm

I am  currently a stay at home dad while my wife works.  When my daughter gets  old enough to be going to school, I will start working again to  supplement our income and because as much as I hated a lot of the jobs I  did, I miss working in general, to a point.  My issue is, I can't  figure out what I want to do.   I am wanting to find something  meaningful to do.  Something I can be proud of and feel like it has made  some kind of difference.  A job that even if I can't say I am thrilled  to do, maybe I can enjoy it or at the least not feel like it is sucking  my soul out.  I will do what I must, stock shelves, flip burgers, etc,  but I want to do something more.

When  I was young, I gave serious consideration to the military and law  enforcement, but due to uncertainty from a couple of sources, I didn't  do the law enforcement.  Military was out as well because my father  developed a variant of ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) and was unable to use  his arms, I stuck around to help my mother take care of him.  I am now  too old for the military and most law enforcement, as well as too out of  shape (though trying to get a handle on that one).  I gave very serious  consideration to forensics, but have since discovered that it is one of  those careers that unless you get very very lucky with, you have to be  willing to move to where the job is available, and can't count on  getting a job in it where you already are.  Due to my financial and  family situation, that is not an option for me.

Other  considerations I have had have been private investigation, gun  smithing, possibly working loss prevention for a business, security  again as long as the company is willing to give actual legitimate  training.

In some ways, I feel  like I wasted most of my adult life working a job type that I hated but  didn't really have any other options for and have missed out on any  opportunities to do something meaningful that I would enjoy.  On top of  that, the things that to interest me are either nonexistent now or not  reasonable to obtain considering my situation.  I really have no idea  what to do.

I don't really know  where I was going with this and what I expect but there it is.  To any  that bothered to read this far, thank you for your attention and time."

I have rather strong grades and I’ve applied to one college already and am considering two more, however I’m debating as to what field to enter. I used to be very interested in Spaceflight and potentially wanted to become an astronautical or aeronautical engineer. However, recently I haven’t felt a strong connection to anything. 

My school offers a special work program that I took because I had finished all of my required credits and I’m now interning for my Dad’s IT company where I’ve been learning programming. I talked to him for advice about what to do with my indecision and he offered that I could take a gap year where he could try to get me more tightly ingrained in the world of actual Junior Software Developer work and talk to some people about actually finding projects for me to complete. 

I felt that offer seemed pretty great and could maybe give me an idea of what a CS career would be like and maybe I could end up going to college for a degree to benefit me further after I had gotten to see what it was like. However I also don’t want to entirely discount the passion that engineering and a chemistry had invoked in me only a few years ago. And if I took a gap year there’s no guarantee I’d be able to receive any scholarships to help me pay for college later on. Any input is welcome. Thanks."

Relevant (?) Background:

29YO female, based in US, some college, high school graduate w/academic honors

Personal Interests:

Agriculture/farming, animals/behavior/husbandry/training, being outside in nature, nutrition, natural sciences, fashion and design, aesthetics/cosmetics. 

Work Experience:

- Food industry (fast food, semi fine dining, diner)
- Customer Service (banking call center, cashiering, etc.)
- Retail (box stores)
- Animal husbandry (grooming, kennel tech, vet assistant, horse barn, etc.)
- Banking
- Graphic design/newsletter development
- Secretarial
- Teaching (Pre-k)

College courses were pretty basic so think English, math, bio, chem with some business classes thrown in there and some other natural sciences (think nursing pre-reqs).

So here’s the problem, I am currently stuck where I’m at physically. I’m making changes to be able to move, but it’s not going to be a quick thing. When I first graduated HS I fucked around at both of the community colleges so due to my completion rate I have to pay for classes out of pocket which is financially not possible at the moment or near future. 

I want to find a field/career that has solid projected growth and demand, pays enough to live a modest life (being able to pay my bills, have a house, decent used car, and a little extra to save and invest in hobbies and a vacation once or twice a year), has decent benefits, generally in demand across the country so that I can move out of my current city and state. Prefer something dynamic that has some change ups every day. I have done factory work so I want as far away from that as possible. Nothing super competitive where I would need to be absolute cream of the crop top 1% of the best candidates. I want to be able to have a decent work life balance and be able to leave work at work. Nothing super dangerous. No crazy work schedules where I work 12+ hours a day. Regular 8 hour shifts. 

I would be willing to do online classes at another college if I can get aid, I know there are some programs that are out of state but online. I don’t really know how that works with like financial aid and whatnot. 

So what career can I pursue when I’m broke and can’t do my local community colleges?"

A bit about me professionally:

I am 28m and have been in the Army Reserves since I was 17 (11 years). I am a Captain with a Bachelors Degree (criminal justice).

I founded and own a large business (700 full time employees) but we are losing money and I do not take a paycheck (as of 3 months ago). Long term, I am not worried about the company but for the next year or two, things are dire. 

I have served as a police officer and wildland firefighter.

My resume sounds good (and it is) but I can not find a way to make money all of a sudden for the first time in my life, just as my personal life has hit a ton of hurdles. I am trying to find a career path that is actually in alignment with my personality. 

I was the energy that started my business but I am not good at running it (I hired a CEO). This is mainly due to attention span.  I was a good police officer but was too contrarian and resigned because I would not obey policy.  I am a good Solider but as a Captain, I am miserable because I now sit behind a desk no matter what position I get. I do love strategy, so have thought about applying to some paid board positions in which I am not part of day to day operations. 

I have looked into Private Military Contracting but nothing has come to fruition. I train MMA/ BJJ daily and I am in great shape and value using my body.  But using your body doesn't pay much these days.  My background is to all over the place to get into the CIA, though I do hold a Top Secret Clearance.  I tried running for political office and failed miserably. I wrote a book that didnt sell.

Anyways, Im feeling lost and that I have all this potential energy that I can not put to work.  I want to be productive but feel my skillset isnt valued anymore.  And now Im broke."

I have been at this job for almost 1 and half years and it's been going great, but as far as I knew, in order to keep doing well in the company, you need a plan and to know where you are headed. Luckily the managers encourage us to think about our career aspirations so they can help us be put on the path and shape our roads to it.

But how do you decide where do you want to advance to? How do you figure out your career aspirations?

Like I have a few ideas, one had to do with marketing analytics (as I have a major in marketing), another is very ambitious but to become a Chief Communication Officer,
Or perhaps something that has to do with Sustainability

But the things that scares me the most about deciding are what if I'm not well fitted for it and what if I spend a long time reaching for that role then find out I don't like it or something

I've always enjoyed anime and have just got into reading novels, I also started attending college again after dropping out years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

 In terms of going into more details in terms of what I want to do, I want to possibly create my own song, or write it at least. Write a novel, create a manga, make an anime, draw art that interest me, etc... After writing for a short while I've realized that doing so allows me to in a way understand my longings and regrets and have a place for them to be coped with. Whenever I'm writing I can create my ideal worlds filled with experiences that I didn't get too experience and hopes and dreams I never could accomplish.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm taking beginning English and Art classes my worry though is for the future in terms of what degree I should choose. Also attempting to read and write as much as possible on my free time.

It's a great environment and although I could potentially get more money elsewhere, my day-to-day is honestly somewhat enjoyable and my salary supports my livelihood. That being said, I would still like the opportunity to make more money each year.

A few days ago, a co-worker who was hired before me was basically told, 'thanks for your hard work this year', and nothing else. She did not bring up the possibility of a raise, because she was already under the impression that she was not receiving one. Our company gives out quarterly bonuses based on performance the previous quarter, and she had heard that no others received raises at their yearly evals. 

Regarding our bonuses, one caveat is if certain quotas (even outside of my control) aren't met, no bonuses are distributed. It's more of a company-wide bonus, where all must meet their expectations. I've gone one quarter last year where I did not receive a bonus and did not receive an explanation. 

Looking at my co-workers' experiences and bonuses, should I ask for a raise at my yearly eval? I must admit, I'm not sure how to go about this, as this is my first career position. Thanks in advance."

Hi everyone,

I have been receiving two job offers simulatineously in the last few days. I am still deciding because the two offers are good. However, each has its pros and cons.

I will one list one pro and con for each offer.

Offer A: working in the IT industry

Pro: Career progression and will obtain certifications, eg CCNA.

Con: Contract of employment subject to renewal or converted to permanent. (still full time)

Offer B: working in the F&amp;B industry

Pro: Only has a prob of 6 months and then converted to permanent.

Con: Less programminng (which is my strongest skill)

My decisions are based on how I enjoy my job (more to B), how I want to learn more new things (A) and how the job can help me develop my career in the next 5 years (definitely A).

Since I only have &lt; 2 years of work experience, they only offer a decent salary, enough for one personliving comfortably in my country.

I am honestly still deciding. Like my heart is saying go for B but looking at the long term, A is more rewarding in terms of career path and fascinating in terms of learning new techs.

**If you were me, how would you decide if you received good two offers and need to decide asap?**

Thanks"

Since I was a kid, my dad had slightly pushed the idea of becoming a doctor. Growing up I’ve never thought of anything else, it felt like the only thing I could do or that was for me. (Neither my parents are doctors). When I was 17 I did an exchange year in the US. being away from my parents’ influence and letting myself be myself and discovering new parts of me I found out I am adventurous, I love being in new places and learning. One thing I was always sure about, that I want to help people in my life. That is my purpose. So, during the exchange year I started thinking that maybe I could do smth else other than medicine, and I was thinking of psychology. I love talking to people, listening to them and hearing their story. I am empathetic and patient. When I got back home, I told my dad about the thinking I did. He freaked out and said that if I won’t go to med school then I shouldn’t call him my dad anymore. In the last 6 months I’ve been riped apart between what I should do next. I finish Highschool this year and I don’t know what I should do next. I dream of travelling and meeting new people, cultures. I would be happy going to remote areas of the world, doing humanitarian work of some sort. A steady life sounds comfortable but I don’t want that especially for my early life. Medicine would offer me financial steadiness and assure me that I will be comfortable and also have a higher social status, but I feel psychology would allow me to be more flexible and grow as a person more, but it’s harder for a psychologist to make themselves seen in the world. I also fear that as a doctor, I wouldn't have much time for other activities and hobbies, and I fear of feeling trapped. My mom wants me to go to med school as well, but isn’t as extreme as my dad. I need help. I am afraid to make a wrong decision and waste time when it is so precious."

He has announced a successor who is a colleague of ours, who is very well liked and appreciated by all of us. I really get on very well with him and I never had any real ambitions to become CEO. So I was surprised when I compared the two of us, who were in a similar range salary-wise, but now he plays several leagues above me (and the others, of course). I felt really bad about this comparison because I like my job, the company and the man who will soon be my boss. I also admire my outgoing boss who has always supported me. But I know/expect the new boss to do the same.

To overcome the discomfort of my unwanted feelings, I've been researching what my own career path might look like. I started my job about 18 months ago and had planned to discuss my next steps/the path I want to take when I have been with the company for two years, which seems like a reasonable amount of time to see a person's potential. Now this plan has been thrown out the window as my current boss will have retired by then (the time frame in which he plans to retire is quite short and he announced it at short notice). 

I'm wondering: should I stick to my plan and discuss the career path after my second year with the company, or should I pick up on the current momentum and talk to both the old and new CEOs about my plans to pursue an executive-level position? 

My background is a PhD in an emerging technology/niche area that the company is looking to enter, as well as a basic engineering degree in the field that the company is in."

I think he wanted to recruit someone else. But because his boss must have suggested to take me owing to my qualifications, my boss must have taken me. 

So, even after 2.5 months, I suck at my work, always there's a mistake. I'm an intern btw. So I feel like it must be exhausting for him. And it is for me too, with this many mistakes. 

I feel like they want me to leave. I think the other person in my team, who also works for my boss, wants me to leave too. The thing is, if I could work well, I wouldn't give a damn about who likes me and wants me to leave. But I suck at my work and I am a misfit to the culture here I feel. I'm more of a formal person. Here it is all bro and sis like. It's a sweet bunch but I don't think they like me. 

Here and then, this other person who works in my team and reports to my boss, has mentioned that I have mixed everything up, doesn't know how she will leave things for me to do since she feels like I have no proper idea on what to do. Then why had she given the ok to make me a permanent staff????? 
I feel like both my boss and this girl want me out. I can see why. Not only am I not fitting in, I suck at my work after being here for 2.5 months. She tells stuff like I should go abroad too. That she thinks I won't even last as long as her. 

And now today my boss also told its best if I get the training from this place and leave to a better place 😅 something about being talented. How on earth am I talented when half the things I do are wrong and has got at least one typo😣 and no it is not imposter syndrome. And that the company might not recognise my work but I seem professional. That if I focus on myself I will do well etc😅......I anyway had typed out my resignation letter since i felt like they dont really want me and i suck at my work. Plus im always working at home too....its so tiring. Lost weight and sleep too. Anyway, it felt like my boss was just trying to be nice while all my boss wants to say is just get lost. 

Am I wrong? Or am I onto something here?"
3,2023-01-15,"Masters' degree in Science, 6 months of UI/UX experience, 4 years of teaching in Vietnam. What now?",u/Casamance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10cjmpq/masters_degree_in_science_6_months_of_uiux/,careerguidance,"Hey everyone. A brief background about myself firsr:

I'm 27M. American National with West African heritage. Native-New Yorker. I have a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry, a Masters' degree in Pharmacology, 3 years of laboratory research experience (2 years doing Medicinal Chemistry research and 1 year doing Pharmacology research) and can speak Vietnamese at a business level and can read French fairly well. I currently work as a Lecturer at a college in Vietnam.

I've been thinking about what my career options would be if I moved back to the U.S. To be frank, back when I graduated with my Masters' in 2019 I had a very, very difficult time finding a job with my credentials at the time. Over 100 applications sent, only got a single (phone) interview for a Medical Writing position in New York from that time. Since then I've moved to Vietnam and found a career in teaching (mainly English, but I managed to get a Science Teaching job in 2020.) During that time I did a lot of self-study in UI/UX for about a year.

Miraculously, in mid 2021 I got a job as a UI/UX designer at a Vietnamese tech company. Unfortunately, I had a difficult time with my projects as I wasn't very experienced and our clients didn't like my designs, not to mention that I was a slow designer... I was let go after 6 months. Immediately after I found another teaching job at a Korean School in Hanoi, and worked there until October 2022. 

Due to meeting the right people at the right place and at the right time, I got a job as an English Lecturer at a well-known college in Vietnam. It's been a great experience so far, but I know that if I want to continue teaching, I'd like to branch out into either Science or Design based courses.

Honestly, I know it seems like I have plenty of work experience right now, but I feel like I've been plagued with the case of ""Jack of all trades, Master of none."" I'm terrified of what my potential job prospects would be back in the States. Unfortunately laboratory research is something that I'm not interested in so my Masters' degree leaves me with very few options in that regard. (I wasnt a great researcher either to be honet...) I could try another go around with UI/UX but I'm scared of falling again. I enjoy teaching at a college but I know the pay wouldn't be that great in America unless I was tenured.

Any input would be well appreciated. Thanks."

10,2023-01-15,At a crossroads in mid-40s with a big career and kids - advice?,u/Dry-Photograph-3582,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10ck6gk/at_a_crossroads_in_mid40s_with_a_big_career_and/,careerguidance,"
I’m a married mid-40s woman with a wonderful husband and three kids (9, 11, 13).  Back in my 20s and 30s, I was career-obsessed and had a ton of energy.  I worked at one company for many years, enjoyed great maternity benefits, but I felt my future options were quite limited there due to competition and internal politics, and I ultimately found the work to be unenjoyable.  By the time I left, I was depressed and crying on the way to work.  It was time to go.

I ended up joining a different company a few years ago and working for an old colleague from my former company.  This person has become a close friend and has been the best, most nurturing boss I have ever worked for.  She’s incredible and she works endless hours, which she can do because she doesn’t have children. These have been the happiest few years of my career and she has promoted me.  The one downside is that the company is located in another city, so I have to travel on short trips 2-3 times per month (less during the pandemic).  I am therefore gone 3-5 days per month while my husband manages the kids. We also have grandparents nearby who help.  My husband works 100 percent from home in a demanding job himself and makes close to what I make.  I make more money than I ever thought I would, more than enough for us to manage our finances.

Recently, my boss was promoted and has asked me whether I would one day take over her former position.  She said she is “holding the seat open” for me until I’m ready to take it, but realistically, I think she will need to fill the position in 1-2 years.  It would require me to travel even more than I already do - and take on new responsibilities.  I estimate my travel would increase to 6-8 days per month.  The position would be reaching a career pinnacle and set me up for a new trajectory for the next 20 years.  My pay would increase by 30-40%.

The conundrum for me is whether I should go for the new role. I already make enough money in my current role, but the new role would be something that could create generational wealth if I follow the trajectory for the next 10-20 years.  My children really hate when I’m away and I miss them too, and they’re really getting older and I don’t want to regret not being home more.  It is possible that the most important investment for future generations could be being more present and available to my kids for these next 5-7 years, but of course have no way of knowing what the future holds.

Also, during and after the challenges of the pandemic, I’ve really started feeling my age a little more and I’m just tired.  I’ve gained 10-15 pounds (very unusual for me since I’ve always had a steady weight), much of which I attribute to working from home and constantly snacking.  I’m just not feeling my best.  I feel overwhelmed already with my responsibilities and like I don’t get enough time to relax.  But I also don’t know if my current set-up is really healthy since that is what led to my weight gain.  

My husband will support whatever I want to do, but says I shouldn’t be motivated solely by money since we make enough.  I haven’t asked my kids, but I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t want me to increase travel, but they have dad and grandparents there for them when I am gone.  The kids are my most important priority.  Any thoughts or advice on how to navigate all this?  Words of wisdom appreciated.

Also, I am aware these are “champagne problems” and how lucky I am."

I went to school for several years when my son (13 m) was younger, but he was a very challenging child and I wasn’t able to work enough to support us and do well in school. I have an associate of arts and some extra credits, but I’m probably 2 years of full time school away from any bachelors degree. For most of my son’s life I have worked in the gig economy/self employment that allowed me a more flexible schedule. I cleaned houses, shopped and delivered groceries, did bookkeeping, and many more miscellaneous jobs. 

18 months ago I took a fully remote full time job with the state. I am doing great at work and just got promoted. My job offers some tuition reimbursement and I am considering going back to school, maybe just 1 or 2 classes per semester online or in the evenings. Ideally I’d like to get a degree that would very quickly and dramatically increase my earning potential. 

I am really academically intelligent and have never struggled with any of my classes, from communications to accounting to calculus based physics. I am sure that I could do well with any classes I chose. When I was younger I focused on taking classes that I found interesting and didn’t focus on a specific major. I changed my major several times. If I go back now I want to have laser like focus on my degree path.

Backstory: my old manager at a restaurant went onto get a degree in business and is now a very big time labor union executive. 

Currently he manages an $800 million health insurance pension for members of his labor union. 

He heard I was pursuing a hybrid cybersecurity/ business management degree and told me i should come to work a blanket union position for him (just a job, but with decent pay and great benefits). He told me if I complete my degree and obtain certain certifications then he could promote me to a very lucrative salary position from within. 

I have no reason not to trust him, he has made no promises but is generally one of my dearest friends in life.

Unlucky for me, rough times came and the labor market started shrinking salaries, HRs started implementig all sorts of disrespectfull, time-wasting hiring methods and the competition is immence.

Given that I am based in the EU, I figured I can find a remote job somewhere and if lucky they would let me work from my current location as the straight outsourcing antics have grown out of hand at the moment here.

I have no issues relocating tho.

Hi everyone, I am a (F29) high school teacher for 6 years now and I hate every single moment of it. Not only I hate the job itself (from preparing the lessons, to managing the class, to dealing with rude teens and even ruder parents, and really bad school administration management) also there's the safety aspect. Few days ago a student stabbed another teacher with a knife multiple times, she's in coma.

I also had one encounter like that once, a student's parent threatened to slaughter me if I didn't drop charges against his son who hit me and spit on me because I caught him cheating.

Long story short I really can't deal with it anymore I keep skipping work which is neither good for me nor for the students, so I'm coming asking for help what are the best options for someone who wants : a career that can be done from home and is suitable for an introvert. I've thought of ui/ux design because I am already into design and I enjoy it very much, but someone told me it has a looot of meetings and very not suitable for introverts, and then I thought of programming but I'm really not that smart, I can only do front end, and I think it's not enough to be hired with that only now because of the whole AI.. Please share your insights with me

F29, wish to work from home so i can travel, I like everything design and visual related, not very smart nor assertive (hence struggling with managing my classes)

Highest level education is a high school diploma.I speak some french. I enjoy languages and reading/writing.

I have adhd and when tested (full assessment by a psychologist), my iq was above average with extremely high scores (well above average) in written/verbal communication skills.

I was a small business owner for 10+ years as a photographer, and did quite well actually! 

More recently, I started work at a tech/digital marketing agency. I started out at an entry level position and am now an account manager.

I enjoy marketing BUT my current work environment is terrible (NEVER any downtime, my employers are awful to their employees, pay is not great). I have applied to many other marketing jobs. Everyone WANTS a degree and I have less than a year experience at an agency. 

I have always wanted to go to school but with three children its never seemed possible.

Now, I feel like I need a post-secondary education to further myself in life, but with 3 kids I have a lot at stake and need to get it right.

A degree in marketing/business - I have experience and am good at it but its not my “passion”.

A degree in history -  History is my passion, but I dont want to be stuck with a degree that is difficult to get a high paying job with or requires additional school such as a lawyer.

Ive also considered something in HR/Union- After working in such a poor work environment id love to ensure employers treat their employees justly.

Open to any other suggestions degree or diploma. I feel so directionless and like I have hit my brick wall. 

Additional information for anyone who wants to help: I have experience in data analytics but am not that strong in math. I am proficient in most adobe apps. I have experience in videography and editing, but having done the creative field most my life I am kind of burnt-out."

I'm so tempted to quit over this, because I feel bad that I'm letting my team down because of my incompetence. But I can't quit because I have bills I need to pay. I don't think I'm a natural at my field (coding) and I have to work super hard to try to understand things, but it's exhausting and I'm so drained by the end of the day, either because of my anxiety from procrastinating because it's hard work for me, or from trying really hard to understand, and often failing to do so.

I'm miserable and constantly anxious because of my work anxiety. I'm constantly worried about getting fired.

For me personally, I don’t like long term commitments and apprenticeships are similar to uni as they’re 3+ years. I also don’t really enjoy routines and I know with an apprenticeship I’d more or less be doing the same thing and I won’t get many days off. At the same time, I don’t want to not pursue anything after sixth form as I want to ensure I have some form of security in the future and will have qualifications to get a job which will be much easier done with a degree. I don’t really know what other alternatives there are but I really don’t want to make myself suffer for 3 or more years doing something I don’t really want to do.

Friend of mine worked there for probably a month for some extra money over the holidays. They’ve recently been offered a new job in their career field and they put me down as an employer reference, even though I asked if my name is given that it would only be as a character reference. 

The new employer has reached out to me to confirm employment dates and rate different criteria on a scale of 1-5. Personally, I’m not comfortable giving my name as this type of reference because I’ve barely worked with my friend and ultimately this feels like a lie. I don’t like giving professional recommendations and attaching my name to somebody unless I can truly vouch for their work performance. I don’t want to give a recommendation for someone who may end up being a bad worker and then my name is tied to a bad recommendation, potentially tarnishing my professional reputation. However, we are currently in 2 separate career fields.

2,2023-01-15,Am I doing the correct thing by pursuing software engineering?,u/throwitonmeh1230,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10culdq/am_i_doing_the_correct_thing_by_pursuing_software/,careerguidance,"Some background. I am a heavily creative person, I have loved writing since I was a kid, I excelled in English literature throughout school, and I study film at university. 

The employment prospects for my major are ridiculously low, so I decided to try up coding. Turns out, I loved it. From there, I have decided to take a masters in computer science and enter software engineering as a career field. I know it sounds like a bit of a jump, but I was just playing around with hobbies, and coding sort of stuck. I also managed to get an internship last summer gone which was awesome. 

But, I still want to be a writer. It is all I have ever wanted. I just don’t want to starve. I I respect people who enter these fields and can withstand little to no money for years and years and years as they work their way up, but I am not one of them. I grew up in a low income household and all I have ever wanted to do was support myself and have some semblance of stability. I wish I had the tenacity to pursue that life, but I don’t. 

Am I a sellout? The people on my major seem to think so. I constantly feel like I’m doing the wrong thing (I’m 20) and that I’ll regret not being a filmmaker or pursuing writing full time when I’m old. (Side note, never wanted to be a filmmaker, but it is what I major in so I’m surrounded by incredibly creative people who love movies so feel pressure to be the same). I intend on supporting myself with this career, and then bringing my passion along with me, writing and indulging in all of my creative pursuits as hobbies. 

Is this wrong of me? I wonder if I’m being too risk averse to truly take the leap. I worry I’ll see my peers excel and become famous and live fulfilled lives and I’ll be doing the opposite."

I guess I just need a medium to try articulating my thoughts and fears, asking for guidance without the fear of being judged.

I was diagnosed with HIV around 5 years ago while I was on my own studying in a foreign country and just turning 25. Needless to say, it was a life shattering event for me that I had to deal with and still am. Some days are easier than others, but I did not let my diagnosis stop me from finishing my degree and finding a good job afterwards kicking off my career. 

As I am approaching currently 5 years of professional full-time work. I look back and I am proud of what I have achieved, I was able to learn lots of new skills on the jobs I've done, I got promoted and built some good connections along the journey. But then I look forward, and I feel...limited. I believe that big part of becoming successful is to be able to take risks, fail, and learn from your mistakes. In my case, I am too scared of taking a risk because what do I do if I face failure and need to ask for help? There is so much shame associated with my diagnosis which feels like a chain, a wall, not one that is made of glass but stone bricks. I am trying my best to break it down but no matter how hard I try it is still there, I can see some cracks but it is not enough to my feeling of worthlessness.  

Some examples of the limitations I feel, I don't feel like I could switch jobs as easily. If for example I find another role in another country, there are multiple considerations that I need to take: Will that country  accept someone who is living with HIV? Will the insurance cover the cost of my medication? Do I need to inform my new employer of my diagnosis?   

I also don't feel like I have the luxury to venture out and perhaps try other things to see what is it that I truly enjoy doing. I feel like I am giving 200% of myself to my job as I have no other option, if I don't have a job then I don't have insurance and I am out of this country.

I don't even have any hobbies anymore. I want to be able to explore myself more, I always wanted to draw for example, or try to learn a musical instrument. But I am too scared of anything that might affect my performance and would lead me to get sacked. 

I want normal things in life, I want to progress in my career, keep trying until I find something that is truly fulfilling and makes me happy. I want to help others as much as I can. I want to find someone to love who is kind and understanding. I want to not feel shame every single second of my existence. 

I apologise for the long rant, and if my post put you down in any way. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for being alive at a time that my diagnosis is a manageable health condition, I praise and honour all the brave souls who died fighting until we got to this day today. I wish to honour them more by eliminating the shame I feel, however, it is a journey that I am still on.

Thank you for your time and for reading until the end."

Going through high school, I was planning on going into the ministry when I graduated. As an unfortunate result of this expectation, my attitude throughout high school was one of apathy. I was just trying to survive so I could make it out. 

Well, I made it out. I graduated, worked in the ministry for a year, realized I couldn’t continue believing in religion, and promptly quit. I started working in retail because I had no direction in my life at all. I’d lost all belief in the only profession I’d prepared for. I have never regretted a decision so deeply as the decision to not apply myself in high school. I could have learned so much and found a passion that would have given me a career direction.

But last fall, I hit an all-time-low and decided I had to do SOMETHING. ANYTHING other than just being adrift and apathetic. So I started community college. Just some basic courses like English, Algebra, Sociology, Speech, and the Arts. I just want to get some of my GEs out of the way while I decide what I want to major in. 

And that truly is the hardest decision of my life so far. That’s because I don’t think I have a passion. And when I say “passion”, I mean someone who is bouncing off the walls with excitement about their subject. Like Neil deGrasse Tyson when it comes to Astrophysics. That’s why I regret not caring in high school. It could have given me that direction. 

I have interests. 

History has always been something I enjoyed, but I wrote that off because I figured that I only enjoyed it because it was easy. Although I took a trip to Gettysburg back in 2018, and it was probably my favorite trip I’ve ever taken. I find myself thinking about history and the people who shaped it quite often. But every time I consider committing to major in history, that other interest of mine taps me on the shoulder. 

Science. 

It’s late December. I get home from work around 9:30 pm. I get out of the car, the cold biting my face as I open the door, thinking about nothing except my warm bed. It’s been a long day and I’m tired. I glance up slightly as I walk toward my porch. I freeze. Not from the winter winds, but from the awestruck wonder. The universe is laid bare before me. Star upon star twinkling at me through the clear night sky. My brain processing the light that began its journey toward my eyes hundreds of years ago. I could stare for an eternity at the wonder of the night sky. I spot the little red dot that is Mars, knowing that, one day, we may live on that planet. I see the bright brilliance of Jupiter dominating the night sky. I lost track of time and ended up staring at the sky for 20 minutes. After I go inside, I’m determined to pursue a career as an astrophysicist. But then history beckons in my head as I walk past my bookshelf. 

This cycle goes on and on. It’s impossible for me to choose. My current plan is to take a physics class and a history class in the next semester. Hopefully that will make clear which path I should pursue. 

I’m terrified of making a commitment. I’m worried that 10 years from now I will not be happy and regret my choice. Does anyone here have some guidance on what I should do? How do I make this choice? And how do I know it’s the right decision?"

I am entering a new career/industry and having a hard time relating to the other working women at my current employer.

However it feels as though the onboarding wasn’t helpful, and despite given a week of education about the company it gave me little about the actual day to day work. I have been expected to do everything from day 1 so I came to find in my second week that the onboarding actually put me behind schedule and I had to play catchup on work that typically Id have two weeks to do - to do in 4 days. 

I think its normal that many things I would learn, get feedback and get the hang of as I go but I feel as though the expectations of me are that I should already know and do everything perfectly. For example, I was asked to lead a meeting with people and I can’t help but wonder why would they ask the new person to host their first meeting? rather than ask someone else to lead and me the next time.

I’m concerned that they are being unnecessarily tough on me or worse expect me to take on the previous person’s role seamlessly without any adjustment. Anytime I ask for examples of previous work I am told its not relevant and I don’t need it - which makes it harder to understand expectations. Is this normal? Any advice?"

I understand this change will result in a large paycut, but I'm certain this change will make me much happier both at work and away from work.

I'm looking for advice on jobs and careers that may be available to me outside of the aviation world with my experience I may not know about. 60k a year is the low-end pay I'm hoping for. I'm open to working in any industry, and honestly, I think I would really enjoy learning a new industry.

1,2023-01-15,How can an Electrician with an unrelated engineering degree transition into becoming an MEP Engineer?,u/Key_Photograph_4223,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10cym8k/how_can_an_electrician_with_an_unrelated/,careerguidance,"I am currently working as an electrician, and I am ready to get out of the field. I live in a part of the United States with extreme temperatures in both directions (can range from -10 F in winter and 110 F in summer), and I am realizing I am more interested in designing the electrical systems than I am in actually completing rough-ins and trims. I don't have a problem with the construction industry, but I am tired of the trade.

I think I have a lot going for me to transition into MEP Engineering, because I already have an engineering degree, I have my EIT, and I am familiar with the NEC (have a residential wireman's license and am taking classes for the Journeyman's exam). However, I have two big obstacles in my way. Firstly, my engineering degree is a B.S. in Materials Engineering. I am anticipating Hiring Managers will see I don't have an Electrical Engineering degree and throw out my application, so I am curious if there is some way I can present the degree without immediately being disqualified? The other issue is I am not familiar  with the software MEP Engineering firms use, and they all are preferring experience with these programs in their job applications. I have identified Revit as probably the most widely applicable program I could learn to use, and have thought it might work to go through LinkedIn Learning to become a Revit Certified Professional. Is this an idea that will work, or is this something that companies really aren't going to recognize as a differentiating factor to other candidates?

I had one interview with an MEP Engineering Consulting firm, and I walked away thinking I had it in the bag for sure, but I was told later that they opened the position a year early and couldn't hire me right now. They did say they would be interested in bringing me on in the future, but I don't know if they are being honest or if they are being very polite in their rejection. Every other application I have sent out has either been rejected or received no response. Is it likely I can break into an MEP Engineering firm? If it is, what can I do to improve my chances, other than going back to college for an actual mechanical or electrical engineering degree?"

I worked with a guy “Hector” for about a year until I left the company for another job. Hector and I got along well on a professional level - I thought he was really nice and easy to work with. Importantly, we worked in different cities so all of our interactions were over the phone or by email (I’ve never even video called with him). I only know what he looks from employee profile pics on our system. 

When I left my old job, I sent an email out to all the employees I liked enough to keep in contact with. I gave them my email and cell. I did this mainly because I am a young professional and I want to cultivate a network of contacts. I only included people I genuinely liked working with.

Now, I left this job over 1 year ago and in that time I’ve met up with a few of my close ex-coworkers several times in the past year. One of them mentioned to Hector that I have moved to the same city as him. Since then, Hector has emailed and texted me numerous times. At first, I was friendly, I updated him on my new job and asked how his job was. But then, he asked me to meet up in person for coffee to “catch up” - I don’t really know what we would catch up on since we weren’t very close even when we did work together.

I wasn’t sure so told him I was very busy and dealing with some family matters, so I wasn’t in a place to meet up (which is true). He waited a few months and has now texted me again asking to chat in person or virtually.

My problem is this: I worry Hector is interested in a friendship or even relationship, and wants to meet up for social reasons. I, however, only see him as a professional contact and am not interested in meeting him. But, I’m really unsure how to communicate this without offending him or ruining our professional relationship.

And yes - I now realize it was a mistake to provide my cell and email :/

TLDR: a former coworker I has reached out to me over 5 times by email and text asking to meet or catch up. I gave him (and others) my contact for professional reasons only and am not interested in a social relationship. Am I being presumptuous to think he’s reaching out socially? How do I communicate my stance to him without burning a bridge?"

After spending 10 years in a company where I was overworked and I overproduced compared to my peers, I was passed over for promotion twice in favor of peers I literally trained. Besides kissing as\*es, these two colleagues had what some people would call the advantage of having the right skin tone... They didn't want to promote me and not ""loose"" me either...

I left that toxic job for a company where I loved and looked up to the boss. I accepted that new role even though I am underpaid compared to other similar roles in that large company (my department doesn't make as much money). The new role offered a $15,000 pay bump in a nice company culture. It also let me get away from my old toxic job and I don't have to bail them out anymore (I enjoy when clients and former colleagues reach out to let me know how bad it is getting). So I feel some loyalty for the company.

Two months into my new role, shocker, my new boss resigns. I am now in my third months with the company, and I am getting several leads and resources to apply for some roles in my dream industry with a likely pay bump in $20 - $40,000 from what I am making. My mentors in that industry encourage me to start applying for roles but I still feel conflicted because I have been in my current role for just few months and the team has just been nice to me.

Should I go ahead and apply for positions in my dream (and high paying) industry and leave the company if I get an offer even though it will leave a bad impression in that team with very low turnover ?"

I find that the value I offer my clients is increasingly diminishing so I find my career both unfulfilling and at high risk of automation. I've been thinking for several months that it might be more fulfilling to educate and train myself for a skillset to help financial institutions in the future to integrate AI models into parts of their operations.

E.g. Help train a chatbot to act within compliance to effectively extract needed information for a mortgage application; or; help develop parameters for an AI to flag potential problems outside bank policy when reviewing documents like statements. 

Basically a job that can use my experience in banking and will then value my skillset in understanding and integrating AI.

For someone with no experience in programming - what would this trajectory look like? I.e. where should I start in learning and does a job like that already exist? I can maintain my current income with only around 10 hours of work each week, so the rest of the time can go towards educating myself. Appreciate any help you guys can give me!"

I started working at this company 8 months ago and having it be my first job and all, I was super happy to get my career started.

Turns out, job wasn’t as interesting as I expected (it literally sucks the life out of me and I work with people nearing retirement). This has been showing in my work and my manager has been overly harsh towards it. It’s over little things I get wrong and she starts singing words of criticism. I’m not denying that work must be done correctly but she’ll send me paragraphs in an email of criticism over a mistake (more than 4 times already)

I sent her a message asking what it takes to get promoted and will probably get a response soon. Was this a bad move ?  I honestly believe she’s a hater or has some issues in her personal life (she told me about her divorce 25 years ago and hasn’t been with anyone since).

2,2023-01-15,Should I quit a job I just recently started because of broken promises?,u/Competitive_Bull4335,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10d5bxj/should_i_quit_a_job_i_just_recently_started/,careerguidance,"Hello everybody,

I  (45 years old) recently started a new job just to find out my role  has   been cut in half since I talked to the CEO that hired me some time   ago.   The job therefore does not match the description in the  contract   anymore and of course is also a significantly reduced role (less people to manage and less responsibilities)  from what  was  discussed in the interview. 

This  means that the new job is not really an advancement in my career, but  the bigger issue that I have is that I was informed of this on my first  day. Even then I was only after I specifically asked what happened to  the rest of the unit was I told about the restructuring. The business  unit I was supposed to lead was cut in three parts  (two smaller ones  around 25% and a bigger one 50% approximately), of   which I m leading  the bigger one. I have raised the issue with the CEO, but he basically  told me the company was restructured after the contract was signed and  it is what it is. He told me to make the best of the situation. He gave  me vague possibilities for advancement and told me I made a very good  impression, but it is hard to believe after the first issue.

The  fixed salary remains the same and  is more than enough to live on. There is also still more  than enough for me to do, but it is simply  not what I was promised.  Bonuses will be more limited though.

My  main issue is that it is causing me to doubt the whole decision and    of course it makes it hard to trust the company.  I kind of got demoted before I even started, because this   restructuring  happened after they hired me for this specific role.  Nobody brought this up while I was relocating and setting  myself up in  the area. No phone call, no heads up, nothing till the first day. I would have expected a proper meeting about this, which did not happen.

The main switching point for me was the increase in responsibilities and ability to shape.  There is also no on-boarding process in place,  which  is also concerning. My  motivation is obviously also taking a hit  from  this.

Am  I overreacting and should I just swallow the pill? I do have other  options, but quitting a   job that I just started in a leadership  position seems to be too   drastic, but trying talk them into changing  their minds is even worse. I  do not see that happening as well, since the CEO was very firm in the  talk. The rest of the business unit is also in a way worse state than expected, which means I will probably  have my hands full anyway. 

Any advice on how I should tackle this situation?"

# They are hardly ever creative. You spend 20% of that being creative and the rest, being technical .So, these sorts of fields are not marketed truthfully. (UX design)

# High wage but less creativity and lots of competitors (Software engineering, UX/UI design)

That said, I have limitations that prevent from from commuting, so if I ever wanted to try and get a job, it would have to be remote. I also can't work for wages, as my condition prevents me from keeping a regular sleep / wake schedule and regular hours.

I’m a landscape architect in Australia who works part time. I earn $38 and hour (charge out rate $165) for a large commercial firm. I have a lot of experience and skills in the field, but I’ve grown to hate it. 

I’m tired of sitting at a desk all day. I can’t work full time as the stress is too much for my mental health, and I need to work school hours (9-2.30pm/4 days/20 hours). My current weekly salary ($760 before tax) is barely enough to cover my mortgage and basic living costs. 

Between being miserable at a desk and hating the pressure of deadlines, I’m ready to throw in the towel. It is also very important to me that I develop and pass on real life skills. 

I like physical work and I love being outside. I grew up on a farm and have a good basic knowledge construction, plants, permaculture and garden maintenance. 

My desire is to start up a gardening business, with a view to growing into consulting and design of small productive spaces. This would make me very happy. My concern is that I won’t be able to match my wage. 

I figure I could charge out basic gardening/maintenance at around $45 an hour. Design work/drawings more like $100. Keeping in mind I don’t want to do landscape architecture, which can have a higher charge out rate but brings a whole lot of complexity with it. 

I know it would be physically intensive, and I want that. Assuming I can get 20 hours a week I would almost be breaking even (realising I need to allow for overheads) and have the benefit of the physical work. 

Can anyone offer insight into this? Do you think I could wrangle 20-25 hours a week? Would it be a foolish move given I could advance my career and earn more, albeit hating it along the way?

I live in Newcastle, so a very populated area with loads of potential clients. My kids are at the end of primary school and becoming more independent

I work independently for a very senior manager and although he gladly assigns me work, he has little to do with ‘line managing‘ me.  The whole organisation (a government agency) has become like this during the pandemic.  My post is a substantive, full time job.

i turn 65 this month, and where I live, there is no mandatory retirement age (I verified this with HR and they said, work as long as you like, we are glad to have you).

I was shocked though when the business manager (who allocates all offices in the building) came into my office this week and said I would need to find somewhere to hotdesk since my office was needed by another (unspecified) employee.  I asked if there was a hot desk space to use, and she said, ‘find one yourself’.  There are none available, since the various managers who conteol those rooms are not interested in accommodating someone who doesn't report to them.  I have asked every single manager, and each one has said sorry, no,space.

So, I am basically being thrown out of the building and have no choice but to work from home.  This is a problem since I do need a place to hard wire to the computer system periodically to receive updates on my laptop, and to base myself for project related meetings.

I have never embarked on legal proceedings but feel this is a thinly disguised attempt by them to push me out due to age.

My old employer wants me to come back.  But they've filled all current long term positions, or so they say, and are only offering contract roles at this point.  The initial period would be 6 months.  I know they have other work in the pipeline that could justify keeping, but it's not guaranteed.  
I was pretty frustrated working there, and felt I was being passed over for advancement opportunities.  Did I deserve to advance?  Maybe not.  But after I left many people were promoted, so it's hard to say if I  might have been one of them had I stayed.  


Has anyone returned to an employer you previously left out of frustration and had a better experience the second time?  Management is largely the same as it was before, as turnover amongst management is pretty low, so I'm not sure my experience would be that much different."

The problem is that I have no idea what I want to do, and the Australian system isn't particularly great for that. See, unlike in the U.S where you go into college and get to pick and swap your majors and minors (I think), in Australia you basically have to choose your degree from the get-go, and while you can change degrees, my understanding is that it's not easy. 

What do you think would be some good degrees and careers to consider? I'm quite into my science subjects (chemistry and physics) but would want my day to day work to be highly people and communication focussed. For this reason, I've been leaning toward Undergraduate Medicine, but it's a highly competitive field to get into, and I may just be setting myself up for disappointment as the odds are not in my favour."

Turning 25 this year and I'm feeling really lost with regard to career prospects. Just wondering if there are any people who've previously worked in hospitality transition into SWE. What was your experience like? I'm based in NYC if that helps.   


I understand that many people do go to university. I once did, but for photography, which (portraiture) is something I still do today. To support myself, I've taken lots of jobs within the hospitality/retail  pretty much all my life after dropping out (or getting kicked out? still confused on that one). I eventually found myself working in a 3 michelin star restaurant after all these years, but I'm through with hospitality. Great money, but I can't stand it anymore. 

Currently taking coursework on SWE and trying to be competent in a few languages including HTML5/CSS/Javascript and hope to learn Python in the future. I'm not sure what the demand is like for these particular languages, I just want to learn something new and practical, while also playing guitar and taking photos which is my true passion."

Context: I’m a recent college grad from the #1 public university in the U.S. (go bears) with a BA in psychology. This will be my first “real” job related to my degree. I did work on the board of a mental health organization on campus though if that counts for anything

Here are my qualms:

• the pay is so low- like I’d barely make more than I was while working at a cafe. The job is definitely going to be more intense, I’ll have to commute to work, and I have a college degree- but the difference is literally less than a dollar. I already accepted my offer letter that listed the pay but is there any way I could still negotiate a pay raise? And if so, how would I even go about that?

• dress code!!! I have no idea what is considered work appropriate at a psych ward. I saw people dressed very casually on the day I interviewed but my role will technically be under the “nursing” department- do I have to wear scrubs ? If so, will my job pay for my scrubs or recommend where I can buy work appropriate attire ? My only frame of reference is a relative who works for an airline- his job paid for new work shoes (just regular sneakers), and compensate anything he buys for work like gloves, new pants, uniform, etc.

• when agreeing to the job I confirmed I can work one 8-hour shift a week (which I thought was strange) but my offer letter says I’m 1) an on call employee and 2) should anticipate a workweek of 16hrs. That’s not what I initially agreed to so which should I expect to adhere to?

I have worked for my current employer for just under 6 months and my probation is coming up. The job is absolutely dreadful and I was hired on the principle that it would have been a hybrid position (it’s not, they changed their mind so I have to commute every day). The expectations of my line manager are too high and after only three months I had a Continuous Development Review where she basically stated she was expecting more from me etc… I was not expecting it and the workload is absolutely dreadful. I didn’t sign anything, she didn’t score me out of ten, I didn’t receive any written follow up and she didn’t set KPIs. Nothing about my performance was mentioned after that.

Since then my mental health has gone downhill and I have decided to apply for new jobs, and got a great offer on the table. I am waiting for the contract to arrive to resign before my probation ends but I am absolutely terrified by the background checks and verifications.

If I had failed in any area, missed a deadline or had a terrible attitude I could understand some of the issues I am having. I don’t know what to do here. I need the money and the insurance. 

Back story: 
• I’m a team lead. 
• Work from Home
• Love my job
• Hate my managers management style
• There are only 3 of us with no direct reports
• The year time requirement before I can swap departments is up in a month. 
• I am seriously great at my job.
• I ask every week in my touchbase with my manager and supervisor if there is anything I am failing at, and they say “no, you’ve exceeded every expectation so far; you’re perfect.”

Issues:
• After, I presented the idea to both of them she said she would “casually bring it up to the director and the AVP to lay the ground work for my big proposal. To submit only a sub section of it in an effort to later build upon it because I was thinking in 2030.” My boss stole my idea, submitted a proposal with her name on it, and told my supervisor not to discuss it with me at all.
• I work a dual position where I also report to another manager. My manager doesn’t like this and consistently has made statements about “overwhelming me with work so I can’t do both”. 
• She asks for daily lists of what I will be doing, and when I ask ‘why’ she just responds with “I’m the manager”. 
• They consistently tell me how my director, the AVP, and COO are the ones who wanted me in my position. How I wasn’t either of their first picks for the role, and that they felt like I was pushed off on them. 

Specific questions:
• Should I go to my director, HR, or wait out my month?
• Is this as terrible as I feel it is or is it that my feelings are hurt?"

1,2023-01-16,Should I stick with it or try something new?,u/sdnn_,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10dfn8r/should_i_stick_with_it_or_try_something_new/,careerguidance,"Hello, Im 22, currently studying dual degree in BSci and BEd in Secondary for Maths but in a dilemma whether I should continue or try something new.

For context, I’ve had a bit of interest in teaching since I was young but never had a huge passion in teaching. I’ve finished my 3rd year out of 5 and completed my first placement but been very drained by how much social energy I need to put in working with kids, parents and other educators. On top of that I’ve been overwhelmed by the amount of work that I have to put in in my initial years of teaching outside of paid hours (resource prep, marking, reporting, etc) and now have lost motivation in teaching. I’ve stopped tutoring as well and forgot maths teaching so my confidence is low as well although I’m sure I can work on these if I put in more effort. I can picture myself enjoying teaching once I get the skills over the years but its that initial 1-5yrs of teaching I'm stressed of if I'll make it through. So for now I'm for sure wanting to try something else before I stick with teaching as my career (so its kind of a last resort), but I’m in a serious dilemma as I don’t know exactly what else I want to try. So far I've thought of transferring to BSci first, however, at the same time, I feel like it would be a good idea to finish BEd as a backup plan (since BSci doesn't give good career prospects unless I complete Masters).

Below is 2 options I pulled out for now with pros and cons. I really want to make a wise decision as I don't want to be further behind and want to graduate/work asap (I guess not teaching for now). I would appreciate any advice from anyone who had any similar dilemma or experience 😞

**1) Drop BEd and transfer to BSci (approximate 1-1.5yrs left)**

* **Pro**: I get to explore something else earlier (only by 0.5-1 yrs tho)
* **Con**: The degree is pretty much useless and unlikely for me to secure a job unless I do postgrad. I don't mind doing postgrad but that gives me +2yrs of extra study. I also don't have clear idea what I want to try out (I only have a tiny bit of interest to try out IT, OT, radiography, or speech pathology) and have no guarantee whether I'll get into postgrad.
* **side note**: I can complete Masters of Teaching IF I do want to pick up education again at some point.

**2) Finish BEd/BSci (2yrs left)**

* **Pro**: I can secure professional accreditation as Teacher and have a backup plan (although no guarantee I'll be teaching later on).
* **Con**: I've lost motivation/confidence/passion in teaching. I can still attempt something new after (the postgrad options I listed above) completing BEd but am worried that I'll burn out during placements. Also have no guarantee whether I'll get into postgrad after."

I want to do a MBA-Finance so a GMAT of 700+ is necessary to compensate my bad scores + a good LOR. 
I'm thinking of getting a CFA L1 so that I get into the relevant jobs first &amp; climb up the ladder (as a portfolio analyst, equity research analyst, Asset management). 
We'll just clearing L1 doesn't guarantee a job but it might 50-50 chances. 

Before I apply to a B-School I need to have a career path and should show progress towards it, I just can't apply abroad without a work-ex in similar field. The admission panel will simply dismiss it at best, count it against me at worst since only thing it shows is you wasted a lot of time doing a certification which brings no value to your career. Also that certification will definitely help me get shortlisted among other candidates &amp; hopefully a PPO if performed well in summer internships. 

If i start from March I'll give the exam in Feb2024, also the GMAT is valid for 5yrs 
I'm dicey what should I attempt first ? GMAT/CFA. 
I thought of giving the CFA &amp; land a relevant job then give GMAT &amp; secure the clg.

They’ve communicated to me that they’re interested in me and have apologized for the delay exacerbated by the holiday season and the ongoing demands of the nonprofit sector. 

I have a final interview coming up after they talk to my references, but during my first interview a supervisor asked me if I’m comfortable doing work outside my job description. For those of you who don’t know, this is VERY common in the nonprofit sector, but it usually isn’t acknowledged upfront and ends up just happening by accident after you’re hired. 

The reason I’m still hanging on is because this job would let me move to the city I’m trying to move to and would be a excellent work and resume experience. It’s also a small reputable organization with what may just be sloppy management.

Stayed there for a month from Nov-Dec. Then I quit after learning I wasn't making it past probation and I had another job application where I was the final candidate. Learned I got put on hold status and recently it just got lifted. I got the job offer, was told by my referred person that I should just take the job offer as it is. But NYC just recently got the law in place where salary is posted on job posting, I checked it out, found out that in a different department but same position name that the job offer salary they offered was the bare minimum of the salary range.

I've been told by others I shouldn't negotiate since I've only had 1 year of working experience and lots  of volunteer experience isn't really 'work experience'. Also my referred person told me initially the job offer salary I was offered was pretty good and it was higher than his, he says they adjusted it due to inflation. Like originally back in Oct 2022, it was 60k-65k salary range (based on guesswork because the new law wasn't in effect yet). And my current job offer salary is 66.5k, but I guess now due to inflation it is now the 'minimum'. I'm basically like a new college graduate in terms of job experience XD, so I've been told I shouldn't negotiate at all in fear of losing the job offer and since Wall Street looks bad right now with everyone losing their jobs.

The job offer place is with a large insurance company that is downtown Manhattan, my father told me that I'm dealing with people who are higher up and deal with Wall Street. Just to take the job with the current offer. But I'm a bit confused because I know that in general people say ""always negotiate"".

So right now, (1) I'm not sure if I should negotiate and (2) I'm not sure how negotiations work especially for an entry level position as a new college graduate, any advice on how to negotiate since inflation is still kinda high right now? (3)Part of the reason why I want to negotiate is because I live in a toxic household so I want to become independent as soon as possible

In April of last year and after a miserable experience at my last job, I decided to quit and dedicate more time to perfecting my Front-End Web Dev Skills. I had studied already, but I needed more experience as I wanted a complete career path change. Yet I had hope since I know programming or IT in general is a very blooming field.

I have tried, after more studying, to get an unpaid internship or ANYTHING that will just allow me to put one foot inside this World. I know how it works and to get the wheel spinning, you generally need some experience. I have not found a single job post that didn't ask for 2 to 5 years of experience, even min wage. I don't know if I am looking in the wrong places, or haven't curated my profile enough.

I think one issue is my LinkedIn. Because I worked with a couple of CEOs directly they have added me, along with all subordinates, to their network. I would say this probably expanded my network significantly, because I've had a *rain* of offers to go back to being an Executive Assistant. The thing is I still hate the job as I did when I quit last year, and I feel if I take it, I will become permanently stuck in this career path. 

During these months I've been also handling other stuff I needed to such as health issues and getting a driver's license, even started writing a book which has been great. I wouldn't want to reach the 1 year without a job mark, though, and I'm starting to feel my chances in the IT Industry might not be so many after all. I don't have applied knowledge/experience and that's the main problem, but I do know how to code using HTML+CSS+Javascript+Angular and I am learning Typescript plus potentially another framework alternative to Angular just to have more skills.

What would be your advice in this case? Am I just doing a poor job with my applications, or looking in the wrong places? I am VERY used to interviews/resumes in my field, but I am a rookie with no one to give me some orientation when it comes to Front End Web. Thanks."

Certifications in things like COMPTIA, CISSP, CSSP, and so on are all very important certs that every person in the field should have at least 1 of. Would becoming certified in 2-3 or more guarantee me a decent entry job? Or do I drop the $20k and get an associates or bachelor's?

I want to go the cheaper route but I lack direction. Idk where to start or what to learn first. I started learning Python programming because I figured I would have to read scripts in C.S. anyway..

Back to my main point... The toxicity in my work environment has reached an all time high, and I just cannot do this anymore. I just spent the past 30 minutes being borderline berated for something completely out of my control. 


 I have been looking at job postings/applying and updating certifications for the past few months, but I don't have anything lined up yet. It doesn't help that I've been half-assing these efforts since I am already so burnt-out and tired all the time. I feel trapped.


I'm about to quit without anything else lined up. And honestly, I almost want to. I could use the mental and physical break from work. I'm upset and anxious all the time. I'm not suicidal, but my mental health is the worst it's been in a long time. I know it's risky to quit without anything lined up, but I'm in an ideal financial place to do it, and my spouse has a steady, higher paying job. We already practice living on one income as it is, and we finally have some decent savings. 


But how do I quit without giving too much info away? 


My boss and coworkers are nosy, and they will push to find out what I'm doing next/where I'll be working. If I say that I don't have anything else lined up (or that I'm focusing on my health, also true), they will get mad and critical of me leaving. Especially since it will be on the heels of two of my closest coworkers quitting without notice (one due to toxicity/micromanagement). I want to quit gracefully and give two weeks if I can.

I (23m) first started college at 18 after graduating. I was going to a big name university but switched to a community college after the pandemic because I just couldn’t afford to go back without taking out big loans (I honestly don’t trust the Biden Admin to forgive student loans, not because they aren’t trying but because there’s too big of a Republican push against anything positive in this administration).

Anyway I always wanted to get my business management degree and I should have it by this fall. My problem is I’m not sure if it’s gonna be worth it. I want to get my residential property management certificate after because I think it’s a decent industry to be in (and because it’s only 6 or 7 more classes) but I’m not sure if it’ll be a good route now.

I would go the government route but I applied for TSA and was rejected because I admitted to smoking weed (I didn’t want to lie on a federal application because I did have a lease violation for it in 2019 so if push came to shove it could’ve blown back on me). Now that 2024 is a year away I think that it is an option but I don’t want to be dependent on that as a route.

I do have a passion for baking but I’ve never put much thought into how I’d start up a business like that. Like I know I’d do catering only but I just don’t have a niche if that makes sense. I make great cheesecakes but with cottage food laws things can get tricky fast so I’d need other recipes to depend on just in case.

Throwaway since I don't need co-workers knowing about this, and if this is not the right place to be asking please let me know where I can post this.

I'm in a bit of an odd place as my immediate manager is leaving and I AM considered for his replacement, my Director (managers boss) has asked me to prepare what I'm looking for and expecting as far as the role, duties, compensation, etc. I have a meeting with him this week 1 on 1.

I've never really done this as most of my increases have come from job hopping, but I'm at the point in my life where if I can get what I am worth and stay where I'm at (I really do like it here) I'd rather stay.

I have been looking at salary.com mainly to see what the title pays in my area, I take that with a grain of salt but I'm sort of using that as a baseline, do I write up a letter stating the title I expect (they already have it setup with HR as the position already exists), pay salary and how many people working under me? I've been here 8 years so I don't know what I need to add to thism they obviously see some worth as they are considering me for the position.

I want to walk in there prepared to defend my request and why I feel I'm worth that.

Or is this more of a sit down and just tell him I expect this salary, this title, report to him and have xxx people below me? I fully expect them to counter offer, but I'd like to account for inflation, title change and expectation with this, rather than let them come to me with something much lower than market."

I am a data analyst with 1y6m of working experience. I am currently trying to find a job in Germany for better future prospects. I know relocating to a western country from a third world Asian country is very very difficult. I have been on the job hunt for the past ~6 months now. I did get a couple of interviews but it always ended up with rejections. I have reformatted my cv multiple times. I have listed all of the important skills on my resume and mentioned important numbers to grab the attention as well. I have also connected with the recruiters on LinkedIn and messaged a couple of them too. I just can't figure out what I am doing wrong. I apply left and right and all I'm getting is automated rejections. It's been very demotivating. In my local country there isn't any market for data analytics. So it's harder here as well to switch to a better opportunity.

I just need some guidance on how to target the European market. Because I can't figure out what I am doing wrong or what needs to be done. My peers with same experience and credentials as mine have gotten offers. Maybe they just got lucky. I don't know. I think luck does play an integral part but putting in efforts plays an even greater role.

Hi All,

I am looking to quit my current job. Things are not going so well and it has also damaged my confiedence and I dont know if I want to work in product management anymore. Before work went down hill , I was looking to work a job with less hours or even part time(Mom). Are there any jobs that I can transition into given my experience ?

Things I liked or tolerated well

* gathering specs
* being a subject matter expert
* documentation
* research
* any task oriented project

Things I really hated

* Selling a idea
* bogus / unrealistic timeline or roadmap
* constant knee jerk reaction to eveything and changing priority for minor and irrelvant things
* unclear feedback or expectation
* lack of support
* understaffed teams

Reason for quiting

* got demoted into support
* a ratational schedule between 3 shifts from 9am-midnight, (understaffed in this team as well)
* general feeling of unhappiness and demoralization

It has been this way for a month now and I still want to leave everyday even after alot of the anger and sadness has faded. My husband is willing to foot the bill for a while and if I really need to I only need 1500 a month to balance our books at our current level of spending and probably 600 if we consever."

We are both self-employed and had to restart our careers out here. We have a 2 year old and we are still renting.

$240 Wifi + Utilities 
$175 car maintenance 
$170 phone
$280 Car 1 payment

$250 My Business Expenses
$100 charity

*Our spending budget takes care of random things we might need/are unexpected and also anything fun (ex. plane tix, movies, picking up batteries, etc) We try not to use all of it and put it towards savings.

**$880 is in minimum payments and the rest is extra we put towards it every month. I know, it’s a lot."

My wife and I would like to move to the panhandle between Pensacola and Tallahassee to be closer to family. She is a physical therapist so won't have an issue finding a job I imagine. Though when we move I have no desire to stay in the law enforcement field. I make almost 100K a year now but those wages are not close to the same up in the panhandle nor do I want this quality of life for my family especially when we have children. We also want to get away from the big city and live in an area that public schools are actually safe to send our children to.

&amp;#x200B;

I already hold a bachelors in finance but it is from 7 years ago. I also have a masters in public admin from 2019. I have no practical work experience outside of law enforcement. I am kind of at a cross roads as to what career I could pursue that would make me decent money and allow me to get a job in an area not nearly as business centered as Tampa. I have considered something in finance but I don't feel like I qualify for most jobs as I have zero experience in anything relevant. I have considered going back to school for a master's in accounting to become CPA eligible but I am also not to sure on the job market over there. Law school would be nice but that would be three years of me likely not working and most attorney's aren't making big money even several years after law school to justify the debt likely incurred. I'm just feeling super lost and unqualified to do anything new that would provide me a salary that wouldn't cause us to struggle.

&amp;#x200B;

We own our house in Tampa now that we plan to keep and rent out when we move. We also own a duplex out of state which provides minimal income as it is only one property. In our ideal world we will expand our real estate portfolio as rapidly as possible to provide significant additional income to compensate for my likely loss of income for a few years.

Ok so it’s my first year getting a end of year performance bonus at my current company, and I’ve just heard from my colleagues (who aren’t really sure either but that’s been the word floating around) that our bonus will be paid into our monthly salary instead of a one time lump sum cash payment…. That’s the most bizarre thing I’ve ever heard. I was talking with family members about this and they said they’ve never seen it done this way either… they always got a one time cash payment, like it’s supposed to be…. What do you guys think? Isn’t this such a big ripoff? When someone works hard for a year and their hard earned bonus money will be split into tiny small amounts every month…. That’s just not right to me… but then again I don’t have much experience in this subject, so I’m looking for opinions and thoughts from everybody. Thank you.

This is also not to be confused with annual salary increases, which we do get separately. But isn’t this more like a major ripoff salary increase instead of an actual bonus?"

I am a female in my late twenties living in an expensive east coast city. I currently occupy a high-level position at a nonprofit doing social justice advocacy work. But, as you’d expect since I’m posting here, I’m looking to make a change. I’ve been in this field for four years, but have been miserable for the last year or so. I kept telling myself things would get better: if only I get that raise, it’ll make the traveling, stress, and long hours worth it. When the new president starts, I was so hopeful things will be different. If only I finish that next project, this job will become, at the very least, tolerable.

It’s been a year and nothing’s changed. My responsibilities have only become more and more burdensome (though admittedly with that have come pay increases), and my mental and physical health have dramatically suffered. I am no longer passionate about what I’m doing, and I want out. 

I’m frantically applying to other jobs, but nothing seems to be coming through. I’m not eating well, not sleeping, my hair is starting to fall out, and I never feel like I can breathe (for those who might be wondering, yes I’m currently seeing a mental health professional for extra support). My work performance has suffered because of how stressed I am, and my boss has started to notice. 

I’m interested in going to seminary and becoming a priest (I work in faith-based organizing, so it’s not a huge surprise or leap). My plan was to hold on to this job until I can start school in about a year, particularly since I’m making really good money (80k). 

But I don’t know if I can do it. 

Is it foolish to leave without another job lined up? Everything I’ve read warns against it, and “conventional wisdom” as far as I’ve heard has been it is a complete no-no. I’m not opposed to working a job entirely outside my field in the interim (ex. working at a restaurant, dog walking, something like that), but would ultimately like something within a church or with greater financial stability. I have some money saved up, but not enough to make it more than a couple of months at the most. I'm not in a position where my family can offer me a financial safety net, so if I ran out, I'd be in bad shape.

Please, any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. I’m literally crying as I write this post. I hate feeling this way."

She's getting older and towards the end of her working life, but still needs to make money.

She has tons of experience, and when I say that her work ethic is incredible I mean that she is a force of nature that absolutely baffles me at how effective she is as a human being.  


She has lots of work experience, but it hasn't translated into something sustainable despite some really incredible successes.   


\- She co-founded a beverage company, which she ran for a decade  
\- She had a restaurant that she opened and managed for a decade, which spun off two other locations that she also ran  
\- She's ran various catering companies  
\- She's ran a successful cleaning company  


But the reality is that, due to financial hardship, she hasn't been able to save money, and many of her businesses ended up going under, which ends creating some weird gaps on her resume and being a little difficult to navigate.

She's very smart, very capable, and very motivated, I'm just not sure if retraining, or finding something that pays the bills is the correct option.

Between the long hours and lack of professional development opportunities, I'd like to move to another industry, but have no idea where to start.

When I try to reach out to folks on LinkedIn, I either don't get a response, or am told to stay in fundraising or move to sales, which is not what I see for my career path. 

If it helps, I'm more interested in research roles, or museums/archival roles (I have a degree in museum studies).

We are a startup company and in August of 2022 we transitioned into a new product. SEO Marketing and lead generation.

Now since then, my opportunities to upsell have fallen drastically. Now I get it, its a new product and we are able to sell it but we seem to have trouble scaling it. For the longest time, I would like to think I've been loyal and understanding of this transition and how it effects my income. But as time progresses, I just don't know if I see the vision anymore. I haven't had a big check in months and i have a daughter to care for and its nerve racking to think about my future when the opportunities are limited. I am 23 tears old and this is my first ""Big Boy Job"" and have been at this company for a little over 2 years so i wonder if i am being naïve or is this just the way the market is?

I understand Real Estate in general isn't doing good either which doesn't help. They have also added other responsibilities like cancellation prevention and failed transactions which again, I understand you have to keep me busy but what am I really doing here? I also feel as if my role isn't really defined and I'm bouncing around doing all sorts of stuff. I am contemplating looking for a new job but my question is what's the SaaS job market like? Should I stick it out at this company? Is anyone experiencing something similar? Is it worth sticking out? I want to SELL, I want to GROW, I know I am capable and the hunger is seeping through my skin. Any veterans of the industry, your feedback is greatly appreciated."

In my despair, I even tried doing the 16 personalities test, thinking it might help me out. I am supposedly an INFP, which should be suitable for psychology, therapist, counselor, HR, and similar jobs, but my mental health would not allow me to pursue that, as I am dealing with trauma (:

I love doing art and being creative, but that is also not something that would pay my bills with stability, I worry. 

Currently, I am working in service industry, and it is killing me both mentally and physically, as it is quite demanding, especially when working longer hours and it gets busy. 

I know this is probably not much to base any career advice on, but I am trying whatever option of getting some advice at this point.

Hi all-I would like to move my work location to a city where my gf &amp; family lives. I have been in my current location for about a year and have worked for the company for about 1.5 years (WFH during covid). Graduated college in 2021 and started right after.

Context: I work for a huge company that has multiple locations in the market I want to move to. My boss is at the director level in our org and has a lot of pull. He works in a totally different location, so it isn’t like I would be leaving him. We go in the office 3 days a week but even when in the office there is almost no in person meetings/benefit to being there. I would go in the office in the new location also. I would ask my boss this week at my performance review. We just had a team member leave the company, so I would think they wouldn’t want to lose another which could work in my favor… thoughts?"

I also like the idea of event planning so basically like event planning but for projects/businesses. 

I’m graduating in May with a psych degree and I’m mostly applying for restaurant management jobs because that’s where I have experience. I’m hoping to take a pmp course this summer and get certified before the year ends. 

I’m not sure what I should be looking for to get into this field or if this is the right job name for the job description. When I look up jobs for project management I mostly see construction/engineering which requires engineering and construction degrees/knowledge. Is there something different I could be searching or looking for or does anyone have any recommendations for getting into this type of job? I’d also love any kind of certification course recommendations.

Edit: Just adding, an ideal job for me would be “restaurant project management”. Like working with a business to open new sites, improve existing ones, manage the various teams and business operations. Something like that, not sure if that is project management?

I keep switching to completely different roles/professions because I get bored and want to learn something new, or because I keep hoping a different type of job will keep me more engaged (yes, I have ADHD; yes, I’m getting treated). At least I have lots of different technical skills as a result. It worries me that I’m not young anymore and still sincerely asking myself what I want to be when I grow up. 

I like working in media, but am worried about future job prospects in a shrinking industry and also about making less than I currently do in future roles (I need to make &gt;$80k). I have had fun working in early-stage startups before because of the pace and variety, but I find much of tech to be kind of demoralizing and I just don’t want to work on another jerk’s poorly-thought-out startup idea. 

I’m willing to learn new skills (I’m good at that) or even go for another degree. 

I’m curious about economics or data analytics, but worried about getting bored again and also unsure what types of jobs are out there. 

Ultimately, I feel like I’m kind of a weird fit for a lot of jobs, but also very useful in those situations where I find the right job. People keep telling me I’m so smart, but I feel like even if I am, there’s no point to it if I can’t use it well. There have been times when I have been able to use my abilities and really shine, but I just wish I could find/engineer those situations more reliably. 

Anyway, sorry this is so long. Here’s a list of things that tend to bring out the best in me vs things I don’t like. Any ideas for fields I should look into? Thanks all! 

Things I like

* Helping people answer interesting questions 
* Communicating complex things to others; boiling things down to an understandable metaphor or a compelling narrative 
* Learning about different areas of business, policy, science, etc 
* Doing qualitative research 
* Working with quantitative data 
* Making connections among different fields, disciplines, or topics; big-picture thinking; strategic insights 
* Learning how to do something I’ve never even seen before 
* Working with people regularly (not necessarily all the time) 
* Figuring out a solution to a problem on the fly 
* Making an impact; feeling like I helped or made someone’s job easier 
* Short-term projects 
* Making more than $80k 

Things I don’t like

* Doing the same type of thing over and over again 
* Being isolated; rarely getting to speak to another human 
* Feeling like my work is totally pointless and doesn’t either help anyone or satisfy my curiosity 
* Lots of bureaucracy; impossible to experiment, try things, take risks, make an impact 
* Being stuck doing something very narrow and technical and never being able to think broadly or strategically or make any connections between multiple areas 
* Projects that never end, or that keep getting killed"

I'm looking for a job with a flexible schedule. TLDR at the end.

Once upon a time I worked as a per diem med tech at a hospital. I didn't like my job. Which is why I don't still have it. But I LOVED my schedule. By the 5th of each month, I would have to put in my availability for the following month. By the 10th, my schedule for the next month (starting the 1st) would be available to see. If I wanted to work more, there was almost always an opportunity to pick up more shifts at the last minute. I was only required to work 4 shifts a month minimum, but could get away with taking up to 6 months off if I really wanted to. I normally worked 50 hours a week for 3 weeks then took a week off each month. But really, I could do damn near anything I wanted.

I had state sponsored health insurance and I paid about 300 a month for it but my job paid per diem staff more so I could afford it without an issue, so not being full time wasn't an issue.

I fucking loved that schedule flexibility.

I didn't love that specific job though. I get sick really easily and working in a hospital filled with sick people seemed to not be an ideal fit haha.

So I'm coming to you all because I am looking for a similar job schedule and have no idea what other careers do this. Everything else seems to be one of the following:

\-Same 4-6 days every week.

\-Max 2 weeks off a year.

\-Schedule decided for you at the last minute with no input

\-Mandatory overtime

The list goes on. My literal hell is working a 9-5 schedule.

I'm open to a lot. I have a high risk tolerance, don't need to be home every night, and am good at pretty much anything I put my mind to, except not getting every flu/RSV/cold/covid virus that comes through the hospital apparently. I'd rather not be gone for more than a couple weeks at a time though. 3 months max. Fine with taking out loans for going back to school or pursuing training.

Huge bonus points if the job you suggest isn't a super niche job that can only be done in one city for one employer.

I have this issue of getting too attached to the projects I work on for companies, like right now, at my current job we're developing a game that is going to be released this year, and I have already spent a year and a half helping promoting it and building our community around it.

I asked my boss for a raise today and he said that he needs a week to think about it and then I propsed that we change my work contract to a B2B freelance contract so I can make more money and he agreed.

So my question is, should I stay at my current job where I am comfortable and MAYBE get a raise, or should I enter a new booming industry with a very ambitious company for more money?"

I’m currently working as a data analyst at a company I’ve been at for a year and eight months. I made an internal transfer to the analytics department 7 months ago getting paid $30/hour (62k a year) and was recently promoted January 1st of this year to Data Analyst to 85k/year salary with a 5k stipend for commuting purposes. This is my only experience with data analysis. 

A smaller competitor reached out to me and offered 100k(total comp) after a referral and a phone call. I would be the sole data analyst working with less advanced technologies (currently writing queries out of a data lake using SQL and doing visualizations in PBI). The new position would be mostly out of Excel, but they said I would have their full support in implementing a more advanced system. They also said they would review my comp at the 6 month mark if I can create value with my analysis. I believe this promise to be true because of some friends who work there were treated this way. 

Having a tough time deciding what to do. The benefits are similar, although my current company offers a 401k with a 3% match on the full contribution and an additional 2% match on 50% of your contribution. Hybrid on both roles with similar commute, similar job security, both have good working environments and WLB. 

I am hesitant to present this offer to my current company since I’ve heard some people be replaced after using an offer to increase their salary. I’ve learned everything I know in my current role and would bring similar ideas to the new one. I feel like I can succeed there, but I’m lost with this decision. Anyone have any advice?"

I keep moving jobs and careers to keep trying to get ahead in life but the goal post keeps moving further and further. I graduated with a degree in Biochemistry and worked for a while synthesizing pharmaceuticals, cleanroom and biosafety cabinet certification, and as an analytical chemist.

Not wanting to be stuck in the lab forever with a paltry salary and little future prospects, I made a lateral move and switched to IT. Worked at a ski resort in IT, got my Net+ and Sec+, and eventually landed a remote gig supporting a SaaS application used in the pharmaceutical industry.

Looking forward, I'm not sure where to take things next. I've been teaching myself python and have been using it to automate a majority of my current role. I've always been interested in learning programming and find the problem solving to be rewarding.  I was recently priced out of Colorado after having lived there for 5 years and *longing* to live there for 20+, needless to say I am devastated and want to make as much money as humanly possible while remaining remote.

Currently, I'm considering data scientist, cloud engineer, python dev, or lab automation/implementation consulting, hell, even pre-sales - all within the biotech/pharma space since I think I have an interesting blend of experiences that will make me more valuable at that intersection. Or perhaps I don't and I'm just trying to make my life fit that narrative.

I received an offer from a company which operates in a vertical that I’ve been in the past and enjoyed. It’s a niche industry and relatively unknown but is massive in its own way. The kicker is that the offer is roughly $20k less than what I’m earning, no signing bonus and to get to their offices, I’ll have to buy a car. I live in Ontario, Canada, in a condo so I have to account for gas and parking as well. 

The other kicker is that if I leave my current role, I’ll have to pay back $20k I received in a signing bonus. New offer doesn’t have a signing bonus. 

Current role is kinda boring and dreary. But good money and office isn’t far from my condo. 
New offer is exciting work in an industry I’d love to grow in but compensation just isn’t up to par. 

I’ve negotiated and their last offer was the max they could go up to ($20k less than current). Any advice or thoughts?"

I'm in my early 40s and have been working in the IT sector for the past few years. I got diagnosed with an eye condition a few months ago, so I need to make a career change. I have about 40 college credits, prior military (telecommunications sector, no security clearance), in a relationship with no kids, and I have 7 months left on my GI Bill (free college). I am about 20k in debt that I'm slowly slimming down.

I'm meeting with a few local academic advisors next week; however, I would love to get suggestions from here :)

My history: 8 years property management, 7 years telecommunications, grad from IT &amp; HVAC tech schools.

What I love: Nature (and helping it!), animals, helping people, eating semi-healthy, camping, and working out.

For what it's worth, I loved the Humanities while I was in school. I was dealing with PTSD when I was enrolled thou so I had to drop out. I'm not back to 100% but I'll make due. 

So far, the programs that appeal to me the most are (in order): A.S. in Physical Therapy Assistant, yoga training, personal trainer, and massage therapy. The only one I would need to pay out of pocket would be the A.S. which, of course, is what I'm most interested in lol &gt;&lt; 

I could put my GI Bill towards the A.S. leaving me with about 10k out of pocket. The big problem would be the lack of funds from not working while in school for about 17 months. The debt I currently have already is causing me a headache. 

Of course, I could go one of the other routes for now and explore the A.S. path in the future when I'm in a better place financially. Being in my 40s though, well it can still be done. 

Any advice, suggestions or questions are appreciated. Thank you for your time :D"

As such, my resume is very long in its current form, reading more as a chronology of past activities and responsibilities within an organisation. As removing content literally 'removes content'; what tips can help me reduce its size, keep it punchy and relevant, without losing too much detail.

Any tips or advice and helping me to shrink down my CV would be greatly appreciated."

I have been in the childcare field for almost 10 years and I make $15 an hour. I stayed in the field this long because I am good at the work and enjoy it. However, i know it is time for me to leave as I am feeling less valued and cannot live on my own at this pay. There is also no room for growth where I am at.

I am having difficulties seeing my skills as transferable to a more ""professional"" field. I would love a work from home job. I am interested in technology, professional writing, customer service, proofing, editing, and design. I have a bachelor's degree in advertising, but I have decided I do not want to pursue a career at an ad agency. However I did gain knowledge of a lot of Adobe software (illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, etc.) that I am interested in using in the future.

I am also open to taking some courses or working towards a certification if that would increase my chances at a better job. 

Is there a job out there that would value my skills and not mind my limited experience with ""desk jobs""? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

My last interview was about 3 weeks ago, and last week I had reached out to the recruiter to see if there were any updates on the role. A week later and no response.

My dad got laid off from his last sales job a few months ago and he's been having a hard time finding a new job. He's in his 50s, and he has like 30 years of sales experience but he has no degree and that makes it harder for him to find a job. He's gotten burnt out of applying for sales jobs and he doesn't really want to do it any more.

I'm trying to help him find something new but it hasn't been easy. He works from home, he lives kind of out in the middle of nowhere and does not want to move into a city. He also has a lot of at home responsibilities which I can't help with because I don't live there. He also can't stand for too long so he can't do things like mechanic work.

I was going to suggest sales manager or director but he doesn't want to be in a management position. I've also suggested insurance claims adjusting as I heard that it pays decent (he can't take some 30k a year job) and you can work at home.

Does anyone else have any suggestions that I can pass along to him that he can try? Thanks!!!"

I struggle with maths but on the other hand I’m extremly passionate about politics and history and I can easly write an essay about any political and history stuff. I also understand and memorise things about history and politics extremly easly with basically no effort.

Now I know that to be  a doctor I have to struggle with some type of subjects but it’s extremly frustranting that I cannot memorise or understand most of the things which are pretty basic.

The thing is I only see myself as a doctor and I don’t think I’d like to do any other job. 

The question is, should I pursue with these subjects and go into medicine and see if I enjoy it or should I change them?

I feel like changing subjects would only be a short time fulfilment of a life long struggle, but can I graduate Med school while struggling with basic things?"

My background is in manufacturing and quality control management and now I cant even a call back for those types of roles. I know the job market is a bit of a mess but instead of blaming that I have come to the conclusion that I must be the problem and am doing this wrong.

Listed below is a set of questions that I would appreciate any feedback on and hopefully someone else out there that is going through the same battle can find useful as well.

* When applying at bigger companies, the automated system seems to be rejecting my application at 3am. How were you able to get past the Applicant Tracking System (ATS)? Did you just copy keywords onto your resume?
* How many applications did it take for you to finally get a call back/interview?
* Did you apply directly through a companies career page or did you reach out via LinkedIn?
* What did you do when you felt like giving up after a long period of being unsuccessful?
* From the time you began to finally landing a job; how long did it take?

These are more broad questions but I would be happy to go more into my particular situation if anyone is interested.

I posted before about how I gave my notice a week ago because my work quality has really been dropping. This week I was supposed to wrap everything up, give my unfinished drafts and a list of things assigned to me to my boss. Out of nowhere my immediate boss told me today that it's in everyone's best interest if I just leave now. They will pay me for the rest of the week and even for my remaining vacation leaves, but when I offered to finish up the drafts and send what I could so as to not leave anyone hanging, they insisted that I leave right away and don't bother. So I left my laptop and all my unreplied emails just there. 

I don't know how to feel because it feels like a really ungracious exit. Giving them the benefit of the doubt they did say it's just easier for them to start clean instead of waiting for me to turn over files, and they know I don't have my heart it in anymore, but the way it ended so abruptly it makes it seem like I was fired. My theory is they think I'll just be a liability for the next four days so I might as well leave--  when I gave my notice my boss was super understanding but by the end of the week I could tell she was annoyed at how much work I hadn't submitted yet. I did a good job my first few months, it's only been the last month or so that has been a real struggle, so it's been quite a blow to my pride.

I never planned on asking them for a reference, and honestly it doesn't matter to me if they don't pay me for the last week because I won't be working, but is there anything they can do to me that I should be worried about? I'm in Canada."

I've been a CNC machinist in Ontario Canada for 14 years. Make $34/hr after my shift bonus.  We have a small side business that nets another 10k a year that we hope to grow more in the next  year when my oldest starts school and my wife has more time to work on it. 

I make decent money and like my job but single income it's still tight. The problem is that this trade is feast or famine. Some months you could work 25 hours per day if you wanted to but other months you're barely scraping 40hrs/wk. We've been slow at my shop basically since the pandemic started with periodic spots of OT but they've predicted even slower sales in the upcoming months and have already laid off almost half of my department. I consider myself safer I guess as I'm one of the senior machinists here working on the larger ""more important"" machines and jobs but I know no one is truly safe in this industry during a down turn. 

I could look for another shop if I do get laid off but I've been around the block in my area and very few places want to pay what I'm getting now and everywhere is the same feast or famine.

I've been contemplating a career shift in the event I do get laid off but I'm not sure if it's feasible with my current situation. As the sole income earner we aren't struggling really but definitely living at the edge of our means so I wouldn't be able to take a massive pay cut to start over. The side business is one thing but no guarantees that we will be able to scale it up enough to cover my lost wages. 

Are there any careers that would start out somewhere near my wage out the gate or am I looking at halving my wage to start over and claw my way back up no matter what I do? 

I was looking into HVAC work since I've heard we have a good program at the college here but it's hard to find average wage rates without the experience to know what to look for in that industry. 

Any other industries or tips or opinions you may have would be great!

Im essentially just a labourer and being underpaid even as that, in actuality im a Leading hand with plenty of experience, knowledge and skills.
I only just started with these guys and its not the environment I want to be in. Its very small scale and unorganised when im used to massive job sites and  alot more challenge in work. Im happier being on big projects with alot more happening.

Me and my Wife both want me to have some stability and me to be earning money so our mortgage is paid, but she doesnt want me trying to get back to the kinda stuff I was doing before, she thinks I should just stick it out here for a year. I dont even want to be here a month, letalone a week.

I feel bad that im applying for jobs and trying to get back ontrack. She has said her piece and then says that its all my choice anyway.

For example, this job is about 5dollars an hour under market rate for a labourer and about 10 to 14dollars under market rate for a qualified landscape leading hand letalone a civil labourer, machine operator/landscaper kind of mixed role.

I am coming of the back of losing my dad and job in some very shit circumstances, but I dont want to go backwards. If anything I want to go further beyond where I was and really work hard to get to where I want to be.

Soo how long should I stay here? Should i keep or stop trying to apply for better positions for a while? Should I just make my own choices and hope that my wife can accept? Should I ignore her and do what I feel needs to be done for me and for us?

Its all very complicated and high emotion when we try to sit down and talk about it and I get where she is coming from but she doesnt seem to understand where Im coming from.

Any thoughts, opinions and the like would be amazingly appreciated.

My question is would be it be a bad idea to look for internships now as a recent grad even though I might experience a pay cut but gain experience into the field I am truly looking to get into or if I should just to continue to fill out applications and hope for the best? Thanks for reading and any help provided!
0,2023-01-16,Should I leave my stressful career to follow my passion?,u/Pleasant_Bag3897,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10dwfeh/should_i_leave_my_stressful_career_to_follow_my/,careerguidance,"Early-mid 20s, Male

A little under a year ago, I started my career. I got lucky and found a decent job after dropping out of college and working at various restaurants in my early 20s. My career is extremely stressful, and requires long hours and intense concentration, but pays very well and provides excellent job security. Things started out well enough, and while I can see myself doing this for a long time, I feel as though the demanding hours and work-life balance are starting to offset some of the other benefits of doing this.

I always wanted to work as a game developer, and had developed my skills/portfolio enough to have had two (unsuccessful) interviews for remote entry level positions before I started my current career. As I get more settled in at my current career, I can't help but wonder about how things would go if I switched careers and explored project management roles for game development.

I have reservations about switching careers due to the excellent pay my job provides, and the fact that switching careers would, in the best case, pay 1/3 of what I currently get, at least for the first few years. I am also not currently qualified to do anything else that pay enough to allow me to support myself without financial ruin, so everything feels extremely precarious, even though I consider myself to be very careful and disciplined with budgeting and personal finance (apart from the keeping your job part). I do not have parents or family to rely on for extra help, as I cut them out of my life completely 3 years ago.

As it stands, my whole career switch plan is contingent on me receiving a job offer I am happy with, but even if I did, would it be worth it for the insane reduction in pay? I don't think the working conditions and hours of the games industry would be much worse than what I'm doing right now, and even though my position has great job security, I could screw up bad enough one day, and be jobless the next.

Go to college, kids."

I was working an unrelated dead end job that in which I did not feel challenged at all and finally left in the summer of last year, since then I've been teaching myself some skills including SQL, Python and Tableau and I've put together a small portfolio of fairly simple projects.

I would love to work as a Junior Data Analyst, Junior Business Intelligence Analyst or any similar role related to data analysis.

I'm basically willing to relocate anywhere in the world and don't have high salary expectations (40-50K USD) I'm really just looking to gain some great work experience and challenge myself every day to learn and grow in the field, but I've heard that their are mass layoffs in a lot of industries right now so I may have a tough time getting hired.

I was wondering if anyone has any advice for me in terms of landing a job in this competitive job market with limited industry experience.

Is it possible to make the jump right into a Junior Analyst position or would it be more advisable to first apply for jobs like Helpdesk etc?

It seems a lot of roles require 5+ years of experience and the responsibilities of the work are well beyond my scope of knowledge, will my resume get thrown out if I apply to jobs like this coming in with no experience or is it worth it to still apply?

I'd like to maximize every avenue of me landing a job within the next few months and I understand it will be a very difficult process. Should I be reaching out to recruiters to help me land interviews?

Sorry if these are not good questions. Thank you for any advice and help it's much appreciated!"

What step should I take next?,u/LifeOfSpirit17,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10dz93g/meetings_and_project_management_what_step_should/,careerguidance,"Hi, I'm currently a project manager in a non tech role. I'm looking into getting a scrum cert to advance my career, and in particular to get into the tech space. My big thing is, I'm very very meeting averse, I'd much rather work on something technical, though I don't mind a few small meetings per week (preferrably cam off of course lol, I'm remote).

So, would I be doomed by going the scrum master route? I really want to get into tech, and getting a scrum cert seems like the path of least resistance for doing so, but doing a daily standup and client meetings and blah blah just sounds like an absolute drag.

I know meetings are just a part of the professional world, but I just don't want to end up in a career that requires 3 or so meetings per day. I'm currently lucky with my current setup given the hands-off nature of our service. Our clients pretty much just let us go until the end of the project and we report in via email nearly daily. But sync up calls are rare, and we typically only do KO calls (if even that) and then they leave us alone.

But do you all have any advice on staying in project management and getting into tech preferrably, but averting meetings like the plague? I have debated learning SWE so I could get a little more work autonomy, but I really do enjoy management too."

I (30M) have been working in Customer Success for going-on 7 years, at two different companies both based on SaaS technology. In summary my main responsibility is assisting existing customers with ensuring they are getting the most value out of their contract (goal is to get them to renew, avoid churning as a customer, etc.).

Thing is, I don’t want to do this forever. I very much work to live (and not the other way around), so I am fine with putting my best foot forward from 9-5 all week, as long as I am getting paid I’ll keep that up, but I don’t want to work more than 40 hours a week for a job I’m not that passionate about. And that’s just it, I’m always drowning (there are some colleagues that work 10-12 hour days and I just can’t bring myself to do it). Despite my role being heavily focused on proactive work, I am constantly contacted regarding something reactive. I am tasked with being proactive with existing customers and basically keeping them happy, having strategic calls with them, etc.

I am a very strong communicator and wordsmith in my emails, etc, that is the part of the job I thrive at. The challenging part (for me) is that I am advocating for technology, and I’m horrible with technology. Of course I live in the modern world, but being asked (regularly) complicated questions around mobile app experiences, technical bugs, software integrations, feature questions, etc are all among things not in my natural wheelhouse.

I had obtained my Bachelor’s degree in journalism &amp; digital media which led to my initial career pursuit for several years in radio (this was prior to my customer success days). Although I would love a career in radio (or any journalism gig for that matter), I truly hated the competitive, selfish, and often snakelike behavior of many of the personalities that make up that industry. After trying to work my way into a career by working part-time doing grunt work for 2ish years, I watched a newcomer get a position up the chain simply because of nepotism. As I continued to go nowhere and watch some really rude, pretentious people work as DJ’s, I had had enough.

So in short, I am a great communicator, but really want to get away from customer success / proactive / strategic work (especially in technology). Where do I go from here?

Should I transfer to BA in Global Business Studies with a minor in Marketing rather than majoring in a BS in marketing?

Background:
I am currently declared as an entrepreneurship major which is a Bachelor of Arts. However, I decided to start transitioning to majoring in Marketing which is a bachelor of science because I am unsure if I want to start my own business and I believe marketing would provide more job opportunities. Every class I am registered in for this semester goes into both marketing and entrepreneurship, besides the math I am taking to start the transition to marketing. However after reading the syllabus of my math class (Finite Math??) I am worried and stressed about not doing well in it, and also having to complete calculus next year. 

The question: I started looking into the major called global business studies, which is a Bachelor of Arts. If I took this major I could minor in marketing, and the global aspect is cool because I know I want to travel for my career. Best of all, I don’t have to take any more math! Will this major provide me as good job outlooks and opportunities as a marketing bachelor of science? I don’t know what I really want to do, but I figure business will give me opportunities."

I earned a 2nd masters degree in the last year and a half (MBA). My first round of college was in pursuit of a career in the arts. After I graduated from that, I realized it was a huge mistake and found myself back in school to get a business degree.

While I was working on my MBA, my creative career took off in a way that I run my own private teaching business. I can pay my bills and put a some money away each month. 

I’m still toying with the idea of getting a more traditional/higher paying job. As I look though listing, I don’t seem qualified for many MBA type jobs. I seem to be an over educated yet under qualified 40-year old male. Anyone out there been in a similar position?

Here is my stort and dilemma 

I have a BA in business economics and own 2 businesses.  The first is a real estate rental business with around 12 houses. It does okay, not great. I have some experiance managing, renovating, buying and selling them and doing maintenance work.

My wife and I built up an export resale business where we buy branded clothing, bags, and jewelry and ship them overseas.  She has always handled the customers, orders and I helped to buy items, set up and maintain bank and credit card accounts, set up excel sheets to do accounting, taxes, and inventorty records, handlng packaging and shipments.  Its always been more of my wife's business than mine though.  

We moved to a new city a couple years ago for her business and business was good but my real estate business suffered as I stopped buying houses and maintenance and management costs increased.  

Slowly due to me being less needed, several arguments about plans for the business, and my attention as the primary caregiver for our two children I haven't been involved much in the last year.    

Well sales are down now and I am completely on the outside of operations now so I can't change how the business works.  I am also terribly bored, and I think its is time to start a career.  Problem is I have virtually no work experience but I can't get a entry level job either.  

I don't want to be a real estate agent or any career where I have to spend years building up customers. 
I was thinking of a total career change into programing after a boot camp or finacial advisor if I could find a career path where I am not hunting customers.  

I am open to anything really.  

I feel lost as to what path to take.  The feeling of writing resumes seems dreadful though and a little overwhelming.  

Is there a career path that is in such demand that is easier to enter?  Id be okay with a slight amount of reeducation but not another 2 years of full time classes. 

Literally any advice is welcome.  Lay it on thick"

I do internal communications in a large organization. I consider myself very fortunate to have landed this opportunity, as it was able to help make me financially more secure (I don’t come from a well-to-do place). The culture/work-life balance is also highly compatible with me.

However, after having spent \~6 years in this organization, I am feeling more and more ‘stuck in a rut’. Specifically:

1. My income is good, but I’m not satisfied with it – I feel like I can be doing more, ‘earning bigger bucks’, but I've hit the maximum level achievable. Definitely not talking about high finance sort of money (and I am never that sort of person), just thinking about unrealized potential.
2. My professional achievements are decent, but I feel I’m starting to lag behind peers of a similar age group. Whilst I have a good reputation within my own broader organization, I’m not earning some ‘industry prominence awards’ (e.g. Forbes), which I do feel like is necessary to ‘break into’ a higher bracket/leverage to get into other companies.
3. My network is comparatively weak (I’m an introvert who’s a bit awkward about networking for the sake of it), and I admit that I’m shutting out on a lot of opportunities. I also don’t really know how to approach this.
4. My work has become mundane/boring to me and I fear it stifles my prospects the longer I stay in it. But at the same time I’m averse to losing what I have (I cannot find an alternative, parallel role that gives me this same culture/WLB/compensation)
5. I want to create large scale positive impact around me, which I felt I was able to do when I first took on this role. However, I feel like I’m no longer very close to it, having realized that I’m just a cog in a wheel at the end of the day and saying what leadership wants me to say.

I’m in my early 30s, and truth be told I’m a little scared as time goes by – since I’m no longer as energetic as I used to be out of college.

Looking for any thoughts and perspectives as to how I can get out of this rut?"

1,2023-01-17,"Just started and now a manager doesn’t like me? What did I do and, more importantly, what can I do now?",u/64929207446,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10e66cz/just_started_and_now_a_manager_doesnt_like_me/,careerguidance,"So to begin with I’ve only actually worked five days so far at this pizza place I started out at. We’ll know chain so I won’t mention it here, to make sure it’s as anonymous as I can get it. Anyway, I had worked at one before two years ago for three years and I became “one of the managers.” Back then, that meant an assistant. I’m only saying this because now it means either the top or second position of the store and not the assistants which I didn’t know before introducing myself to this assistant, which is what I was! 

So on my third day she comes in while I’m on a smoke break and she’s working one spot in the store with her back toward the front, where I came from, talking to another girl that works there. The other girl speaks to me and this manager asks her if I’m new and we both say yes because I felt it was rude if I didn’t speak, because I hadn’t met her before. Later on, we are both working in this position and honestly after those three years I should be good at it and I am. Even if that makes me consider an AITA post. Regardless, she asks “so did you work at another small pizza business or something?” 

So I told her! “No, but I did work at the (location) store for three years and I was a manager.” And she just had this unhappy look and said, “oh, well I’m an assistant manager.” Thinking I had made her upset because I may have made it sound like I was the general manager or something I told her, “yeah! That’s what I was, that’s what I meant.” Nervously trying to repair what I thought could be coming from her attitude. 

Since then (that was my THIRD day back) she has just been snide and petty constantly. I even asked another coworker (not a manager) if I had done something or maybe she was just one of those people that seems rude and hateful and doesn’t mean to be. She told me she does have RBF but honestly if I think something is up I should just ask her. I’m not trying to have this big show of confrontation on my now fifth day. So I’ve let it go for the most part but I’m too old for these games (21f) so I’ll admit I returned a bit of the sarcastic jabs and other things and I’ve tried to give it back to her so to speak. I wasn’t doing one thing properly because they don’t have the measurements posted so I was going off all the pizzas I had seen done right and getting as close as I could. She brought up on two different occasions that I was doing it wrong, they weren’t allowed to, all of that. Which would be fine! I love to see a manager correcting an employee for doing exactly what I was doing, but, she knew why. She even got an attitude with me for having the screen on the setting that shows what goes on every pizza so I could do it right. So the second time, when she brought up the general manager seeing me do it and all of that, I let her know. I’ll admit I didn’t plan for it to come out as harsh as it was, but, I said, “I’m doing this because I don’t know which cups are for (this pizza). Can you tell me which ones to use so I don’t have to keep doing it this way?” Imagine that with a bit of attitude of course, because I had had about enough that night. She ended up saying, “oh well you don’t have to make that one so you can stop there and we’ll save it for if we need it later!” 

I thought that would be the end of it. I thought she would stop treating me this way once I showed her that I do know what I’m doing and I’ve done it a long time and I know what I was doing was wrong but there was literally no other way for me to do it so that even when I’m making a mistake I’m making it by choice because I have to for now and I’m doing it as perfectly right as I can. Other than this, she’s thrown me on other positions even though everything is different there and I figured it out of course but when she can’t even put the different items on the same order together and sends so much extra stuff to my screen I do get even more frustrated. Oh, and she always hides from the cameras and gets on her phone in a slow time. Today she let ingredients on the line be just about empty and would put me on that part so she couldn’t have to go get more even though they were right behind us. The thing I’m tasked with making sure is clean every night she keeps putting handprints on to make sure it’s more dirty. 

I honestly feel like I somehow challenged her when I mentioned being a manager in the past. Honestly, when I started here the general manager excitedly asked me if I wanted management again. The only reason I told her no was because I wasn’t completely sure about me still knowing what I was doing. And I’ve come to believe this assistant is the reason she was looking for another one. She’s walked out and left the closing of the store in the hands of a minor before and has then been hired back. She goes on smoke breaks without letting anyone know and leaves the orders to pile up since no one knows they should be looking out for them. She yells at the crew members and asks things of them she would never lift a finger for herself. The one thing she was asked to take care of that first night was left incomplete. She “did” it, but of course the part that would take longer than half a second she left for whoever actually was going to do it. 

She’s honestly just making this a horrible experience. (Tmi) I’m on the nexplanon implant and it has caused enough stress to lead to symptoms that are only caused by stress, and it takes a lot for me to get to that point at least so far. 

I really don’t want to go to my general manager about this because I JUST started. I don’t know if I need to handle it myself because of that same reason. But this has made me want to walk out of a job on my third day, and, that’s a very strong thing. I’ve tried giving it back to her and showing her that I’m more than capable. And honestly…if she’s worried about me going after her job she shouldn’t have been. But she definitely should be now. If I was running the store, she wouldn’t even be a crew member much less a manager. And I’ve worked with teenagers that don’t know how to work before and they’ve been so much better. 

I need advice on what to do in this situation because the child in me is coming out and saying to start stuff even though I just started. It’s a LOT more than what I’ve mentioned here, I’m just trying to get enough for someone to be able to understand! So don’t think I’m overreacting to these few things. I thought so too that’s why I waited until three days of working with her to make a conclusion. I just left a job because even though I was the only person in the company they refused to respect me in any way because I was a young female. So they got to find someone to do it better.

I'm a little down. I majored in Statistics and had basic exposure to SAS and SQL. There were elective classes that focuses more on these, as well as coding in R and Python, but I never took them. Now I have graduated and landed a good job (that sadly does not relate to statistics). I have been here for almost 2 years now.

I love my job. But I'm scared that I have become too comfortable in it. It pays well but, it doesn't pay as much as my degree is worth. Plus I miss stats. It was fun. But I am a little rocky on it now, especially with my basic exposure to coding. All the jobs I'm browsing now that pays the same level as my current job demands all these coding skills! So in a way, if it wasn't for my current unrelated job, I would have not gotten a good salary from the start!


What is the best way for me to practice AND apply it? It's nice to read a book and all or watch someone code and understand it, but I would also like to apply my coding skills to something too. It helps me learn this way. Should I just try to freestyle learning on youtube and books, or is it best to pay a class?

We had a discussion about wages the other day and my professor mentioned from the 1-6 years you’ll be making from 50K 50K to 65K and to reach 100K it would take 8-11 years with a license. This means for me to reach 100K I would have 4 years of school plus 8 of working to reach this number. I could instead drop out and work in construction with my dad and start making pretty good money right away and get to the 100K mark same time if not a little sooner. This would allow me to make money the next 4 years rather than going in debt for my career, I feel like if I stay in school I would lose my most valuable years as I won’t be able to do anything since I won’t have any money and won’t be able to start a family until I’m 30.

The company I was working with(Oracle) uses Java primary in their tech stack. Even though my professional experience is in Java mostly I'm more proficient in C++ than Java. The reason for this is I've done coding for 3 years in C++ during college and even after I joined this company I was always coding in C++ in my free time. So I'm thinking about putting C++ in my tech stack under my work experience section. Also I'm on a break currently since last 8 months and not comfortable in Java at all. I can't decide whether I should do it or not cause it's basically a lie. If I won't put C++ in my work experience then most companies who are looking for C++ developer won't even consider my profile cause I don't have professional experience in it.

I might be wrong. But I feel that because most of reddit answers discuss USA salaries and roles in tech, it might seem that this is the case worldwide. I have people commenting on the dev industry salaries as if this is the only way to have a comfortable life and do something important.

In my opinion, reality is different in Europe. In Europe salaries of a developer are just ok. Maybe better than some other roles at first, but for more senior roles not so much. Also socially is a bit below average as developers are seen as socially inept and lacking business skills and perception. Developers are also treated as tools to build something and have less respect from their peers unfortunately. What seems to be much higher socially and financially in Europe is finance/business/consulting roles.

I am making this thread for me and for some other curious people and I might be completely wrong. If I am, I will gladly adjust my perception on the matter. But for now it seems to me that there is an obvious difference for tech roles between US and Europe.  


PS: I am well aware of all the EU perks aside from salary that USA citizens don't have and my comparison is adjusted accordingly."

I am an intern and in my current position I work from home. Also I have very few tasks so I can often work on my post-grad's thesis instead, which I will be completing in a couple of months. I'll even be moving soon to another european country but my boss said there's no problem  and I can keep working from home. He also added that soon there'll be a lot more projects coming our way.

A few weeks ago though, just out of curiosity, I decided to send some resumés in the country I'll be moving to, and some folks have replied asking to set up an interview. Problems are that:  
1) I don't feel like I'm good enough for the positions, as there have been very little projects and I don't know some programming languages very well, and  
2) I fear it will be more stressful to start a new position in a new company, where they'll rightfully expect me to work full-time and even go to the office, and I'll have to once again postpone my graduation.

So, after consulting with my family, I decided not to pursue these new job opportunities so that I can complete my thesis. However, I talked to an older friend who pointed out it was a bad idea not to pursue these job opportunities as I can graduate anytime and the whole point of graduating is to find a job.

I don't feel ready, and I really want to graduate so that I don't have to think about it anymore, but maybe I'm just scared. Am I stupid for giving up on these opportunities?"

So I'm basically a sys admin at this federal IT agency that works with federal clients. In a few months, i am about to cap a year at this position. Sticking around for a bit more until we migrate some stuff to the cloud then i'll bounce afterwards.

Here are my questions listed below.

1. My security clearance still didn't come back and it's been about 10+ months so i guess that's normal?
2. When i decide to leave, i'll have about 4 - 5 years of experience in the field so salary wise i'll be aiming for $150k - $165k for next role. Generally, that's a good salary right?
3. To double check, when you guys are doing interviews with prospective employers what do you tell them when they ask 'why are you looking for another role?' I usually just say 'exploring other career opportunities' is that a good response?
4. Lastly, am i considered a federal employee? For example, if i work for general dynamics or lockheed martin does that make me a federal employee?"

Currently, I am completing a PhD, where I am half-researcher, half-employee, my official title is engineer-advisor on the company side. I will complete my first year soon, and I have 2 years to go. Once I am done, I will have an engineer diploma, a master in informatics, the PhD, and 4 years on the market, working for this company. I am 25 years old.

My domain is rather mathematics-oriented. I optimize systems (fleet of vehicles, employee scheduling, etc), in order to bring 3 things : monetary value (consume less fuel), practical value (equity between employees) and programming value (I write the scripts, they have to run in few seconds).

Recently, after 2 years working on a project, I found out a way to mix state-of-the-art methodology with a new approach, that would drastically improve the performance for our biggest client. Basically, that would save at least 10 millions dollars worth of fuel, per year. This would require no infrastructure change, but the algorithmic complexity is through the roof, and we would have no competitor for years on that topic, should it work.

And now, here I am, somewhat freshly out of school, I want a career in R&amp;D, and this would be an excellent way to prove myself. I want to make the most out of this as I can, in order to quickly boost my income down the line. I have no debt, but it has been difficult to live properly for a few years now.

Eventually, I want to make my own company as an advisor, but in 2 years, it might be too early. By then, there will be long discussions about this with my current employer. Should I stay and ask for a raise; would it be too much to double/triple it based on these results ? I have no idea how much an expert should make, and I don't find anything relevant online. I don't want to under-sell it. I typically travel, and I will likely meet some clients in the US down the line for this project.

The results will be published, but the complexity would be far beyond the current skills of my employer. Realistically, I am the only one with the software and mathetical knowledge to do this. I cannot really find another employer to have multiple offers, it would be a different domain, likely. So I find myself having to make guesses on how much should an expert be paid, with no one to compare to."

Would you be able to offer me some guidance related to my degree? I graduated from a state university, 4.0 GPA &amp; summa cum laude, with a B.S. in Management Info. Systems. Currently, I’m employed as a Process Analyst (Business Analysis) at a F500 energy company. I knew from the very first few weeks, the role is not for me and that I do not fit. 

Some of the colleagues are toxic, no clear guidance from management, and there is a HUGE employee turnover rate company-wide. Not to mention, unpaid OT and your raise/bonus depends on company performance AND how much you stay OT.

Prior to this role, I worked as a Logistic Coordinator at a transportation company, but there was a top-off in terms of salary and whatnot. I thought Business Analysis is what I wanted to do, but more so leaning towards banking or commercial real estate. Now, I feel stuck with my degree and age.

I do not like coding/programming, but don’t mind simple queries and/or Tableu/PowerBI.

Thanks in advance!"

I've been placed in a bit of an uncomfortable situation at my current job. I work finances in the blue-collar industry and the pay is really good for my experience (3yrs experience). However, the team I'm on changes constantly as they're all contract employees, and I never really got proper training as the team didn't have the time to train me.

Now that the senior position has opened up, my boss has said that I'll be taking over almost all the projects (minus the 2 biggest ones). I expressed my concerns since I was only taught this two months ago and have a really good rapport with my boss. I do somewhat see this as an opportunity but the company I work for wouldn't even consider me because of my experience even if I tried applying (I've tried) and the senior position gets paid upwards of 30k-40k more/ year.

Fast forward to this week, and a friend of mine tells me about an opening at his job in commercial finance and he'd put in a good word for me. The issue is the pay is 15k less than what I get now but I was advised I'd get 10k more pay after 6 months of training. I've considered this avenue before as I really enjoyed that side of finances when I was there but want to know everyone's experience leaving a job for another one with lower pay.

Thank you!"

To make things quick I am considering leaving my current job and moving into an entirely new industry, but I’m not sure if it is the right move. 

I am currently working as an agency recruiter, with one of the big names in the industry. It pays well Salary 55k+ commission 

I fell into recruiting after college and have been doing it for close to 2 years now. I majored in finance, but ended up in this sales role. 

I have an interview for an accounting assistant coming up. That would pay max 45-50k. It could be a significant pay cut, but a way to get my foot in the door. 

Long term I would love to do something differently such as getting into computer programming. My rationalization for the lower paying job would be a better work life balance, that would leave me with more energy to do a boot camp/program after hours to transition into the computer science field. Since as you know agency recruitment is a grind. 

If anyone has gone through something similar or if anyone with more career experience has any suggestions, it would be much appreciated!"

Hey all, Im 26 and going back to school for corporate accounting, Ive bounced from terrible living arrangement to worse arrangement for about 6 years now and I have not been stable enough to really work on my true passions. Accounting is something Im hoping will give me the stability, time and money I need to have an ok life. I have the math skills to do it but honestly im not excited about the career choice. Id really love to go into graphic design or another arts with the ultimate goal of getting into VFX or UI/UX design.

The plan is to finish my Degree (I have 60 credit hours already done from my initial college attempt), figure out what art degree I want, leave my state (AZ) to somewhere with more art opportunities and go from there, using accounting as a stable base. I have no interest in being a CPA.

I just want to know if this plan is stupid. Even the one degree is going to be a huge investment of my life but I cant make it on entry level jobs anymore due to medical issues. I view accounting as the more guaranteed option, but is this misguided? Im flat broke, taking out a loan for school and my parents are cutting me a break till I get back on my feet. I pretty much have this one shot to get a better life going for myself and im just beyond nervous. Any opinions welcome"

These two points are leading me  go back and get a 2nd bachelor's in either computer science or statistics to further round out my knowledge base and advance my data career. 

My question is, would a 2nd bachelor's degree at limited cost to me, other than time, be worth it for career growth / long term earning potential or would it be a waste of time as I will already have my MS?

My boss has admitted that he has no idea what they will do, what their strengths are, or how they will add value. 

We really need someone with a creative flare in our department. We have 2 designers, but it's not enough. Our receptionist has a master's degree in fashion design. I don't know much about their experience, but I do know that they have more general experience than the new hire, and I'm guessing that they will be quite creative? 

I'd rather they promote the receptionist to the ""available"" position, put the new hire in reception, and the new hire can help us out with some marketing tasks.

I need some advice as to my salary. I'm a personal injury lawyer in Sothern California. I was licensed in 2021 and have a little over one year worth of experience as a practicing attorney. Before and during law school I worked at a number of personal injury firms and built some real world applicable skills I could take with me when looking for my first job after passing the Bar exam. 

I currently work at a small personal injury firm in the San Fernando Valley that's been around since the 1970s. There are the two owner/partner attorney, two paralegals, a receptionist, and me as the associate attorney. I currently handle a very small caseload of my own, and have settled a couple of cases by myself, but I also work on cases for both the partner attorneys in doing discovery, deposition prep with clients, defending and taking depositions, legal research, writing mediation briefs, lien negotiations, client intakes, drafting complaints, and some law and motion as well.  I love this office, and I'm happy with everything here, except for the salary. I'm recently married, and I need to start increasing my income to at least begin to tackle things like a future house, future kids, etc. 

I wanted to know what other lawyers who are either in my same position with similar experience, or those who have more experience and have a better idea for what the market rate is, think an appropriate salary would be for me. I want to try and negotiate a higher salary soon, but I want to try and make sure I'm not going in with my head in the clouds in terms of the amount of money I want/expect. I want to make a fair proposition when it comes to my salary and not reach for the stars out of greed. 

I've tried to do some research online but I'm getting a pretty wide range so thought I might have some luck hearing from people with real examples.

Any and all information is greatly appreciated.

Thank you very much in advance."

Context: Until recently, I was completely financially supported by my now ex spouse. I worked on passion projects, but nothing that paid well. Now I'm looking to get into the workforce and use the skills I developed during those passion projects.

I'm hoping to get into web development, and I have significant experience with WordPress (WP). I was recently at a WP meetup, and two different people asked to see examples of my work with the implication that they wanted to hire me. I excitedly sent along the examples, and yet didn't hear back from them.

I think my work is pretty decent, definitely in league with other sites I saw at the WP meetup, so I don't think poor quality is the reasoning.

I theorize that I didn't hear back because almost all of my previous website experience was related to NSFW topics. I created several sex blog sites from scratch, and redesigned several more. I also made a gallery website for an artist that has created a lot of sexual art.

I also have these projects, including my person sex blog, on my LinkedIn. I have the descriptions focused exclusively on my skills, not the content, but the names indicate them as NSFW in nature. These show my WP experience more so than other job experience, but I'm worried they'll scare people away.

Clearly my solution is to create other sites as soon as possible, even if they're dummy sites. However, is there anything I can do in the meantime?"

Hey guys, this my first post hopefully someone sees it. My back story is I went to college for a couple of years and in turn had a very very bad mental health scare, and from then on I have worked dead end jobs like painting, sales, manual labor. 
Then I started a business with my father and couple of other people. I moved from my home state to pursue this endeavor, in doing so since the business is not doing well, the property in which my father and I reside needs to be sold to help with money for the business. This was promptly shown to me a week ago. My father not speaking to me about the situation, he has found somewhere to go, I haven’t. 

One of the people in this business is a uncle who owns a couple of rental properties, so he gave us the opportunity to stay at one. 

Now yes this was probably a terrible decision on my part, because I’m reality I just was labor, none of my ideas or anything transpired. 

In trying to salvage my relationship with my father or what is left of it I told him that I homelessness is most likely an option, exhausting all options of friends and other relatives. 

Essentially I am asking what are are couple of options you guys recommend. Thank you guys."

I am 28 years old and graduated college later than average at 27. I got my BS in Environmental Studies, worked in conservation and outdoor recreation for a bit and discovered that wasn't for me. In a LinkedIn-mediated fluke, I ended up getting a position with an environmental consulting company doing telecom safety compliance work. It is not at all subject matter that interests me, or that I really even understand for that matter, but offered me stability and employment during the economic nadir of the pandemic. 

I have been in this role for about a year and a half. I am bored by the work, dislike the company I work for as well as the world of consulting, and am fearful of getting deeper and specializing further into a career path that I don't want to end up in. Recruiters are regularly reaching out to me on LinkedIn, and my supervisor has made it clear that a promotion to a level II or III position or move to Project Manager is in the cards for me if I want it.

I've identified that my ideal career field is urban planning. I do not want to go back to school for my masters in urban planning until I have a better idea of if I like the work or not. I have been monitoring my city's job board for a year now, and a position just popped up that doesn't require an urban planning degree. It is a technician-level position essentially processing construction permits and liaising with permit applicants. I feel like it could be step in the right direction for my goals because it is in the city's urban planning department, which would allow me to network with people currently working in urban planning, and would also expose me to the type of work an urban planner actually engages with. Rather than making an expensive mistake by jumping into an expensive masters program to determine if urban planning is for me, I could work in the field and figure it out, then decide to go back to school later.

Where I am uncertain and what I'd like advice on is the fact that I would take a pay cut as well as a step down on the career-ladder. My current role pays $51k and is a Specialist level which requires a bachelors degree. This position with the city pays $45k and is a Technician level requiring only a high school diploma plus some experience. The pay-cut would impact my quality of life, especially given how out of control inflation is right now. I would also lose all the perks of being a fully remote employee I currently enjoy. And, if I find out that urban planning is not actually it for me, I will have wasted time and missed out on growth I could have gained if I had stayed at my current company.

I stumbled into a career field I do not want to dig myself deeper into. Should I take a 12% pay cut and step backwards on the career ladder to test out my ideal career field?"

I am a 24 year old woman who has no clue what to do with her life and is spiraling because I'm almost 30 and have no career prospects and next thing I know I'll be 40 and wondering how I wasted my life away.

For background on me: I graduated with a BA in Psychology in 2020. I also had a minor in computer science but my knowledge in that field is very, very, very basic. Like Hello World basic lol. 

Pursuing a career in the legal field has always been of interest to me. I originally wanted to do forensics, but took a single chemistry class and realized science is too hard for me. I give up quickly, unfortunately. 

I took the LSAT in April and got a 160. Thought about applying to law school but then I worked as a legal assistant and absolutely hated it. I'm not sure if it was the firm (it was an immigration law firm and had a 1 star on glassdoor and I was severely underpaid) or I don't like law as much as I thought but I quit after a few months

I briefly considered doing a Post-BAC program in order to pursue medical school cuz I was like well I like helping ppl and I have the psych degree I could do psychiatry. I even got letters of rec and signed up for a 7,000$ calculus course that now I am unsure if I should take or not. 

I'm just at such a loss. Nothing inspires me. I don't really have passions when it comes to my career. But I need to do something. All I know is I want to help people, I love talking to people, understanding the brain and human behavior (hence the useless f\*cking psych degree), science (even tho I'm trash at it). I also need to pick a field that will make me a lot of money. Not that I even care about that, but because I don't come from money and I am 150k in debt from undergrad. 

If anyone has advice I would greatly appreciate it."
1,2023-01-17,What options do I have for moving forward in my career? I'm really struggling to break out of the box I've found myself stuffed into.,u/Fox_Malloy,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10ek9rq/what_options_do_i_have_for_moving_forward_in_my/,careerguidance,"Hey everyone!

I'm having a real hard time at the moment trying to figure out where to go with my career, and hoping that there are some people on this sub that might be able to help with some ideas. Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to be thorough!

About Me:

I'm 35 and I live in Canada. I have a Bachelor of Arts (with Honours) in Geography. I have 9 years of working in an office environment; 5.5 years in banking (in England and in Canada) and 4 years in healthcare (in Canada). In London I worked in Collateral Management for 4.5 years, which essentially involved processing and reconciling movements of cash and/or stock to cover trade exposure. I then worked for a year doing Financial Crime analysis at a bank in Canada. I then moved to my current position working as a Financial Analyst in healthcare.

The problem is that ""Financial Analyst"" was never really an appropriate title for the job I ended up doing. There were various financial reporting components (budgeting, monthly and quarterly reporting) but this was a pretty small component of the job (although I did vastly improve the quality of the reporting and presentations). Other than that, I worked on developing the team's KPIs, I streamlined processes, I processed payment requests, I put together project contracts, and I provided data for reporting. A large portion of my time was spent working on three main projects:

1. The team funded around 30-40 projects per year, but a lot of the projects had very similar names and/or the name of the project changed after it started. There was a ton of confusion, so I implemented a project code system whereby all projects were given a code.
2. We had an online file storage system (M-Files) where all the project documents had just been dumped with no consideration for naming convention. Everyone was constantly complaining that they could never find anything. So I came up with a logical naming convention, went through and found every project document, renamed it using the new naming convention (including the new project code) and fixed all of the metadata.
3. We had a project database that was absolutely hideous and missing huge amounts of information. Everyone complained about using it and a lot of the time large pieces of information was missed because there wasn't the correct field, or the options within the field were all outdated. I went through all the project data, used a variety of sources to fill in all the missing information, and then used Caspio to build a new database that met all the needs of the project managers/coordinators, but also provided data for KPIs.

Around 2 years into the position, it was decided that the department would be restructured. Long story short, I was moved into the Finance department. The only real tasks I was left with were producing (and presenting) the monthly and quarterly reports. This freed up a fair amount of time, so I did two things:

1. I learned how to use InDesign so that I could produce 'designed' reports (rather than just using Word).
2. I started creating two Excel dashboards that non-Finance team members could use to access the financial information for their projects/areas, and access plug-and-play graphs and charts that they could use in their reports. Previously all the information was only available via financial statements (which I had to provide each time they were requested) and there was no easy way to compare data. I basically created two spreadsheets that had all the financial data in it, and I'm currently working on a dashboard for each spreadsheet that will display the data and allow users to filter the information as required.

I'm getting to the point where I feel like I need to move on, but I'm really struggling to know what direction to go in. I've been looking Financial Analyst jobs, but almost all of them require a CPA or CFA. I'm not entirely sure that I want to get a CPA/CFA, because the finance component is actually the least interesting part to me.

I looked at Data Analyst roles, but they all require SQL (which I don't have). I'm also not sure that data analysis is *really* my strong suit. I also looked at Business Analyst roles, but it seems that you need to be able to code and/or have experience/background in IT. Business Analyst seems like the most appropriate route for me, though?

What I like doing is finding problems and creating solutions. I like fixing things. I might not always be the person who can build the solution, but I also like networking with other people to find someone with the expertise to complete the project. This is 100% what I want to focus on moving forward.

Anyway, if anyone could give me some guidance, I would really, really appreciate it. I'm getting really down on myself because I don't feel qualified to do anything, and I feel like I've been pigeon-holed into finance because of my 5 years in Banking and because of my current job title. I don't know which direction to go in, and I have no idea how to market myself to be appealing to employers."

I have a degree in psychology from a non-US university. Pursuing a career in psychology isn’t on the cards for me; when I did this degree, I was dramatically oversold the career prospects attached to my degree, and being honest the course content killed any interest I had in pursuing any further education in psychology to actually get into work.

I have been exploring other options for going back into education, from doing another bachelors degree, to certifications, to masters programs not tied to psychology. One of these that keeps coming across my screen is a 10 month boot camp in cybersecurity. Would this actually prepare me for working in cybersecurity, or would I need a traditional degree or something else to make it worth my while? The ad claims that there’s no need for prior experience, but 10 months to come out into growing field with high pay seems a little too good to be true.

I have a very specific skill set that this company requires. On paper I am a 100% match for what they are looking for. I went through 3 interviews all were great conversations, the person I would be working under even said ""you check all the boxes."" I then interviewed with their boss and it went great. We talked about the interview process and how I am the last person they have interviewed in the second wave of people (apparently other interviews haven't been close to what they want). I was told I would hear back within the next week to week 1/2 (Tomorrow marks 1 week). 

I have not followed up as I am giving them the time they told me they would reach out. 

The ONLY issue I see with all of this is it would require me to move cross country for this job. I have stated through all interviews it is no problem at all when they need me there I'll be there. In the job description it even states they will pay for relocation! 

This job would be life changing for me in compensation, location, and work opportunities in the future.

I am very smart when it comes to finding patterns in mathematical equations. However awful at formulas which leads to me being insecure in my math skills as I do not do what I am thought to find equations.

I am stating this as I feel I want to have time to complete my dream degree later and why I am asking the question with the requirements:

Good job that pays a living wage

actually hiring in high demand

Physical Job (It may sound like an irony to not want a math or science job but I want my mind to develop more by having my studies as a hobby not a job until I get a doctorates degree.

Provides decent hours ( When ever I pursue my degree I do not want to worry about not having enough time to complete 2 classes per 1-2 months)

Can get a bachelors degree in quickly and requires little math do not want to worry about my gpa just want math to be a hobby right now

I really do not want to desk job. I get the career I want is sorta a desk job but 2 things flexible schedule and its a career I want not the same as siting down in a awful job all day.

Just to preface, I’m in the UK. 

I’ve been welding for the past 4 years now, and it’s taken me to now to realise where I am, there’s absolutely no career progression. I recently saw an advert for an academy in software testing, and it’s something I’m really interested in outside of work. I applied and passed the aptitude test and I am taking the final interview tomorrow. Now for the advice: 

I haven’t told my boss I’ve been looking for other jobs, and I would like to give notice as he is a stand up guy, even though my contract says I don’t have to. The interview is tomorrow, and the academy starts on Monday. I’ve really dug myself a hole, but I don’t want to tell him now, incase I don’t get the job. 

I really would appreciate advice on the situation, and I don’t mind you being critical about it, I know I’m in the wrong.

Ever since then he keep little jabs and slightly insulting comments about everything I do or say.
I don't want to be the new (and one of the youngest) worker that makes waves, but it really getting on my nerves.

I started at my current job about 1.5 years ago.

A month after I first started at this job, my head of department handed in her notice and left almost immediately. She left for another job because of a toxic situation with another colleague/management. There was already another vacant position in the department, so this meant that the office was at half-capacity, one of few colleagues being me who was still learning the role one month in -- along with aforementioned toxic colleague/management further complicating things.

After a few months (of stress and inefficient work) they found an amazing replacement head of department. Our department was finally full and we worked really well together. The problem is that the workloads are still unsustainable and we're not listened to when we try and communicate this: management acknowledge that we're understaffed and resources are finite, but then never take steps to lighten our workload (rather, the opposite - it's infuriating).

The kicker is: our new head of department is now leaving (and I don't blame them) after a less than a year in the role, because of the unhealthy environment and unsustainable workload. I know from experience that the situation can only get worse, like before: no one to coordinate/oversee the department, and an increased workload (we're already at our limit) for those of us who stay on, and only false support from management. (Management don't even want to advertise the head of department role for another few months because it 'looks bad'). There are also some big projects that my head of department was following either alone or together with me and it's not yet defined who will take these forward. The cherry on top: I know that at least one colleague plans on leaving when possible because she, too, is sick of the situation, burned out, and knows it can only go downhill from here.

It was suggested to me that I could, however, take advantage of the situation as an opportunity: to ask to take full lead on the big project/s on the condition of a raise given the increase in responsibility, and then once these are done, hand in my notice. Pros: I would (very rapidly) learn and grow my skills, earn (a little bit) more, and have this extra experience in project leadership in my CV. Cons: I will have literally zero support during that time, it would be my first time doing any of this, I know from experience that having no head of department is extremely stressful, as well as toxic/unsympathetic colleauge/s to deal with.

My other alternative is simply to find another job - something I've been considering for a while. My skillset is pretty well-requested in my field. I would feel bad leaving mid-project, also because most of my colleagues are amazing and my job, though not particularly well-paid, has some good healthcare/other perks.

I'm really 50/50. Part of me wants to challenge and the growth, and the other half wonders why the hell I should put myself through this stressful situation (again).

Any advice/thoughts would be very appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I also have another job offer that my recruiter says I will be extended if the company's headcount can onboard me. The recruiter said they will let me know this month. Company B's recruiter said 190k in total comp, drivable, known for burnouts, FAANG. Verbal only.

Notes: Company B is having a bunch of layoffs/hiring freezes, and company A is probably more stable. Company A is also prestigious in its own right. Fresh out of college, 21 yrs old. Company B was supposed to let me know in December, but didn't say anything until I asked this month and was told that there is no news so they didn't say anything :/

I know if I renege, I will probably be blacklisted and I don't want to burn bridges this early in my career, especially with such a big company like company A. But that total comp, if they extend it, is pretty juicy and would set me up for retirement I think. I know that if company B cant extend me an offer, I'm stressing over nothing. But if they do, what should I do?

I'm 23(m) and currently doing my masters in molecular biomedicine and graduating in less than a year. My dream has always been to do a Ph.D and go into research. It's what I always wanted to do, but I've recently discovered that getting a job in research is really hard and if you get a job the pay will be miserable. Now I was never someone who was chasing money and I still don't, but it feels a bit disappointing to put all the work into this for almost nothing. Now I'm considering to to into medical school, but there's a few doubts I have. First, when I finish my masters I'm gonna be 24 and including all the deadlines and bureaucracy here in germany, it will probably take another until I can actually start medical school. So I will be 25 when I start and finish earliest when I'm 31. Second, I will have to take a student loan, because even with a part time job I will not be able to finance everything by myself. So If I actually go with this I will start working when I'm 31 while being  approximately 50.000€ -60.000 € in debt. 

Now I need some advice. Should I go on with this plan or is it too risky? The other option is doing a Ph.D and risking not finding a job or only one with horrible work conditions.

After some advice here, in the last 6 months I have moved companies from a big organisation in a management position to a team member position in a much smaller organisation, money being the main driver for the move (30% payrise).

To put my current role into perspective, I am a Lead, have a Senior above me and 3 Apprentices below. We have 2 more Leads set to start within the next month and actively recruiting for a 3rd.The job itself has about 2-3 years left in it before it will be difficult to find a similar job.

After a few months in the role I am missing elements of my old job, the responsibility, importance etc and I am slowly starting to dislike going to work more and more as the months go on.

I recently reached out and had a conversation with the director of a different department, he had some roles available that I am extremely interested in and very similar to what I used to do. The conversation went well, they said I showed great enthusiasm and said that I would fit in the team perfectly with great opportunities for development and growth. The role in question also has the opportunity to transfer across industries quite easily, which in my current role it would be much harder to do so.

Naturally I came away over the moon, I felt like a massive weight had been lifted off my shoulders and I could see a future for myself.

A week goes by and we have another catch up, they tell me that they have spoken with the CEO of the company and are both in agreement that although I would be great at the job and I quote ""I would have you in my team in a heartbeat"", my current role is too essential and important to the business.

Now I feel I am at a standstill, I feel like just handing my notice in and quitting, but on the same foot I am highly thought of and get paid very well for what I do. The company has a great benefit package and has recently been putting a lot of emphasis on ""The development and progression of our people"" which seems to be the opposite of what has happened to me.

I am just after some opinions really, am I right to feel annoyed? Should I start looking elsewhere? Thanks in advance"

Hey guys, kinda new here. I’m 22 and a recent college grad with a Bachelors in Psychology and 2 minors in Sociology and Law. I wanted a break from college and all academia in general after I graduated, and my parents were nice enough to give me 6 months (I’m living with them currently).

this is not the end of my education journey; i will be doing my Masters in library science online after i finish my bachelors. While im working on my masters, id like to have a part time job of some kind.  
I should mention, i am disabled and use a cane, so jobs that are physically demanding arent an option for me. i was thinking of getting a regular job in retail/ a restaurant but i am concerned it would be too physically demanding. What are good jobs i could get with my degree with no experience? Thanks!"

Is one more desirable over another in terms of pay, opportunity, or work life? I was reading about how some some people enroll in a HIM program and then apply for jobs in medical coding. Is there some benefit to going that route instead of just getting into a medical coding program? I’m a little confused about the whole thing. Still pretty unfamiliar with both career paths and looking for the one that’s the best fit for me. 

I have a BA in communications and journalism. I’m in my mid 50s, so that was a long time ago. But I’ve had varied careers over the years. I love words, language, communicating verbally and via writing. I’m very detail-oriented and love working solo. I feel like this could be a good fit for me. I used to be a medical transcriptionist years ago. 

I’ve had the same career for many years working in vacation property management…but that ended during Covid. Looking for a fresh start with something new that I’ll enjoy and can do from home, as we may be moving to the outskirts of my city within the next few years. So that would be ideal. Would love some feedback on both career paths and the ideal path to become a medical coder, since it seems like a lot of people go the HIM route initially."

After graduation, I worked briefly in a dental lab as a model/milling assistant but the pay/hours they were requiring was horrible so I worked as a caregiver in the mean time until I found my current job.

I went into my biology degree with nursing in mind but I realized working directly with patients wasn't for me after working as a caregiver.

3,2023-01-17,How to deal with family pressure to pursue a job that doesn't interest me?,u/Amateurfilmmaker123,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10eq6jc/how_to_deal_with_family_pressure_to_pursue_a_job/,careerguidance,"The title pretty much explains my current situation. A little bit of background on me/my family:

&amp;#x200B;

I come from a middle-class household and am currently in my third year at my university studying business administration. During college admissions, I wasn't really sure on what I wanted to do with my life and, amid all of the confusion, ended up choosing a very prestigious private school under the pressure of my parents. However, I'm starting to regret my decision. If I'm going to be completely honest, in the moment of the decision I felt pressured by my parents because in their eyes the value of the education was just too good to pass up, especially since this school often places kids in very good jobs upon graduation, serving as a ""feeder school"" to very prestigious IB and other finance firms. So I agreed and attended the school under their guidance. What we didn't talk about with this decision is the financial pressure that came with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am one of four kids and although my parents are able to pay the expected amount of tuition (with generous help from financial aid), the education is still costing my family a pretty penny, especially considering that they want to help send my other siblings to school. This is something I feel guilty about every time it comes up, and it always seems to be the topic of conversation when discussing what I want to do once I graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

In regard to career stuff, I have been fortunate enough to discover two amazing passions during my time at school: Film and language learning/experiencing other cultures. I found these passions after a major injury I had during my freshman year that left me unable to walk for months. I have taken my pursuit of them into my own hands, chasing them relentlessly, developing my filmmaking/language learning craft, and even receiving praise from professors and employers for my good work on past projects. It's something I'm extremely passionate about and, in my opinion, genuinely good at.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently run the social media for an official school account, creating and managing content as the photographer/videographer, and also have developed a professional fluency in Spanish while beginning to study Brazilian Portuguese. I have also worked on several documentary projects through the school. I would absolutely love to find work working on film sets of some kind (or start my own production company) after I graduate, as it's something that gets me up every morning! I absolutely love it, and if I could find a way to combine this film work with working abroad that would be a dream. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, now that the time to apply for internships is approaching I'm starting to feel enormous pressure to pursue a prestigious career in Investment Banking/Consulting. This is something that genuinely does not interest me at all, but every time I have this conversation with my parents it always revolves back to how they have dished out a pretty penny for me to attend this school, and if I don't want to get an instantly high-paying job after I graduate why did I even attend?

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that my parents genuinely just want the best for me, and I'm trying to see it from their angle: they've spent a lot of money to help me get a good education and want me to be financially secure in my life. I'm extremely grateful that they care enough to even have this conversation. However, the path that they're outlining genuinely does not interest me at all and I've resolved I want to do something different with my life.

&amp;#x200B;

The pressure I feel whenever this crosses my mind just feels enormous and I'm starting to resent both my parents and, above anyone else, myself for not making the correct decision several years ago. If I had known that choosing this school would result in me having to choose a career I hated, I never would have done it. I feel like I'm in too deep to change anything, as I only have two semesters left at this university and a lot of the money has already been spent.

&amp;#x200B;

Have any of you guys dealt with this? If so, how? I feel very lost and under a lot of pressure right now. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!"

I’ve been with the company for 3 years now, no disciplinary marks the entire time. A member of my organization mentioned that they believe we are being let go. I’m not sure what to believe, any thoughts?

UPDATE: I was indeed let go (RIF) I attended 2 daily meetings and a planning for our next sprint and shortly after was my meeting where they informed me I was being let go.

For those asking I am a QA Analyst(remote) I was with the company when it was a start up but they were recently bought out by a bigger company. From my brief conversation with other members in QA a total of 25 QA employees were laid off including some developers and engineers.

I was offered a severance package which I have not signed yet. They are offering 6 weeks worth of pay but will not include the hours I have worked this pay period(60) or my vacation hours I had accumulated(64).

My manager offered to be used as a reference and played like they were upset I had to be let go but I was told by someone that remained on the team that all members that were friends of theirs before joining this company remained(6 members hired last month who did not know how the company functioned or could not run any test plans alone) so in my eyes they decided to save their friends over people who were there before they(manager) was even hired. That left a sour taste in my mouth.

I have started my search for a new job in the same position/field. I was a full time manual QA (in the process of learning automation) making roughly $32/hr. I was in charge of creating/managing test plans &amp; test cases, creating/analyzing/validating bugs/tickets on Jira, working closely with the dev team on sprint tickets. Using Charles Proxy/Postman/Android Studio/MySQL daily depending on test cases. There's more on my plate but I do hope I can find something relatively soon. 

I will post this update in the comments and answer any questions I have seen. Thank you for everybody that has reached out with comments or positivity I appreciate all of you.

TLDR; Was laid off due to RIF(reduction in force) manager kept close friends who were extremely new over members of company with longer seniority than said manager."

1,2023-01-17,Tips for dealing with imposter syndrome and overall feeling like you are bad at your job?,u/BravoSavvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10eror2/tips_for_dealing_with_imposter_syndrome_and/,careerguidance,"Hello,

I've worked in higher ed now for almost 10 years.  I did a lot of student-facing work, advising and success coaching and while those jobs were great, I got really burnt out talking to students and I realized while I was good at it, those specific roles weren't the best fit for me. 

I left higher ed for about a year doing similar work, and in the midst of all that applied to an LMS (learning management system) instructional support role at another college.  This was the hardest interview I've ever completed, but I was offered the job! I met a lot of great people out of that and sadly, left due to a super toxic work environment.  The silver lining was that I now had educational technology experience and lots of it.  Even though I was there for only 7-8 months, this was the height of COVID and the rush to push everything online.  I set up APIs, managed and fixed course content, did low to mid-level tech support for students, and helped install and set up 3rd party tools from publishers like McGraw Hill and Pearson.  I gained a lot of confidence during this time because I had to teach myself a lot of this due to not having great support from my supervisors. 

I ended up leaving and got a position working on the LMS at my previous employer, a different college.  This was great work-life balance, an okay-but not-so-great paycheck, and I worked on a team of 3 other people who had been managing the LMS for about 20 years.  They were super friendly and talented, but they didn't really need me.  I ended up answering very easy support tickets and doing very simple, minimal tasks in the LMS that were almost mind numbing.  Some days, I had nothing to do.  Some people called me crazy for not wanting to stick with that job, but when I say mind numbing tasks, I really mean it.  I knew I had so much more to offer and I didn't see my responsibilities changing anytime in the near future.  

My friend at a local state college reached out to me about a systems admin job for their CRM system.  After reading the qualifications and seeing that they didn't need someone who knew SQL or needed to code, I applied.  I interviewed, thought it went well and was offered the job.  I started this job back in June and have been here about 7 months.

It's been hard adjusting to CRM administration when I've been so used to working on the LMS side.  My boss essentially had this role before me, but now she is a director.  She is not an IT person and considers herself self-taught as she implemented this system with not much help or support and taught herself a lot of things.  I give her credit for this.  With that being said, she is nearly inaccessible and not available at all due to meetings and her other duties.  It just makes it hard to ask how something was set up, how a workflow runs, the history of 'this' or history of 'that.'  I wish I was on a team more-so, so I could ask questions as that's how I best learn.  

With that being said, I've learned a lot in the past 7 months and keep reminding myself that my boss has spent 4+ years in this system from implementation to now, and that I'm being really hard on myself.  We work in an extremely chaotic environment and I have no clear priority.  I'm managing my projects and requests the best I can.  I also do on-demand, live tech support on the daily.  I just hate when I can't figure something out quickly or by myself... it makes me feel really bad at my job or that maybe I shouldn't be in this job, because I can't do it.  Unlike the LMS, CRM systems are a little less intuitive and more clunky and overall I'm just a little less familiar with database administration.  

I'm good with technology and am self-taught as well - and am very good at training others on technology and having the patience to do so.  I have done some great work thus far, but a lot of the time I feel like an imposter who shouldn't be in this role because I feel like I don't what the F I'm doing.  I submit tickets to our CRM vendor, who does help but that can take some time to get back to me which can delay the process if I could just learn or figure it out on my own.  

I try to tell myself that learning a job of this nature takes time and patience, and you don't have to have it all figured out.  I'm doing my best, I'm reliable, and am very friendly and pleasant at work to others so why am I constantly stressed or worried that I'm not doing good enough? 

I'm assuming other people have dealt with this but any tips or shared experiences are helpful, especially from those who work in tech and can relate to having a sys admin type of job. 

TIA! 

TL;DR: Started a job 7 months ago out of my comfort zone.  Everyone says I can do it, but I feel pretty bad about not being able to figure things out easily and overall spiraling, thinking I'm bad at my job and that maybe I'm not cut out for this.  I work in higher ed as a CRM systems administrator."

I've applied to 40  jobs in total within 3 weeks. I had one interview and just got a request  for another interview.

The issue.  Im in durham and im looking at Denver. I have 3 years experience and Im  a tier2 tech. If I move now I am looking at making like $60k. If I wait  another year and get the CCNA I just started and maybe even another  cert, i am looking at $80k.

for  context I am an It undergrad. I am currently working tier 2 and really  would just need one or two certs to leave helpdesk. If I move right now I  am going to land in another helpdesk role. I am a single 29m and have about $15k in the bank. no debt..

If  I move right my money will not go as far due to high cost of living, I  will not be moving up at all, and I'll be uprooting my life for this.

I really thought I wanted the move, but the more I felt out the job market the more I realized it didnt make sense.

My standard of living will shrink and I will not advance my career.

The  idea of moving was a dream, but I generally feel like its in my best  interest to stay at my predictable job right now and get some certs  done. Then later, maybe the end of the year, re-evaluate.Then if I wanted to move I would have real career advancement and also make enough to do alright in a more expensive city.

What sucks is turning interviews down, but Im to a point where I think Id turn down offers.60k in Denver is still less then 55k in durham and I dont want to prolong my time in helpdesk.

I guess it seems like I made up my mind, but maybe I just want to be told its a smart move."

I have a BA in Film &amp; Television Production, but most recently worked in Construction.

I started off as a Low Voltage Service Technician for commercial buildings. Basically I helped install and service various systems (Wi-Fi, Security Cameras and Entry, Alarms) in new Apartments/Hotels. When I started, there were 3 people in the company: CEO, Project Manager, Me. The CEO came from a bigger company so he already had some big clients and million dollar contracts regardless. As a result, I wore a LOT of hats and quickly grew within the company. Even though my title changed, my responsibilities still carried over from the previous role. Depending on the day, I would either be handling operations (purchasing and scheduling), engineering (AutoCAD), accounting, research &amp; sales, or would be going to the field for service calls.

I'm not really sure how to fit these on my resume in less than 5 bullet points. Also the lack of focus in one role makes it difficult to know where my experience lies in each role. I kind of have Operations experience, but I don't feel confident saying I can be an Operations Manager anywhere else. I was laid off due to budget cuts and probably because I was getting noticeably burnt out. I've been unemployed since April and have not had any luck in the job search since then. I've applied and interviewed, but my work history gap and sporadic experience has made me lose direction. Should I go back to Film or stay in Construction? Maybe a different industry entirely?

I've always had a great work ethic, but I struggle at being a self-starter, so starting my own business would not be ideal for me. I'm not a business-minded guy. I'm not trying to change the world or make a billion dollars. Just want a stable, clock-in clock-out type of job. I just want to be able to pay the bills and spend time with my family. I'm willing to take classes and get certs for the job, but I'm already 8 months into unemployment so I'd like to expedite the process.

Besides going back into the trades, what should I do? Also how can I explain my gap in employment history to an interviewer?"

After 5.5 years I was wondering about leaving and then I got offered another role in a new division which was highly technical, I accepted the role as a senior engineer and was glad I get to do more dev work, 6 months in, our team lead resigned and I was offered his position. I was shocked beyond anything, and elated that I was even considered, the fact that my other teammates are far more experienced, I thought I was too young as in less experienced to be accepting this role. I did accept the offer and it’s been great. For last 1 year I have been the team lead/engineering manager. I feel I do a lot more but I don’t get time to code, I do ton of code reviews and tech planning. Honestly I like this role. Now my issue is if I want to switch companies, I want to join in as an engineering manager and I am worried if I will get anything with just 7 years of experience. 

PS : A female in tech, who did a lot of hard work to be taken seriously and show that I am worthy in my current company, I am scared that once I switch I will have to work not just at my work but also to make people trust that I am good at what I do. This has made me too anxious and not want to shift job for years now. This is my first job out of university.

sorry if this is too much random info :|

I graduated with an engineering degree in December of 2021. I had a job lined up and ready to go for after graduation. I began working in early January of 2022. Immediately, things did not go as planned. At my job I was extremely bored, ignored, and was also commuting very far. After 5 months, I found a new job and quit. 

My new job is better than my first job, however, I’m still very bored. The work I do is very unfulfilling and because of this boredom I really don’t do a great job at work. 

I’ve had talks with my boss about how I’m just not understanding what’s going on and why my work hasn’t been up to par. Which makes me feel even worse now that others have noticed my quality of work. 

There is another component to this, so bear with me. A month after I started my second job (July 2022) I began experiencing severe mental health issues related to anxiety and panic disorder. It was an extremely difficult time for me and I went into inpatient treatment for 3 weeks. After I got out, I continued to work. I am doing better than before, however, I am extremely stressed out about my job and my interactions with other coworkers because I simply am not good at my job. 

Lately I’ve been thinking about quitting my job and taking 2/3 months to get my anxiety under control and find a job that would truly make me happy. I wish I would have taken some time to reflect more after college instead of jumping right in. I just feel guilty about not working. But the way I’m working now isn’t admirable either. I feel so stuck. I can’t see myself doing this like of work forever.
I do have enough money saved up to last me probably 6-8 months. 
—————————————————————————————

I think it should be noted that my health because of my anxiety is pretty bad. I barely sleep anymore and I’m so tired all day. I puke a lot and even just have a hard time going out in public because of my anxiety. I feel like I’m fighting a huge battle."

I’m in healthcare and interviewed successfully at another facility. I ended up receiving a very generous offer and left my former employer.

A week into my new job, it was discovered the hourly amount was keyed in wrong by the recruiter and my actual hourly rate is now $10 less. The Union rep who I contacted told me it can’t be honored due to the Unions contract. The new facility is Union represented and comes with a pension and yearly guaranteed increases. While I’m still getting used to the new environment, it seems chaotic, disorganized, and less helpful. 

My old facility paid less, but having been there for 10 years I shaped and built it to a manageable work load. My core team there is trustworthy and we work well together.

So I’m in a crossroads in my life, I’m about to graduate with a BA in Humanities with a minor in Public Administration. Im 32 year old female who had worked in hospitality her whole life, a Barista and manager at a cafe, I wore many hats in service. That being said I love working in a team and I enjoy giving and receiving support. Seeing things come together and helping people, etc. I am currently torn between going to Law school, public or private policy or switching completely and going into nursing. Nursing because I’m so accustomed to working in a busy and changing environment, plus stressful and deals with people being annoying, but somehow it’s fun dealing with all the moving parts and being pushed to think fast, also I wanted to do nursing before going to John Jay (covid scared me off a bit)
I’ve recently been finding law and philosophy so pretentious and the people who involve themselves in it seem so self absorbed. With policy, it’s hard to get your ideas taken seriously with all the bureaucracies. I don’t want to spend my entire life arguing politics, history and sociology, just to get the right thing done.  
I’m honestly looking for advice."

Last summer, I completed a purchasing internship at a large global company - mainly because I was too late applying for Finance internships and I just wanted to get some corporate experience and get my foot in the door with a good company. I enjoyed purchasing, but I also wasn’t in love with it, so my plan has still been to go into corporate finance.

However, I was just offered a full-time position to join the indirect purchasing team as an entry level buyer at this company upon graduation. 

Now I am stuck between taking the purchasing job and being guaranteed a good job upon college with great benefits (despite maybe not loving the job), or continuing to apply for corporate finance positions and risk not having a job for a period of time after college. 

I want to accept the purchasing job, but I am worried that after a couple years I may wish I went into finance, and if I switch careers I will basically have to restart my career with an entry level role at that point. The other thing is I have never done an internship in finance so I’m not 100% sure I would even really like it, but it is what I have thought I want to do.

I also live in a mid-sized city (population 200,000), and haven’t seen an abundance of finance opportunities. Additionally, I have to compete against graduates of better business schools in the area.

It seemed out of character for him not to respond at all, but I thought maybe he was just waiting until closer to the start date, plus the holiday season was going on (and I think he has a new baby, so...basically he's got a lot on his mind right now). I sent a polite ""just checking in"" followup as a reply to the original email about a week ago, and still nothing (nothing in the spam filter either). In the past he's been upfront about things like not having any more info yet, so again, the lack of response feels unusual - and if they had decided not to hire me after all, I believe he would have said so.

So: would it be pushy to try sending another email? Other methods of contact (e.g. Slack) in case my emails have somehow gotten lost? Am I being too paranoid and should just continue to wait for now? 

There aren't many other opportunities available right now, and I haven't yet been able to line up anything after my current job ends. I recognize that this might be making me overly worried, so I would appreciate any other opinions or advice.

I have a master's degree in arts management from my home country, which allows me to enroll in postgraduate programs here.

At this moment I got accepted to both and have to decide which one to take.  
I enjoy working with people, I’ve always been a people person, I have a good experience with hiring and training new employees. 
On the other hand, I’m a very detail oriented and tedious type that doesn’t mind mundane office tasks, I’ve always enjoyed legal matters and wanted to become a lawyer in the past (couldn’t happen for various reasons). 
I would love to hear advice and/or opinions on both occupations, especially from people who changed careers in their 30-40s. Thank you!"

Boss has deleted my clients, saying she's trying to book them onto the same day as it's hard for me to get there and no point for just 1 client per day. However, she's also blocked off my workdays, so clients can't even attempt to book me anytime on my work hours.

I wonder should I keep this casual job, though almost no chance of hours, so when I get an interview, I can still say I'm employed, which always looks better? Or should I get a random job like a dental assignment or a kindergarten teacher, and just get some random income until I get pregnant, as we're going to be trying for 1st child soon, and I'll be able to come back to this after my maternity leave.

Back story: I'm an engineer and currently make okay money 70k + Car. I've been in this role since early 2021, however in July 2022, I was offered a job for 150k a year. The job seemed a little bit sketchy but it was with a fairly large company so I thought it was a good idea. So I accepted. I quit my job on the Thursday night after a call with my boss and the next morning he told me to leave the office and give the car back.

Over the weekend I received a call from the recruiter saying they wanted to have another meeting with me, so I could meet the engineer I would be working under. When I got there, they said I had been undersold the job hard and what I applied for is nothing like the role. I applied for a design engineer role, the role was actually swinging hammers etc. in the underground coal mine 5 days a week. There were many other red flags about this company so I ended up calling my old boss and said, look I’ve made a mistake, would you be interested in taking me back. At first my boss said, sorry we have moved on (I had been gone 2 working days at this point) But towards the end of the week he called me and told me to come in and have a chat. In the end he gave me my job back.

My job at the moment is very chill and I have an amazing boss, the job is quite flexible. If I want to finish early I just come in early, and they are super relaxed about taking holidays. There are a bunch of good things about working here, but I do barely anything and it's starting to eat at me. I worked for my engineering degree and I want to use it. I feel like I’m not building good experience or skills.

Cut to now, 6 months later. A friend from university recently got a job with a large mining company and said they are looking for project engineers (which is the job type I’ve been interested in for since uni) and put my name in. They contacted me and after some interviews offered me the position. Salary is 138k which is almost double what I am on now (excluding car)

However, now I am a ball of anxiety and doubt. I’m worried I’m not qualified enough for this new position. Even though the people I interviewed with knew my experience and were happy with it and said they want to train me. I just can’t shake the imposter syndrome. I am also terrified of leaving my company again, after leaving 6 months ago and them helping me out by taking me back. Especially since we are starting to get really busy. (We are a very small company. Boss who is trying to retire, 1 other engineer, an admin person, and myself.)

Has anyone else been through anything similar? As I’m writing this out, I can see that taking the job is the right thing to do. It’s just a hard thing to do after my boss gave me my job back after I screwed them around the first time. Does anyone have tips on how to approach this situation with my current boss? And tips on being extremely overwhelmed at a new job and battling imposter syndrome.

Apologies for the long explanation.

EDIT: thank you all for your advice. To be clear, I told everyone I walked, and took a day off for the ceremony. A month ago, my boss asked ""You graduated, right?"" And I said yes. I think I'm gonna come clean. 

This has been the most incredible boutique company I've worked for, and I truly love this job and the people I work with. I joined full time pre-graduation and am now the head supervisor after 2yrs. I was working thru college during the beginning of my position but dropped out without telling anyone at work. Made it seem like I graduated with my bachelors (no change in HR paperwork or anything). It's been 8 months since.

Now I'm about to be promoted to asst manager. I don't know if they will run an extra background check or not. I also feel so guilty for misleading my boss, which could in turn screw him over with corporate for corroborating my story, even though he had no clue. I was going to come clean within a year, but now this (unexpected) promotion is soon. The official job description for the asst manager position does NOT require a bachelors.

However, there is always the chance of them finding out at any point, not on my own terms, which would absolutely ruin the trust I've built and my reputation for future career prospects. 

Should I come clean before signing the papers? Should I quit and leave to save face (of course I would be upfront about my lack of degree at another company)? Should I quietly sign and not say anything? Should I quietly sign, then resign in a few months?

Logically I realize that the cleanest thing would be to simply quit, but my heart and mental health would be so guilty to leave &amp; burn this bridge on dishonest terms. I do fully understand that this is the hole I've dug. No one in my life knows about my situation, and any advice, from someone who hasn't been going around in circles trying to figure this out with as few bumps as possible, would be greatly appreciated

I got free college through the current store I work at. I chose a certificate because I've dropped out of college twice before and wanted to wade my way in rather than jump into a huge degree. I understand that in many instances an associate's or bachelor's degree would be preferable but I didn't want to risk it.

I'm currently ahead and on-route to graduate in May, I've devoted most of my free time to doing college and I'm excited to finally make it. Because it's a cert that covers Network+, Security+, and CySa+,  all the topics are covered just enough to help me understand the topic at hand.

On top of all this, I've noticed that many jobs in my area, and in my home state, have extremely varying requirements to the point where trying to set up a plan is pretty overwhelming. I thought I'd ask for advice and see if anyone in the field may have good advice on the topic. My hope is that I'll finally be able to break this cycle of working blue-collar and retail jobs and finally land myself in a good position.

My current plan is as follows:

* Graduate college.
* Refresh on the subjects I've learned.
* Get *at least* Network+ and Security+ certified.
* Refresh my resume and cater it to the tech industry."

I'm currently 21 years old. I dropped out of college in December 2021 to take Google's UX Design certification. I finished the course and built my portfolio in Summer 2022. I applied to tons of jobs and tried looking for internships but had 0 luck. I then found remote insurance sales. I got my life insurance license in October 2022. In order to make money in the life insurance sales industry, you have to sell insurance policies. I spent hundreds of dollars on insurance leads and had 0 ROI. I came to the realization that i had no more money to invest into leads, so i left that job in January 2023. I'm currently unemployed &amp; live with my parents. I don't feel like a total failure because I work out consistently.. i'm actually in great shape &amp; i help my parents remodel the house, so i'm not a total couch potato, but financially i feel really insecure as i only have $331 USD to my name. I'd have to resort to getting a normal job but I don't know where. My interests are cars &amp; fitness. I heard that personal trainers don't make alot unless they have a large clientele which once again.. isn't stable like my previous insurance sales job. For cars, i don't know if i would enjoy being a mechanic. I was looking into amazon warehouse because they pay well and have great benefits. I also have in mind to start a clothing line in the future or buy my first rental property. Problem is that clothing business is saturated and investing in real estate in Miami, FL (Resident state) is hard due to the rising costs of houses. If anyone can share advice on what is the best route to take, i'd greatly appreciate it."

Just wanted to start a thread around the topic of asking for a raise at their current company, specifically in the near future. Maybe we can give each other some advice or tips.  
For me, I've already reached out to HR to make sure this was the best time to approach and set up a meeting with my manager since our annual 1 on 1 review is around this time. I'm very nervous because this is the first time I'm proactively asking for it in a professional work place. I've been with this company for almost 2 years, had one small raise last year (just to cover inflation).  
I've been planning on how to give my pitch, preparing what to say, studying all the advice I can find online. I am planning on asking for a 20-30% raise, I know its a lot, but because my salary is already under the average of other similar ones in my area, and also I've learned and executed new skills pretty well the past year.  
I'm just afraid because I know times are tough for all companies right now, but I'm also trying to tell myself if I dont ask, I probably will never have a chance at it.  
How are your guys's going??"

I’m still on my parents health insurance, and am a full time graduate student in an MSW program. $32,000 in student loans from my undergraduate. The first 2 years are funded. I’m doing the “3 year plan” and will graduate at 26. 

In the last year, I’ll have to take out some loans to pay tuition because my GA doesn’t cover part time. In the last year, I’ll take out around $12,000 more. My school is 4.5 hours away from my family. I have few friends and no significant other, but plan on growing a community here. 

The thing is, I’m not sure which area of social work I want to get into. And I’m a bit unsure about this path. My issue is that I’m contemplating transitioning out of the program this summer and seeking full time employment as an entry level HR assistant or something administrative, then working my way up (ideally). I feel this drive to start my career, as I’m already 24. Especially since HR assistants can work their way up overtime and make more money. I know social workers can go into private practice but I don’t want to be a therapist. If I leave the program, I should tell them soon, because I don’t want to burn bridges with my current GAship. 

Thanks for the guidance advice!"

any advice on potential qualifications, programs, boot camps, or just general advice on what to do would be appreciated. i am good at my current job but bored with it, and i also feel like transitioning into a more technical role is sound both from a job security perspective and a financial perspective. 

another thing to keep in mind is that my current employer isn’t really interested in financing training to upskill into a different role, they’ve indicated that they’re happy with my performance in this role and would rather hire someone qualified to do data science or engineering roles. which i guess is fair from their perspective, it just means that a transition into a new role means i probably have to leave my current company."

I did my bachelors in tourism management and graduated in 2020. I really wanted to do something Data related but I was not able to afford private education at that time.  I graduated during the Covid lockdown times, and I was not able to find a job related to tourism.

After few months I was able to join my current workplace, as a Business Analyst. It is not a technical role and pay is ok for a someone that doesn't have an IT related education and work experience. I am quite comfortable here. Flexible work environment, Job is not that stress. Most of the time, I don't have anything to do, and nobody cares. I mostly did coordination and following up, documentation related work.

But I wanted to do something bit more technical. So, I started another diploma in data science. while doing that I started to applying data analyst, BI analyst positions but I got rejected from everything mostly because I don't have experience and My expectation for salary was bit higher than trainee and associate positions.

So, I realize that It's hard to change carrier easily. so, I lowered my salary expectations and finally I got a position from another company as an associate data analyst. Salary was 25% less than my current job. But when I announce my intention to resign from my current company, they said they can increase my salary by 30%. 

Now that offer is about half of the salary promised by my current company. But I don't thing I am getting any carrier progression here since I was here for 13 months, but I don't really gain anything. maybe few soft skills. I cannot change my carrier within my company since they don't do data and analytics related work.

Am I crazy to lose half of my salary to pursue a dream?"

Hi there everyone just was hoping I could get some advice on how to get myself out of this rut I am in?

Just to get into it and start I have been having a hard time getting my life together lately. To give some context I finished my graduate degree in 2019 and I received my MPH. I was feeling pumped up due to graduating with the highest cumulative gpa I ever received in my life and I thought I was ready to start my career. Low and behold I moved back in with family and was searching for jobs immediately. I applied to numerous jobs which I believed I was qualified for, however I was not success fun landing a job. I was still optimistic then the pandemic kicked in and everything shut down. Basically my social life shut down as well and to this day I have been living with my family which although I am grateful for has made me feel like I am not hitting my expected course of life and having my independence of my own place and finances in order. I also felt like a massive disappointment which made me hopeless and depressed for a few years since then and just saw myself as a loser. While some of my family and peers were able to become successful I felt like I was falling behind in life. I went to studying other things and putting my eggs in multiple things such as real estate, taking a course at a local cc for computer programming and even recently applying to other graduate programs. Basically though I feel I am at a slightly better place mentally and even physically now compared to a year ago, I still have this fear of choosing the wrong pathway and still feel lost on what I should be doing next or if I am doing the right thing in exploring. I was reluctant to share this bit, but was hoping to hear some insight and suggestions from others here? Just to give some context I am now in my early 30s (though I still don’t look my age 🤭 so I guess thats a blessing)"

I am currently off work due to a medical condition and I'm using my time off to change career to a work from home role.

Data entry seems to be appealing, but I'm not quite sure where to start? I'm like a fish out of water because I've always worked in a manual labouring role.
I have my own laptop, I'm not computer illiterate and I'm keen to make money.

Would it be beneficial to do any specific courses to help better myself in this field, or should I just start applying for data entry positions?

I am having a difficult time in my job, I would like to know your opinion.

I am the Front Office Manager, Human Resources, and manager of my employer's client companies. I give my face to all the companies, and do what I can, but I am completely exhausted.

Starting with the fact that I have the companies on my back and have already asked for a change of position.

Everything I do is charged by my colleagues, and I end up being criticized constantly.

I give my maximum for everything and in two years I haven't gone up from a salary that seems more minimal than anything else now because of inflation.

What annoys me the most is that my colleagues call me incompetent, for having some ideas, doing things X way, etc.

However, I have a different mentality. To err is part of being human and you learn from your mistake, no matter how long it takes.

I don't know how to deal with these situations anymore, there is nothing I do that isn't criticized, there isn't yelling, and they don't put other people on the spot to show my incompetence. I'm tired.

I'm looking for a new job, but it's hard.

How can I learn to deal with this better?"

(translation) ""After careful consideration, we are not interested in offering you an internship if you are going to automatically disappear for 1 year by completing a masters abroad and therefore having no guarantee that you would stay for a full-time position. However we are very much interested in your profile if you would like to work with us after your masters, since we are not compensated by offering it to you in between your studies.

I graduated last year with a Bachelors degree in finance and have been working in corporate finance ever since. There’s a number of reasons why I dislike my current career, but essentially the work/life balance is not sustainable for me. 

I enjoy Finance, but not in the way i currently use my knowledge/skills in the corporate environment. Growing up my schools taught many different classes regarding Personal Finance, Economics, Business skills, and Excel. And after considering my options for my future career I’ve decided that’s what I want to do - teach others what I am passionate about.

My question for this subreddit is where do I begin? From my limited research it seems like there are programs to fast track a career change to education if you have a degree in a particular specialty area. But I’ve also read that many pursue a masters in education. I’m just not really sure what the best option for me is. Or what options are really even out there that I’m unaware of. I’d like to teach at the highschool, Juco, or university level (though i’m not sure how hard the requirements are to teach at university)

TLDR: How do I change from my career in Finance to teaching Finance-related classes at the Highschool, Juco, or University level."

I live in a pretty rural area and it is not really feasible right now for me to relocate currently.

I am in a financial situation where being un employed for a little while wouldn't be an issue. 


My job is making me miserable. I never wanted to work in a lab setting, I just kind of fell into this job. I was super thankful for it at first, but it has become a nightmare. It would be OK if I was just doing lab work, but I am doing so much more. I work in a very dirty, dangerous industrial environment. Every morning in the middle of Midwest winter I have to climb on the roof of a building and stir  buckets of poop water with a probe. For the first couple of months I would sometimes not have anything to do for days at a time which would bore me out of my mind. Now we are super busy and understaffed so my boss can basically just make me do whatever. It's been a pretty toxic work environment with a lot of passive aggressiveness. I am the only women in my company and I work with all men in their 40s and 50s. They all act super macho and have been in screaming matches and threatened to beat each other up. 



Basically, I'm at my wits end here but I am not sure what to do. Since this has taken a toll on my mental health. 

My boss told me yesterday that I am doing a really great job and I am really helping keep everything afloat right now and this would all be so hard without me (which was very nice). 

My current career goal is to be a data analyst. I am currently learning sql and getting the google data analytics certification, but I have been so emotionally exhausted from my job I havent been able to work on it in the last month. I have a lot of experience from college (R, MATLAB, excel) and in my current job with data analysis, working with large datasetz and data cleaning. Since I live in a pretty rural area I would probably need to look for a remote position which could be very competitive.


 I don't want the fact that I was only at this position for 5 months to make me look bad and make it harder for me to get a job. This is my only real job experience so I dont really know how to explain it to future employers. I also don't want me leaving in the middle of a difficult time make my boss give me a bad recommendation.  I am afraid he would be really mad at me quitting that if I put in my two weeks that he would make them a living hell. 



Sorry this is so long lol I just don't know what to do."

I’m a 26yr medical assistant, I’ve been in healthcare (oncology) for 5 years and I am soooooo over it. I wanted to expand my career in healthcare as healthcare was all I wanted to be in but never wanted to become an RN (kudos to all of you). Everyone wants me to become an RN or at least get my RN BSN (I currently have an associates in applied sciences) and do something else outside of patient care but I am truly not feeling it.  I also looked into sonography but I looked away from that as well. 

So within the past year I’ve decided to pick my brain outside of healthcare and look into real estate. I’ve been in RE school trying to obtain my license to become a realtor but I’ve been procrastinating. My RE course expires in March so I’m going to make sure I complete it because I don’t want my money to go to waste. I know when becoming a realtor, I still need a full time job because that will not pay all of my bills in the beginning. 

I love helping people, leadership, organization. 

But I’m stuck in a position where I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT I WANT TO DOOOOO. 

So here I am, looking forward to all of your wonderful responses. What the heck is out there?"

When I first started, I was the first fulltime employee in my dept (with a consultant) and the department has struggled to grow after turnovers in leadership roles. It's finally starting to add people, and I am now the most senior person, and am burned out.


My last boss was asked to resign at the end of '22, and I wanted to stay long enough to see what changes the new boss might bring.


I took a 2 week vacation over new years (from which I did not expect to return) to try to rest and reset because while I am very tired and am seeing my influence diminish, it's been the best job I've had with some people I truly admire.


There are lots of big projects planned for the next couple of years, but I just don't think I have it in me for either the big projects or social changes. It's been hard to accept but I think I'm past due to move on. 


I still have some unfinished projects, and there is a recertification audit coming in the summer. I feel guilty for potentially leaving the company to finish my projects and navigate the audit when no people in the dept will have been there for more than a year. 


My question is, could leaving harm my reputation when they might need my knowledge for the audit? Or is this just the undeserved guilt people often feel when leaving a job? I feel like I'm running away, but as much as I want to, I haven't been able to engage with the work and don't want to harm the team.


Extra: I also accepted a promotion last year that was not a leadership position I wanted. I worry it was their attempt to retain me with the boss leaving."
4,2023-01-18,any other confused engineers? Trade school after receiving bachelors degree/switching careers,u/NeedleworkerTop111,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10f9kbb/any_other_confused_engineers_trade_school_after/,careerguidance,"Little background about myself - I am an immigrant and like most immigrants i was taught to focus on nothing else but studies and get a job in the STEM field. Although my parents never really put the pressure on me I felt as if my only safe option was engineering, since I didn’t wanna study 7+ years doing Med. Ironically it would take me 6ish years to get a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering. I’m not stupid - i’ve just never been the school type. I suck at tests. Give me something practical or things to do with my hands and i’m good!  

Anyway, the reason why I was intrigued by engineering in the first place was - Avionics, Airplanes and I’ve always had this foolish dream about being an astronaut and thought engineering would be my path towards it. Little did I know a degree in engineering would mean cubicle office jobs (more on that later).   Maybe i’m stupid but i thought a degree in engineering would also involve hands on work but now i’m realizing i should’ve just went to trade school instead of wasting 6 years of my life tryna pursue a degree i lost all passion for midway thru college. I honestly don’t know how i graduated. Now i feel as if i’m too old to be an entry level engineer somewhere. I even thought about switching to I.T to work remotely but I don’t wanna sit in front of the computer for hours.  

Since finishing college with an engineering degree and no internship experience - it took me about an year and a half to land a really good job. Don’t get me wrong i’m extremely grateful for the position i’m in but i don’t think i’m cut out for writing technical reports and working in a cubicle. Don’t get me wrong - the ppl in department are awesome and really easy going. Work environment is great but I just feel dumb and I just can’t shake the feeling that I don’t fit well and I would do better in a trade (Air technician, Avionics Technician). I just want to be out there working on things and getting my hands dirty.  

So is anyone else going through a similar situation and does anyone have any tips on going to trade school after getting a bachelors, or switching to a completely different field. Does anyone have any tips on how to get into Air/Avionics trades career?"

But I have a lot of confusion regarding how one can have a  long term career in this industry as they start off as software  engineers.

For example, I graduated some years back and have worked as a web developer. I am now at an 'intermediate/senior' level.

I've  worked at 3 different workplaces. And at every single one of those  companies, I think I have not met anyone who was above 38 years of age  except for the CEO at best.

Recently  this thought has been really scaring me that the life span of a cs  person is very shortlived as you become over qualified very quickly and  also become too expensive of a resource and it ends up making more sense  to have you replaced.

I know this  is not the case for everyone, but I fear there are far more cs people  right now than there are senior roles to accommodate them. Not everyone  can be a CTO, a software architect, a project manager.

Is  going into teaching the only 'safe' option? Can someone please guide on  how to have a long career in the industry as I'm getting worried as I'm  aging"

The work we do is very project based, with multiple roles on the project team usually involved to bring a project to completion. I work in the engineering/technical side. 

I have gotten positive un-solicited feedback on several projects that I have been saving in a folder.

There are a few projects that I know demonstrate my leadership and technical expertise which I would like to highlight to my manager but I don't believe the current project team would deliver feedback to my manager without my prodding.

Is this appropriate to do? What my plan is, is to ask these team members (if they are comfortable) if they would provide feedback on my performance for these projects to my manager. I feel comfortable telling these folks I am aiming to get a promotion this year and their feedback would help me do that. The promotion would not be in any direct conflict with their own advancement.

My husband received military orders overseas, so I finished my degree online but the only program offered through my school was Organizational Leadership.

The only jobs I’ve been able to hold are retail, one marketing job with a non-profit (the turn over was insanely high and was just a toxic workplace), and a customer service job.

It was my first job out of college. A few months ago I saw a posting at my dream org that seemed like it was lifted straight from my resume. This org is a renowned, international non profit. I applied, not thinking it would go anywhere, and fast forward a few months I made it through the whole process and accepted an offer.

Everyone in my life has been super supportive, but a few have had a mildly shocked reaction when I tell them the name of the organization. I even have one acquaintance (ex friend but she sucks) who acted very shocked when I told her, and I could tell she was thinking “how did you land a job there?”

Now I’m starting to ask myself how I did manage to land the offer? I was very honest on my resume and during the multiple interviews. I did a whole project for them to the best of my ability. However, my brain is still telling me I tricked them into hiring me.

I’m really excited about the position, but how do I get over this anxiety so I can focus on doing a good job? It’s starting to eat me up and I’m getting really anxious."

I have a professional license in the field of sales I was in throughout college. I left that sales role because I feel that the next step after a degree is to find a corporate 9-5 that requires a degree and offers benefits. Not being an independent contractor sales person and basically ""wasting"" my degree. 

I started my ""first"" post-grad corporate job shortly after graduating, after taxes I make \~$36k, 2 hour daily commute cannot afford to move closer. This role is teaching me nothing, I was basically lied to and am an office monkey. I've basically been disappointed and exhausted for a whole year, and the janitor who has been here the same amount of time as me is making more $ than me. I wouldn't mind as much if I actually felt like I was learning and progressing. I have tried to negotiate my salary and asked for raises and was denied, but am constantly showered with performance compliments. 

I didn't stop my job hunt since I graduated. I have still been consistently applying for jobs, going to career fairs, networking, interviewing, seeking professional resume revisions, optimizing my LinkedIn, etc. but have not turned up anything since.

I have been wanting to quit this job since June but I am now hearing with all the lay-offs and recession to NOT quit whatever job you're in. But I know my job is not opening doors for me and leaves me exhausted by the time I get home after 10-11 hours when you factor in commuting. 

I genuinely don't know what to do. I am dependent on my partner for housing, but am responsible for all my own expenses (car, food, etc.) I have a healthy savings thankfully. I've been working on a business idea for a while now and have a lot of support, but I feel dumb just dropping everything to pursue my business 100%. My partner and immediate family want me to quit because they believe my low pay might be associated with my demographics and see how depressed I've been. I don't want to ruin my career trajectory though and end up working food service after how hard I've worked. 

Do I quit my job and focus on my business idea while also continuing my active job search? Or would that be a dumb and reckless thing to do?"

I’m from a country in APAC and I was recently just placed on PIP due to sub par performance (though the reasons for this was out of my control). I was offered to take a mutual separation where I was offered about $2000 and 1 month garden leave to give me the opportunity to apply for other roles internally. 

Being a fool, I thought I’ll be able to work through the PIP and get out of it successfully and ended up confirming over email that I’ll not be going ahead with the separation plan and will participate in the PIP. Now, I ended up applying for a few internal and external roles post that and in just 3 days have 2 internal and 1 external interview lined up and I’ve even finished a couple of rounds of interviews in each of them. I’m fairly confident I’ll get another job with a good pay hike

Now I seriously regret not choosing the separation plan as I would have had $2k with me with the same outcomes. I also will now have PIP on my permanent employment records

My question is this: can I go back to the employee success consultant or my manager and tell them I want to withdraw from the PIP? And will it be too audacious of me to ask for the mutual separation offer again, even though I declined it last time? 

I need to take action on this by the end of the week because I seriously feel I will fail the PIP. Thanks in advance"

I'm a receptionist/administrative assistant and my primary roles include answering the phone/emails, ordering office supplies for the rest of the employees, and a few other things.  Nothing I'm asked to do takes a particularly long time, and I usually will have a list of a few things I need to get done during the week.  

The issue is, I don't have enough to do.  I'm just not very busy.  I work for a company that serves pretty much exclusively very wealthy clients.  So, we don't get a ton of phone calls anyway.  There are some weeks where I'm super busy with a million tasks but this is pretty uncommon.  I'm trying to grow in my career, however, and want to gain more knowledge and experience.  

I've tried asking the other administrative assistants if they need help with any projects or tasks, and sometimes they do, but not always.  I also regularly make up tasks for myself to do, such as organizing supplies, or fixing up and re-formatting incorrectly-done logs in Excel.  Still, I just don't always have something to do, no matter how much effort I put into trying to find something.

The girl who trained me did not do a very good job, either.  I know this because I was somewhat ""re-trained"" on some things by someone else.  It's just frustrating because I really want to take on more responsibility and it feels weird being the only one not swamped in work...or being on my phone throughout the day because I just can't find anything.  

My boss intimates me a little bit because he was rude to me a couple times when it really wasn't warranted.  I don't see him much and I sit alone at the front desk.  We don't have clients come through the doors very often.

So, my question is, what can I do to be more productive and busy?  I need help!"

But in not so short summary, I started this job 6+ years ago as a part-time assistant. Slowly, my tasks increased, but I didn't get a raise until over 2 years later. It was a substantial increase ($5) with the expectation of more work. No problem. I loved the atmosphere, and my direct boss/mentor was amazing. They were flexible with my kids' school and child care issues. Well, 2 years ago, my mentor had medical issues requiring extended leave, and I took on about 80% of her workload. Thanks to COVID, we learned she could work remotely quite well. I didn't ask for a raise but asked for the full time personnel benefits such as accrual of PTO and insurance. At the start of this change, I found out I was pregnant, I no longer have reliable child care and refuse to use daycare, so I had the intention of stepping down after having the baby and this aligned with my mentor being able to come back on full time. Unfortunately, her medical issues didn't improve, and I came back in at 2 weeks post partum. Still no raise was offered, but at this point, I felt I'd done enough for the company for me to have to ask for one. One very important detail is because it was unexpected for me to come back. They accommodated me bringing baby with me. Also, as there was a gap in us being able to come into the office due to my postpartum and her treatment, the company had hired a temp ""receptionist"" at my same rate as myself who'd been with the company for 5 years at that point. I was upset, to say the least, and asked for a raise, I got $3. After 9 months of me bringing my baby in, being part-time support for the office manager, and taking on about 90% of her workload while keeping my assistant tasks, my boss succumbed to her illness. It's been devastating as I can honestly say I know everything I do thanks to her and she'd become a great friend and had supported me through all the changes in life that had affected my life/work balance. I can NEVER replace her. She had a mad science to how she ran this ship. But due to this still being a business that had to continue operation, I continued my work. Her tasks were now mine. I didn't learn everything she did as she always told me she kept things close to heart for ""job security,"" but I stepped up. I continued doing her tasks and more needed along the way. It's going on 6 months, and I just feel that I'm worth more than what I'm getting. I practically took on her job and didn't get an increase or new job title. So I very nervously and messily (terrible anxiety with confrontation) brought it up to the boss, and he told me that to pay me more, he'd have more expectations for me. I'm at a loss for words. I don't know how to put a value into my job duties increase and compare it to how flexible they have been with my having a 1 year old and remaining part time. At the end of the day, I am completing my tasks even if my daughter is here with me needing feedings and naps. Am I wrong for expecting an increase in pay?"

Some of them have seen my linkedin profile and seen that I don't graduate until 2024, so they ask about whether or not I can even work full time. Well, I'm a part time student so my schedule is quite flexible. But I do not plan on being a part time student forever. The plan is to get this SDR role for a year (if I'm good enough to keep it for that long) and then go back to full time studies. But, I'm not sure if I should be honest about this or not

Not only that, but I have made it clear that I'm looking to become an SDR so that I can eventually become an account executive...but, I'm not sure I actually want to be an account executive in the future. I'm working on a copywriting portfolio and also taking a web development course and building a portfolio for that. My long-term plan is definitely going to be related to one of these career paths. The SDR role, as much as I hate to admit it, is largely money related (but also a good way to get into the sales world which could help with my copywriting journey). It's entry level and requires no experience. I've only been job searching for a month or so and have already gotten offers...it's not as easy to do that with copywriting or web development, those take a lot more time, so I'm using the SDR role as a filler. But again, I told the recruiters that I want to be an account executive in the future.

I feel bad about not being honest but I've talked to a few sales coaches who basically told me that emphasizing your interest in become an account executive is the easiest way to land this role, and they were at least partially right, because I'm getting a lot of responses.

Hello - looking for some feedback from recruiters or others.

A few weeks ago a recruiter reached out to me seeing if I would be interested in a job they were filling. Again, I did not apply but obviously wanted to know more and go through the process, couldn't hurt right? So seemed fine from their phone interview, but doing my first meeting with the company outside of call with the recruiter, I didn't really care for it to much. Just was not a great interview, the director felt a little spacey and just seemed unorganized (was also 30 minutes late to the call). Just some small red flags and some larger ones that it might not be what I am looking for regarding the actual job. The recruiter reached out to set up a third call, and I could obviously do it, but I do not want to waste anyone's time. Basically looking for a good way to respond without this cutting me off from this recruiter for future jobs, or I don't know if there is some secret recruiter blacklist that I would be on. I don't know, I know this sounds really silly, but I want to be honest that this might not be the best fit, but not work against me in future. Feel free to tell me I'm overthinking it, but curious how others approach this."

She did mention though in my initial interview though that I could apply  as a health educator once the position is posted if I’m interested. 

They recently put out an ad to hire a health educator, but the hourly wage is about $1.50 less than my current wage. The director of health education who would be my boss said I should apply and that she would love to have me on the team. I feel good about my chances of being offered the position. 

My hesitation is that it wouldn’t feel right for me to take a position with more responsibility and less pay. On the other hand, this position would guarantee me a full-time and long-term role that is not based on grant funding and could be a good start to my career.

During COVID I started a Master's Degree in Education at WGU and will finish in July. However, I have been working remotely with some location flexibility off and on for the past 2 years. I have decided I prefer the freedom of working remotely rather than working in a classroom. I'd like to work remotely, with a preference for location independence and changing locations every few months. I know this is hard with W2 jobs and would be willing to work contract jobs and/or start my own business to meet my goal.

I am thinking about EdTech, but know there are more possibilities in Tech for remote work compared to other fields. I'd be willing and happy to study more after I finish this degree in July if it will help me meet this goal. What tech roles are best for location independent remote? IT, Data Analyst, Security, Project Manager?

I have:

BA in Psychology (with a research and data background.)

10 years in retail banking.

Higher than average computer experience.

MS Educational Studies (graduate July 2023)

I've been dabbling in the Google IT and Data Analyst certs... I have good interpersonal skills do I could see Project Management as well.

Starting goal is 45-50k and I would like to double that for 100k+ within 5 years or so.

Thanks for any ideas and input you have!

So abit of background, I'm 20F and have worked in entry level position in finance for just under a year now. I have started my ICAEW level 4 qualification, it's alot but I'll get there. I'm just wondering what paths I have after that. Currently all I'm told is to then do chartership and then just work, and I'm not sure I want to just work in an office and report what the business is doing.

I'm ok with office work it's more I want to feel involved with something. I thought maybe personal finance or forensic accounting? Those seem to from what I know be more interesting. 

I'm just hoping someone will be able to offer some advice, on what qualifications and experience I should get for a career in personal finance or forensic accounting. Or any advice on other parts of finance."

The dream job is actually boardgame and TTRPG development, but as a creative feild I realize thats hard to break into so i need to do something to bring in money in the mean time.

I do very much care about safety and compliance, rarely do I get as worked up as when i read stories about completly preventable accidents happening due to company oversite. So as I am waiting for my big break in tabletop, I figured I'd transiton to Compliance Auditing. I don't know where to start though. My main questions are as follows:

\- Will my 3+ years in validation carry any weight when applying to auditing jobs?

\- If my degree is a bachelor's in biomedical engineering, will I need further education or certification before i begin applying to jobs seriously.

\- If i hated validation because it felt like i was doing endless pedantic paperwork for the benifit for noone, will I even like Compliance Auditing?

Any and all advice on this topic will be greatly appreciated! I can answer any follow up questions as well."

Problem is I am very overqualified for my current role and because of this and my personality they absolutely loved me. However when I put in my notice my boss got very angry and has made her emotions about it very clear. When I put in my notice she told me not to talk to anyone about it and that she will tell people however ever since I put in my notice everytime I walk into a room she is talking bad about me. What I am most worried about is that she could be saying anything out of spite about it and I don't think it's fair I do not get the opportunity to explain why I am leaving as the new opportunity is the right thing to do and I know my co-workers will be upset I am leaving but I want to explain I am doing so for a good opportunity and no other reason.

Edit: she had said that the reason I am not to talk to anyone about resigning is because someone else recently resigned and doesn't want the company to look bad
What should I do about my boss talking bad about me?
How can I make this situation better?

Edit 2: this morning I walked in to old food left and smeared on my work station, I told my boss and she said she doesn't care and there's nothing she can do about it because she doesn't know who closed last night (the roster says it was one of the ladies she was talking bad about me to) and she has more important things"

In all honesty, I hated this job but not at the beginning. It’s when my managers expectations started becoming unrealistic then I started losing motivation.

She was micromanaging my work for 7 months now but she also does this for the other new people too. I honestly do make mistakes and I have repeated similar mistakes but when she points them out, it’s detrimental. I was starting to question everything I did. 

We’d have calls and basically she’d just express her discontent with my work and it was hard to hear but I promised to be better then she would question my statement saying I’ve said that before but do I really mean it. After having 40 minute calls of criticism, she’d send up follow up emails outlining our call which would be like 3-5 paragraphs long. She’s done this at least 5 times now.

This was my first job and I wasn’t passionate about my work mostly do to the simplicity of the work but also because my manager made me feel incompetent in everything I do it started affecting me outside of school. I’m not a victim but I feel like she’s not going to say anything good about me if future employers attempt to call her.

My last day is in a few days and she has cut me off the day I have my letter of resignation like she literally has moved me to other employees who have worked her long to review my work until I leave.

TDLR - didn’t enjoy my first job mostly due to boss and simplicity of work, feel like she will speak poorly of me for future employers"

My dad spent most of career in “for profit” education. He worked at a couple colleges/technical/success schools as an admin. 

Some of you may know, a lot of these success or tech schools are no more and some have completely closed their doors. He was more behind the scenes as an admin and dean of admissions at one point but still laid off.

He was let go from his last education job about 2-3 years ago. He took a job with Amazon as a delivery driver and has been doing that for about 2 years, 5-6 days a week. Slowly but surely, it’s killing him. He’s constantly beat up and I just don’t think he can do it much longer at 53. 

He’s been searching high and low. Has had few first interviews and second interviews with a couple seeming very promising. However, he was not given any of the positions he was under consideration for. He’s lost a lot of ambition and he knows he’s viewed as an old dog. I want to help him because it kills me too. He’s making half of what he was at one point and he seems depressed.

Anyone know of some areas to look at for him? He’s 53 with an Econ degree and a masters as well. I know his age isn’t ideal, but I really want him to stop doing physical labor as a 9-5. 

I appreciate any guidance or advice"

I recently moved to Vancouver from Hong Kong with a work permit and I’m currently an employee at a Hong Kong company in Vancouver. Though, I’ve been having some thoughts on my career. 



*Current situation*

I’m currently working at a Hong Kong company in Vancouver where I don’t get to speak English or learn about the cultures. I decided to leave Hong Kong for Vancouver because I like North American cultures, but now, I feel like I have never left Hong Kong. 



*Some background*

• I worked in two industries before:
1) A junior graphic designer at multinational firms where I was able to work with people from different countries.
2) A local high school teacher at a slightly international environment as some of my colleagues are from different countries like India, Pakistan, France, the UK, etc.

• My English was considered okay when I was in Hong Kong but it could be seen as pretty bad in English speaking countries.

• Been planning to get a design job in Vancouver but unfortunately I couldn’t get any as my skill sets are not up to date anymore.

• I’m reaching 30 soon.



*Plans*

I’m thinking about getting a job at a local cafe/restaurant so that I can engage in the community more. I’ll also have more mental spaces to focus on my career change (I’ll take online courses after work to equip myself). Though, the salary will be lower and I’m not sure if I’ll be able to get into my targeted industries afterwards. 

Any thoughts or any similar experience?

Thank you all in advance."

Sorry if this is frequently asked, but I really need some advice on what to do next. 

I've been unemployed due to personal circumstances for a few months now (breakup / relocation) and am now looking to get back into work. I've been living off my savings and unemployment benefits for a while and could live off them for a while longer, but I'd just rather be in work soon for sanity's sake and to top my savings back up. I pretty much applied for jobs en masse last week, some I really wanted, others I thought I was qualified for but wouldn't want to stay there. 

I have three interviews (currently) coming up. Two of them I'm not really interested in; I applied for just to get some income coming in whilst looking for something I'm actually interested in. The other one is something I'm REALLY interested in and could see myself staying there for a very long time. 

Job 1 I'm interviewing for tomorrow. Employee reviews aren't great and the pay isn't great, but it's nearby and would be perfect to ""keep me going"" until I get a job I really want. 

Job 2 I'm interviewing for on Monday. It's a similar job to job 1 with much better pay and benefits but further away and has worse hours (weekend working, late shifts). Has slightly better employee reviews than Job 1 but not fantastic. The start date would be mid February. 

Job 3 I'm interviewing for two weeks from now. It by far has the best pay, is with a company with fantastic reviews, and it's a career I'd be extremely happy and fulfilled in. Also has a really short commute. However, I think I have less of a chance of being offered this role. 

Basically, I want to wait until I've had the interview for Job 3 before making a decision in case I hypothetically get offered 1 &amp; 2.

Do I mention that I have other interviews coming up in the next couple weeks that I'd like to wait for before deciding? I don't necessarily want to screw over Jobs 1 &amp; 2 by accepting a role and then instantly walking out on them, but equally I don't want to miss out on potentially a really good opportunity. I also don't want to burn bridges with 1 &amp; 2 in case I don't get 3 and I don't get offered anymore interviews.

What should I do? Jobs 1 &amp; 2 have indicated they would likely give me an offer on the spot. I think they have a high staff turnover and probably wouldn't consider waiting even if I was a fantastic match for them. I just really want job 3."

I studied electrical engineering in college, but accidentally (but fortunately) stumbled into software. As it turns out, I love data engineering.

About a month ago, I became a little disillusioned with where I was, and I interviewed at a few other companies for a data engineering spot. I didn't get those roles, but I had also applied as a technical sales engineer for one of the largest electronics company in the world because I was referred to by a former classmate of mine. It's not data engineering, but the job appealed to me because it was in a stable industry, would require a lot of travel, and I would get to focus on the business side as much as the engineering side. It was definitely a breath of fresh air, considering I have been working remotely for the past 3 years and got massive cabin fever.

I managed to breeze through all of the interviews and was offered a technical sales engineering role. I was initially going to use it as leverage against my current job for a salary increase, but I was offered a lot more than what I expected, and there was no way my current company would match. The base pay, performance bonus, and annual bonus are very nice and the benefits are also very nice. In short, the just the base pay would be 50% more than what I currently make and the TC is 3 times what I make now. I have spoken to a few people I know that work in that role, and they even reassured me that it's pretty easy to hit your TC mark, and they enjoy the company as well. That being said, I accepted the role, it was too good to pass up.

I don't plan on being an engineer for longer than a few years, I would like to get an MBA and go into management for a tech company by the time I'm in my early 30's. That being said, before that, if it turns out I don't like the new job, could I transition back into software as a SWE or DE if I can show I'm still competent at it? Would having cross industry experience and experience in technical sales and business help?"

It has only been me and one other person for the last 9 months I have been here. I took this job because I was in need of an office type position for the experience and hours.

I have done a lot of good work here, sort of changed the way that they do business because they were VERY old school. Got a SaaS for us, fixed all the data, proper backups, and managed a team of a few service workers. 

My plan for a while now was to try and get an internship in the summer because this company does not allow me to move up whatsoever, I am essentially at the highest position I can be at. The person I have been working with for the last 9 months dropped the news on us 2 weeks ago that he is leaving. All of his duties have been relinquished to me so essentially I have to do it all.

Out of nowhere, an old acquaintance referred me to a job opening at a branch in her company. I applied and have an initial interview call on Friday, this obviously means nothing as it stands. If I were to get this job offer I feel as if I would have to accept it, it's an IT position which is what I have been pursuing, it's a much larger company with room for advancement, and I have to imagine it's going to be more pay. 

I am only 23 years old so I am brand new in my career field and I feel like I have to do what's best for me. The only thing is, my boss has no idea how to run the business at all. He would essentially be screwed without me here since he is relying on me to take over everything. I got very close with my old coworker and he essentially got trapped here in a similar situation. Obviously it would be the right move if I were to get an offer, I am just worried about the aftermath. I don't see a possible way in which he could run this company.

Do I stay for the time being to help the company, or go pursue something that could benefit my career?"

I’m a recent grad as of May 2022 with my bachelors degree in Human Services. I was supposed to start a Social Work grad program this year but life pushed me into a gap year that I did not want to take. 

That gap year ended up being a blessing in disguise because I’m realizing I may not want to go in the direction of Social Work. I was able to land a job pretty quickly right after graduation. I currently help the homeless population locate housing. This job has helped me realize that I do not want to work with individuals one on one. I believe I’m somewhat too empathetic to work with such vulnerable populations. You really can’t help everyone. That being said , I am able to easily integrate with teams at work and work one on one with coworkers.

On the upside the job has helped me realize that I do enjoy the administrative side of it all; the forms, the email communication, the organizing, etc. I am deeply interested in law, public policy, administration, etc. I could even see myself assisting for a campaign or lobbying. 

If you couldn’t tell, im still trying to figure out what I can see myself doing for the rest of my life ,,, and with no experience , I don’t know where to start! (24 yr old here) 

If anyone could give me advice on a masters degree that is related to the areas of interests that I had mentioned earlier I would be greatly appreciative. Also looking for a degree that would give me a decent range of careers to venture into as well as a decent salary outlook (70k to start)."

I interned there over the summer and love the work. Long term, I hope to work in Corporate Finance, M&amp;A or capital markets, and was only really interested in going to law school with the intention of going into biglaw in one of those domains. I went to a severe non-target for investment banking and did not major in either finance, business or accounting, so my odds of breaking into ib are/ have been nil. I haven't received anything from any of the other schools I've applied to just yet (Emory, Notre Dame, USC, Vandy, UMich, WashU, Duke &amp; Berkeley). I came into College wanting to go to law school and continue down an academic route. But now, 3 years later, I'm not quite so sure anymore.

 If anyone has any advice, as well as how common/big a deal the full ride is, it would really help. Also, if anyone could speak to how good/bad an idea it would be to try to get an MBA from an M12/M20 program after a few years of working as a lawyer or lateraling into ib...

1,2023-01-18,Should I switch companies?,u/gori97,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10fkme3/should_i_switch_companies/,careerguidance,"I joined my company as an associate around 8 months ago as a management consultant in data and analytics from the one of the Big 4, where I was a Senior Consultant.  The reason I joined is because the firm is reputable, they have great bonuses (depending on chargeability) and they were building a new business unit in the data and intelligence division. All of this seemed like a good opportunity to contribute into something new and fresh, with a load of variety of work and not just Financial Services (like I was at the Big4) with a specific focus on data.

The first project I was given was an absolute shit show, I joined in the middle of the project with poor management and little guidance. Even though the project itself was bad, my feedback was positive, receiving good comments from Managing Directors and Directors for the work and results I had achieved.

My next project, was just support. I built dashboards for another business team and that was it. I kept asking for more work and responsibility or how else I could support the team once I was finished with analyses. I asked constantly, but the response was 'there is no more data to analyze'. Eventually I got rolled off, but got decent feedback from it.

Post this I got put on nearly 3 months of Financial Model Review. THIS IS THE MOST BORING THING I HAVE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE. It has nothing to do with Data and Intelligence and requires very few brain cells to do. Essentially I would sieve through excel formulas, looking for errors, every single day. I started doing a good job and they kept on giving me more and more of this shit work. Worst of all, this was free work, so it would not impact my bonus or my utilization. I would keep looking for other pieces of work but my boss would get upset if I ever brought up that I wanted to do something other than this. Towards the end I gave up and did not review them properly and eventually I got called out.

I had a 1-1 with my MD recently where he pointed all the things I had done wrong during my time here. I was always proactive, looking for pieces of work where I could charge to. After 8 months into the company, I feel like I have been misled into the type of work that I would be doing. My reputation has taken a hit because of the model review work and I feel like crap. My reputation at my previous firm was really good, to an extent that they gave me a blank cheque to stay when I told them I was leaving. 

My question is to whether stay at the company until the end of this year or jump ship back to my old employer which pays less? Is it worth staying where I am now until the end of the year so that it does not look bad on my CV? FYI. My bonus is payed in December"

I have about 3 years work experience in customer service. I love my studies and fell upon HR as I learned about the IO psychology track. I thought I wanted to do the organizational psychology master's program at my university especially because I am able to do it within 1 year. This means that I would have a MA by Spring of 2024. I am very interested in having a corporate career in recruiting/talent acquisition. My dream would be to work for an international company.

HOWEVER... I am not sure I want to continue waiting this long to start my career. I have been struggling to get internships partly because of my rigorous school schedule (18 credit hours per semester) and the low pay... I am working as a waitress right now and make pretty good money in comparison to the minimal payout for interns... I am also in a research lab for workplace competencies at the university.

Is it worth it for me to get the MA in psychology (organizational track) or should I stop at the BS in psychology and start working? Will having the MA serve me further benefits as I start my HR career journey? I know having work experience in the field is crucial, but for whatever reason, the pickings are very slim in the area I am currently located... especially for part-time work.

I am married and both my husband and I dislike living where we are right now and are only staying here for me to finish school. He is struggling to find decent work where we are due to a language barrier. Us moving elsewhere will be very beneficial for us both longterm and this is our plan once I finish my studies."

I did everything from engineering, prototyping, patenting, safety testing, finding and working with a design firm to help with the industrial design and design for manufacturing, building a Shopify site, marketing, advertising, and launching it at the national restaurant association show in 2018 with first units shipping in early 2019.

In 2019 I license the patent, design, and use of tools to one of the largest manufacturers of restaurant highchairs in the US.

I took a brief break and was applying and started interviewing for some jobs when COVID hit. During Covid, I decided to renovate a dilapidated duplex I owned and then sold it back in September. 

The past couple of months are the first time I’ve been really job searching in the past few years and I’m struggling. I’ve been looking for roles in new product development and non-tech product management roles, but no bites. 

More senior roles tend to want more broad experience (i.e., multiple product launches). I’m open to entry level roles, as working for an organization outside of restaurants is a bit of a career shift, but finding it tough to know what I am qualified for and how I should brand myself.

QUESTIONS I BELIEVE THIS COMMUNITY CAN HELP WITH:

\- What is an easy remote job that will allow me to pay for living expenses for the next year while I continue to search for an optimal career?

\- Based on the information below, which career do you think I should try next?

**WHAT I'VE ALREADY TRIED:**

\- I have a Bachelor's in Accounting and a Master's in Information Systems from Texas A&amp;M. I did a co-op internship and worked for Big 4 in public accounting for a little more than a year before I couldn't take it anymore, and quit. Accounting and business in general have left a bad taste in my mouth; what I know most is that I don't want to return there. **(NOT ACCOUNTING/BUSINESS)**

\- I've shadowed many nurses, physicians, and other medical practitioners to determine if I wanted to start the long journey to med/PA school and found that the work-life balance is horrible. Obviously, the amount of money, time and resilience required to do this is massive. **(NOT MEDICAL PRACTICE)**

\- I tried substitute teaching, private tutoring and private lesson teaching (trumpet) and I've found I don't have patience for people who don't want to learn, which supposedly is the most important trait a teacher needs. **(NOT EDUCATION)**

\- I started taking classes for mental health counseling at a local community college, and found that I was not going to learn anything that would be worth the 3 years and obscene cost of an additional graduate degree. It seems that a licensed therapist's skills are based in their talent and personality rather than their educations. **(NOT COUNSELING/THERAPY)**

\- Most recently I have been doing my best to study Python for the purpose of breaking into data science and data analytics, both of which I learned at a rudimentary level for my master's program. With a couple more months of intensive self-study I can probably land an entry-level job, but there is nothing I particularly like about the field.

**WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR:**

\- Something that **doesn't require years of continuing education**. Ideally, I'd like a job where the only barrier to entry is skill. Examples I'm considering are freelance writing, editing, or project management.

\- Something **challenging.** I will become bored if a job is easy or repetitive.

\- **Good work/life balance**. I won't let my career consume my life. Going over 50 hr./week is going to burn me out quickly. The busy season in public accounting is most of the reason I was inspired to quit.

**FACTS ABOUT ME:**

\- On the Big 5 Aspects scale of personality traits, I scored 97th percentile in Openness to Experience.

\- I'm intellectual, and enjoy discussing ideas such as philosophy, religion, politics, and self improvement.

\- I have several chronic autoimmune diseases.

\- I'm very analytical, and enjoy operationalizing. Bullet journaling is my favorite hobby; I love writing.

\- I'm bold, straightforward, and honest."

Should I go back to my old job?,u/smallbrowngorl,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10foewu/miserable_at_my_new_job_after_2_weeks_should_i_go/,careerguidance,"Two weeks ago I started a new job in what I thought was my dream position. It's the same work as my old job, which I loved, but with a significant pay raise and benefits. While it's the same work, this new job also has opportunity for more professional growth. Fast forward to today and I'm totally miserable. I dread work everyday and have woken up crying since I started. They're loading me with huge projects while I'm still being onboarded and I feel like I was thrown in the deep end. I tried to communicate how I was feeling with my manager, but she told me that we could not slow down because they need these projects done to hit their Q1 goals. It feels unfair because I just got here and I've had no time to ease into the position.

I've recently been thinking about going back to my old job. I left on really good terms with my boss and we still chat about random things. I talked to one of my old coworkers who said that if I wanted to go back, she knows they would welcome me back. I absolutely loved this job and I felt so happy everyday. The only downside was the pay wasn't too great and there were no insurance benefits. However, this new job has turned me into a gloomy person and it's even starting to taint my relationship with others because of how burnt out I am. I can't help but feel like I traded my happiness for a nicer paycheck.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice on how to go about this?"
1,2023-01-18,Follow passion or location and stability?,u/rcplaneguy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10foh52/follow_passion_or_location_and_stability/,careerguidance,"For context I am 25, in a relationship with no kids, I just got let go at my current job in the aviation field at Amazon. I have 60 days to find something internally or take severance. I have interviews lined up both within Amazon at the traditional Fulfillment center environment as a higher up manager, as well as some at up and coming aviation companies. 

“Big” Amazon jobs offer a lot of stability, can get promoted fast, relatively easy compared to my previous role, and offer many locations where I can transfer and get to my dream location. Downside being a boring job.

The aviation side is a little riskier and new, with about the same pay as the Amazon job. Downside being not as flexible location wise and not as stable but it is my expertise and passion career wise.

In my shoes, which would you choose? Short term Amazon as a means of pay and stability is my first choice, as I would rather take advantage of the easy transfer while I’m still inside as opposed to the tougher external interview if I came back."

I make 60k now, the new job is minimum base 90k-110k plus commission potential. I’m about to have a first baby (late March early April) and at my current role I will have flexibility during that time to work as needed, take time as needed to be with my wife throughout the day. If I leave my current role before then, I’m not sure what this new company will be able to do for me in terms of time off/leave as a fresh employee (understandable). I have not asked them about this yet although i have brought up that I’m expecting soon. I’m finding it very hard to pass on the potential to double my income, but really value the flexibility while my wife gives birth. Also should note my current employer is not doing great, laid some people off, not much room for growth. Any experience with this, any parents that have advice would be greatly appreciated."

I’m fresh out of college with 80k in student debt. My car is also aging fast so I will likely need to put a lot more maintenance into it soon or even get a new one within the near future. I recently picked up a full time job at sea world for $15/hour but because it’s the off season, my hours are about 26-30 a week so I’m only making $100 above my rent before taxes and such are taken out a month. 

I recently interviewed and have a good chance on getting a salaried position at the school I attended which would be great as it’s directly connected to the field I went to school for.

Because of my loans and the cost of living in the area I’m in i’m likely going to need to work at least 1 full time and 1 part time job. The thing is, I enjoy what I do at sea world. If I get the position at the university, I want to try to make it work so I can still work at sea world. 

Has anyone here ever worked 2 full time jobs and would recommend it/have advice for me? Or if I get the position at the school should I give up sea world and find a less commitment part time job."

I've spent years asking almost everyone I know for suggestions as to what I should go into and no one is able to give me any suggestions. I have a bachelors in international relations but I can't find anything in my area that pertains to that. I have a job currently that is okay for the short term but I don't want to do it longer than I have to. The kind of job I'd like to have would have these features:

1. Not a 9 to 5. I find working every weekday for most of the day incredibly depressing. I'd much rather do 12 hour shifts a couple days out of the week and spend the rest of the time making art and pursuing skills.

2. Meaningful. I'd really like to do something that helps people and makes their lives better, not make someone else richer. I've been told I am a compassionate person who is good at communicating and I feel like I would be good at helping others.

3. Active. I hate the idea of being in a building all day. I'd like to be out in the world where I can see the sun. 4. Exciting. This is vain, I know, but I'd like to feel like what I'm doing is cool or badass. It might be childish but I feel like I'll regret it when I'm older if I don't try and find something that feels that way.

I'm not trying to make 6 figures nor do I care about having fancy things. I simply want to live a life I'm happy with while not struggling financially. I'd like the possibility of making around 55k eventually, as that is just above the living wage for my area. I am willing and able to go back to school if I have to.

Fintech. Service Delivery / Incident Management for 3 years, now Junior Product manager for 8 months. Between 1-2 months ago another PM quit, I’ve taken on their work in an area I had no experience in. A very visible area. My manager tried to break up the role into segments but, in reality it’s all on me. It hasn’t been long since that person quit, but it’s unsustainable to do their job plus what I was doing. 

I am in the position I’m in now because I’ve only excelled at the company. Constant praise, constant positive feedback outside my team, and I’ve poured my heart into it. I feel like that’s been known.

Review time is now, raises are decided in the next couple weeks. Unsure if we’re replacing the spot I’m filling in for, and for months I feel like I’ve been doing more than what a “Junior” should be doing.

I want to ask for the title of Product Manager and a 15% raise. It would be seen as a rather quick promotion, I get it, but I’m hesitant to bite my tongue and play things out for another entire year.

Knowing the time frames I laid out, am I jumping the gun?

I’m leaning towards going for it. Laying out the myriad of things I’ve done, and asking for what I want, and if I get shot down I get shot down. Worst case my boss says no, I can ask for a time frame on getting to where I want to be. 

If you’re a manager I’d love to know your 2 cents, or if you’re someone who’s been in a similar position, I’d love to know your thoughts, or just general feedback on this situation. Thanks!"

The reason I like sonography is it seems like a relatively routine career and you have more of a variety about where you want to work.

Based on what I have said, can anyone give me any advice on what career I should pursue?

Sending emails and other communications are an important part of the job. 

I was a lawyer in my earlier life and write fairly good formal communications. However, whenever I send out a draft to my team, my manager makes so many unnecessary edits that I'm starting to get annoyed. I'm starting to feel resentful about this and have stopped copying her on some of my projects/ asking for her input on them. I've never had to deal with this before. 

I know the problem is not with my writing being terrible because other colleagues (including very senior lawyers whom we work closely with) are happy to approve my work with minimal edits where she hasn't stepped in to completely butcher my drafts before their review. 

I could, and have pushed back on edits by rejecting changes. However, this gets tiring because I then feel a need to justify or leave comments and it takes away time from other matters I have to attend to. 

Any guidance on how to nicely tell her to stop making unnecessary edits to my drafts / resolve this issue will be appreciated."

I accepted a somewhat low ball offer because I was desperate to work. I have enjoyed my time at the company, but brought up the option of working remote after I learned my SO got a PhD offer two states away, with a one hour time difference. 

I have had a very positive experience, received a raise 6 months in and am up for another at the 1 year mark. My boss has been supportive, given much praise, and gave a great performance review. I was given our largest client and interesting projects. The culture is fun with a “working at 80% capacity” mantra, meaning we want to get things done, but are encouraged to take breaks and our time with tasks. 

HR has begrudgingly stamped off on me moving to remote work, but have been clear they are skeptical of remote work.

I really do enjoy this work format, and would like to earn and work more, but banks don't open on Sundays. My boss has floated the ide of moving up, and this has piqued my interest and re-ignited some of the passion I had in school for academics.

However, something in me despises a full 8 hour shift. I truly would work 7 days a week if it meant I could have a ""full time"" job that didn't require any regular full working days.

Hi Guys

South African here were job hunting is really tough.

I applied for a position at a Dutch company that has operations in SA. They asked me to do an HRM FORCE Ability scan that covers the following: numerical, verbal, and spatial insight

The numerical was super tough, and I mentioned this to the recruiter as my results were not great.

He called me today saying that it is not just me who failed the test, but all the other candidates as well.

So the company asked one of their existing employees to do the test, and even he failed the test.

So he said he is busy looking for a similar test, and asked me to share an online assessment with him if I know of any.

Can anyone suggest an online assessment (Preferable one that is not too tough on the maths side)

That covers Numerical, Verbal, and Spatial insight?

For reference this is the one I did:HRM Force Ability Scan"
2,2023-01-19,I think I’m being gaslit by my boss?,u/supspace14,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10fthok/i_think_im_being_gaslit_by_my_boss/,careerguidance,"I say “think” because it’s actually more unbelievable and hard for me to believe. 

I started a job at two weeks ago that i was initially very excited to accept. i’ve been freelancing through the pandemic and I was super excited to be around people again. the fact that it was a small/local business and a small team was attractive for me because i work better in smaller groups. 

the first week we ran into an issue and my training was delayed. so i did some independent contract work for the company instead and it gave me a chance to work with everyone. all was well. then the next week, the first issue i ran into was in training. it wasn’t organized, i had to keep asking for more material and got stuck with a trouble shooting project on my third day. my boss was out all week working from home and my trainer also works from home exclusively but i got through the first week successfully, despite the lack of instruction and direction. 

this week, however, has been a disaster. monday went well. my boss validated a lot of my concerns and apologized for the lack of training direction. but in just two days, everything has exploded. what led up to the explosion doesn’t matter as much, but i can say it was because a project was assigned to me with the due date set at a week away. the problem is that it’s (at least) a two month long project, but probably longer with other work and training materials. on top of this, my boss and trainer were assigning additional things that were smaller, but were made much bigger by the project deadline. 

so my boss goes to leave today and asks how i’m doing. i confess that im overwhelmed. they respond by stating they figured i would be and that’s why they were going slow. i explained that i thought there would be a middle ground between having very little vs everything all at once. my boss then makes a comment about how they’ve barely given me any work and there’s no reason to be overwhelmed. im trying to explain the addition project i was assigned, but im having difficulty because at this point i’m anxious and my boss is getting angry. 

my boss is telling me over and over how i asked for more work, how the work im being given i do differently than they do (which is confusing because my boss said they hired me BECAUSE they wanted fresh material), etc. They accuse me of having an attitude and rolling my eyes, which I wasn’t but instead i was just having difficulty keeping eye contact. and so i explain this and they say back, “You don’t have anxiety! why would you have anxiety? im making you anxious?” and the situation just gets worse from there. im told that all i’ve done is complain by expressing my confusion, that i asked for this work and how now i can’t handle it, and all the whole im trying to explain that I actually didn’t ask for ALL of it but they’re determined to twist my words at this point. 

my boss then tells me i could have come in their office at any point today to address my concerns. i mention how it wasn’t my first reaction because just yesterday, they were saying how overwhelmed they were with taxes and i didn’t want to add to it. my boss says “you know that’s not what I meant.” At some point they bring up the fact that they’re late to dinner and how they wished i would’ve brought this up earlier. i remind them that they asked me how i was doing, was i supposed to lie? my boss says, “i think next time i would prefer you to. actually, i just won’t ask how you are and if you need to tell me then you can come tell me.” 

after my boss left slamming the door behind them, my coworker helped me find the misunderstanding and it was the project with the wrong due dates that my boss didn’t know i had. my coworker is going to talk to my boss to explain that someone didn’t do something right and that’s why i was so overwhelmed. but regardless, the way i was spoken to is unforgivable. there’s not a situation i can think of where that’s okay. i understand my boss may have a lot of stress, but we all do. and most of us don’t have or even want to take it out on others. i forgot to mention that this happened in front of two of my coworkers. 

the issue is i’m due into work tomorrow and I don’t even know that i want to put in a two weeks notice. i know that’s the right thing to do maybe? and i don’t want my coworkers to suffer. but i also feel like that’s my bosses problem and not mine. had my boss cared about the employees, this would have never happened. i think my boss is counting on me to be the bigger person and i don’t feel like i owe it. i have no idea what time my boss will be in tomorrow and im not that interested in working until they get there, just to quit. ANYWAY 

Im going in circles now. life goes on. if you’ve got advice, im buying. if you’d like to wallow with me a bit, then cheers"

I will have 5 hours of mandatory non-billable meetings along with 40 hours of billable work, but only get paid for 40 hours in this instance. Anyone else have a similar situation?

1,2023-01-19,What careers would be suitable for someone changing from education or teaching to a new field?,u/tvavariant,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10ftvuw/what_careers_would_be_suitable_for_someone/,careerguidance,"As I mentioned, I am looking to change careers, but I’m not totally sure which direction I should go or what job might be the best fit for me at this point, and I’m hoping others may have some suggestions or insights to consider.

First, here is a little background:

I am 37 and have been an elementary school counselor for the past 10 years. I actually like my job a lot, but I feel like I am stuck at the top of the ladder with no way to really advance my career. I have pretty much maxed out my salary with all of the extra certifications and things I could do to move up, plus I have also written a couple of professional books and presented trainings as well. Although that part about being an author sounds glamorous, it really has only brought in about $3-4k in sales and has slowed down. I also was teaching some adjunct courses at a local university, but now most courses require a PhD, so I’m not eligible to teach with just my master’s. So at this point I feel stuck and need to make a change if I want to bring in a higher income.

My wife is a stay at home mom and we have 4 kids. We live in a higher cost of living area and my annual salary of around $95k doesn’t feel like much with inflation and providing for a family of 6. I have decided that I would like to explore making a career change to find something that will allow me to be a better provider and also be something that matches my skills and interests.

I have a BA in Linguistics, an M.Ed. in school counseling, and I also recently earned a certificate in digital marketing science from a local university. I attempted to start a small web design and seo business on the side, but it has not been successful. I made a few Wix sites for some clients, but it seems really competitive to find clients. I actually really enjoy the work of designing sites, writing content, etc. Unfortunately, it just hasn’t worked out the way I had hoped.

I have decided that I do not want to pursue becoming a school administrator/principal, which seems to be one of the most likely ways to grow my career. I also don’t want to put time and money into a PhD to be an adjunct and I don’t want to be a full time professor either.

The main option I am considering is moving into a tech role, but I’m not sure what yet. While I think I could pick up coding, I am not that excited about it. I am interested in front-end development and UX/UI roles, but careers that focus primarily on coding sound a little daunting. 

I have an interest in data analysis and it is actually part of my job as a school counselor in small ways such as disaggregating school-wide data to look for patterns and trends, and then establishing goals based on that information to make a positive impact. Whenever we got to do problems in our digital marketing class that involved pulling apart data and setting goals I really enjoyed it. I am not super strong in math though, so I don’t know if I have what it takes to do data science/analysis roles.

Other than that, I enjoy working independently, but I also like being part of a team working towards common goals. I am a very creative and strategic thinker and enjoy things like playing chess, designing LEGO sets, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or writing stories. As a school counselor, some of my other skills include curriculum development, facilitating discussions/meetings, empathy and perspective taking, organization, project management, event planning, shaping a positive school culture, building relationships with stakeholders, presenting information/teaching, mediation, etc. In terms of a career, I also would like to find something that could enable me to work from home and earn $150k plus within a few years.

Are there any careers that might be a good fit for me and wouldn’t require a ton of training or education expenses? Something that I may be able attain through a bootcamp or even self-study? Thanks for your input!"

I've had seasonal work as a landscaper, temp jobs running youth sports programs, and I have some experience running/coordinating events.

The thing is - Ive enjoyed all these jobs, but could never pick which to settle down with.  I was thinking working in the parks and rec department would encompass aspects of all these past jobs ive had.

I have a bachelors in the social sciences, and I've been told City's like to hire people with degrees!

My question is - it seems park's and rec departments often have different divisions, generally into three categories 1) recreation 2) parks/parks maintenance 3) culture (art programs, events)

If I pursued a career in the parks and rec department, is it realistic I would get to dabble in all of these divisions or would I need to specialize?

This really has me feeling down since I put in a lot of hard work. 

I received my performance review for all of 2022 and I feel like I was rated lower (3/5 meeting expectations) than I should have been. I was at least expecting a 4/5, going above expectations. I changed teams about 4 months ago at the same workplace and my mid year review with my old manager was ranked really well and I even got promoted. I don’t at all expect another promotion in 6 months but I’m surprised how I was rated lower by my new manager for the entire year even after getting this promotion. There is another member on my team who is in the same job level as me who has been there for a year on the team and could it be that I’m being compared? Obviously joining a new team comes with a learning curve and I don’t have the domain knowledge yet for the new team. 

With that said, does anyone please have advice on how to politely come back to the conversation with my manager? How can I advocate for myself? I already asked for things I could have done different or things I could do to improve in the future, but I think my current manager could also not be accurately assessing my work with my previous manager. 

Seriously appreciate any advice since performance reviews are new to me."

I am currently working in an HR supporter role, 34 years old.

As part of my job I come into contact with all sorts of weird inquiries and my default action is to investigate the inquiry and take action accordingly.

I have taken several personality tests and every time 'researching' or 'curious' comes out as some of my top qualities/personality traits.

I **am** very curious - I want to know how things work, how people feel, why things happen, etc. 

Is there any way to leverage this into a successful career?

I was thinking something like:  
Coach  
Manager  
Scrum master  
Psychiatrist

As I am already a bit set in my ways (2 children, a mortgage and a full time job) it's a bit hard for me to pivot too hard, so I guess psychiatrist is perhaps off the table as this requires specific training...

But maybe you can think of something else?"

I have listed 2 of my professors down whom I did pretty well under, who agreed to give me good references. I’m now considering listing another co-worker who’s in a supervisory position (although not in a directly supervisory role to me but in an adjacent department). Me and my coworkers do have a good relationship. However I’m worried that the co-worker I’m planning to list will tell on me to my boss. 

First of all - as a recent graduate I’ve only had 5 months of working experience at a startup. The team is small and I’ve honestly had anxiety this whole time as my boss gets quite upset when people leave, especially good workers (a lot of them have left over the last few months). Although I have a good working relationship with him and he constantly recognises my achievements, he isn’t too happy with me leaving. And hasn’t been too happy with previous ex-colleagues either. 

I’m therefore shit scared about listing him down as a referee for fear that he would provide my new company with a lacklustre reference, out of spite that I’m leaving. 

I feel stuck and genuinely anxious and would appreciate any tips/advice to navigate this hellish situation."

I have a tough decision to make. I work with operational excellence/lean/business improvement on a business unit management group level today. The global company is about 8000 people and on a considerable growth journey. My business unit represents 600 people and the Scandinavian countries.

I am turning 35 this year, and have been working for this company for 4 years, got promoted a year ago. Have in total 12,5 years of work experience. I have a bachelor in engineering. 3 years in the university. Typically less educated than many others with this kind of senior position.

I have been looking for another job for a while and have been offered a position at a consultancy company. They started 2-3 years ago and have about 10 people and plan to grow to 50 in a few years. They share the same values as me, and we have the same view on what the companies of the world need to do for making an operational excellence transformation. And they have a unique scalable solution for this. I am very excited about this job and think I would have loads of fun with the team, being part of building the company into something great.

When I notified my organization about my offer (Monday this week), they asked me to come and talk to the VP of the EMEAA business unit. This was yesterday. They have offered me a position as responsible for Operational Excellence for that business unit. That would be leading this area in a business unit of 2000 people,  with 150-200 m€ in revenue. No direct reports. Need to work with influence to guide and lead, to make Operational Excellence a core thing in the company.

The promotion at the current company would mean doing more of what I already do but on a very senior level. Includes all the issues with trying to get people to do things, that they might not believe in, while they are pressed for the financial result at the end of the month. It will be a struggle. Same issues that I have currently, which are demotivating and have led me to look for another job.  It would be quite a lot of travel, which I think I am okay with.

At the consultancy company, I would travel as well, but I have the impression that I would have a better work/life balance. Fewer long travels with flights etc.

Salay wise (not very important, I earn ok already, and a lot of it is taken away by taxes anyway (50%))

The consultancy company offers a 9% increase from what I have today. With good benefits, an potential business area and team responsibility in the future.

The promotion offers an 18%-27% increase from today, with a bonus program of 0-40% (most likely only 20%  is achievable) of yearly salary. Good benefits etc. as well.

I think I like the consultancy firm more, but the promotion offer is huge and really hard to say no to.

I basically need to decide today. Maybe I can negotiate a few more days.

Thoughts from you?"

Now I’ve been told that I am not getting the yearly raise because I received a promotion last year. I was told they don’t believe in giving 2% raises so they want to wait until 1 year after the date of my promotion to give me a larger raise. 

Also worth mentioning: 
- I was grossly underpaid before last year’s promotion. I only received the promotion/raise after having to make more of a fuss than I care to about my pay band, industry average, etc. 

- I have a new hire direct report who makes $2/hr less than me, has a fraction of the responsibilities, and does subpar work. 

How should I proceed? Is the writing on the wall? Should I ask my manager if the writing is on the wall? I was caught off guard when I was told this and didn’t think to say I was specifically told this would not affect my yearly raise. I know the majority will say to polish the resume and leave but should I talk to my manager about this further and bring up what I was told with the promotion? 

TLDR: Last year, I was promoted/received raise, told it would not affect my yearly raise. Now I am told it is the reason I am not receiving yearly raise. What do?"

Well making this post for many different reasons.
But I currently feel stuck in my career,
I am 31 years old and I have about 10 years in experience in sheet metal. 

I am able to weld(Mig,Tig) and have operated CNC Laser, CNC Turret Press, Manual Mill and Press Brake operations, I also learned how to use SolidWorks. 
Currently my roll in the company that I am at. 

I do all the prototypes for press brake operation to get customers for the company, I also give tooling requirements and machine setups and a step by step bending process so there will be no errors. 
I make my fixture for the back gauges and make (design) custom tooling if I need to make a bending process a lot faster. 
(I also do the same for welding) 

I help the engineers by giving them information if the job is possible with machines that we have. 
How do I do that? 
Well my boss always said yes to a job but sometimes we needed to do a lot Mickey Mouse setups(dangerous) to be able to finish a job. So to prevent that I stepped up because things got out of hand and some of my coworkers got hurt. Now they tell me if it’s possible to do a certain job. 

I know this may sound confusing, but I find myself not wanting to go to work anymore, I use to feel a challenge and now not so much. There is a challenge but not the same one anymore and I want to keep learning/growing but I am not sure what to do with what I know. 
I talked to my manager and he told me that he wouldn’t want to move me from my position because I am to good in my current role to place me somewhere else. 

I never went to college but I did take some courses online for metallurgy and SolidWorks. 

I get payed well enough and the only thing I don’t like is that there is no benefits. 
I make 33hr. 


But right now I want to grow but not sure how to do that, any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!!"

If you can comment on specific roles/positions or firms that would be appreciated. I'm particularly interested in ""buyside"" asset management roles in specific industries but really open to hearing about any finance related role. My research leads me to believe that IB and PE have the worse work-life balance but pay the most annually (maybe not per hour). I'm trying to find a finance related job that allows for family/personal time yet still provides a high compensation (maybe not as high IB &amp; PE but close to it).

I’m working in the marketing department, I’m specifically responsible for digital marketing, but I’m starting to think I should start to look elsewhere. Here’s why.

1) One of my tasks is the help with setting up digital campaigns to e.g attract leads. But what often happens is that my feedback or concerns about how the people in charge of a project want to go about the campaign get dismissed or get the standard “We have to make speed, and we can optimize the landing page / visuals / goals /… later.” 

This frustrates me because after a while I don’t see the point anymore of me being present at meetings or in general giving my 2 cents if they don’t take it seriously or just do what they want and afterwards blame me if the goal(s) isn’t met. 

2) I have been trying to learn new skills and the company / my manager claims to want to help financially and support my development. Yet, after +1 year nothing has changed and it always gets delayed or pushed aside with vague excuses. 

What do you guys think? Am I too quick to judge or is it time to jump ship?"

I was there about 2 years and then moved onto a new role in career services at another school, this boss wasn’t any better. After 3 months of not feeling acquainted enough I walked out. This current role (also at another company), I don’t feel as hassled by my bosses for the most part(?) but question if I am being micromanaged too. For example, the team lead sends an email with students assigned, the task &amp; they expect some kind of acknowledgement from each of us within the hour, if they don’t hear back they’ll follow up. Plus she audits file consistently, I can leave a note on a student’s file &amp; maybe within 30 mins she’ll send a direct msg asking to submit for review/some other task or a correction/heads-up. I had a review with my boss recently &amp; for the most part it seemed good. She gave me satisfactory &amp; above satisfactory for the categories, my last role in AA there was a “needs improvement” in the mix.

differently, only i have no idea where to start. I never thought i'd get out of there so i honestly never thought on what and how to do.
 
 1. i don't understand what gcse really gives me and do i need anything else's to study further ?
2. what career would you recommend so i could live comfortably and give my future kids a good life and education and basically everything a kid
deserves?
I would say i can study anything as in i always had  good grades back home but then i just stopped going to school so i could work to help my mom which was a really dumb thing to do.

I'm just trying to reach out to fellow IT professionals. I recently completed my AAS in Information Technology with and emphasis on InfoSec. I am currently starting my BS in Cybersecurity. Currently I am an Information Technology tutor at a college but I had 2 other jobs until this past year. I absolutely had to take some things off of my plate.

I had a sober living home that I started with a very good friend d and family member and I worked as a substance abuse technician at a local rehab.

The tutoring job obviously doesn't yield much revenue but it's all about building a resume in my case. I did not have a solid work history until 2018 - present.  I was also an adict myself and now a recovering addict.

I applied for an IT position at the college I currently work for which is full time and roughly 34k annually. If I o tain that position, y goal is to use those funds to pay for my certifications. My cert plan as of this moment are
A+
Network +
Security +

If anyone who has a similar story or any suggestions at all as far as next steps, practices before finishing my BS etc. I would so very much appreciate it.

Right now I have two Next Level Security servers running on my home network. One is configured with pfsense, the other is running windows 10 due to hardware limitations but I plan to force that later. I have a CISCO network switch that connect that server and a mini gaming PC behind the pfsense firewall. 

Sometime this weekend I am going to deploy an access point behind the firewall as well, remove the GOU from the pfsense server and start setting up a lab on Internal custom network through VirtualBox. 

Ideas, suggestions, lab configuration etc all and anything is appreciated."

I originally have a degree in geography and somehow wound up at a healthcare software company in a consultant role. 

I don’t want to jump to a master’s just yet. I would prefer to build a new skill set and foundation with a new bachelor’s (since my employer will pay for it). 

I’m wondering if it’s better to pursue a STEM degree, or something STEM adjacent. I understand the pros of a STEM degree, but my advanced math skills are poor and I tend to be more of a visual and hands on learner, so theory is rough. On the flip side STEM adjacent degrees seem interesting, but I worry about being less competitive with a lack of programming knowledge, less job security, etc without strong tech skills and less earning potential. 

Some degrees I’ve been looking at are the following…

STEM: Computer Science, Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning &amp; Autonomous Systems

STEM-adjacent: Integrated Computer Science, Human Systems Engineering, Business Analytics, Technical Communication

So as the title says I got put in an IT Helpdesk position. I was first in Helpdesk from April 2019 to September of 2021 and I hated every single moment of it. Was so joyous to leave work each day. Right before September 2021 I got my A+, Network+, and Security+ certificates in hopes of getting another IT job that either pays more but also isn’t Helpdesk. 

I got a new job in a different town that pays more and it wasent Helpdesk. Basically it was a glorified FedEx position for IT. All I had to do was give out new computers, install software if it is needed for who the computers are going to, schedule a time to meet with client and get them to sign into it and if everything is working (the computers are either brand new or refurbished) that’s it. If they have a specific licensed software they need installed or have a question about something - tell them to call the Helpdesk. 

Basically it’s the best job ever invented if someone hates Helpdesk like I do but wants to work in IT. Sadly it was a temporary position and in December of 2022 I got sorts forced to get a raise and while getting a raise got put in a Helpdesk position.

Now I’m back to square one of hating my job so much that I’m happy to miss work for a relative dying. I went to a funeral yesterday for my Grandmother and was esthetic to be there just to miss work. 

My question is how does one get a new job in IT that isn’t end user support or Helpdesk? It makes me hate waking up during the week, hate my life until the minute I get off, and just makes me want to enlist or something I shouldn’t even be thinking about. 

I have a bachelors in IT and almost 4 full years of IT experience.  The only thing I could think of is get more certs so right now I’m studying for Server+ because I think a system administrator job would be something I’d like other than anything that is a non-Helpdesk position. 

But I don’t know if getting that helps. Any sysadmin job I apply for always says no or doesn’t respond. 

Does anyone have tips? 

My job is unbearable to me. When someone asks how’s your day or how are you I go 
“I’m alive and I have a job” 
Anything else I’m fabricating to look not as negative so I don’t get fired lol."

I'm job hunting within one of the states that requires pay transparency, and I've noticed that a lot of companies still fail to provide the salary ranges for available positions.

How is the best way to phrase ""You need to tell me or else you'll be violating the new pay transparency laws"" while still maintaining an open and excited manner? 

I very much do not want to appear as overtly aggressive or one to cause trouble. I also understand that the initial response is to say ""You probably wouldn't want to work for a company like that anyway,"" but it occurs so frequently because it's such an old tactic and I don't people really think about it. Automatically rejecting these kinds of opportunities is not really an option. I need a way to address this issue directly because I think it's a great way to set boundaries right off the bat, and because I don't want to miss out on a great position due to some guy trying to hardball me."

My new job offers are 20k and 35k salary bumps. The 20k bump is a horizontal move with a lot of growth potential. The 35k bump is a vertical move with unclear growth but I will learn new skills that will be difficult but put me in a new class of workers (learning a new programming language R vs now I only know SAS).

He thinks this worked because of the fake resume but he concurs with me that it could be coincidence too.

I don't plan to downgrade this year but I would love to find a job that is just enough to pay the bills so I can stop and smell the roses a bit more. 2 days off is just not enough time off.

The closest thing I can get to do is the IT jobs which seem reasonable, but I've been wanting to cut it out unless there's other opportunities, since they're going through the same thing as the tech industry.  

So far one option has been the military, government contractors/full-time, and GS jobs. I can easily get them thanks to my US Citizenship, and with stable income, low chances of layoffs, and decent benefits - I can coast on this one. 

Another option is the trade business - Machinists, Electricians, and Operators are some of my options as well. Benefits for these is that training is free, I can get an associate degree for relatively low cost in whatever degree/certifications I go for, and relatively good pay and questionable benefits.

Another option I've been also considering is going into business - however I need to figure out how I can start one, get funding from VCs, and secure a place as well as build something that can actually be profitable. I'm thinking of an all remote workplace, but I don't know how that's gonna work out with VCs and also needing a physical office later on.

Another option I can do is try one of the engineering discipline - chemistry, nuclear, biology, medical, etc. Problem is that even though I've been taking engineering-centric classes, I worry that a CS degree would probably not be held up to that standard pedigree that has already been there.

Final option is to say screw it and go all in to my current part time job and try to work full time from now on. Reason being is that they offers generous raises - roughly $14/hours to $18/hours now and $2/hours raise per year depending on contract. I already know most of my coworkers and I've been pretty comfy on that gig as well. Some people look down on it, but I see it as a win since I just do what I do and I'm good.

So out of these options and also willing to head more as well, which one sound the best ? 

TLDR; IT-specific job, Military, Trades, starting my own business and hustle it until it is profitable, Engineering, or stay part time to convert to full time and make enough to live off in my cheap area?"

Hope everyone is safe and avoiding the cold cause its rough out here nowadays. I'm currently having a mid life crisis right now because I'm so lost on what to do with my life. I'm a single child with no family relatives whom I am close to + immigrant parents who don't know anything except provide a living. I honestly wish I had an older sibling or someone I can consider a mentor to help guide me because my entire life, it's only been me, myself, and I who had to do things for everyone, especially my parents. I'm so excited and desperate to leave the nest and have my parents stop relying on me, so I'm determined to get a job immediately once I graduate and move out with my partner. I'm exhausted with the constant changes of choices I have.

I was previously a nursing major, but I quit nursing school because of the crazy amount of tuition I had to pay for VIRTUAL LABS/CLASSES. (this was during the PEAK of COVID) Also, I saw some devastating things as a nursing student at the hospital that made me realize my heart is too weak for this field. \*Sigh\* I know people say you get used to it, but during that time I just didn't have any mental capacity to hang through nursing school..

So now,

I'm (F) currently a Junior at a University as a Health Science major, but I realized deep down I have no passion toward my major. Everyone in my major are future MD's/PA's/Nurses/Dentist/etc. I have no thoughts of going to get my masters until I have some sort of adult income coming in to support my higher education.

Recently, people have been telling me life after graduation is rough (ngl it's been terrifying to hear, but it's hard for everyone) and it's all about networking. (Apparently your major doesn't matter?) I've always been good with computers, but legit seems like everyone is doing the whole bootcamp thing to get a job in tech nowadays.

My resume is mostly just teaching + hospital admin work. What is the best way for me to branch out and network? I've done some research through school, but they're not that helpful what so ever. I kind of desperately need some guidance cause I really want to be set on what I want to do, but I just don't know where or how to start.

I kind of found Product Managers to be pretty cool, but I don't have anything resume related to branch out in that career field. ANY ADVICE WOULD BE APPRECIATED T\_T"

If it matters, I’m 25 and I have a BA and MA in International Relations, a postgraduate degree in governance &amp; intelligence and I’m in the latter phases of a PhD in Political Science. 

I transitioned to this firm at the start of last year and I’ve been enjoying it so far but things have been slow as there haven’t been a lot of strategy engagements lately.

Recently my boss (the partner) approached me out of the blue saying that he had something important to discuss. Apparently it seems that everyone is aware that I’m a great professional and everything I produce is really good, but they’ve been struggling to, quote, “use me to my full potential” over not being able to score as many contracts with my specialty areas as they would have liked (the issue here is that they've never even tried to allocate me to anything other than strategy consulting, not that I have any issue with it as I've never really gotten negative feedback). 

So he made a proposal: 

**A)** one of our public sector clients needed a consultant to work directly under that institution’s chief as a sort of, quote “right hand man”. This guy is some big-shot (ex-?) CEO with some deep connections with our major ruling party. My boss even went on ahead and blatantly stated that it would be good for him to have as many friends there as he could...

**B)** Everything stays the same and I remain at the firm, get promoted, etc…

I went to what turned out to be an interview with the guy himself just to check things out and the guy pretty much told me that the job was mine if I wanted it and that it would consist of following him to a bunch of strategy meetings with key political figures and some European Union big wigs (plus doing all the powerpoint funny business us consultants do). I would basically be an on demand consultant that happens to function like a pocket secretary I guess.

Understandably I got somewhat excited. It's not everyday you get a pass to casually pitch in with meeting with the prime minister and a bunch of other dudes... However, after this meeting, I got to talk with his lead for Human Resources and found out that their salary offer is barely above my current salary. This being the public sector progression is not as amazing as in a consulting firm (unless I get my sucking muscles working)...

I’m not sure what to do. Should I take mediocre pay for the opportunity of a life time? What would you guys do?

As a public sector strategy consultant, do you think this opportunity would make me a more valuable in the long run? 

All I have to do is say yes or no by Monday and I’ll be working with some really influential people… god I wish I was a house cat, decisions suck"

I was a ""gifted"" kid and manual labor work such as zoo keeping is not ""a real job"". My older brother suggested IT. I tried a few classes at community college and I understood it well enough but it did not come naturally at all (just had zero interest). I pulled out quickly. Dad got irritated again and kept pressing. I am great with numbers so I went to school for accounting with some classes on human relations, saw it through, and got my dad off my back.

1. Buidling e-learning modules/courses in the LMS - this is basically a copy/paste excercise as all of the content is creatd by outside parties. I have dabbled in some HTML/CSS work within the LMS course builder in order to improve the display of courses, but nothing too substantial. Would love to develop skills in Articulate Storyline, which our company has access to although has not shared with me.
2. Supporting Devleopment of E-Learning Modules - basically overseeing the authoring of e-learning modules by communicating with a committee, SMEs (authors), and module production company (the people that build the SCORM/Storyline module). It is a lot of emailing...waiting 2 weeks...sending materials back and forth between parties. I'm not sure if this would be considered ""project management.""
3. A lot of administrative work with committees - setting up meetings, hosting zooms, taking meeting minutes, distributing materials, inviting members to join, preparing official documents and reports, etc. Really dislike this aspect and it's becoming a bigger part of my role unforutnately.

I feel like it's a problem that I'm not really diving into any aspects of my job enough to the point where I'm devleoping real skills that could be applicable elsewhere. I'm working with e-learning courses but not doing any designing where I could move into an instrucitonal design role. I'm managing the development of modules but not enough where I could call myself a project manager. I do other random tasks like editing videos, creating tutorials, creating promos, analyzing LMS data but it's all very amatuer and self-taught.

Over the last few years I’ve been seeing a therapist, dietician and personal trainer and I realized that their lifestyle is appealing to me. I like the idea of spending hour-ish long chunks with individuals that I can schedule at a time that works well for me, as well as being responsible for running my own (tiny) business. Obviously I have considered those 3 careers as options and haven’t ruled them out, but I was wondering about other options as well.

I have a masters degree in a humanities field, and would be willing to do a bit more school if necessary. The money prospects are enticing but less important than enjoying what I do with my time (which I recognize is an enormous privilege)."

How the review works is my manager rates me 1-5 on each criteria, and then I rate me 1-5, and those totals get averaged to determine my performance. Raises are distributed this way too.

1 = Very poor, in need of a lot of coaching

2 = Poor, needs guidance 

3 = Meets expectations

4 = Doing very well, above expectations

5 = Exceptional, going above and beyond

In my opinion, I would rate myself as a 3 for most areas, because I am meeting *my* expectations for quality of work. But the last time I had a performance review my manager said she was surprised that I was rating myself so low because she gave me 4s and 5s in a lot of criteria.

I want to do well on my performance review, but it feels weird to say ""Yeah, I'm going above and beyond"" when I am only meeting the expectations I have for my own work. (Which I know are way above the last person who did my job, because I have been told so)

So, what would constitute a 5 on my end? What criteria do I base my opinion on?"

Something I didn’t mention was that I signed a 4 year contract in my current position which isn’t up until the end of this year, 2023. They essentially paid for my “fellowship” (cost estimated to be $35k) so I’d have to pay that back at a prorated amount. I’m just so miserable and can’t see myself staying that much longer. 

I’ve heard that some companies when hiring me on will pay the remainder that I owe, which would be great. But does asking for that make me look bad for breaking a contract? How would I even go about asking for that? Or do I just try to stick it out for the rest of the year even though I’m miserable? Thanks for any input!"

1,2023-01-19,Helpful Interview Tactics To Land The Job?,u/KryptoSC,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10gayua/helpful_interview_tactics_to_land_the_job/,careerguidance," Quick background about myself. I was a tech and finance consultant working on many short-term projects and currently in a senior role. During my 25-year career I've had over 70 jobs, went through a few hundred interviews as the job applicant, and have conducted dozens of interviews from the other side of the table. Here's what I've learned and my perspective on how to best land the job you want.

First, before an interview starts, the interviewer reads your body language. Having confidence, speaking at a normal pace, and being assertive is critical. If you give the impression that you're nervous or that you're being too polite kissing a\*\*, this will be a big turnoff from the start as the interviewer might think you're out of your league applying for this position. Basically, you want to act like you've been their long-time coworker.

Second, most interviews usually start off with the hiring manager or a panel of people giving you a quick background of themselves, the company, and the position. You need to pay close attention to the part of why they have this position opened (which I'll address in more detail later). Then they ask you to talk about yourself. This part should be BRIEF. Too many times candidates would run their mouth off for over 10 minutes and they would go into details about what they did at each of their jobs. This is a trainwreck if you're doing that. Instead, this part should be 1-2 minutes long TOPS. Time yourself! It should contain 1 or 2 bullet points about your education, and for each the last 3 companies you worked at you should state your position and 1 or 2 bullet points about what you did there. Those bullet points you state at each of your job should tie back into the job description of the job you are applying for. For example, don't talk about how you increased sales at your last job when they're looking more for an Excel-savvy analyst.

Third, after your BRIEF intro, this is the part of the interview where YOU need to take control of the conversation. If they did not mention why they have the position opened during their intro, then you need to state something along the lines of:

""Before, I talk more about myself, I'd like to know why are you looking to hire for this position. What problem are you trying to solve or address?""

The answer to this question is the most critical part of the interview that can make or break it for you. This answer will inform you of how you need to continue the conversation and what subjects to talk about. This is where you become a salesman and close the deal. When they say, we're hiring, because we're trying to address Issue A, B, and C. Ideally, you want to be able to respond back with something like ""Regarding Issue A, at this past job, I have solid expertise doing this and that. For Issue B, I did this and that in my past job, so I can help your team. For Issue C, I can be a valuable resource, because of these past things I've done.

Fourth, If you're a mid to senior-level candidate, ask what is the high-level strategy that the manager is trying to accomplish and then give your perspective on strategy and approach. Try to debate them a little bit. People like others who can be confident enough to throw out ideas, think strategically, and have an executive mindset.

Hopefully, you found this helpful. Feel free to comment back your perspective and thoughts."

In most cases having to completely switch jobs or career paths. I feel like I have been wasting time staying in places so long that underappreciate the value I bring to the table UNTIL I'm gone. And to my awful surprise I seem to keep finding myself still being put in precarious situations in the work place. 

There are some things that I speak on that I feel wont ""rock the boat"" too much. As to picking and choosing my battles I have had plenty, which makes things easier to sniff out the ones I know NOONE is EVER going to win. (Some people just aren't willing to grow/evolve!) which I also know usually doesn't have a direct correlation to me. But I cant help but feel like every time I have to go to HR, keep quiet, pretend like I didn't hear, completely ignore and or take whatever is being dished out....I die a little inside. ESSPECIALLY when you then realize what you have said was wrong and instead of simply saying you are sorry, laugh and try to tell me it was a joke.

I am making as close too the highest paying amount I have ever earned. Which makes me more and more reluctant to just leave as I also live in one of the most expensive cities. But where will I find a good middle ground!? I'm not saying everything needs to always bee lemon drops and gummy pops but is a girl gonna ever catch a break? I keep telling myself that If I was just here things would be way different and NEVER are!

I have been with my current company for 8 years and have worked up from a design engineer to a project manager. Our company recently joined with another and as such we are reorganizing our department. My boss oversees a large region and is very busy. We have several offices within his area with  design teams in each office. The new company structure includes a department lead for each office with about 6 engineers/project managers under them. Our boss was supposed to select department leads for each office in October and promotions were recently announced. My boss failed to select anyone to be the department lead (each office had a couple people they are capable of doing the job) and instead has decided to manage them all himself for the foreseeable future. This is an overwhelming amount of work and takes away from his job managing the whole group and growing our practice. I get along well with my boss but my career growth has often been delayed by him (ie delaying promotions, not giving promised work or guidance needed to advance). Our group is currently very understaffed and we are pretty much booked with work for the next 1-2 years.

I am currently in a good position to leverage for the promotion, but also have solid prospects at other employers as there is a severe shortage of engineers our area. I love the projects I have and enjoy my coworkers, but don’t want to pass up an opportunity for growth/advancement. My question is do I go out and get job offers and then approach my boss, or express my concerns and allude to getting going elsewhere if I need to? He knows full well I could get a dozen offers without much effort. I don’t want to sour my boss by forcing his hand completely if I get other offers and threaten to leave, but I worry that if I just express my concerns nothing will happen. Thoughts? (FWIW I have never used the threat of leaving with this company, and they poached me from a competitor)."

I make enough to pay the bills and live comfortably. 

With our newest addition to the family I’ve been naturally finding myself dreading my time away from my family. For the first time in my life the career I once loved so much feels like it’s taking more away from me than it’s giving. I’m longing to find something that would allow me to work more days at home to be near my family. Although I live and work in a very tech heavy area, I know next to nothing about it, or where to even start career wise. I consider myself a very well rounded person with lots of hobbies and interests. Im punctual, efficient, friendly, talkative, a fast learner, can keep a tight schedule and always interested in learning new things. But, where does that leave me? I’ve never had to actively look for a job since I was 18. I don’t even have a LinkedIn account for fear of it being too bare. Do any remote jobs translate to my line of work? 

Not sure what I’m looking for out of this. Anyone else find there selves in my shoes? I know I still have a lot of time left in my life to explore more career options, I just never thought id actually do it. At this point I’m open to any positive feedback or suggestions! Thanks for reading."

There are some pretty general questions on it that you'd expect to see ex. Where do you see yourself in 6 months, 1 yr etc. Some a little tricky to answer but still acceptable and expected ex. what are your weaknesses? And some that require a little deep digging and I think may be borderline inappropriate to ask in a professional setting ex. how do I change my mindset to reach my goals? What would my career look like if I over came my weaknesses. Those are straight up weird to me and open the door to lots of conversations that do not feel like they should happen at work and maybe with a friend or therapist.

Anyway so after writing our answers we do multiple rounds presenting them to different managers. In each round your answers are critiqued and edited (they literally tell you what to write) so what you initially wrote just keeps changing until it is unrecognizable and completely not what you wanted.

Any (gentle) push back leads to talking in circles until you just give up and agree.

Am I overreacting? It just feels... wrong. I get needing development plan and an overall sense of direction and why they would expect that from each employee. But every time this comes around I feel more lost about what I want to do in life and sometimes I think that's by design.

And should I really stick it out?,u/_boov,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10gdbll/how_candid_can_i_actually_be_with_management_and/,careerguidance,"I’ve been working at a small (&lt; 10 FTE) marketing agency for almost a year and a half. Prior to that, I was at another small (~15 FTE) agency for 5 years. I really like most things about working in a small, entrepreneurial environment. I strongly dislike bureaucracy, as I’m sure most people do, and I LOVE solving problems. 

One of my biggest strong suits in my previous role was identifying inefficiencies/issues and implementing solutions. I have several documented examples of my solutions improving relationships with clients, allowing us to diversify our service offerings, or saving us thousands of dollars. While I’ve always had to get major changes approved, I never felt like I had to defend my reasoning or justify myself. 

When I took on my current role, I was really excited to come in and improve things. They were very up front with me about things needing work. It took me awhile to catch on and build rapport with my team to feel comfortable suggesting new solutions, but I got there. 

The problem is…my solutions are often shot down for one reason or another. I don’t think they considered that my changes would have a company-wide impact. For example, we’re stuck in the STONE AGE with software. As a fully remote company, I just don’t think this is acceptable. I’ve found solutions for project management, invoicing, etc., and some management is so reluctant to learning new systems that they’ll keep manually generating recurring invoices each month.

While I’ve always seen efficiency as a good thing, they seem to view it as a “shortcut.” They want everything we do to be totally custom. With fewer than 10 FTEs (4 on my team), it is IMPOSSIBLE to reinvent the wheel on every single scope of work/project plan and still remain profitable. It just requires too much time and we don’t have the infrastructure. I am just so exhausted. 

For some reason I feel that I would be “giving up” if I quit. I’ve been open with management about having trouble here and there, but I’m wondering if I should/can be totally candid with them: “listen, I respect you and am doing my best but I’m quickly growing frustrated by not being allowed to innovate in the way I know how. To be completely honest, I don’t feel that some of the decisions being made are in the company’s best interest and my department is held back because of it.” Of course I can provide them with concrete examples. 

I’m torn. Is there any way to approach this without it sounding like a threat of me quitting? Is it totally out of line to say this to a boss? Should I just assume that our philosophies ultimately don’t align and walk away? Or is every boss like this and I’ve been living in a fantasy world for 5 years?"

1,2023-01-19,Accept a new job with slightly lower salary for some stability?,u/Clear-Ad2516,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10gdfmo/accept_a_new_job_with_slightly_lower_salary_for/,careerguidance,"I'm a PhD who's been working in industry (pharma) as a scientist for the last two years. The job is sometimes interesting and sometimes too boring/corporate (I'm in a big multinational), I often don't feel invested.
My contract is not stable. I'm a contractor and most of us have been let go earlier, I have a second 2-y contract but it could be terminated any time with one month's notice; perspectives of a permanent position are bleak - company is on a financial diet. My colleagues are very happy with my work and my boss is fighting to keep me, but ultimately the decision is way above her and I'm one of the few non-permanent employees left.

I have received an offer as project manager in university, which sounds super interesting and with a lot of variety. The job would be for 4 years. However, at the start I would make slightly less (-2k per year) than I now do in pharma (pharma company pays really well and there is some freedom of negotiation whereas uni is heavily regulated). Task wise - I think I'll like the PM job more. Stability wise, new job would be more stable. But I'm afraid accepting an offer with no jump in salary, and at a time of inflation, could hurt me in the long run. On the other hand, the scientist job is quite niche whereas maybe project manager could be more flexibly spendable for the future?

Opinions please :)

ETA - that 2k is after tax. So the difference is more like 5k before taxes (northern Europe here)"

6,2023-01-19,High paying job with additional pay or lower paying job with more work life balance?,u/TheOnlyOddThing,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10gdr1v/high_paying_job_with_additional_pay_or_lower/,careerguidance," Hi everyone,

As the title states, I'm in a quite of a bit of a dilemma. My current job is amazing, the people are great and the work is not too much (it doesn't tax me or anything and requires no over time). The current salary is $110,000 with bonus included. I have been recently offered a job that will pay $175,000 with bonus included but I am aware that the job requires a lot of extra work (pushing 50-60 hours per week).

I know I have been fortunate but I need some guidance in terms of where I will be in 10 years from now if I decide to choose my current job over this other job. Will I regret it? Will the saving amount be similar?

I do value money as I am planning to start a family but at the same time, it is so nice to have a nice work-life balance so I can focus on my life as well.

Any recommendations will be appreciated."
231,2023-01-19,Is it reasonable for prospective employers to ask their candidates to do a “case study” assignment during the interview process?,u/SCexplorer11,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/10gdsap/is_it_reasonable_for_prospective_employers_to_ask/,careerguidance,"I’m currently a candidate for an entry-level event coordinator job with a non-profit. I’ve had three interviews so far. Phone, zoom, and in person. I started the process before Christmas and I thought I would get an offer or rejection after the in person interview, but now the hiring manager sent me a long “case study” assignment to complete within a week. Looks like it may take at least half a day to complete. 

I just think they are asking too much of me as a candidate to continue jumping through these hoops for an entry-level type role. They haven’t told me what the salary is yet and it sounds like I would be working many nights and weekends, as well as being on call overnight at times. It just doesn’t seem worth it to me anymore to keep putting in effort into this process. 

Is it common for these kinds of jobs to have candidates work on these assignments during the candidate experience? I understand it if it were for a skilled role such as in tech or IT, but it seems like a bit much for a presumably low-paying entry-level role like this one. Or am I wrong to think this way and I should just suck it up and do it?"

The other class is carpentry which I already have experience building stuff from a woodworking class and projects like fences, shelves, etc. I'm not sure which one I should take but I think that I'd enjoy both. Any advice, would help. Thanks!"
