If enough people are into it more content will come within the following year with hopefully yearly updates which after some time leads to the following three scenarios:

A: The content creators give up and do nothing more with it dissapointing fans who were hoping for at least an ending.

B: Content creators bloat the content beyond the original scope looking nothing like the original content and ruining all that hooked people onto it in the first place.

uniCorn: That rare gem that the content creators give the fans a deserving finish which is liked by all.

 - used to help with a few ailments: tiredness (from any source), symptoms of a lack of sleep, waking up faster (even if well-rested otherwise), fixing jet lag
 - used to get specific effects: heightened attention and preventing sleep
 - lightly process the part of a plant
 - has a bunch of positive side effects, like getting antioxidants into the body
 - abusing it to dangerous levels is possible but requires efforts, or interactions
 - can still interact with a bunch of drugs (like Hypericum perforatum does)
 - you extract the chemical with hot water and drink the result, like with a lot of herbal medicine

BUT contrarily to other herbal medicine it's not, afaik, marketed with inflated expectations.

Same points could be made about tea, but i've seen marketing inflating its virtues by quite a bit."

* People burp 10-30 times per day.
* Conservatively, we can estimate from this that the average person spends approximately one second out of every day burping.
* Thus, there are a total of approximately 7 billion burp\*seconds that occur each day.
* Naively dividing this burp-second mass evenly across all of the 86400 seconds in a day, we get an average of 81,000 burp-seconds per second.
* This is an average number and the minimal burp-second density can certainly be smaller due to differences in how many people are awake, etc. However, it seems reasonable to assume that the number can't vary by more than a factor of 10.
* Thus, there are at least **several thousand contemporaneous burps** occuring at any given instant."
