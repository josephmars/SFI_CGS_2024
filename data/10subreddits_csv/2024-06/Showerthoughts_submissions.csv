I believed my childhood was alright but after conversing with a few of my friends, I realized perhaps not as much so. 

My parents used to hit me pretty bad, and at least before yesterday I gave the excuse that, while harsh, it was usually because of some behavior from my side so it was just severe punishment. I mentioned it, in passing, and I was given extremely shocked responses. 

I realized that, throughout my entire life I was constantly being compared to other kids, other teens, and eventually other adults. My success was never celebrated by family, and help was never really given.

After all that though, I still figured it was an unfortunate byproduct of being in a household that expressed affection in other ways. But after talking with friends and contemplating in the shower, I realized that had I started asking about other parents and comparing them, I may have realized I was in an abusive home years earlier. 

It’s an overall morbid post and I apologize if it triggers anyone hence I used the nsfw tag.  But it certainly was a genuine shower thought"

continuous growth is the model every school of economics teaches and that recessions and downturns are part of the process... this model is also largely responsible for why we are currently in the climate soup we are in (slowy being carbonated).



but what if we invented a hibernation mechanism for the economy that would intervene and shut down costly processes in times of scarcity or disruption so that the essential parts of the economic body can survive until conditions improve, much like cells and animals do?

What happens when it finally reaches the South Pole? In theory, the robot was digging down the entire time... at what point is the robot digging up? Once it broke ground at the South Pole from digging down, wouldn't the robot just fall to the sky? Again, for the sake of conversation, if it were a human digging, at what point does the human realize and notice that it went from digging down, to digging up? It just went from digging down and putting dirt to the side, to digging up (and dirt is falling on the ground)."

A child is as expensive as an adult but does not provide anything to country's economics for 18 years at least. So governments of developed countries decided to choke the birthrate so that they would need immigrants. Immigrants come from less developed countries. Students apply to universities and are full of eagerness to study and then work because this country is drastically better than theirs. Due to this fact immigrants also have lower living standards and will do anything in order to not to go back, so companies could hire them for lower wage and higher workload. They also accept best students, and well off families who did everything to get in the developed country so developing countries will continue to choke losing intelligent and proactive citizens and developed ones will get the profit for lower cost. And as soon as immigrants do not  meet the requirements (kicked off the university, couldn't find the right job, did crimes and etc.) the country will just depart them and replace. Damn, sometimes it is just like immigrants work some time and then they just do not get the citizenship being forced to leave. 

But as I look at Germany and Sweden my theory doesn't seem so perfect so... Get out of the shower and forget!"

The odds of us being alive are unfathomable with the millions of ancestors it took to create us, and the fact that the big bang perfectly enabled us to be have the exact proportions and compositions to create life. As intelligent beings the obvious life goal would be to learn more about the universe and put all our effort into exploring more of it.

Yet despite all this, the vast majority of us just stress about things like passing our classes, getting a promotion, making money, or worrying about a sports team/politician. 

Of course our human needs come first, but it blows my mind how we all consciously live like NPC's. "

As the title of this post suggests, /r/Showerthoughts is going to be undergoing some changes in the near future. The general goal will be to make the subreddit more accessible, stimulating, and enjoyable, and to hopefully raise the overall quality of the submissions here.

While a handful of these changes have already been decided behind the scenes (like the elimination of that overlong question-tree, for instance), we wanted to open up the discussion to users before we implemented anything. To that end, we'd like to ask you the following questions:

**\- What is your favorite thing about /r/Showerthoughts?**

**\- What would you change about /r/Showerthoughts if you could?**

**\- Should bacon be crunchy, crispy, soft, or floppy?**

Feel free to answer any or all of the above questions, and please don't hesitate to add any additional thoughts! We'll look forward to reading your ideas, and we'll make another announcement when the updates are upon us."

The theory is based on the fact that you only hear the stuff you actually want to hear, and more than half of what you hear or see later becomes fragments of memories long gone before you even realise it.

There’s a lot more stuff around you that you negligibly or partially hear which you don’t even process but somehow gets stored somewhere in your brain. Like lost archives.

If you could only process or find a way to navigate through those data. Trust me. You’d be unstoppable. You’d automatically start connecting all these pieces of information with each other however ways you can, and realise it is all in-fact connected. 

You will know everything. You will make inventions. You will predict the future. You will find answers to the questions unanswered.

I feel like a place like this would be good for older teens and young adults still trying to figure out what career they'd like, in a low stakes environment. Each job lasts around an hour at most, so they can try multiple jobs in one day, and see which one they'd be interested in learning more about.

I have seen many posts in which men are told that the reason their wife isn’t interested in sex is because she’s mentally and physically tired. Those posts encourage men to take part in chores and take care of their children and wives.

At the same time, I saw a post in which a woman stated that “less nagging and more gagging” is what got her “acres,” etc. What she sounded to me like 

Both of these types of posts sounded to me like they were transactional, ie, that, rather than doing things for their partner because of love and contribution to the relationship, they were doing it to gain something— which sounds so manipulative towards one’s partner and untrue towards one’s self. 

At the same time, chances are that these same people look down on sex workers… as if they themselves aren’t performing for favors. "

What if someone made a movie with the following plot line:

1) man noticed a really well made spider web in his backyard and hoses it down but the web doesn’t fall. He thinks “whoa so strong”

2) keep in mind this is in the 1800s or something. This man obsesses with spider web strength. He works to produce spider web like material using actual spiderwebs to create high strength materials.

3) fast forward 200 + years, his progeny has a factory and business around making these web materials for high strength  Kevlar armors for war and gun materials from the silk and everything war related from the silk 

4) the mistake was using the same species of spider over the many years, causing these spiders evolve over time and eventually escape the forced breeding grounds 

5) they attack humans (suddenly they’re ginormous in my mind) and the only thing that can stop them is the military equipped with their spider web battle armor and guns

6) spiders realize it’s their webbing around everything and somehow they using that against humans and suddenly….. spider world!"

For example, a friend of mine may be having issues with their spouse not being emotionally supportive at best, and emotionally abusive at worst. Rather than seeking emotional support elsewhere, leaving entirely, or more seriously pursuing therapy as solutions for the loneliness and lack of support they feel- they just keep waiting for their spouse to be whag they need. 

I think we often times see our problems as ""okay I dont like how this thing is, and the only way for me to be happy is for this thing to change for my happiness"" and not ""this IS the problem, the SOURCE of my unhappiness. It only makes sense that my happiness will be found elsewhere, or at minimum I will need to find a solution OUTSIDE of the problem to fix it."""

Especially when they charge you $20 for the main dish, $5 for a soft drink or water, and expect a 20% tip.

I used to look forward to discovering new food trucks in and about town, where you'd get something pretty tasty for a reasonable price. Street tacos used to be $3 bucks each and getting 3 or 4 was such a yummy treat. 

I loved supporting these chefs and getting to try out new foods that I might not have otherwise.

Now, you get something pretty mediocre; like tonight it was an unimpressive shrimp noodles, on a paper plate that wanted to bend in half. I had to look around to find a curb I could sit on, to rest the plate on my lap before it gave up and let the noodles slide off.

Another truck was selling burgers and fries for $16 and $6 respectively, while yet another was doing gyros for $19. Street tacos from the Mexican truck? $7.50 each! 

At restaurant prices (without the table and chairs, bathroom, or service), this is no longer the experience I used to relish.

To explain, I'll use nothing as an example.

^ there is nothing in that line, BUT ALAS, that is not true because I can point it out, nothing is the absence of something. 

Which is paradoxical, because therefore something is the absence of nothing, which makes no sense is nothing is the absence of something. Therefore these two cannot possibly exist together in the same space, but yet, they do, for example we talk about space being nothing, but its space, so it's something, therefore it's not nothing, but it isn't something either.

Everything we take for granted only exists because we made it exist, science, isn't real, it's just what we have all collectively agreed makes the most sense out of what we witness. 

Earth is only called earth because we called it earth, for example.

Therefore nothing is real, everything is made up gobbledegook, and we're all just dealing with it.

Not that that's a bad thing it's just kinda cool!"

If you feel like shit and haven't been drinking water, its because your blood is becoming more viscous, and you can dilute it by hydrating yourself, which will make it easier to pump blood through your pipes (stay hydrated). Same goes for food, if you eat stuff that causes your blood to be more viscous it'll make it harder to circulate (eat well). Maybe a lot of this stuff is obvious, but I just started training in plumbing engineering and its making me think about things through that lens.

TLDR: Exercise, drink water, eat clean"

Starving the lower class for resources and bolstering rich elites has historically resulted in society mostly comprising of a mass of peasants. 

The privileged and powerful have historically also undermined groups that do not give them any private benefit to have their resources redirected toward themselves.

And, as a hot take, nobody is truly able to just shrug off toxicity; they instead pass on that hatred onto other people, making the environment as a whole more hostile for everyone.

Many affected by toxicity try to make themselves out to be stronger to feel better about enduring the hate, but regardless give into its infectious grasp through the mocking of others for taking the matter more seriously.

The stance that people hurt by toxicity are simply weaker is not a progressive way of thinking, since instead of facing the issue, people conclude that they are helpless to make change and accept its suffocating presence. Change comes from a desire to make things better, and drowning that out is no way to go. If there's a flaw in a system, more often than not the solution is to fix it.

Albeit, the disinhibition effect on the internet proves to be a thorn in the back; this dissonance it provides, though beneficial to the vulnerable who lean on it, also can make those acting as mediums for toxicity separate themselves from their actions to deny their own responsibility.

Large scale revolution requires understanding and unity, but if you don't think you're equipped to go big, at least start small! No act of kindness is insignificant because it'll always be noticed by a human person; yourself at the very least. 

It's better to be nice to someone who doesn't deserve it than to deny kindness to someone who needs it. "

Gametes have life much sooner than they can fuse together into some being. And death is not when your heart stops, nor you stop breathing, or being conscious. Death comes slowly in the body, not instantaneously. The fact Is that you lose consciousness progressively, and you can't really feel death occurring to your body. Much likely it is like being put under total anesthesia."

The trend of violence decreasing as a whole will probably continue. Some things will undoubtedly improve objectively. But there will always be war. There will always be the haves and have nots. There will always be classes and rulers, oppressors and oppressed. 

     We’ve had thousands of years to try a different way of doing things but we keep coming up short because we are human. We are tenacious, we are industrious, we are clever. We can accomplish mind boggling feats of ingenuity, and engineering when we work together. I am convinced that there is no problem that the sum of all of our intellects couldn’t overcome. 

     Humans are amazing… but we continue to fight and kill each other, and subdue each other, for the same reasons we’ve always had and we always will: hate, fear, greed, desperation. 

     I like Star Trek and media like it. Where we abolish poverty and journey beyond the stars, bringing our gifts with us. I would like to believe that I’m some tiny piece in the Human Machine, a machine that’s slowly lurching towards some great inconceivable ideal. I don’t believe that anymore.

Last week, we [ask for your input](https://redd.it/1djiftx) on how to improve /r/Showerthoughts. There were quite a few great answers, and a handful of requests were repeated several times over. Those requests were as follows:
 
\- Make it easier to post      
\- Cut down on karma-farming     
\- Require higher-quality posts      
\- Allow a greater variety of posts

As you may have noticed, half of these requests seem to contradict the other half: If it's easier to post, or if we allow a greater variety of posts, there will be more karma-farming and a greater number of low-quality submissions by default. On the other hand, if every post is required to be a high-quality and unique showerthought, the amount karma-farming will certainly be reduced, but the difficulty of posting will only increase.

Still, where there's a will, there's a way... and we think that we’ve come up with one.

**/r/Showerthoughts will soon feature four different post-types.**

These will be as follows:

------

**Showerthoughts** will be what they always were (or were supposed to be)— miniature epiphanies that make the mundane more amazing. They'll be original, they'll be unique, they'll be of exceptional quality, and they'll be exemplars of the subreddit.

**Musings** will be very similar to showerthoughts, but they'll only need to be original, not unique. Basically, if you came up with a high-quality thought by yourself, you'll be able to post it, and it won't matter if a similar thought was expressed by a user of a niche forum in 1993. You'll still need to proofread your musings and ensure that they're rule-abiding, but you won't have to worry if each one is the very first of its kind.

**Speculations** will be ""What if?"" premises, contemplations of things that can't be verified or falsified (like ""How does Tobias Fünke poop?""), and thoughts on events that are *probable* but not necessarily true *yet* (like ""As AI-generated videos get better, people will almost certainly use them for next-level catfishing.""). Speculations will still need to be thought-provoking, interesting, and likely to prompt discussion – we won't accept ""I might see a sparrow today,"" for instance – but those of you who asked for questions and ""I wonder..."" statements to be allowed will have a place for them now.

**Casual thoughts** will be posts that feature original but more-common conclusions, including those thoughts that currently get removed as ""personal perspectives."" As long as a given thought was offered with a modicum of effort and isn't in our list of done-to-death submissions (which we'll discuss in a moment), it will be allowed. This variety of post is going to be experimental, so expect it to be adjusted as time goes on.

------

**The Flair-System**

When creating a new post in /r/Showerthoughts, users will select one of the above-listed flairs, then receive a prompt which encourages them to read the rules. After they've responded to that prompt, the user's post will be approved. **There's will be no more question-tree**, and there will be no more ""You have violated some vaguely defined portion of the rules."" Ideally, folks will have a much easier time understanding how and what they should be posting, and posting itself will be a smoother process.

Following from that, something else which was suggested was a limit on the number of posts that any one individual can offer. We're going to give that a try, starting with allowing **one post per person per seventy-two-hour period**. (Only posts will have a limit, though, not comments.) Like other things, this rule may end up getting adjusted, and we'll be watching to see how it affects the community.

Finally – and as alluded to in the ""casual thoughts"" section – quite a few people expressed frustration with the number of low-effort, done-to-death, and low-quality posts and comments in the community. In order to cut down on those, **we'll be condensing our fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth rules into one catch-all rule**, and we'll be explicitly forbidding certain posts (like ""The brain named itself"") and post-formats (like ""X was Y years ago""). Comments like those that should be silent votes (such as ""Great post!"" or ""LOL, upvoted!"") will also be forbidden, partially because they add a lot of disruptive noise, and partially because they're often offered by spammers.

------

There will be a few other (smaller) changes made, too, but most of those will happen behind the scenes... and besides, this announcement is already long enough that most people will have started skimming by now. If you're one of the few individuals who is reading every word, respond to this post by discussing the virtues of having radioactive lobsters run the subreddit. The rest of this paragraph will obscure that suggestion. **Watch for future announcements as we work on details, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you see something that might require our attention.**

The rollout will take place over the next few days, but for now, let us just say this:

**Welcome to /r/Showerthoughts 2.0!**
