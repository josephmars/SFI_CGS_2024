284,2024-05-31,CMV: Raspberry Jam is the best of all jams/jellies and it‚Äôs not even close,u/nowlan101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d5aatg/cmv_raspberry_jam_is_the_best_of_all_jamsjellies/,changemyview,"It‚Äôs the perfect balance between the original flavor of the raspberry, which is sweet but with a small sour bite to it, and the copious amounts of sugar spooned into it. Strawberry jam is hella overrated, it tastes far less like the original strawberry it came from then raspberry jam goes from its namesake. 

Marmalade is really only good by itself on some buttered toast but you rarely eat that outside of breakfast. The mixed berry, grape and plum jams are all interesting novelties but nowhere near as good as raspberry. Grape is just a stand-in jelly for 90% of the population. Nobody *really* wants it. But if the strawberry uncrustables are out then I guess we‚Äôll have to settle for that. 

Raspberry balances sweetness with tartness and complements the earthy flavor of peanut butter way better when it comes to sandwiches. Hell, sometimes I‚Äôll just skip the bread and just take a spoonful of each instead. 

Wake up sheeple! Don‚Äôt let ‚Äúbig strawberry‚Äù get to you!

I believe over time should be after 20-30hrs OR wages need to increase as a whole. 

I work 10 hrs a day 5-6 days/week (50-60 hrs/week). The amount I make is a lot more than 40 hr/week, that‚Äôs why I do it. But when I think of people who can‚Äôt work more than 40 hrs due to personal constraints or being burnt by the job, this seems like a major widespread economical problem. Especially when you can publicly see how much these companies make, that you work for.

I understand that successful entrepreneurs will always make the most money. It just seems like it‚Äôs gone extreme. 

The funny thing is we (the 99%) control how much the entrepreneurial‚Äôs make. But we can‚Äôt seem to stop them or the wages they choose for us.  They find ways to get the lowest price or find perfect psychological advertisement and keeps us hooked.

This probably sounds very nihilistic. But I‚Äôm pro future I‚Äôm just trying to see a better future. Im probably wrong.

This means that they live where they live, and not in some military complex.
It means they go to their local shops and don't get dedicated supplies etc

So when I hear claims that they are ""hiding"" among the civilian population it seems to be twisting the actual nature of life in that kind of situation, what it means to be a civilian, what it means to be a guerilla fighter.
It also seems to miss that plenty of actual military locations around the world are within civilian areas. London for example has many barracks and installations, including one I used to live down the road from.

If someone bombed this barracks and I was caught in the blast along with other non military people would the British army be accused of ""hiding among civilians""?
Would they say they had ""used me as a human shield?"" 

As for human shields, this seems to be applied in retrospect.

As above, if people are in a camp and identified as combatants they aren't actively doing anything with those around them, so when there is collateral it's hardly a result of their actions.

My thoughts on an actual human shield would be a soldier using a person in close proximity, almost like a temporary hostage, to avoid being fired at.

In the case of Hamas Et Al I don't think that simply being close to people who are caught in their strike as collateral qualifies - it's obvious that Israel/IDF wouldn't care either way, and the ""shields"" aren't actually preventing anything at all.

I refer better with the term collateral damage, people who were caught in a sad radius, but not an active action against them by someone ""using them"".
I think to change my view I'd be interested in seeing any operations which were actually called off/changed to avoid collateral damage, ie the theoretical human shield actually effectively shielding.

I'm open to any other relevant discussions but please keep it specific to my post, as this is an easy topic to digress in! Referencing back to specific parts of my post and things I've said will go a long way!

He only voted for Biden because he‚Äôd remove his student loans. He wants to keep voting for Republicans going forward because that party will keep making the economic machine better for him so he can gain more wealth to pursue his hobbies and build his life. However we‚Äôve seen systematically that the Republican Party only cares for the rich and wealthy. If you don‚Äôt have >$500K net worth then it‚Äôs disadvantageous for you to vote for them. Trump has increased income taxes for lower tax brackets while decreasing taxes for multimillionaires. Republicans do provide incentives for businesses but those do not trickle down to the working class or individual workers but line the pocket for their executives. If you‚Äôre young and broke then it makes more sense to vote for Liberals since they are more likely to provide social support systems to build wealth in the short and medium term.

One Ishmael(which is where the Islam faith comes from) and Isaac (Abraham passes the Jewish faith). For years Abraham tried to have kids with his wife Sarah but it never happened at first. God told him to be patient but Abraham as impatient as he was cheated and had a son out of wedlock. Ishmael was born. Later God did send Abraham and Sarah as son which was Isaac. God established his covenant with Isaac. Ishmael and his mother were banish. Ishmael and Isaac has been fighting ever since. Actually til this day. The war in Palestine will never stop. There is nobody on earth can stop it. But one day when Jesus comes back for his people (the saved) that‚Äôs when the war is over. That‚Äôs the question everyone should be thinking about right now. Is your heart right with Jesus? I‚Äôm not trying to preach. But are you really going to watch all this bad stuff happen and not ask God into your heart today?

Therefore the Israeli national anthem, which calls for a home in Jerusalem for the Jewish people, doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to have violent intent. Arabs and Jews can co-exist there. I think people‚Äôs problem with the anthem is more so what it represents. Many who do recite it completely support the war, which I couldn‚Äôt disagree with more. Nevertheless, I don‚Äôt think the Israeli anthem is problematic when viewed in the lens of a pacifist.

A person is copied perfectly - body and mind.  
The clone is usually depicted as having all sorts of psychological issues just from being a clone.  
I don't understand this view at all. In my eyes the clone is equal to the original.

**Note:** This post is heavily inspired by the *Mauler Twins* in *Invincible* tv series. Reading this post might be a minor spoiler to the series. 

>You wake up strapped to a medical bed. ""Rise and shine, clone!"" you hear from the other side of the room.  
""You're the clone"" you answer, still disoriented from the cloning process.   
You look at the source of the voice and see..... Yourself. There's now two of you.

>You look exactly the same - your physical state copied perfectly.

>You are genetically identical.

>Your memories have been copied, and by this time you remember everything, including getting into the cloning machine.

>And yet this other *you* is a completely separate being. The only thoughts you have are your own.

  
This story can continue in two paths.

The first path is simple - you are completely indistinguishable from your clone. There is no way to tell who is the original and who is the clone. You are both completely equivalent.   
In this case there is no hierarchy between the two of you.

In the second path:

>""That's what the clone would say"" your copy says. Before you can protect the clone points to the bracelet wrapped around his arm. You immediately look to your own arm and realize - you are the   
clone. 

In this case there is a tell to distinguish the clone from the original. The clone, for some reason, is considered inferior to the original. This creates a strange hierarchy and power dynamic, as if the original somehow matters more or worth more.

I believe the second case should end up just like the first one - two equals.

An exception would be if there the clone and the original have something they absolutely cannot share - such a spouse.  
In that case there is reason to believe that the original has some advantage when deciding how to deal with the situation. However, that is not to say the original automatically gets to own and keep everything.

To sum up, I believe that when two identical clones are created it shouldn't matter who is the original and who is the copy.

0,2024-06-01,CMV: widespread female promiscuity devalues women in dating dynamics and incentivizes antisocial (ASPD) characteristics in men at the societal level,u/die_eating,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d5p4k4/cmv_widespread_female_promiscuity_devalues_women/,changemyview,"Tldr From positive things came some unintended negative things. 

Women gained liberation (sexually, biologically, financially, etc); one way this newfound freedom is exercised is heightened promiscuity, which led to a wholesale shift in social norms around fornication and marriage. The old norms used to be enforced most strongly by women themselves. It was in their interest to prevent the ""devaluation"" of sex, as it was a prime motivator of men to strive to become better long term partners. This benefited society by creating a stable foundation for social reproduction -- including in particular the tethering of male energies toward the most productive ends. 

The built-in biological incentive is now tethered in the opposite direction. Short-term mating strategy and less attachment is incentivized on both sides, by both sides.
Those who want to opt out of this paradigm are finding it harder and harder to find a partner who feels the same way.

I don't think it's coincidence that men/women relations seem more fraught than ever.

It's not sustainable -- neither for women nor for men, nor for society as a whole. 

The trap is presupposing that women must be denied the opportunities for self-fulfillment that many have pursued in this era. (Reading this as) disparaging women is counterproductive -- and in fact it is symptom of the same spiral of social dissolution that I am criticizing here."

Now, I‚Äôm not a bigot and have nothing against trans people- I‚Äôve had trans women and men play in my D&D campaigns, and a close friend‚Äôs daughter is trans. In most situations, in most organizations, it‚Äôs natural for both trans and biological women be included together! Still, though, I believe that biological women should also have our own space.

Growing up, my opportunities and experiences were overshadowed by sexism - for example, I wasn‚Äôt allowed to attend Space Camp in 5th grade, because I was the only girl who‚Äôd signed up. Trans women were still boys as a child, with all the privileges that come with it. Sexism is something relatively new to them. And as a woman in a man‚Äôs body, they had a different set of challenges and a different set of experiences that I can‚Äôt presume to understand! 

I fully support their right to have trans-only communities and don‚Äôt expect or demand to be included. I can‚Äôt help but see this as yet another case of men (sex, not gender) pushing us to the back because they‚Äôve decided they want something. Misogyny at work yet again.

0,2024-06-01,CMV: Trump's conviction in his recent business fraud case is unlikely to give Biden an advantage and might even help Trump's chances.,u/SpiritedDiet,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d5r10p/cmv_trumps_conviction_in_his_recent_business/,changemyview,"It is my opinion that Trump's felony conviction will probably not help or hurt either candidate during the November election. There is a greater chance, in my opinion, that this case will embolden independent voters to vote for Trump as a way of ""righting a wrong"" rather than persuading voters to Biden's side.

For example, this CNN survey said only 24% of registered voters who supported Trump said they might consider changing their vote if he was convicted (pg. 4).

[https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24610236/cnn-poll-trump-trial.pdf](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24610236/cnn-poll-trump-trial.pdf)

An ABC News poll had similar results with 16% saying they'd reconsider voting for him and 4% saying they would no longer support him (pg. 2).

[https://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1232a22024Election.pdf](https://www.langerresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/1232a22024Election.pdf)

While these are not overall positive results for Trump, the vast majority of those surveyed said it wouldn't change their vote. 

More important than these polls, however, is the fact that we still have 6 months until the election. This is a lot of time for conservative leaders and media to persuade voters that this trial was a sham and plenty of time for voters to simply forget about Trump's conviction entirely.

Just remember how close to the election the infamous ""grab them by the p\*\*\*y"" tape was and how little it affected either candidates polls (second to last paragraph).

I think this trial's results is more likely to have little effect on the November election, but I would be remiss to not mention the millions of dollars Trump's campaign has raised in the time since the verdict.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/us/politics/trump-fundraising-verdict.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/us/politics/trump-fundraising-verdict.html)

Admittedly, I don't expect a large surge of voters in Trump's favor due to this verdict, but I still think it's more likely than Biden winning in a landslide because of it.

TL;DR

Trump's felony conviction, based on current and 2016 polls, is unlikely to cause a large positive or negative effect. However, it is also more likely to encourage independent voters to vote for Trump than it will to encourage votes for Biden."

I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. I have worked in Democratic politics since 2007. 

I was a contributor to Alvin Bragg‚Äôs Campiagn when he first announced he was running for DA, I am a 32 year old Black Jewish man and a native New Yorker.

Now that you know my background and can infer at least *some* of my priors/biases‚Ä¶

 The trial was completely fair and the case was airtight, but keeping the trial in NYC was a colossal mistake. 

Let‚Äôs imagine Barack Obama, or any Democratic politician, did what Trump did but in Mississippi.  This is a thought experiment, I know the idea of Obama paying hush money to a porn star is ludicrous, put that aside. 

Even if he were clearly guilty, no reasonable person would think Obama would get a fair trial in the Deep South.

My family is from Alabama, our last Democratic Governor, Don Siegelman is a political prisoner because of how the Republicans weaponized the justice system in that state. 

Bill Clinton was not charged with perjury, in large part because of the tremendous damage it would do to the nation and the person nature of his alleged indiscretion.

I think Bragg should have never brought this indictment, but since he did I think Merchan committed a historic error by refusing to allow a change of venue.

I don‚Äôt think this will change any minds, I don‚Äôt think Trump will be imprisoned on these charges, I am said about the state of this country and afraid of what comes next."
195,2024-06-01,CMV: Conservatives shouldn't have a problem with Islam and Muslims in their party because they virtually share the same views.,u/StatisticianGreat514,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d5rgjl/cmv_conservatives_shouldnt_have_a_problem_with/,changemyview,"Ever since 9/11, Conservatives and Republicans in general have waged a constant campaign against both Islam and Muslims as a collective for being supportive of terrorism and every terrible thing in society and that their views are not compatible with society. But I find this ironic because much of their party platform and views are in line with their views.

Both believe in traditional gender roles, traditional marriage, anti-abortion, family values, entrepreneurship, a heavy emphasis on religion in life, and less liberalism. As a matter of fact, many Muslims voted for the Republican presidential candidate during the 2000 election resulting in his win. They voted for him by 70% by the way.

But after 9/11 happened, that support dwindled along with hawkish foreign and domestic policy such as the War in Iraq and Afghanistan affecting them and calling former President Obama as Muslim due to his middle name being Hussein. And there was little-to-no backlash from the party and its supporters. Probably because doing so would be considered woke and politically incorrect. This resulted in them voting Democrat in for the next 20 years in spite of such diametric views because of constant scapegoating from them.

If anything this is an example of why Republicans are the party of Identity Politics and Tribalism. They always like to blame the Left for grouping every single minority group in one box and not allowing them to think for themselves when they are the ones who made them think that way. The same can be said about their views on Blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, and non-Christians in general. Hence, they had no choice but to advocate on each others' behalf due to discrimination from the majority who happen to be White and Christian. Yet all of these groups share the exact same values as they do.

As for Muslims, I'll repeat what I said. It makes no sense why Conservatives and Republicans should demonize Muslims and Islam when they believe in the same thing as they do. In fact, with much of the policy we've seen recently by Republicans in terms of abortion bans, anti-wokeness in terms of promoting LGBTQ content in schools and traditional gender roles and values, they'd be a winner among them. But they only show apathy towards them because doing so would alienate their mostly dumb White Evangelical base, which they view as ""pandering"". And quite honestly, if they do alienate them by courting and promoting Islam and Muslims, it would be better because it'll show that they've been pandered to enough and their holding and privilege in their party is coming to an end. I would like to see that happening. This way I can have the last laugh because their negative reaction will only expose that their party does indeed promote Identity Politics and Tribalism. After all, as I mentioned before, the party is mostly White and Christian with a few token minorities here and there. But hey, what do you expect from the Grand Ole' Projection?"

I think this is the best deal that has a chance of being accepted by both sides. For Hamas, they can avoid complete annihilation as an organisation, which is the alternative if Israel is to continue to the war for another 7 months minimum. For Israel, they can get all the hostages back and Hamas will not be governing Gaza anymore. This is a great deal for both parties and we can avoid further bloodshed in Gaza. And most importantly, this is a deal backed by the US, the most powerful country on Earth. 

If Hamas doesn't accept the deal, then they are just delusional thinking that they can get a better deal in the future or that they can fight Israel out of Gaza.

If Israel doesn't accept the deal, then they never really cared about the hostages in the first place. By the way, Israel's opposition leader, ex-Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and the hostages families are also demanding Bibi to accept the deal, and I think they are right."

By contrast, prohibitions on homosexuality is attributed to only 6 verses, not one of which was directly attributed to Jesus. Traditional Judeo-Christian ethos, is abundantly clear on adultery and infidelity.  And yet, the man  conservatives have overwhelmingly selected to represent their values for the country and world is Trump.

Trump has had an interesting life. While married to his first wife Ivana, he cheated on her with Marla Maples. While married to Maples, he sexually assaulted E. Jean Carroll. After his divorce of Maples and marriage to Melania, he cheated on her with Stormy Daniels about 4 months after Baron was born. In addition, over 20 other women have alleged Trump engaged in sexual harassment or sexual assaults on them. Trump also reportedly flew 7 times on Epstein's notorious private jet. 

If conservatives cared about adultery/infidelity, then I can't see how they would vote for Trump. They would sit out the election instead of trying to employ pragmatic rationales of picking Trump based on how his policies align, or that he is the ""lesser evil"", or some ""greater good"" could be served by his administration. Those who engage in compartmentalization, denial, or deliberate ignorance also lend further evidence to support my arguments, as such defense mechanisms could only be employed if they recognize their political support is incongruent with their purported personal values."

I have really come to deeply appreciate your country for various reasons, I really have, but the biggest deterrent for me right now is the current state of your democracy.

Looking at american politics has me in disarray: I wrote a [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1d0hjap/keeping_up_with_american_politics_takes_a_toll_on/) that unfortunately didn't receive mod approval on r/offmychest going into further ideal, but basically I've come to dislike both parties.

The Republican Party is a sick man: it's too conservative for its own good, its policies are unpopular, under Trump its most extremist members have taken over, and they've been losing ground since before then: California, Colorado, Virginia... I can see them holding onto Texas and North Carolina though. Unless they realign to be more centrist and moderate after either a 2nd Trump Term or a defeat in the upcoming election, they'll just dwindle into irrelevancy by supporting unpopular candidates for the next couple of election cycles, effectively handing over the presidency, congress and perhaps even the senate, more or less temporarily turning the US into a one party state at a federal level.

Moreover, though it might be just because I'm centrist, I have reasons to dislike both parties. I'm generalizing, but overall:

* Democrats US and want to make the country more ""european"". Some good things may come out of this but this mentality would just strip away many things that make the US unique, turning them into somewhat of a nanny state.
* Republicans, on the other hand, seem to have the opposite problem: they chase after an overtly idealized view of the United States that involves socially pushing back the country to the first half of the 20th century.

I believe americans have a set of inalienable rights (both those protected by the constitution, the international declaration of human rights, as well as more... recently conceived rights such as LGBTQ+ rights) that shouldn't be meddled with in any capacity and always be upheld as fundamental for every citizen. Democrats shouldn't mess with the 2nd and, to a lesser extent, the 1st amendment, and I could say the same with Republicans should  abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Moreover, they should ditch the culture war BS and focus on things that actually matter... you know, economic policy, energy policy, foreign policy... a whole of things ending in ""policy"". Republicans as the party of limited government and Democrats as the party of the working masses,  each working for the good of the people in different ways.

Or maybe we should just scale back the federal gov't and just let the states do their own thing idk at this point.

Sorry If my post comes off as ignorant or doomerish, but that's why I came here: to have a change mindset and a reality check.

1. if we make a drug illegal, why would more people do it? during prohibition why did more people become alcoholics? personally if alcohol became illegal tomorrow, then i would listen to the law and just not buy and consume alcohol simple as that. a permanent record is not worth a short term pleasure for me. are most people willing to break the law?

2. if drugs were to be legalised then wouldn‚Äôt everyone be doing them? how would this not pose as a threat to society? there will be little shops on every corner to buy cocaine and weed and now everyone is high and unable to function. unable to work, drive or attend to their kids. they become a possible danger to themselves and others especially if consuming hard drugs. everyone is now damaging their health because of drugs. would making them legal increase the incidence rates of diseases, mental health problems, addiction and mortality?

3. were the laws prohibiting weed back in the nixon era *really* only truly based on racism and economics in the hemp industry? was there truly any concern for health? knowing that at the end of the day, weed is still a drug which will harm your brain and body and put you in danger. 

4. why is it currently an issue to be paying attention to? why is it important to decriminalise drugs and why right now with other things occurring in the world? 

5. is there such thing as a high functioning drug addict/user? i don‚Äôt know if this is what i‚Äôve grown up with personally or if its just the way the world works. but the only exposure i‚Äôve had to drug addicts are junkies on the street or lower class people who don‚Äôt have anything going for them. i personally come from a more sheltered religious background where my parents never even touched a drop of alcohol or did anything of that sort. can we agree that doing drugs will fry your brain regardless of how successful you may be?

One post read, ""A lot of my peers, friends & family haven't said one thing about Gaza or Sudan or any of the fucked up things going on in the world. It has been 233 days of ongoing slaughter but you are all so worried about what people might think of you. So focused on your travels, parties, red carpets, money and designer shit but show zero concern for humanity.
I won't say anything to any of you individually but just know I'm very disappointed. If you feel like I'm talking to you, I am. You should be disappointed in yourselves. To be so wrapped up in your own life and so worried about your contracts and social media collaborations and what you might not get invited to if you show support for people who CAN NOT DEFEND THEMSELVES is so priveliged of you.
I'm not saying stop your lives but acting like you don't care is gross. Unfollow me or think what you want but remember that karma is real and God, Allah, our creator sees how you continue to turn the other cheek.""

Okay so this is my view. It's completely selfish and self centered to condemn those who don't feel the need to give their energy to something they don't know/care much about. There's conflicts going on all across the world the many people aren't talking about. The Uyghur genocide, Russia ukraine, South Africa,.. you name it. So many examples of ""children being slaughtered"" that's not specific to what's going on in Gaza. Now I'm not trying to say that it's not a tragedy or doesn't matter but for the person that condemns others for not speaking out, are you giving that same energy to those other conflicts as well? And if not wouldn't that make you just as bad? The point is that EVERYONE picks and chooses what issues they care about that affects them and that's within their proximity. Expecting someone else to virtue signal about a situation that they don't care much about just because it's something you care about is pretty selfish in my view ."

Seinfeld on the other hand is legitimately funny. There are a number of catch phrases that still tickle the funny bone today. (Think ‚Äúno soup for you!) It‚Äôs humour has stood the test of time.

I hate that, I want to be the guy who is terrible at sex but has gotten a bunch.

I‚Äôm a 28yo virgin. I don‚Äôt care how desirable I am, as I see it a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. The only people who care how desirable they are, are really insecure and immature people. These people likely have never had sex and are trying to cope with their failure in life by appealing to some kind of unrealized potential to have sex. But it‚Äôs just a fantasy. If you‚Äôre so desirable just have sex and brag about that instead.

Let‚Äôs demonstrate with an example. There‚Äôs a guy named Nick the narcissist. Nick lost his virginity at age 18, every year he had sex with another woman. After having sex a few times with the girl he lost his virginity to, he decided he was just the hottest shit out there. Everything he learned was exclusive to the first girl he slept with, and even with her the sex was mid. But he has the confidence and gets laid every year. Every year he thinks he did super great but he actually was a horrible partner. He has the confidence, he‚Äôs self assured and that makes him happy. And he‚Äôs had sex with a ton of women. He doesn‚Äôt need to be desirable. 

It‚Äôs infinitely better to be Nick the narcissist than a 28yo guy who is a virgin, not confident in himself, but once he does have sex he will be super good at it. 

You don‚Äôt even get anything from being good at sex as an adult. In high school girls will tell each other you are good at sex and you‚Äôll get lots of sex partners but that‚Äôs just a high school thing. After high school you get nothing, what are you looking for a participation trophy, hehe you haven‚Äôt even participated *spits in your face and laughs*. 

I think women are right when they say that the 28yo virgin is more desirable. But that should not make any 28yo virgin feel better, desirability means nothing. Nick the narcissist has had an objectively better life and there‚Äôs not really a debate on it. Nick the narcissist will have ten more sex partners in the next ten years and if the virgin loses it immediately he will have one sex partner in the next ten years. You‚Äôve already lost if you‚Äôre the virgin."

Trump will either formally withdraw the US from NATO (as his former advisers such as John Bolton insist he wishes to do) or will do so via the back door by saying he won't authorize US defence of some/all NATO countries (as Trump has said himself).

US withdrawal from NATO means the US will violate the implicit deal that's been in place for the last 75 years: no need for your own nukes as the US nuclear umbrella will protect all NATO allies. 

Faced with a nuclear-armed Russia, European states will have no choice but to create their own nuclear deterrent. Only nuclear weapons guarantee against invasion.  

Non-NATO American allies like Japan and South Korea will need to go nuclear as well.  If the US can turn its back on Europe there's no reason to believe it won't also betray other allies. Simply put, confidence in the word of the United States will be broken.

- Convince me Trump won't abandon the US's treaty committments to its allies

I have ADD. I was diagnosed as a child and I‚Äôve lived with it for most of my life. My mother has issues with anxiety, depression, and hoarding. My sisters struggle with the former two. None of us, however, *identify* with our illnesses to the extent that we turn it into a personality trait. We‚Äôre shaped by it but we are not *it*. This is where I think there‚Äôs a problem today. People are becoming tribal around the ideas of mental illness. Autism, ADHD, Bipolar, Anxiety, Tourettes, the more the concepts and language of academic psychology and psychiatry bleed into everyday life, the more people are going to construct their identities around it.

But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs healthy. I‚Äôm sure there will be plenty of people who respond to this who will say they‚Äôve found community, connection and understanding through meeting/talking to others who share their illness. But when something as expansive yet also nebulous as mental illness is gets boiled down to 30 second tiktok video, we‚Äôre risking over expanding the definitions of illness so that they‚Äôre otherwise meaningless. Take a look at r/adhd for example. I‚Äôm a member of that group but I don‚Äôt frequent it often because the sheer amount of things people attribute to their ADD is ridiculous.

That‚Äôs a crude parody but it gets my point across. People are associating things to mental illness that are just normal human likes/dislikes. Yes, people don‚Äôt like doing laundry or brushing/flossing their teeth. Nobody, unless you love the sensation of floss on gum, enjoys doing chores. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre called chores. If they were fun to do we‚Äôd call them ‚Äúfun tasks‚Äù. But associating the dislike of chores as something inherent to ADHD is silly but when you take an idea like that, throw it into a lively internet community and combine it with the human desire to understand themselves or find a roadmap to building an identity you begin to the same ‚Äútrait‚Äù adopted by others.

Most ‚Äúneurodivergent‚Äù brains show no major differences from other humans brains. There are no ‚Äúdepression fingerprints‚Äù on the brain that allow people to identify a brain that has depression from a brain that doesn‚Äôt. The same principle applies to all other mental illnesses. It differs from person to person to person who are in turned shaped by their family, culture, and upbringing. But people want that roadmap so they‚Äôll flatten that wide expanse into a flat binary of ‚ÄúADHD‚Äù and ‚ÄúNON-ADHD‚Äù. Take the DSM for example, they tried to eliminate the diagnosis of aspergers and combine it with autism if I remember correctly but when people who‚Äôd identified as being ‚ÄúASPIES‚Äù found out, they howled in protest at their erasure.

But, unfortunately, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anyway to avoid this. The more we talk about something, the more we lower the barrier for entry. The more we lower the barrier, the more people can glom onto it for identity building. Kind of like the kids who, when I was a young, would fake cut marks on themselves to seem edgy and for personality fodder. But now we get it for every mental illness imaginable. To add a final point to this, I think the minute we start making other people‚Äôs symptoms iron laws for our own personalities is the minute we begin to limit and create reasons for why we ‚Äúcan‚Äôt‚Äù do something. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I was diagnosed as a child and I‚Äôve lived with it for most of my life. My mother has issues with anxiety, depression, and hoarding. My sisters struggle with the former two. None of us, however, *identify* with our illnesses to the extent that we turn it into a personality trait. We‚Äôre shaped by it but we are not *it*. This is where I think there‚Äôs a problem today. People are becoming tribal around the ideas of mental illness. Autism, ADHD, Bipolar, Anxiety, Tourettes, the more the concepts and language of academic psychology and psychiatry bleed into everyday life, the more people are going to construct their identities around it.

I don‚Äôt love that but I understand where it comes from. 

But if we go into interpersonal experiences, if you‚Äôre being a jerk to people because they‚Äôre white, the fact that people who share your skin colour experienced racism in the past isn‚Äôt license for you to be a racist today. 

I‚Äôm of British descent. I don‚Äôt think it would be acceptable of me to be an ass towards random Germans and just expect them to accept it because of WW2. I actually don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs ok. Will I crack a Germany joke now and again? Sure, in good fun and not to a German. But I can‚Äôt just use the ‚Äúyour grandparents would have done bad things to me‚Äù excuse to be a dick to them. 

I think historic racism and sexism, and even ongoing racism and sexism, are obviously bad. But whether there is or isn‚Äôt some ethereal power dynamic difference between us at a macro level does not give you free reign to be a bigot towards people regardless of how they are as an individual. Like you can‚Äôt be calling your white progressive friends crackers and then defending that by saying ‚Äúwell, through the lens of historic oppression and privilege‚Ä¶‚Äù

No. You‚Äôre making it clear to all of us that you‚Äôre a racist who wants a shield to be a racist. You‚Äôre not mad that society was historically racist, you‚Äôre only mad it was racist against people like you. There‚Äôs a huge difference between being an egalitarian versus being a ‚Äútemporarily embarrassed racist‚Äù (to turn a phrase). "

Oftentimes I will hear people excuse the crimes of musicians (and to a lesser extent, other artists; I'm looking at you Burroughs you uxoricidal piece of shit) because of their talent and/or influence on their artform or genre. People excuse Kanye and Dimebag for being neonazis, Michael Jackson or Jerry Lee Lewis for being pedophiles, Lennon and Diddy for being wife-beaters, Cobain and Clapton for being drug addicts, Elvis and Oasis for their plagiarism, the list goes on.

And then we have Ronald James Padavona, a man without whom heavy metal would be unrecognizable. **The** international symbol of metal, the horns (\\m/) came from him. Heavy metal's obsession with fantasy and mythological imagery came from him. Half of the vocal style of heavy metal comes from him. He bridged the metal and hard rock cultures of America and Europe, and most importantly he was a tremendous, multi-instrumentalist musician packed into a fun-sized gnomish form... and he did this without hurting a hair on anyone's head, breaking any laws, infringing on anyone's freedoms or letting himself be controlled by any gods, governments or substances. He spent his life faithful to his wife, and together when he wasn't belting out *Holy Diver* he was founding charities to help the homeless at home and feed starving people abroad. Also, I'd go so far as to say he was a great yet nontraditional masculine [rolemodel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XimhI3TvUIg) for impressionable boys up until his death.

Dio's influence stands as an intense counterpart to the notion of the ""tortured artist""; that to produce art great enough to define a genre, especially in music, **especially** in the tumultuous time of the 1970s and 80s, one had to be a deeply flawed individual, or otherwise commit acts of personal or social transgression.

My view can be changed in two ways

1) Provide evidence for another musician who had a greater influence on music and/or their genre who adhered to the same moral standards as Dio (as observed from the position of a 21st century westerner, at least)

2) Provide evidence that Dio was less than the unassailable figure of moral strength"

Couples fresh out of high school with no career paths lined up, raising children in cramped apartments, relying on social programs and government handouts to supplement what they can't provide? 

  Why would you want your children to grow up with less opportunity than what they should be afforded? It's especially distasteful considering the state of our economic climate.

 It's not fair to the parents as the responsibility of parenthood adds a lot of stress on a person, and couple that with you not even having the means to comfortably afford the time or money it costs. It's not fair to the children either because your stress, lack of time, and lack of financial means will effect their upbringing and available opportunities. 

 Some of these kids grow up to overcome these obstacles, but they're the exception and not the rule. I think it should be more common to shame this practice because it seems like it's more than accepted by society. "

I look around at college football today and I‚Äôm just utterly shocked at what it is. I‚Äôm really not that old and I didn‚Äôt get into watching college football until I was in high school (only about 10 years ago), but even in that time frame, there has been so much change that it almost feels like it‚Äôs not worth it anymore. 

1. Conference realignment. For anyone unaware, Texas and Oklahoma left the Big 12 for the SEC, most likely for larger revenue streams and ‚Äúmore guaranteed post season access‚Äù. That meant the Big 10 had to grab Oregon Washington UCLA and USC and Cal and Stanford are now playing in the Atlantic Coast Conference with new arrival Southern Methodist (who are in Dallas), effectively killing a conference that has been around for almost a century. 

I want to watch rivalry games that matter. I want to see the passion the fans have when Oklahoma faces Oklahoma State or Oregon and Oregon State face off. I want the regular season to actually mean something, give teams and alumni and fans regional bragging rights over their conference mates. Century old rivalries have been splintered without a second thought. The Miami Hurricanes of Florida are going to Berkeley CA for an IN CONFERENCE match up. USC in downtown Los Angeles are hosting Rutgers, who‚Äôs campus is 30 minutes from Times Square, in an IN CONFERENCE match up. It‚Äôs ridiculous, it‚Äôs enraging, but it‚Äôs not at all entertaining. The pageantry and tradition that the game is known for has been watered down and made Disney safe at the cost of losing part of the identity of the sport.  

2. Everything is becoming about the post season. I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Josh Pate, but he has a really good view on this. Some programs just aren‚Äôt meant to be national championship contenders and are instead just supposed to focus on the regular season games. Only the top of the top, the best of the best should get to play for a title, and while I acknowledge that there are teams that got screwed out of contention in the past, how is this new post season going to be any better? Coaches will start benching players during the end of the season when they know they have a playoff spot secured just to guarantee longer rest before the playoffs. 

3. The excess in commercials and marketing has my head spinning. The head of the SEC stated at the spring meetings that teams may need to start looking into on field branding or jersey patches. They are actively turning the game into a walking advertisement. Increased ads turning games are turning them into 4 hour slog fests, and while I would love to watch my team on tv and support, I almost can‚Äôt justify that time anymore. 

4. This isn‚Äôt about the students anymore. I‚Äôm not sure that it ever was, but it was nice when everyone was at least still trying to pretend. There are guys that are making more money right now as college athletes than they will at the highest level in the NFL. I‚Äôm glad the players are getting paid, the fact they weren‚Äôt before was highly exploitative. But now it feels like the best are going to get better and everyone else just has to be ok with them being left behind. The sports betting scene has death threats being sent to athletes on a weekly basis during the season. 

Again, I‚Äôm looking for reasons to watch again. I‚Äôm trying to find the fun in the game and experience again and I just haven‚Äôt been able to find it myself"

A term used by minorities, particularly the Black community when they their own kind who votes Republican instead of Democrat? It's basically a ""Self-Hating Person"" or ""Race Traitor"". When that term is used, Conservatives (White Conservatives in particular) get offended and criticize them for being racist for letting them think one way. 

But a lot of Conservatives fail to realize that they use very similar terminology to describe Whites who vote Democrat as well as towards White Conservatives who have Moderate views on certain Social Issues such as Race, Religion, Gender, Sexuality, and Immigration. Examples include ""Cuck"", ""Beta Male"", ""Soy Boy"", ""Girly Boy"", ""Coal Burner"", ""Mud Shark"", and ""Oil Driller"". The first term is the most common among them. Some people have stated that these are Alt-Right terms and that they are not common among Conservatives. But if you check out the comments section on outlets like Breitbart, Fox News, etc., they use those terms a lot to describe any White who they see as Self-Hating, having so-called ""White Guilt"", and voting Democrat. In simple terms, they use these terms to describe a Woke White Leftist. It also has been used to describe any White Conservative pushing a diversity agenda or so-called ""pandering"" as they see it. 

Reading these comments, I can't help but wonder the hilarious and hypocritical irony behind this. As they use these terms, I wonder if these are the same people who take issue when minorities use the term ""Uncle Tom"" for pretty much the exact same reasons they use those words for. Putting down their own race in order to get approval from others. If so, they need some self-reflection. Furthermore, the fact that they get offended by terms such as ""Uncle Tom"" and other similar terminology like ""Coon"", ""Oreo"", and ""Coconut"" goes against their beliefs that the Left are snowflakes who want to be politically correct. 

If you don't believe me, here's an article from a Right-Wing News Outlet that covers the term. The author and commentators (before they got locked) even admitted that the word ""Cuck"" is a White Uncle Tom.

0,2024-06-02,"CMV: If I had to choose, Democrats are worse than Republicans.",u/anonmonagomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d65mha/cmv_if_i_had_to_choose_democrats_are_worse_than/,changemyview,"I have been on the fence for years watching and listening to both sides. I have family and friends on both sides. I see what lives they lead and how their decisions effect their livelihood. I am a minority that lives in a democrat dominated city for the last 70 years. I see good and bad in both sides but I would like to be convinced if my experience has not been genuine.

This has nothing to do with voting or our political leaders. I am strictly talking about the people who vote for Democrats or Republicans. I have never voted and don't plan to this election. Neither candidates are good people nor do they have the interests of the people in mind. But I digress and onward to the meat of the topic. This is strictly about the everyday people who identify as democrat and republican.

Democrats largely claim they are more educated and provide stats to back up said claim. Yet they are generally more in debt compared to Republicans and can barely make ends meet despite their degrees. Degrees in which net you a job that pay less than many occupations that do not require a degree at all. Most democrat high schools have a drop out rate of nearly 50%. On top of that 50%, their graduation rate for public high schools are just above 50%. Suburban red voting areas have much harder curriculums and their high schools have an above 90% graduation rate. It's general consensus among people to choose to pay extra money to send their children out of the democrat city and into suburban school districts to get a better education. On top of that, democrat public schools have high crime and sending a child to a suburban school is far safer.

Democrats push no cash bail policies to set free people who should be detained and then get upset that crime has risen. Democrats then pull stats to claim crime is actually down when the police departments have openly stated they no longer keep track of certain crimes due to the no cash bail policies thus manipulating the data. Crime happens whether it is documented or not and given the defund the police movement, democrats are for the majority against law enforcement and choose not to call when something happens. Or If they do, they do so reluctantly. Its hypocritical, when you see democrats so against police but deny those resources to the people who really need it by defunding it. Generally democrats are against guns. Yet when comparing crime stats over the latest voting maps, it would show over 90% of all gun crimes happen in blue voting areas. The surrounding red counties have an above 80% gun ownership and virtually is gun incident free. 

When it comes to public interactions, democrats tend to base their response on their emotions or how they feel as opposed to collecting their thoughts and responding logically. Democrats are generally more violent or will resort to violence if they do not get their way. People cite jan 6th as the end all be all of all violent riots but democrats funded and pushed the country wide riots in 2020 and formed CHAZ and CHOP zones in Seattle and Portland. Democrats form blockades and disrupt people and claim its a 1st amendment right when it absolutely is not.

When it comes to fiscal responsibilities, democrats are hands down the most irresponsible. They make up the vast majority of criminals, homeless, and unemployed. People will cite statistics but your own eyes tell you everything when you walk out onto the street. While some democrats who do manage to make a high income, they are completely irresponsible with that money. They spend well beyond their means and purchase things for sake of it. Even coming down to family and friends who are democrat, they are all struggling, poor, and barely getting by despite making above the means to pay their monthly bills.

Lastly, the mentality of democrats. They are defiant and disingenuous. They expect everyone else to do the work and expect to recieve half the spoils. It is never a democrats fault, it is always everyone else's. They do not stay firm to one belief. As soon as another belief comes by that provides them a better opportunity to personally benefit them, then they will shift. There is very little they stand for and will argue to the very end if you as so much question an ounce of their position. When political division rose to a boiling point in 2016, the only people who were cutting people out of their life were democrats claiming they don't want to associate with right leaning individuals when in reality they meant they only wanted to stay in contact with people in the same think tank. Forcing yourself into an echo chamber makes them extremely close minded. That's how the Republicans got trumpers.

Sorry for the long post but I'll end it here. I'm not saying Republicans are great because they absolutely are not. They are rough around the edges and hold some bigotry in some form or another. But they largely keep to themselves and tend to their responsibilities. Democrats tend to lash out and get involved in everything regardles if we like it or not. Now I'm not religious in the slightest but generally democrats are anti religion and get upset that religion tells people what to do. On the other side of that coin, democrats love telling everyone what to do and conform to their way of life.

So if I had to choose, democrats are worse than republicans. Sorry if you feel attacked but I genuinely do not mean to offend anyone. If I am wrong in many or all of my observations please feel free to CMV."
0,2024-06-02,CMV: The fact that Hamas leadership is in Qatar is irrelevant,u/BoysenberryLanky6112,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d668ii/cmv_the_fact_that_hamas_leadership_is_in_qatar_is/,changemyview,"We all know that Hamas, radical Islam, terrorism, whatever you want to call the ideology will never die. People worldwide left comfortable middle-class lifestyles to join ISIS, and there's no shortage of people who are looking for meaning in life and think they've found it in a death cult. But the true threat of Hamas or ISIS or the Taliban, or any extremist terrorist group, is their military capacity and the capacity of the boots on the ground.  


  
Especially given American support for Israel, the Hamas leaders in Qatar would like nothing more than to conduct successful terrorist attacks on US soil. Yet to my knowledge, they've been unable to do anything on US soil. Meanwhile obviously in Palestine they've been very successful at organizing attacks. My view is that the reason they've been successful in Palestine and not in the US is because the leadership is actually pretty irrelevant and the important part is having the boots on the ground and the trained organized fighting forces within the country. Therefore if Israel can eliminate the boots on the ground fighting forces in Palestine, even if they can't get at the leaders and masterminds of the attack who reside in Qatar, they will have done all they need to do, and can hopefully be in a similar state as the US is today with regards to Hamas. The leadership wants to do stuff, but without the organizational capacity on the ground they have no power to carry out the attacks. They don't dare launch rockets from Qatar right?  


  
Now one argument I can see is obviously there are more Palestinians willing to turn to terrorism against Israel than there are Americans (or Mexicans or Canadians) against the US. But in that case what value does Hamas leadership even provide? It's not like most Hamas attacks are all that complex, they generally just launch rockets at civilian areas hoping to kill civilians. Is there anything the Hamas leaders in Qatar bring to the table in terms of training people for terrorist attacks that you can't find on the internet? I guess in theory they could help coordinate attacks between different terrorist groups, but they clearly showed on 10/7 they were incapable of that since their goal was to get other groups involved and for the most part the other groups were like ""nah we're good"". So I'm struggling to see what taking out Hamas leaders in Qatar would even accomplish? My view is their goal of taking out military capacity within Palestine is a sufficient goal, and their leadership in Qatar is a bit of a red herring. Can someone change my view? I'll admit I don't have a super good understanding of how Hamas operates so I definitely could be wrong. It just seems the ""Hamas leadership is in Qatar not Palestine therefore Israel can never destroy Hamas therefore they shouldn't even try to take out the Hamas fighters in Palestine"" is a common reddit talking point, and I'm not sure that's true."

I believe this due to ingredients listed on the back of conditioners, shampoos and other hair products that I've read.

I often see things like alcohol included. This, dries out things, not exempting hair.

Also, because, I know something about marketing and how advanced it has become, by now, I hold the view that I do. It has become incredibly effective in convincing people to buy, buy, buy and also, to revel in your purchases and laud those who have the advantage of high level purchasing powers.

And I realized I that I‚Äôd noticed a trend online of calling all non-consensual sex ‚Äúrape‚Äù.

Maybe it‚Äôs a trend of online spaces getting more radicalized or maybe I simply spend too much time on the internet but hear me out:

I‚Äôm going to setup a title with a catch-all term and then provide: intent, action, consequence, and a resulting, likely, legal verdict.

Title: Man shoots neighbor.

1) Intent: man wanted to kill neighbor over fence dispute
Action: man shoots neighbor
Consequence: neighbor dies
Verdict: murder

2) Intent: neighbor asks man to assist in his suicide
Action: man shoots neighbor
Consequence: neighbor dies
Verdict: manslaughter/ assisted suicide

3) Intent: man wanted to kill neighbor over fence dispute
Action: man shoots neighbor
Consequence: neighbor is injured but lives
Verdict: attempted murder

In each scenario despite the Action remaining the same the verdict, and legal sentencing/ repercussion, changes with it.

Now I understand the catch-all headline is meant for click engagement. But if you read the linked article it never, until the end quote, specifies that the ‚Äúrape‚Äù that occurred wasn‚Äôt one of force but on of legal non consent.

And I feel the same way if in scenario 2 of my example the written article would‚Äôve said the man murdered his neighbor.

There‚Äôs a reason different words exist and convey different things. 

TL;DR: when trying to convey information be distinct in your word usage.

One criticism I often see is that Messianic Jews are just trying to trick jews into following Jesus, but that's not true; Messianic Jews genuinely believe what they believe about elements like dietary laws or the Sabbath, and saying they're just trying to trick people is as silly as saying Muslims or Mormons are just trying to trick people. A religion might be, in a sense, artificially constructed in its origins, but that doesn't make it less real to its followers; and gatekeeping religious sects in this way is pointless. One criticism I *do* agree with is that, for the most part, Messianic ""Jews"" aren't real Jews, but that's a separate issue entirely; one can sincerely hold stupid beliefs."

0,2024-06-02,CMV: Computing Will Soon Be Able To Simulate The Human Brain (And AI will be Indistinguishable from Human Intelligence),u/Andy_Razzmatazz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d6bikn/cmv_computing_will_soon_be_able_to_simulate_the/,changemyview,"With the major advances in all fields of Computer Science, most notably in Deep Learning (e.g. LLMs like ChatGPT) and Integrated Chip Design (e.g. NVIDIA GPUs), we are seeing that much of the earlier hype surrounding Artificial Intelligence is actually bearing fruit. 

*Point 1*: **A computer simulation of the human brain will be possible in our lifetimes.**

With deep learning and human brains basically being functionally the same at the microscopic level‚Äîperceptrons being the computer analog of the biological neuron‚Äîit seems that there really is only two things preventing an accurate simulation of the human brain:

* Computing Power\*: The human brain has approximately 86 billion neurons that form 100 trillion connections. However, the [nerves impulses are very slow](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_conduction_velocity&ved=2ahUKEwia8PLA6LyGAxWJoK8BHUg_DpgQFnoECBQQAw&usg=AOvVaw1rpTlDABoEwWTVfkbarz01) compared to the speed of the electric field, which constitutes as an advantage for computing. In [his book](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.amazon.com/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/0143124048&ved=2ahUKEwiHkZaP6byGAxU_efUHHW7iCkEQFnoECDEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3I0tb-rHOFaMoWOu_0pZoQ), author Ray Kurzweil estimates that 10\^17 bytes of memory and a computing speed of about 1 exaFLOP (10\^18 FLOPS) is needed to model the human brain, ignoring other biological parts of the brain. The fastest supercomputer in the world, [the Frontier](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_(supercomputer)&ved=2ahUKEwj88tSg6byGAxWKhq8BHdEuISsQFnoECBUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2rAaLpy31t0YrTF34Nn1_9), is capable of about 1.102 exaFLOPs. Even assuming a less optimistic version of Moore's Law‚Äîsteady increase, it seems that computing power will soon be sufficient.
* Accurate Training Data\*: While the human experience is obviously very complicated, the rule of thumb for the data required to accurately train an AI model is about [10 times or more examples than features](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.akkio.com/post/how-much-data-is-required-to-train-ml&ved=2ahUKEwj__7nj57yGAxWebvUHHSeLPJkQFnoECBUQAw&usg=AOvVaw1Z1QN26r_mp8B_OfgupDLE). Though this seems to be a bigger problem as accurately collecting data to prevent overfitting will likely be difficult, I'm optimistic that current neuroimaging technologies should be sufficient to collect the necessary data.

That's *Point 1*: **A computer simulation of the human brain will be possible in our lifetimes.**  
><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

Point 2: **Once the human brain is successfully simulated, Artificial Intelligence will be indistinguishable from Human Intelligence. And humans will just be a costlier version of AI.**

This is obviously a lot more philosophical\* than Point 1, but also a lot more important. For many, the complexity of the human is a strong supporting point for the ""we are [more than just the sum of our parts](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://theotherjournal.com/2014/05/when-the-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts/&ved=2ahUKEwj044qb67yGAxVfk68BHZWZDn4QFnoECCEQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2C0-OyWwZEAsIojzbA625G)"" viewpoint of human existence. However, with AI being able to simulate the brain, arguably the most complex biological aspect of the human, it seems that our biggest source of incomprehension will soon be made clear. And by extension, it seems that [eliminative materialism](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://philpapers.org/browse/eliminative-materialism&ved=2ahUKEwiPzp6x67yGAxWWbPUHHbRyIgcQFnoECBMQAw&usg=AOvVaw3eRlRyj_BWFfuEBPW1AqWh)‚Äîthe idea that usual psychological notions and categories of mental states are empty of any objective basis‚Äîis becoming an increasingly appealing view of the world. All of this should not be surprising, the human brain/mind is intrinsically deterministic, it's only that we lacked the knowledge to truly comprehend it before.

><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

To summarize, these are my two views: 

*Point 1*: **A computer simulation of the human brain will be possible in our lifetimes.**

*Point 2*: **Once the human brain is successfully simulated, Artificial Intelligence will be indistinguishable from Human Intelligence. And humans will just be a costlier version of AI.**

It appears to me that the more streaming platforms get popular and entrenched, the more they produce low bar films and the more it's becoming less worth to subscribe to these platforms. 

I agree that my taste may be different from.other people's taste but still to even get something that comes close to what you like is reallly really hard these days especially on Netflix.

The second being that your average woman is much closer to conventional attractiveness and what men desire in women than vice versa.

Point number one. For women a lot of what makes a woman attractive to men are things that can be changed. Weight, hair, skin, youthful appearance etc. all of which, with the help of a diet and modern cosmetologically advancements, is not overly difficult. A heavy woman can in most cases easily lose weight with proper diet, the rest can be handled just by putting on the correct makeup.  It also significantly helps that men are not as scrutinizing as women when it comes to this. For men, the things that make a man, are mostly immutable characteristics. His jawline, his eyes, facial hair, things like that. None of which can be changed. It's all permenant. The biggest one of course being height, which feeds into my next point. Studies have found that women are happiest when a man is 8 inches taller than her. That means for your average 5'4 woman, her ideal height is probably 6'. The average man is 5'8, so on average the average man is shorter than ideal for your average woman.

For men, the ideal height is under 5'7, which most women are since the avwerage woman is 5'4, means  most women fit the man's ideal height. Even beyond this, the average woman is a lot closer to conventional beauty compared to men. Don't believe me, take a look at national symbol of beauty, [Sidney Sweeny](https://x.com/bankaikokujo/status/1766884511214645752). Don't get me wrong, she's cute. But she looks like a woman you could see at walmart. But through some makeup and nice hair lighting she's now on another level of beauty. I'd think this is possible for most women to level up"

Lastly, the charges against Trump are EXTREMELY obscure, and unprecedented.

However hybrid conscription, volunteer based military doesn't work. The draft isn't just something you do, it's special, that's why there is so much draft dodging. 

A simple solution is peacetime conscription. Now sending every 18 year old to fight won't be well received. So this isn't traditional conscription, people who volunteer will be payed more and put into regular service. The conscripts will get basic military education, and will be put into the reserves.

This means that in war time there are millions of pre-trained soldiers who know military discipline. This would also mean that if there were any particularly comptent people who didn't want to become soldiers, they could be offered to stay in the military long term."

So the left argues that the rich is terrified of falling global fertility and things like the 4B movement because that means they will have less ""slaves"" as these lefties put it and less consumers to buy their product.

This is one of those platitudes that sounds epic when you read it on reddit but makes no sense if you think about it for a few minutes. The rebuttals to this argument are as such

  
1: The Rich are overwhelmingly pro choice 

[https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/)

This poll says that college grad and ""college grad+"" support abortion more then people who didn't go to college. The average college grad makes way more then the average person who didn't go to college. College beyond a bachelor's even more so. 

  
2: Look how many companies subsidize abortion for their employees

[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abortion-travel-companies-paying-benefits-amazon-starbucks-target/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abortion-travel-companies-paying-benefits-amazon-starbucks-target/)

Look at all these companies, it is basically every big company. Some even pay for the abortion straight up and have funding for birth control. 

  
3: The rich don't need births to keep their labor force steady, they have immigration which once again the rich overwhelmingly support. Countries in Africa and the middle East will never stop having kids. I think in Afghanistan 95% of women support wife beating, not 95% of men or 95% of people 95% of women, you think those women will ever join the 4B movement ? 

I admit I kept the point simple and sweeet and have more evidence I could share so I am curios what you think. I think what we see here is the result of the left's absolutist one struggle rhetoric. Even as a lefty this was always something I disliked about the left. This insistence that every single cause they advocate for is somehow connected and it always leads to incoherent rhetoric like this. "

When you are in your 20s, your brain is undeveloped, you often still live with parents or other guardians, and your maturity can often be lacking. In other words, you are an adult in legal terms only.

Any romantic activity -- going on dates, texting and calling crushes or boyfriends/girlfriends, having sex -- is a liability at this age, not a plus. I cannot tell you how many times I've seen teens and early 20-somethings buried in their phone, giggling at texts from so-and-so, when that time could have gone to bettering themselves, building a business, pursuing passions.

Romance and sex can wait. It's not going anywhere, and once you turn 28-30, you have a much more stable mind and life to begin pursuing dating. You've earned the right to pursue frivolous activities because you've earned it.

Edit: And before the ""it's an emotional need!"" comments begin, romance is not a need. Socialization? Sure, which can be accomplished with friends, family, community. Romance is a want, one that should be pursued in later life."

As I understand it, the ideal application of the concept of cultural appropriation is when someone from a more dominant culture takes something important/sacred from a less dominant culture, but divorces it from its original context and in the process creates widespread misinformation that the less dominant culture might never get much of a chance to correct. For me, the classic example is [feathered war bonnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bonnet) of the Plains indian tribes, which are like a Medal of Honor in that culture and which Euro-American people sometimes turn into costumes without understanding that they're essentially engaging in an act of stolen valor.

But I think when people apply the concept to less central cultural signifiers, like non-sacred, non-honorary clothes and foods, the concept of cultural appropriation loses almost all force and meaning, and might even veer into a sort of racism or ideal of ethnic purity in the process.

The history of humanity is the history of one people borrowing ideas from another people, over and over again. The ""Euro-American"" numeral system is Hindu-Arabic in origin, our K-12 mass education system is Prussian in origin, our university system is Medieval and Christian in origin, our system of mass testing is inspired by cultural contact with China and its Confucian testing system for officials. When it comes to food, every dish made from corn (maize) or New World spices is ""foreign"" to European American culture, but few could consider grits or corn bread or popcorn to be ""cultural appropriation"" because it doesn't make sense to consider an entire food as cultural appropriation in all its uses.

I just don't get where it's supposed to end. Why is it some huge outrage that Starbucks is putting pearls into its drinks, and not telling people about the long history of tapioca drink pearls in several Asian cultures? Should every popcorn place explain how Anglo-Americans first encountered about maize, and explain that popcorn predates European contact with the Americas? It just seems silly.

0,2024-06-02,"CMV: White People can be Uncle Toms, too. And White Conservatives should start using such terms to combat Anti-White Rhetoric.",u/StatisticianGreat514,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d6h20q/cmv_white_people_can_be_uncle_toms_too_and_white/,changemyview,"I've been seeing a lot of posts on Reddit complaining about how White people are being demonized in society.¬†

Judging by these posts, it's obvious that they were written by Conservatives, particularly White Conservatives in general considering a lot of the content that's being written here lately is mostly Conservative in nature and the fact that White people for the most part are Conservatives. In fact, they're the only demographic that mostly leans that way. Not to mention, Anti-White Racism is the only form of Racism that Conservatives fight against. Not so much the other ones, except for Jews. In these posts, they highlight how Whites are being mocked, discriminated, and becoming victims of various forms of racism both openly and discretely in terms of verbal and systematic ways. And that it's White Liberals who are constantly tearing them down along with themselves down in every way possible.

All I can say is that by reading these posts, it got me thinking about something. I wonder if these people who wrote these posts expressing their grievances now realize why Black Conservatives are called Uncle Toms by other Black people. It's because they constantly tear down their own race in order to elevate their status among others. This is the exact same reason these posts that I listed here are addressing.

So here's a little word of advice that I, a Non-White, Non-Conservative person, would want to advise them. I want you to start using the term Uncle Tom to combat all the Anti-White rhetoric against you and use it against the Self-Hating Woke White Leftists who are enabling them. Better yet, use the word Cuck to show Distinction because Uncle Tom already has been taken. Similar terms include Coconut for Hispanics and South Asians, Banana for East Asians, Pick-Me for Women, Simp for Men, and Kapo for Jews. The last two terms in particularly are used by the Right to describe Emasculated Men and Jews who aren't too supportive of Israel. Even other Jews use the word Kapo as well to describe them.

Trust me, there's nothing wrong with saying terms such as Uncle Tom and Cuck. It's not racist or bigoted. It's politically incorrect. It's the language you guys speak, isn't it? You constantly complain and mock White Guilt, so when you use these terms, you're sending a message that you have a sense of Self-Esteem, Dignity, and Respect and that there's nothing for you to feel guilty about. And while you're at it, I hope you to apologize to every single Black person who you accused of racism for calling their own kind who vote Conservative as Uncle Tom because they had a point. If there's anything we can agree on, it's this: Putting down your own race in order to gain approval from others is not cool. Doesn't matter if you're Black or White, Majority or Minority.

Go on, say it. I dare you. I'm being serious. This message is not to be taken lightly. It's meant to be taken seriously. After all, we're not supposed to be politically correct, right? Yeah, that's right. Now, go say Uncle Tom and Cuck to the Self-Hating Whites who are enabling Anti-White Racism. Otherwise, your lives will continue to be a living hell thanks to them."

323,2024-06-02,CMV: The only requirement to celebrating pride is being a proud LGBTQ+ person or a straight ally with no other political stances unrelated to lgbtq rights being necessary.,u/redditordeaditor6789,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d6iy5e/cmv_the_only_requirement_to_celebrating_pride_is/,changemyview,"It's pride month. I am a gay man. I'll see posts and such from friends along the lines of ""You can't celebrate pride if you're not against Israel in their conflict with Gaza. You can't celebrate pride if you don't believe in BLM.""

I personally believe both those things. But I think it's dumb to gatekeep pride with sentiments like that. That you're not allowed to celebrate pride if you're not in lockstep with other political causes. I think that logic is wrong. Here is my reasoning. 

1. You can say it's about ""gay people's protest against oppressor so that means you must be against other forms of people protesting against their oppressors"". But there's plenty of examples of people rising up against their ""oppressors"" that I'm sure most western progressive thinking people wouldn't agree with at all. It's not about standing up against oppressors in general. It's specifically and exclusively about LGBTQ+ people standing up to their oppressors, gaining rights, and creating better lives for themselves, and celebrating how far we've come.
2. I believe it holds up an oppressed minority group up to a higher standard. Simply because a person is gay that means inherently that have more of a responsibility to be support of all other causes of inequality? That's dumb. They should be against other forms of inequality because they're a human being, like anyone else should, that has nothing to do with their sexuality of gender identity. I get you can say it's hypocritical, but that's such a naive way of thinking of it. In a perfect world yes hypocrites wouldn't exist. But anyone of any demographic, oppressed or otherwise, has just as much likelihood to be a bigoted asshole. Telling an lgbtq person they're supposed to have some sort of inherently quality because they are lgbtq is exactly the type of stuff we're fighting against. 

I'm open to having my opinion changed, but frankly it's pretty inconsequential for me because I agree with most of the causes I've seen it being compared to and needing to support. The only one I saw that I was a little iffy on was being against fatphobia. I don't make fun of overweight people, in fact I'm attracted to bearish men, and I think it's great plus size people are getting more media exposure. But I see some probably rage baity things online about what fatphobia is that makes me roll my eyes so idk maybe I am fatphobic? Getting in the weeds there, but the point still stands, I don't think there should be this gatekeeping attitude with pride. "
18,2024-06-02,"CMV: ""Parasocial Fixation Disorder"" should be recognized in the DSM as a mental illness.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d6j4q2/cmv_parasocial_fixation_disorder_should_be/,changemyview,"The kind of person I think this applies to most would be the ""whales"", or individuals who tend to donate lots of money in order to gain the temporary attention of the media figure, usually a streamer, likely in an attempt to forge a meaningful relationship with them, at least in the sense that the media figure begins to recognize them.

I was thinking about this last night because I was listening to a streamer and someone donated $100 saying, ""Today is my birthday, so I wanted to share my gift with you"".

I thought this was deeply sad and pitiful - to imagine someone alone on their birthday and essentially just forwarding a cash gift that someone gifted them (a family member, probably), to a streamer they like. That was when I considered that someone displaying this behavior has a mental illness. This shows a dismissive attitude to real-life relationships in favor of parasocial ones, and this is often a symptom of addictive behaviors: they **interfere with the maintenance or formation of healthy relationships**.

And then I thought about it some more and I considered that basically *anyone* who donates to a streamer like this has this condition, just in a less acute degree. There really is no rational reason someone should want to donate money to a streamer aside from some kind of *pathological* loneliness which drives unhealthy behaviors.

But just to be safe I would say that only ""whales"" would qualify for this condition, since other people who donate might have other motivations unrelated to a parasocial fixation: Perhaps they want to challenge the streamer on something they said, or simply contribute to an interesting discussion, etc.

Anyway, I figure this mental illness would be in line with the following recognized conditions, and likely a combination of them:

**Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**

Similarities:

* Obsessive Thoughts: Individuals with OCD often experience persistent, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) that are distressing. Similarly, parasocial fixation involves persistent thoughts about a media figure.
* Compulsive Behaviors: People with OCD engage in repetitive behaviors (compulsions) to reduce anxiety. In parasocial fixation, individuals might engage in repetitive behaviors like constantly checking social media updates or watching videos of the parasocial figure, or donating money frequently in order to get that dopamine ""hit"" that is common with other addictive behaviors. I think for people with this condition, each donation is basically like pulling the lever of the slot machine - they're hoping for a satisfying recognition from the media figure.

**Dependent Personality Disorder**

Similarities:

* Dependence: Both disorders involve an excessive need for reassurance and support from another person. In parasocial fixation, this dependence is directed towards a media figure.
* Fear of Abandonment: Individuals may fear losing access to the parasocial figure or feel distressed if they cannot engage with the figure‚Äôs content.

**Delusional Disorder, Erotomanic Type**

Similarities:

* Belief in a Special Relationship: Individuals with erotomanic delusions believe that another person, often of higher status, is in love with them. Those with parasocial fixation might believe that the media figure has a special connection with them, despite lack of evidence.
* Persistent Thoughts: Both involve persistent, fixed beliefs that are resistant to contrary evidence.

So what do you think about this? I figure there are already, shall we say, *dubious* mental illnesses which make the cut for the DSM, so why not this one?

Isn't that a pretty basic shared understanding amongst everyone about how capitalism works? 

It's not a useful way for understanding inflation. If companies increased their prices to increase profits, why didn't they do it before? Because previously that higher price point wasn't the most profitable. Why that is the case is the harder and more useful question to learn. The economic conditions must have changed to make this the be increase in price possible. Unless the claim is that companies weren't greedy before (a really naive take if you think about it).

Companies are always greedy. They are greedy when they increase prices, they are greedy when they decrease prices. Companies decrease prices to maximize their profits (encouraging people to buy from them instead of a competitor, or to get the profit from a sale of someone who can't afford a higher price).

Some goods fluctuate in price a lot due to supply and demand fluctuation like eggs or gas. It's obviously the companies trying to make money at any given point, not companies forgetting and then remembering to be greedy. 

I've seen lots of people comment on big box stores cutting prices by saying that this ""proves"" the companies inflated their prices to be greedy ... which makes me wonder, did these people think in 2019 that companies set their prices altruistically??? Do they think companies have sales out of the goodness of their hearts? 

Often times, companies raise prices because they have a limited supply of it so they want to sell all of to the richest X people who are willing to pay the higher price. This way they make more profit, which means among other things, they may be able to spend that money on alleviating production bottlenecks. Having a lower price just means that there will be a shortage, but less money for the company.  YMMV if you think that is good or bad."

But the truth is that they constantly stand against the Racism from Liberals, particularly towards Whites and Minorities who don't vote Democrat. When it comes to their own side, they claim to stand against it and often accuse the Media, particularly Left-Wing Media for fueling it as Manufactured Outrage. But in reality, they're not as strong against them as they claim to be, especially from their base and their Accusations against the Media is just Plain-Old Gaslighting. I'll provide three examples of such.

An example of such is last Summer when Conservative media outlet Breitbart published a piece exposing a rising Conservative influencer named Pedro L. Gonzalez for sending out a series of racist and antisemitic messages from 2019-2020 railing against prominent Conservative pundits and grifters such as Candace Owens and Ben Shapiro and believing in White Replacement Conspiracies. The outlet supports former President Trump while Gonzalez supported current Florida Governor Ron DeSantis when he was running for President. Earlier last year, this guy railed against the late Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. accusing him of being a Racist, Womanizer, Plagiarist, Rapist, Communist, and Supporter of so-called Critical Race Theory. After it was published, the News Organization was accused by its Supporters for publishing a lengthy article about a person they have never heard of before in spite of the fact that he was featured on prominent Conservative News Organizations and Pundits such as Tucker Carlson and Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk. It was even criticized for publishing an article that had a quality similar to Liberal Media outlets like CNN as well as being a Distraction from other important issues facing the country. The outlet was even criticized by DeSantis supporters for engaging in a Smear Campaign to derail the Governor's then-Presidential Ambitions.

If anything, the Backlash the Outlet received exposed a huge Irony. Over the years, Breitbart has published a lot of stories before in regards to Race, Demographics, Immigration, etc. that were similar in tone to what he believed in. They once had a column detailing ""Black Crime"". And it seems like the Backlash against them is Indication that combating Racism and Bigotry within their own circles is wrong, especially since doing so is going against the First Amendment and Free Speech. Furthermore, it seems to indicate that they covertly support it as indicated by them stating ""I don't agree with what you said, but I'll defend your right to say it."" But if anything, it just demonstrates that the Right has wasted the First Amendment to the point of Exhaustion, especially when it comes to social issues like this.

Then, we have Michelle Malkin, who has a long History of spreading negative views on Immigration and Race, particularly for her defense of Japanese Internment during World War II as well as racial profiling during the War on Terror. It wasn't until a few years back in 2019 when she started spreading Antisemitic Beliefs by supporting White Nationalists that resulted in her getting kicked out from numerous Conservative Organizations. If anything, it seems surprising to me that many Conservatives didn't seem to mind her Reprehensible Views at all over the years. It only took criticism of Jews to be the breaking point.

Finally, we have former Iowa Congressman Steve King. A Strong Opponent of Immigration and Multiculturalism, he has long spread Racist, Antisemitic, Anti-Immigrant, and White Nationalist content, as well as supporting global Far-Right Leaders and Candidates. And he was elected 9 times without any Criticism from the Right. But it wasn't until 2017-2019 when the Right started condemning him for making comments on White Nationalism, Western Civilization, and Western Civilization that caused him to be censured and then later removed from the 2020 Primaries. When Right-Wing media outlets such as Breitbart reported the news, a good majority of its readers agreed in unison with him stating that people are taking him out of context, White people should have no blame and guilt for creating the Western world, Republicans rebuking him are Cucks (which is pretty much the White/Republican version of an Uncle Tom \[Double Standard much?\]), and why Organizations such as NAACP, BET, among others aren't considered racist? Judging by these comments, I guess this is what Conservatives meant when they stated that we shouldn't be politically correct anymore. Condoning Racism is an example of being politically incorrect, especially when it comes from your own League and condemning it is an example of being politically correct and suppressing free speech. Kind of like the incident with Breitbart and Pedro Gonzalez.

So in conclusion, the Right has some extremely Bizarre Standards when it comes to combating Racism, Bigotry, and other forms of Hate when it comes from their side. They have no problem talking shit against Racial and Religious Minorities. But when it comes to Whites, Jews, and Conservative Minorities (especially ones who bash their own communities), then that's where they cross the line. And when it comes to Racism from within their own Party in general, they either have a Dismissive Tone and condemn them for either taking things Out-of-Context, suppressing Free Speech, and criticizing the Liberal Media. In fact, it should be noted that the Right has developed a Bad Habit of criticizing the Left and the media for anything Bad that happens within their own circles instead of taking any Responsibility for the Rhetoric that their Base spews. After all, they are the Party of Personal Responsibility, right? Seriously, stop with the Denialism, Gaslighting, and Projection already. And you playing the First Amendment card all the time makes you look and sound like a Bunch of Wimps. There is a limit to what is Acceptable and Unacceptable Speech. Many of us can see through this Bullshit and all you're doing is promoting Guilt among Minorities."

In recent decades, the United States has found itself entangled in numerous international conflicts, often providing substantial financial support to wars in other countries. While the intention behind such support may be rooted in promoting global stability and humanitarian aid, it is increasingly evident that this financial commitment comes at a significant cost to the nation's own welfare. It is my belief that America should cease its financial support for foreign wars and instead reallocate these funds towards addressing pressing domestic issues, thereby fostering a stronger, more prosperous nation.

Firstly, the financial burden of supporting foreign wars is immense. According to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University, the United States has spent over $6.4 trillion on wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other conflict zones since 2001. This staggering expenditure diverts resources away from critical domestic needs such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and social services. By redirecting funds from foreign wars to these areas, the government can significantly improve the quality of life for its citizens. For example, investing in healthcare can ensure that all Americans have access to affordable medical services, reducing the burden of medical debt and improving overall public health.

Moreover, the infrastructure in the United States is in dire need of modernization. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has consistently given the nation's infrastructure a failing grade, highlighting the urgent need for investment in roads, bridges, public transportation, and water systems. By reallocating funds from foreign wars to infrastructure projects, the government can create jobs, boost the economy, and enhance the safety and efficiency of transportation networks. This not only benefits the current population but also lays the foundation for future generations to thrive.

Education is another critical area that would greatly benefit from increased funding. The United States lags behind other developed nations in terms of educational outcomes, with significant disparities in access to quality education based on socioeconomic status and geographic location. By investing in education, the government can ensure that all children, regardless of their background, have access to high-quality schools, well-trained teachers, and modern learning resources. This, in turn, can help close the achievement gap, reduce poverty, and prepare the workforce for the demands of the 21st century.

Furthermore, redirecting funds from foreign wars to social services can help address issues such as homelessness, mental health, and substance abuse. These issues are often interconnected and can have devastating consequences for individuals and communities. By investing in social services, the government can provide support and resources to those in need, helping them overcome challenges and reintegrate into society. This can lead to a reduction in crime, improved public safety, and a more compassionate and just society.

In conclusion, the United States has a moral and economic imperative to prioritize its own citizens and address pressing domestic issues. By ceasing its financial support for foreign wars and reallocating those funds to healthcare, education, infrastructure, and social services, the government can create a stronger, more prosperous nation for all. This shift in focus would not only improve the quality of life for Americans but also send a powerful message that the well-being of its citizens is paramount.

0,2024-06-02,CMV: Israel and Zionists should cease their current PR war efforts.,u/BiryaniEater10,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d6nfq7/cmv_israel_and_zionists_should_cease_their/,changemyview,"I believe Israel can do whatever it wants in the real war, but they should cease their current PR war immediately. 

There are multiple reasons for this. 

The first of these is that their choice to react how they have has only led to the pro Palestine movement getting more attention than it would. The pro Pal movement isn‚Äôt the first leftist endorsed movement  and it surely won‚Äôt be the last. 

But the thing is that most groups criticized by leftists tended to just ignore what leftists said, and let the movement die out over time. The Zionist movement especially outside of Israel has taken a different approach. They have chosen to put the spotlight on pro Pals, label them as bigots, and demand that pro Pals engage in discourse with them. 

The pro Pal movement as a whole has no reason to engage with Zionists, because the only time we engage with others is when there‚Äôs a willingness to disagree to agree civilly with each other. 

Zionists have already said this is not something they‚Äôre willing to agree to disagree on. First off, the fact they aren‚Äôt is a pretty poor look. There are multiple conflicts we agree to disagree on. What is the reason the Israel Palestine conflict should be any different?

PR wars should be about painting yourself positively, not demanding the world agree with you and slandering them if they decline to. 

Secondly, there is no basis for civilians who live nowhere near the region at all having to recognize a nation. There is a weak argument that losers of war have an obligation to recognize the winner and respect them, but there is no such requirement for you or me. Israel can have existed for 100, 200, or 300 years, and I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs incumbent on us as civilians to recognize it, let alone have no civilians opposing it. There are civilians today who refuse to recognize many nations like Turkey, so why is it only a problem with Israel.

Also, civilians labeling someone evil in a war and applying double standards to the side they see as worse is also a normal thing that happens in war, so again, why is it a problem only here? 

With wars, people decry anything that who in their eyes are the more evil side does, and put a disproportionate focus on that side, and agree to disagree with those who don‚Äôt see it that way, so it makes no sense to say this is the conflict where everyone needs to agree.

Another reason is history. Zionists use to be on the side of history doesn‚Äôt matter, but recently they have recognized that history will always play a role in any PR war, so they have twisted the history quite a bit.

The most believable narrative as of today is that Zionists in the early 1900s-1940s engaged in a massively invasive and destructive migration which was harming Arabs, and eventually tried to declare a state over part of the Arab land. 

The Arabs eventually chose to declare war to defend themselves from the invasive migration and state creation and obviously failed. Now, Zionists are twisting the story to deny that the migration was invasive and wrong, and thus that Palestinians actually started the war out of aggression and not self defense. 

If you‚Äôre twisting history this much to get good PR war, that‚Äôs yet another sign you can maybe sit out the PR war for now.

0,2024-06-02,"CMV: Talk therapy, in general, doesn't work",u/Empty_Technology672,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d6pbi6/cmv_talk_therapy_in_general_doesnt_work/,changemyview,"I've done therapy in the past and generally, I have found it unhelpful at best and actively harmful at worst. 

I have found the following to be true:

1. Most therapists themselves are battling their own mental health issues. Their ability to help their clients is going to be limited based on that alone.

2. therapists have their own biases. Someone, for example, who is trying to figure out the best way to come out as gay to their friends and family might be stunned to learn that their practitioner is homophobic. This could lead to more harm to the individual seeking therapy and is a common story I've heard from LGBTQ friends.

3. I don't personally believe that talking about your trauma really solves anything. And if It is helpful, it's only helpful to a degree. Sitting around and talking about some event that happened 10 years ago that's over and done isn't helping anyone. 

4. If a therapist is bad, no one will know it unless their clients start to report them. Because of the patient-client confidentiality, therapists can do a shitty job for a long time before someone corrects them 

5. Every time I tell a therapist ""I have X behavior that I don't like. I want to work on that"" I'm told not to worry about it because if I'm worried about it, that means I'm aware of it and couldn't possibly be a problem. The ""client is always right"" mentality isn't helpful to people seeking therapy but it is helpful in getting the client to keep returning and paying for therapy.

The only time ""therapy"" was useful to me was when I was in a harmful situation. The ""therapist"" was a social worker who helped me report an abuser to the correct authority and help get me and my minor brother out of an abusive situation. Outside of that, therapists have done nothing to help Me process or overcome adverse situations or help solve mental health issues.

Rather I watch a lot of videos of court proceedings, and noticed just how expensive it is for a tether to be placed on a person, and it is more often than not the burden of the defendant to pay that expense. It is my view that this practice places an undue and unnecessary hardship on the defendant, who often has other financial charges placed upon them for whatever reason (even in cases of personal bond I think this is unnecessary). Additionally, I think it is an inherently coercive practice, placing the defendant in an inherently unequally weighted decision to either A) pay the money and be ""free"" pending your case, or B) spend the time in jail, accumulating other debts and potentially losing your employment (if one has it). Lastly, I believe that this places a burden that is particularly harmful to low-income individuals, naturally, further bolstering the perception that the courts are indirectly preferential towards those with more wealth. 

Rather, I propose that this simply be subsidized by the courts/legal system/whatever system pays for this sort of legal requirement. This way, the system inches its way closer to being more rehabilitative rather than punitive. I can already see the counters stating, ""why should it be a taxpayer burden for a (potential) criminal?"" in which I would counter with the fact that our taxes already go to many other systems, namely prisons, paying for these services already, and (perhaps this is faulty logic, we will see) in order to remain consistent, one would need to also advocate for reduced/abolished public contribution to all institutions meant to be directed towards (potential) criminals."

The child is no longer a distinct person, but an extension of yourself, and this will make it significantly harder for them to create a distinct identity. They will always be tied to you.

I'm not saying that mafia and its gangsters are saints or Robin Hoods. Sure, they're criminals and they are doing illegal things. But it doesn't mean that they're pure evil or complete monsters. Sure, neither is street gangs, but there's main differences between these two:

1. Mafia, unlike street gangs and its thugs, doesn't do unnecessary violence and usually tries to avoid collateral damage, while street thugs oftentimes assaults random civilians and even kill them as a part of gang's initiation or in order to prove the loyalty. 

2. Mafia does kill, and so does street gangs. But mafia kills (mostly) other gangsters and doesn't deliberately targets innocent civilians, especially for wearing colours of a rival gang. Most mafia hits are against other gangsters or witnesses and law enforcement officers that was getting too deep. I'm not saying that it's good to kill cops and detectives just because they're doing their job and same about the witnesses, but at least mobster won't kill you because he wants to take away your car, phone, money or something else and won't kill you because you are wearing clothes of a rival gang's colours. 

3. Mafia has their own code of honour, and even though street gngs also have a code, its much loose in terms of what's allowed and what's not. For example, street gangsta can rob people on the street, assault them, rape them and even kill, as well as do other crimes that mafia mobsters aren't allowed to do. Mafia's code of honour is more strict and was created to keep mobsters in check and prevent them from getting too far. 

4. Mafia isn't involved into a drug trade and trafficking, unlike street gangs, where drugs is a bread and butter. Sure, some mafia bosses are okay with drugs, but generally, mafia isn't too fond for drugs. 

5. While mafia can be brutal and violent, they actually provide the protection and can help people when official law enforcement can't. That's how mafia helped to find missed children, was involved in a counter-terrorism and counter-espionage and even defended people during riots and when street crime was on its peak in large cities. Street gangs usually doesn't do that, although they're usually claims to be a protectors of their 'hood, but in fact all they do is intimidating people, robbing them and spreading toxic ghetto ""culture"" with a violent and racist traits. 

6. Mafia was able to thrive because of the government's mistakes and incompetent law enforcement job. Such as prohibition era, ban of pornography and other things that government was doing wrong or was doing that too strictly (such as ""zero tolerance policy about drugs"", banning all gambling or something like that). I'm not trying to justify the mafia, but only criticize the government's policy and its mistakes.

7. Mafia is a lesser and kinda necessary evil, which is basically impossible to defeat, only control. That's how Italy does it about their own mafia (after many years in a futile attempt to destroy the mafia) and that's how Yakuza in Japan and Triads in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and some parts of a mainland China are coexisting with the government and law enforcement. Those countries also have a relatively low crime rate, unlike USA, where street crime and street thugs and ""gangstas"" are common and crime rate is relatively high, especially in large cities. 

8. I'm totally aware that mafia is, far from its fancy and cool look from novels, movies and video games. And I know that not all street things are greedy, hyper-violent and pure evil, a lot of them are originating from a bad and poor neighbourhoods with a high crime rate, poverty and violence, and that's how they're getting involved into a life of crime. But it doesn't excuses their brutal, violent and unnecessary crimes, such as drive-by shootings (especially in a crowded areas and at the innocent bystanders that was only ""guilty"" to walk into a ""wrong"" neighborhood or wear colours of a rival gang), brutal assaults on the random people (a.k.a. ""knockout game"" or something like that), gang rapes of women, burglaries, carjackings, drug dealing, arsons and other. Sure, mafia can be brutal and their executions and hits can be violent, but they're usually aimed at their rivals and better done (like, instead of a spraying the rival gangster's house with SMGs, drive-by style, endangering the innocent bystanders, mafia would likely hire a hitman, who would kill the rival gangster when he's alone, or use a sniper rifle in order to make an accurate shot). Of course, collateral damage happens and mafia kills bystanders, but it's usually either an awry accidents or an inevitable collateral damage. Like, if someone saw a mafia's ""hit"" and was spotted, he/she should be executed because ""leave no witnesses"" policy. Brutal and violent, but it's kinda necessary from the mafia's side. Same about when mafia tortures someone who hold the debt for a too long time ‚Äì you should know ""the rules of a game"" and think beforehand, especially when you're taking loan money from the mafia and not paying your debt. ""Nothing personal, it's just business"". 

Alright, I think that I said enough. I'm waiting for replies and criticism. "

Unfair dismissal from a job is different as it violates a legal contract. But a film actor not being rehired for a sequel isn't that. 

Essentially, they want others not to express their own freedom of speech and association.

The right to not to business with someone after a contract expires, not to buy someone's product or just to not be around someone is the fundamental right of every person and entity. And if a large number of people do this in an organised way, it's still their collective right."

**Why it is illegal:**
1. *Deception*: The false records were intended to hide payments made to Stormy Daniels, misleading both regulators and the public.
Fb
2. *Election Impact*: These payments were meant to suppress information that could have influenced voters during the 2016 election, constituting an unreported campaign expenditure.

**What makes it illegal:**
- Falsifying business records to disguise the payments as legal expenses, thereby concealing their actual purpose and nature.

**Laws broken:**
1.  **New York Penal Law Section 175.10**: Falsifying business records in the first degree, which becomes a felony when done to conceal another crime.
2. **Federal Campaign Finance Laws**: The payments were seen as illegal, unreported campaign contributions intended to influence the election outcome.

These actions violate laws designed to ensure transparency and fairness in elections and financial reporting. Trumps lawyers are part of jury selection and all jurors found him guilty on all counts unanimously.

Here is a timeline of events related to Donald Trump's falsification of business records case:

### Timeline of Events

1. **2006**: Donald Trump allegedly has an affair with Stormy Daniels (Stephanie Clifford).

2. **October 2016**: Just before the presidential election, Trump's then-lawyer Michael Cohen arranges a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence about the affair. 

3. **2017**: Cohen is reimbursed by Trump for the payment, with the Trump Organization recording the reimbursements as legal expenses.

4. **April 2018**: The FBI raids Michael Cohen‚Äôs office, seizing documents related to the hush money payment.

5. **August 2018**: Cohen pleads guilty to several charges, including campaign finance violations related to the payment to Daniels, implicating Trump by stating the payments were made at his direction to influence the 2016 election.

6. **March 2023**: Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg indicts Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, arguing these false entries were made to hide the hush money payments and protect Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign.

7. **April 2023**: The trial begins with Trump pleading not guilty to all charges.

8. **May 30, 2024**: Trump is convicted on all 34 counts of falsifying business records. The court rules that the records were falsified to cover up illegal campaign contributions, a felony under New York law.

9. **July 11, 2024**: Sentencing is scheduled, with Trump facing significant fines.

This timeline outlines the key events leading to Trump‚Äôs conviction for falsifying business records, highlighting the legal violations and their impact on election integrity and transparency.

1) They should be old enough that they have the minimum of maturity and life experience required for them to choose a name that won't immediately be ""Spiderman"" or ""Amogus"" because names follow you for the rest of your life (or however long you can tolerate it without going through the official process of changing your legal name)

2) Parents still get to choose a temporary name for their kid because kids are people and people needs names still, and if the kid likes their temp name they might just choose to stick with it (and their birth certificate doesn't have to be changed)

3) The kids are taught not only about what goes in a name but also what makes a good or crappy name (Elon Musk could've done with that one, poor his children.)"

Before I go any further, let me just say that I support Palestine with tooth and nail, however I have no issue with Jews, I have an issue with the decisions of Netanyahu, the dictator nobody's talking about.

I would also like to clarify:

IDF = Israeli Defence Forces

Hamas = Terrorist Group from Egypt, not Palestine

I will use Israel and IDF interchangeably throughout this post, whenever I say Jews I mean the ethnic group, but otherwise I'm talking about the government itself.

I see these really, just awfully dumb takes on the Gaza conflict all the time, and it really bugs me that people are genuinely believing their own misinformation that they have made themselves, due to no context whatsoever on the war.

One I see people (particularly white americans) throwing around is: ""Israel has every right to attack Palestine because of the October 7 Attacks!""

Any person with an actual ethnic, religious or geopolitical understanding of the situation, whether they support Israel, or Palestine, would be almost cracked up by the sheer stupidity here. **PALESTINE DID NOT ATTACK ISRAEL, HAMAS DID. THEN ISRAEL ATTACKED PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS.**

It's become very clear, to Jews and Muslims, alike, that the IDF knew about the Hamas attacks, and purposely did nothing to stop them, so that they would have a chance to commit blatant genocide. And no, this isn't some crazy conspiracy, this wouldn't even take a military genius to see.

Hamas had weaponry lined up for days on end before Oct 7, yet the IDF did nothing, despite knowledge of the preparation of the attack.

Another really dumb take I see a lot is: ""Well Israel has tried to limit civilian casualties!""

If you listen straight out of Netanyahu's mouth, of course you would think that.

Every Palestine military base has been gone for more than 2 months now, yet Israel is still bombing, there is literally nothing but civilians left and they are still bombing, you can't say with a straight face that Israel is trying to limit civilian casualties. They have literally targeted individual family homes and houses, and the IDF intentionally kills journalists to be all hush-hush about the war.

In conclusion, maybe actually learn some facts before you just base your opinion from what you see around you. Just because your country's leader supports a dictatorship does not mean you have to.

Crime is rampant, and criminals are more brazen then ever. Last week, an Uber driver was pulled out of his car and beaten simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The perpetrators of the crime filmed themselves doing it and cheered each other on. Yesterday, bike thieves were caught on film in broad daylight, surrounded by dozens of people, without any concern of being caught. 

Gun violence is the norm. Traffic enforcement is non-existent. Open-air drug markets, tent cities, random attacks. I get that this is just something that happens in cities, but in the past, police used to be able to do actual policing. Not really a thing anymore. 

I get so frustrated that I am starting to believe that severe penalties coupled with restriction of freedoms is a valid path to consider. Singapore's version of soft autocracy is wildly successful at maintaining public order and safety, and rarely do you ever hear of people complaining about democratic erosion. 

More recently, El Salvador has seen quite the dramatic decrease in crime. Human rights advocates have been closely monitoring the situation there, but so far any long-term concerns of human rights violations have yet to really come to fruition, while the short-term benefits of Bukele's policies have been undeniably successful and popular.

Short of that, I would welcome old-school mafia vigilante justice. I shouldn't have to worry about my windows being smashed just because I have a car with windows. I shouldn't be afraid of owning a bicycle because it will definitively get stolen. I believe actions should have consequences, and these criminals should be taught a lesson. If I violently prevent someone from stealing from me, they probably won't steal from me again. Criminals use violence against us, and it works. Why not give some back in return?

Then, in 1983, the armed wing of the May 19th Communist Organization set off a bomb inside of the senate offices, which once again was a serious attack on the institutions of our government (They also had an abortive plan to assassinate Kissinger) and had the very real potential to kill/maim people in the same building (It was placed directly outside of a Democratic senators office, targeting him for his support of the invasion of Grenada).

I hear them being called as ""dystopic killer machines"" or ""inhuman"". I however believe that drone strikes are the most ethical form of warfare.

As an army you have responsibility to keep your own soldiers and civilians on both sides alive and destroy the enemy military capacity without unnecessary suffering. Drones are perfect for this purpose. 

Firstly, it is right to not risk lives of your own soldiers and to not expose them to gruesome realities of the battlefield. Why should they be traumatized by seeing the results of their strikes in person, when it is not necessary? 

Secondly, all civilians must be protected. Drones are excellent at reducing the amount of targeting errors. Why?

Well, we all know that fear often leads to mistakes. You can't expect soldiers, who are afraid for their own life, to act fully rational and according to the rules. Drone operator however, sitting in a far away chair, does not face any grave risks. I believe that this must positively impact their decision making and reduce error rate. 

The fact that they aren't really risking anything personally also allows the drone operators to make precision engagements from very close range. Their reconnaissance capabilities are also much better (why not loiter there a few minutes longer to ensure that really only the right people are hit? little to lose). This is again great for enemy civilians, who are less likely to get hit.

Accountability can be very easily achieved in drones as the engagements can be completely replayed and judged while having the exact information available to the operator at the time. This helps to enforce the rules of engagement being followed. 

Lastly, the surgical strikes by drones allow to even kill a minimum of enemy soldiers as command centres and leadership can be attacked very effectively. In the end the enemy soldiers get also spared. 

To sum it up, I believe that especially in various counter insurgency roles, drones should be used as much as possible and it is only ethical. Change my view! "

The idea alone already makes it sound of a pro-(big) tobacco dogwhistle: Michael Russell, the scientist who coined the THR war cry ""smoke for nicotine, die from the tar"" [had ties with BAT,](https://tobacco.ucsf.edu/michael-russell-father-tobacco-harm-reduction-had-ties-bat) ergo solidifying the dogwhistle nature of the statement. Further solidifying the idea is that Big Tobacco already rides on the [tobacco harm reduction wave.](https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/30/e1/e1) 

With the latter in mind, for all arguments that Bloomberg's philanthropies in the US are pushing tobacco control worldwide, we might have to look on how Big Tobacco might have infiltrated UK's public health advocacies given the UK's reputation as THR capital of the world. Remember BAT's attempts to market what was hyped as a ""pharmaceutical e-cigarette"" (actually a nicotine inhaler designed to resemble a cigarette pack) named Voke that won NHS approval in the UK, [but didn't seem to go through the market, at least with their involvement?](https://tobaccotactics.org/article/kind-consumer-limited/)

Also, when you switch from cigarettes to an alt-nicotine product such as snus, nicotine pouches, or vapes, you are still trading an addiction for another, and these (except for open-system vaping products, which tend to be independent of the Big Tobacco) are often manufactured/marketed by Big Tobacco, which means these things are dogwhistles as a product. Big Tobacco can only speak in propaganda, disinformation, and dogwhistles, after all, and the initial anti-youth smoking ads produced in wake of the TMSA (""Think, Don't Smoke""/""Tobacco is Whacko"") are effectively that too."

They keep using the same old phrases. ""Turning away is a privilege. Do something!""

Ok. What?

What do we do? Is there a charity for this thing that's happening on the other side of the world? Is there a magical force field we can fund to block all the bullets and missiles from the opposing army? What do we do? Kind of funny that you gloss over that specific bit, huh?

That's the problem I have when people say that they're ""spreading awareness."" Because what ""spreading awareness"" translates to is ""shouting at randos and people that don't want to listen, telling them to do something because you're either too lazy to do it yourself or you've subconsciously realized that you can't do anything.""

In the words of the great Brennan Lee Mulligan, ""You do not get to pretend you are being noble if you're just going to do some random shit. If I f\*\*\*ing jerk off on a subway and say 'This one's for the troops,' that doesn't matter!!""

The reason why Martin Luthor King's activism worked is that it wasn't just shouting straight at the sky. His methods were informed and methodical. He did the bus boycott because he KNEW black people were the majority of bus passangers and that would cut into the profits. He specialized in non violent protests because he knew that if it were violent, that would feed into the public perception of black people and seeing a man get beaten without fighting back is a better sight than a random bar fight because there was no way for the public to misinterpret that. He had a plan and BASIC EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING SKILLS

The difference between MLK and today's activists was that MLK wasn't a hack. There was a method to the madness. HE WASN'T A LAZY MORON

This is why I prefer charities over activism because in charity, your actions are actually worth a damn. Is some level of advertising necessary for charities to function? Yes. But if you are shouting at the goddamn sky telling people that they need to ""do better"" and not telling them specifically what they can do to help, SURPRISE! They aren't going to know what to fucking do! And they are going to pass your goddamn signs and go about their day doing absolutely jack all just like what you did immediately after you posted that tweet"

Western Samoa (formerly German Samoa) could easily have been annexed in the Treaty of Versailles if there had been some American diplomatic pressure.Finally, all the islands occupied in World War II, from the Marshall Islands to the Ryukyu Islands (where Okinawa is located), could have been definitively annexed.

Philippines should have become independent because it had a very large population.

So with him recently posting outright screenshots of his positions on the stock to the sub, I don't think its possible to miss the fact that this one action *will* boost the price because people will jump onto the stock thinking something is coming. Even though DFV isn't directly telling people to buy anything, its pretty obvious group behaviour that has been exhibited in the past and could easily be predicted. 

As for what to actually do about it, that's a different question.

I have seen some saying it's already here. I do not think this will happen and I will list some reasons why. I can elaborate more in the comments but I don't want to over bloat the post here. I should say that when I say far right I mean explicitly fascist,national socialist or white nationalist. Also I want to say now that I am Black. I wish I didn't have to say this but I want people to focus on what I have to say and not say shit like ""your privileged so you just don't see the warning signs"" 

1: The demographics aren't there.  the White population is declining in both numbers and influence. I remember Sweden was like the whitest white country imaginable as a kid and now I think POC are 25% of the population, white people just don't have kids. I am not in the mood to argue why but it's true. Unlike other groups they can't make up the difference with intermarrying because white men are not popular in the dating market. I am black right and I have so many white women who just simp for me, I have actually gotten sick of white women meanwhile I never see white men get simped for just for being white. White men are just kind of weak you know, they just don't got that dog in them. 

2: LGBTQ acceptance is on the rise. I think like 25% of Gen Z is queer, how is the far right going to win elections against that ? They won't and more of Gen alpha will be queer. 

3: Rise of feminism and women's autonomy, the far right vision kind of hinges on women being submissive and having families. Most women especially Gen Z and millennial women don't want that. I think among young people women actually make more then men, women can make great money on onlyfans while being a dude in today's economy isn't like that. The man vs bear meme went mega viral,barbie was the highest grossing movie in it's studios history.

212,2024-06-03,"CMV: ""Love the sinner, hate the sin"" is condescending and offensive.",u/Leylolurking,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d7kvdq/cmv_love_the_sinner_hate_the_sin_is_condescending/,changemyview,"Typically said by Christians to LGBTQ+ people. I think this and other similar sentiments while well meaning are incredibly condescending and queer people are right to be offended by it despite whatever good intentions might lay behind it.

  
I thankfully have never had someone say this to me in real life, my family and friends are very accepting but I hear about this from other queer people a lot and recently I have encountered a lot of YouTube content from Christians expressing basically this idea. What bothers me most is that the speakers in those videos and the commenters either don't realize or won't acknowledge why this would come off as condescending or why LGBTQ+ people would be offended by this.

  
Often this comes along with comparing being gay/queer to being an alcoholic or something like this. They make this comparison to emphasize that you can love someone while condemning their ""life style."" But ultimately this comparison only highlights how offensive this sentiment is. Everyone, even alcoholics, agrees that alcoholism is bad. People who are alcoholics will justify themselves by claiming not to be alcoholics (i.e. ""I can quit anytime I want""). On the other hand gay people don't see what they're doing as bad or unhealthy the way alcoholism is. I think this is why it comes off as condescending, because it assumes that we cannot discern  what is good for ourselves. ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" is condescending because it assumes queer people are ""sinning"" without even knowing it, like we're idiots but you love us anyways or something.

  
I think this is deeply offensive and feel free to call me ""triggered"" or whatever. This is offensive because most of us have struggled to get to a place where we can be happy and healthy. So many of us have tried to force ourselves to be straight/cis only to live miserable and unhealthy lives because of it. Implying that we are ""sinners"" for living the best lives we can is not only condescending but deeply offensive and hurtful to people in the LGBTQ+ community."

Unfortunately this is going to be longer than I expected it would be, but I hope you'll bear with me because I think this is a very interesting perspective on legalized euthanasia for humans and what it really means. I've trimmed this down as much as humanly possible and bolded the parts that I think are most interesting.

This is a political commentator's perspective on this and I think it's interesting and sort of made me decide that they have a point, and we shouldn't allow for this kind of thing to be legal.

>A young Dutch woman finally got her tragic wish to die by assisted suicide. Her life was terminated last week after waiting three years for final approval for her euthanasia.

>By the time she was 22, she wrote a, she wore a do not resuscitate tag around her neck. She struggled with depression, anxiety, personality disorders, wanted to die by assisted suicide, waited three years, and now she got it.

>This is a woman who did not have any physical illness, much less a terminal one. She was perfectly physically healthy, but she was depressed and she was bullied. And so, and she was anxious. And so she wanted to be put down.

>**So here's a thought experiment**. Imagine if I was driving over a bridge and I happened to see a young woman standing at the edge of the bridge.

>And now imagine that I pull over and I approach and I ask her, you know, what's wrong? And imagine that **she tells me she wants to kill herself**. And **I respond by saying, okay, well good luck then. And I get in my car and I drive away**. I say, if she wants to die. It's her right to die.

>If I did that, nearly everyone would agree rightfully that I'm a monster. People would say, ""What kind of psychopath are you?"" Now, the contradiction here is totally irreconcilable.  In fact, in the case of jumping off the bridge, Nearly everyone would agree that, that not only should I try to dissuade her, but that I can, and in fact should use physical force to stop her. If that's what it takes. You wouldn't say, ""what are you doing? That's her choice. How dare you?"" You wouldn't say that. No. In fact, you would say I'm a hero for saving her.

To supplement their point here, I wanted to quickly share [this story ](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3177504/We-help-lives-Japan-s-suicide-catcher-saves-500-lives-11-years-dedicating-life-saving-people.html)about a Japanese man who has ""talked down"" 500 people over 11 years who apparently intended to commit suicide. As you might expect, this man is hailed as a hero and will likely have a statue built in his honor after his own time is over. I think this supports the point: not only are we disgusted by someone who encourages someone to commit suicide, but we celebrate those who prevent suicide.

>And yet, if that woman just, let's say, keeps walking across the bridge and stops at her doctor's office a a mile down the road and decides to use a poison needle or a poison pill or whatever to kill herself, then all of a sudden it's now something we shouldn't try to stop. In fact, a doctor should facilitate it, should perform it for her.

>Now back to the bridge analogy. Imagine...I stop, I ask her what's wrong? She says she wants to kill herself. And then **she says, well, I want to jump. I don't wanna live anymore, but I can't bring myself to do it. So would you come over and push me? And then what if I did**? I mean, she wants to kill herself. She's fully consented. She's asked me to assist in her suicide. So what if I said, okay, well, all right, if that's what you want. **If I just shoved her over the bridge, now, not only would I be condemned nationwide, globally, in fact for doing that, but I would go to prison.**  
  
**And yet that is exactly what doctors who perform assisted suicide are doing.**  


To supplement this point, there was another [story](https://abcnews.go.com/2020/michelle-carters-texting-suicide-trial-revisited/story?id=83835354) in the news a while ago about a man named Conrad Roy who was suicidal and while texting his girlfriend about it, she encouraged him to commit suicide. And he did. Subsequently, she was tried and convicted of involuntary manslaughter. At the time, this case was quite controversial and made for some complex discussions about how we should interact with suicidal people.

*""Prosecutors said that Carter, then 17, had been texting Roy for months about his bouts with depression and, in some messages, encouraged him to go forward with his suicide. She was arrested in 2015 and charged with involuntary manslaughter. Carter's trial, decided by Massachusetts Judge Lawrence Moniz and not a jury, began two years later.*

*Ultimately, Moniz found Carter guilty of involuntary manslaughter and described her behavior as ""reckless.""*

*The judge sentenced Carter to¬†2 1/2 years in prison with 15 months served¬†and the rest suspended. She was also sentenced to five years probation.""*

So again to supplement the argument, we see that there is actually legal precedent that encouraging someone to commit suicide could end you up in jail because of it. This pundit doesn't seem aware of it, but their point has actually been proven in reality.

>(...)killing someone is not medicine, okay? Just because you do it in a doctor's office, that doesn't make it medicine. No medicine is a particular thing. Medicine by definition is meant to heal and treat and cure. Not everything can be cured, not everything can be healed, but it it, at, at the very least it is treated. That's what medicine is. Killing someone is not a treatment. **Death is not a treatment plan**. So then we go back to ""**What exactly is the difference between a doctor performing assisted suicide and me pushing a woman off a bridge when she asks me to?""**

>**Just because a doctor does it, that doesn't mean mean that it's medicine**. This is one, a very simple concept that seems to be hard for a lot of people to grasp just because a doctor, **the definition of medicine is not whatever a doctor does, okay? That's not the definition of medicine**.

I think this is a compelling point too, because it's true that doctors in history have done all kinds of horrendous things under the guise of ""medicine"". Do you think it's true that *""just because a doctor does it, that doesn't mean it's medicine""?*

>(...)the irony is, in the New York Post, at the very end of it in the article, there's a, there's a link to the suicide helpline.

>Well, what do they do with the suicide helpline? They don't send you to euthanasia. They try to help you not do that. Because when it comes to suicide, we all recognize that it's wrong and people shouldn't do it. And if they're doing it, then it's because like by definition, they're not in the right state of mind. And that life is worth living and that we should never just give up on it. We all recognize that. And yet euthanasia has support from many millions of people.

What do you guys think about this? I think this pundit has a point that people certainly seem to have contradictory views on suicide and assisted suicide, and we seem to be confused about how we really feel about it: we celebrate those who talk down people who are suicidal and legally punish those who merely encourage suicidal people to go through with it *with words(!)* but out of the other side of our mouths, we say people should be allowed to have doctors kill them if they want them to.

And what happens if we don't legalize assisted suicide? What purpose is there in making that a part of our society? Our culture? People who truly want to die will do it if they want to. They don't need our help and encouragement. On the contrary, we are very sensitive and quick to encourage them *against* doing so! But when it's a medical setting, suddenly it's okay to literally kill them?

I expect that many of you support legalized euthanasia/assisted suicide, so...what do you think about this? Change my view."

1. Safety 

Often women report that a man approaching them wasn't necessarily about how charismatic etc he was but more so about Safety. If they turned him down or even accepted would he follow her home , is he some weirdo  etc. 

2. It's a superficial engagement built purely on physical characteristics.You aren't approaching the woman because of her amazing personality or what have you but merely because of certain physical characteristics caught your interest. 

3. Superficial engagements aren't how relationships usually start. Most people meet in school, at the job /co-worker , friend of friend and church . These are spaces where you can casually meet people and engage without any expectation whatsoever of a relationship. Superficial engagements quite often just don't work in the long run.You won't hear your parents or grandparents saying how they met their significant other aisle 4 of Walmart. 

4. Many women find it offensive for men they consider ugly to hit on them. Once again this is a superficial engagement. This isn't a person you can swipe on some app but real life superficial engagement so some women may feel offended 

5. Because of so many underlying factors the rejection rate is high meaning it serves to lower men's self esteem when it may have absolutely nothing to do with looks or even how charismatic you are . Because this is a superficial engagement men will hyperfixate on looks for failing 

6. Distance and living arrangements. Like I said most people meet their spouses in casual spaces they frequently meet at so factors like distance are often not an issue when getting to know each other because you are already meeting somewhere. When it comes to random superficial engagements at places you don't know how far this person traveled to get there , who they live with etc .

I go on about other factors but the main point is that superficial engagements don't work in the long run. What's proven to work is being in casual places where you speak to the opposite sex frequently like school , work , church and friends of friends to enter a long term relationship. "

71,2024-06-04,"CMV: It is more reasonable to say ""I don't know if alien life exists"" rather than ""I believe alien life exists"" or ""I believe alien life does not exist"".",u/GuyDudeBucket,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d7q6r1/cmv_it_is_more_reasonable_to_say_i_dont_know_if/,changemyview,"Generally, there are three beliefs one can hold. My claim is that (3) is the most reasonable.

1. Alien life does exists somewhere in the universe.

2. Alien life does not exist anywhere in the universe.

3. I don't know. 

When I say ""alien life"", I mean any form a life that is originates outside of Earth. So this could be anything from little green men from mars to bacteria 5 billion light years away. 

When people try to make the case that alien life MUST exist, the arguement is usually as follows: there are millions and millions of habitable planets in our galaxy. There are millions and millions of galaxies similar to ours in the universe. We exist, so the formation of life is possible. Given that the universe is so vast and there is so many opportunities for life to form, it is probable that life exists somewhere else. 

My problem with this arguement is that it disregards the probability of life forming. To estimate probabilities, we must know (a) the amount of habitable planets AND (b) the probability that life forms on these habitable planets. While we have estimates for (a), we have NO idea about (b) (other than it is greater than zero)! Anything else is pure speculation. 

For instance, say that the number of habitable planets is roughly 10\^20. Lets say that the probability of life forming on any planet is 1/10\^16. In this case, sure I would agree that it is probable that life forms. In fact, I could quantify my degree of belief by calculating the probability. On the other hand, lets say that the probability of life forming on any planet is 1/10\^25, then I would say that is not likely that life does exist outside of Earth. What if the number was 1/10\^30? Now, why should I believe that the probability of life forming is 1/10\^16 rather than 1/10\^30 or visa versa? 

Although we can try to look at each factor which is a necessary condition for life to occur and try to compute probabilities for each, then run the calculation for all conditions to happen at once (such as good star, decent sized planet, atmosphere, water, etc), I feel as though this arguement falls flat because we don't actually know how our own life originated on planet Earth. That is, we shouldn't pretend to know all the the necessary conditions for life to exist, much less their accurate probabilities. 

To make it more concrete, Frank Drank famously devised the [Drake Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation): 

>N = R \* fp \* ne \* f1 \* fi \* fc \* L  
*N*¬†= the number of¬†civilizations¬†in the Milky Way galaxy with which communication might be possible (i.e. which are on the current past¬†light cone);

>and

>R= the average rate of¬†star formation¬†in¬†our Galaxy.  
fp¬†= the fraction of those stars that have¬†planets.  
ne¬†= the average number of planets that can potentially support¬†life¬†per star that has planets.  
f1 = the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point.  
fi¬†= the fraction of planets with life that go on to develop¬†intelligent¬†life (civilizations).  
fc¬†= the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases¬†detectable signs of their existence into space.  
*L* = the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space

Since we are interested in the whether life exists somewhere out there, we are interested in:

>N \* number of galaxies / (fi\* fc \* *L*) = number of galaxies \* R \* fp \* ne \* f1  
(assuming that our galaxy is representative of other galaxies)

There is not a consensus of f1 among people - not that is backed by science anyway. Because of this uncertainty about which life can form, it is more reasonable simply to conclude exactly that: We just don't know."

20,2024-06-04,CMV: AI art will be ultimately negative for humanity if we don't take steps to regulate it,u/ScientistOk8604,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d7sisn/cmv_ai_art_will_be_ultimately_negative_for/,changemyview,"

I believe AI generated images, or AI art, will be ultimately negative for humanity because it uses work from other artists, it doesn't democratise art and instead reduces it's value and it sets a dangerous precedence that can make humans unemployable in the future



AI requires the hard work from other artists to function and the models require large amounts of work to be fed into it for the models to work. I disagree with the notion that the AI is stealing from artists as the AI transforms the artwork, but I still think that the people developing AI should have asked the artists before using their art. AI's supporters make the argument that the fact that they posted their work online means that they consented to anyone seeing it. They consented to people seeing it, not for it to be scraped from the internet to create a machine that may ultimately completely destroy their career and the profession of art. 



The second argument for AI art is how it democratises art. I very much disagree with this sentiment as art is already democratised, all you need to make art is a pencil (or pen), a medium and time. People compare AI art to other technological advancements like DAWs in music, photography and digital art, these aren't alike to AI art as DAWs allowed the common person to use their musical skill to use many instruments that would never be used otherwise, photography still requires the skill of the camera operator to arrange and align objects to get what they want (I've heard someone call it ""painting with light"") and digital art allows people to create art with a few time saving additions (like layers and the fill tool), who does AI art open art to? people who can't draw? 



An argument I've heard for who can benefit from AI art is how it allows people with disabilities to create art and how it allows people to become artists without an opportunity cost. The first is condescending to disabled people as it implies 'oh disabled people need a machine to make art for them', which isn't true as Frida Kahlo, who was stuck in a wheelchair, was able to make art and Paul Alexander, who was stuck in an iron lung, was able to become a lawyer and write a book (without ChatGPT). The second is incredibly laughable as the opportunity cost (or time spent learning) is what makes art valuable and admirable as a skill. Imagine applying the same logic to other professions:

Oh this escalator up Mount Everest will democratise climbing to allow people to climb it without the opportunity cost

Oh this punch-inator 9000 will democratise martial arts by allowing people to punch as hard as Mike Tyson without any of the training or opportunity cost



I actually think this will make art less valuable as it'll make it so people will initially think ""oh this is just made with AI"" rather than amazement that a human has the skill to make that kind of art. 



The final argument against AI is how it will replace artists en masse. I've heard 2 arguments against it:

1. AI sucks at certain things and can't be creative so if you got replaced with AI you probably suck

2. This is just the nature of automation

The first only really applies to high art, because most art isn't in art galleries, it's in the designs of floors, walls, bags, cards, book covers, and so many other things, and these things are prime examples of things that can be easily replaced with AI. AI may have weaknesses now (like hands, firearms, anything mechanically consistent) but don't forget that 5 years ago this was fantasy, hands have been improved incredibly with AI over the last year, who knows what AI will be able to do in 5, 10 or 20 years? Human artists are also at a massive disadvantage as they cost minimum wage while AI costs just a subscription and is orders of magnitude faster due to being made of lines of code rather than flesh.



The second sets a dangerous precedence as you can very easily apply the same logic that ""it's just the nature of automation"" to every profession on the planet when AI gets to them. An argument made is that ""AI will replace some jobs but it'll create new ones"", which may not be true as most of the most popular jobs existed in some form before the industrial revolution, so this means that automation hasn't created more jobs for people, it forced people to go into other professions



I know that automation is the reason why we can live the lives we can live now, but I look at the trend and see the end of employment and think ""maybe we should stop?"""

And most of these videos are shorts, which means that a viewer doesn't even SEE their ""credits"" without clicking the description.

  Sometimes (by which I mean almost every example I've seen, and I scroll through shorts for hours every week) the original video only gets hundred of views and barely anyone commenting, but when one of these accounts takes their videos and twists the truth into something slightly or comepletely different, they get millions of views. 

  If they simply want to bring more attention to either themselves or the original creator, then at least it's legal. But of more than half the cases, they ise the views and popularity to do ads, which means getting money, and earning money by using other people's videos without their consent is just a downright CRIME. The worst thing is, they almost never get charged for it or even get noticed by anyone, and even if the original creators sees and tells them to stop (which has happened multiple times), nobody will see and nobody will care.

  Also, just so I am clear, I don't mean any specific person, team or account; what I'm talking about is the general idea of using other people's content for money and only putting their name or a link to their account somewhere people don't directly see.  "

Let me elaborate a bit on what I mean on this with a few points. 

1. After all the bullying, exclusion, and general mistreatment I've had to endure in my life, I feel like it got to a point where I wanted to ""show"" everyone that they were wrong to do what they did and that they were wrong about me as a person. Some of these things included getting married at a prime age and overachieving academically and financially as a way of giving them the middle finger and send them the message that they were wrong about me.

2. Going off of the last point, I never understood how some people, like my cousin (36F), who is an utter failure in most aspects of life, don't care what others think when she not only suffered being a lonely nerd in university, but also has nothing to show for it since she had a pathetically mediocre wedding and got married to someone 12 years older than her and is now expecting her first child at such an old age. Sure, she has a managerial position in a pharmacy, but there are people more successful than her financially that aren't romantic failures as well, yet she somehow seems okay with everything, which is absolutely inconceivable to me.

3. I feel like the clich√©d advice of not caring about what others think only applies to privileged people that are attractive, rich, or were fortunate enough to have their self worth ""given to them"" by society, NOT people like myself who suffered and have to fight for respect from others and even for respect within ourselves. 

So yeah, I suppose what I'm looking for are points as to why others' opinions of me shouldn't matter, since I'll admit that it's one of the main things that's making me not want to do the things I genuinely would like to do in my life for myself and not for others."

So let's get to the point. I live in California, so let's use that as it example. Imagine a scenario in which a sect of native americans decided that they want to decolonize California. They go from town to town murdering children, raping women, and kidnapping people into their dense cities. I'm sure you can understand their anger, and resonate with their cause. What is stopping you from joining them. Will you raise mass protests to cheer them on? Are you still refusing to condemn these soldiers? Are they still freedom fighters for you? Will you still maintain this point of view, as they are murdering people closer and closer to your town? When they come and murder you and your family, are they still freedom fighters for you? If the government came to fight them, are they still monsters in your eyes? If you believe that it is important to stop them, will you not send armies into their dense cities, and go door to door looking for the kidnapped people? Given that your freedom fighters fights wear civilian clothing, and are protected by the local population, do you think you can succeed doing this without getting civilians killed? If you are one of the people refusing to condemn Hamas (or give vague and elongated answers when asked that question - like saying ""you are asking the wrong question""), will you equally refuse to condemn these people? Will you be equally vague with your answer that what they are doing is wrong? or will you do everything in your power to guarantee that people like that never get to commit another murder again? If you felt that their actions are wrong when it was in your home, but permissable when it was done other people, would you consider this behavior bigotry?

I want to start by defining my terms because I find that this subreddit often gets hung up on definitions, and that's not the point of this post. I think these definitions fit well with what I'm trying to communicate:

[Plot Hole](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/plot-hole)

>part of the plot (= story) of a movie or book that does not fit with other parts of the plot

[Continuity Error](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/continuity/index.html)

>A continuity error is a lapse in the self-consistency of the scene or story being portrayed.

In my own words, a plot hole is something that is inconsistent based on a logical analysis of the events, while a continuity error is when *explicit* truths established at different points in the story contradict each other.

By these definitions, I would consider a continuity error to be a kind of plot hole, though a plot hole is not necessarily a continuity error. Here's a table that demonstrates my classification:

|Example|Categorization (most specific applicable)|Explanation|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A book on a table moves between a scene transition that is implied not to represent a passage of time.|Continuity Error|Showing the book initially was something established to be true. The next scene contradicts the established truth without any plausible cause of the effect.|
|A character needs clarification about something their background indicates they should know about or knows about something without a clear cause of this knowledge.|Plot hole|While the character's knowledge was not explicitly established, it is not logical that the character does not have the necessary expertise for their established background or previous feats.|
|A knowledgeable character gets an important part of history wrong, but when they are proven so, there is no indication that other characters recognize this or change their idea of the ""wrong"" character.|Plot Hole|While a character saying something does not necessarily indicate it is true, a character who is trusted as an expert being incorrect, so crucially should modify that trust in most cases or at least lead to a confrontation or change in the thoughts of other characters. Most should also be attentive enough to realize the contradiction.|

# The View

Commonly, a plot hole or continuity error in a story is seen by the audience as a weakness‚Äîsomething that should be looked over for enjoyment‚Äîa dirty spot on the otherwise generally clean narrative. For some, this will actually destroy some part of their enjoyment of the story, depending on how much suspension of disbelief they have.

In contrast, I believe such inconsistencies represent an opportunity to expand the lore/narrative or serve as fuel for intrigue and fan theory. When creators recognize the mistake they made, they should be able to add to the story's context to make it make sense, and, as a side effect, they get a new story element to use.

To illustrate this, take my first example, the book moving between scene transitions. Since it is not explicit that no time passes between scenes, some events could be inserted between the transitions that are mentioned at a later point in the story to demonstrate their existence. Perhaps the book is something important to the story that even the characters overlook and only realize the importance when they happen to pick it up again.

Another possibility is that the book's moving could be the effect of unseen characters observing or manipulating the events. Maybe someone was secretly in the room previously and accidentally knocked over the book in their rush to get away. This is more interesting than the other example, in my opinion, because it introduces an entirely new character relevant to the story. This character now has behavior, and the creators can fill in the backstory, motivation, and personality to create an entire subplot or even a spin-off.

You don't have to explain it immediately‚Äîin fact, I recommend you leave it unexplained for some time. This allows audience members to pick up on the details and use their own creativity to engage with your work by creating theories. If a theory is correct, it satisfies those who subscribe to it. However, even if it isn't the way the creators decided to go, the process of creating and discussing the theory in itself is enjoyable.

As an example, take [this theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1be88e7/marvel_i_humbly_present_to_you_my_dumbest_fan/), which posits that the first Iron Man movie does not take place in the same universe as the main one of the MCU, substantiating the claim with a recast (a variant of continuity error) and inconsistencies in how universes are referred to both in-universe and in non-mainline MCU media.

It's a creative way to answer a question that has long been considered by the community with plenty of debate. And, while the OP is self-aware that it is ""dumb,"" I certainly enjoyed it, it was well received by the community of r/FanTheories, and I presume that the OP likes their own idea as well. None of that would be possible without the plot holes, retcons, and continuity errors in the MCU.

# Conclusion

While plot holes and continuity errors are often seen as weaknesses in a story, they can actually present opportunities for expanding the narrative and engaging with the audience through fan theories and creative solutions. By embracing these inconsistencies and using them to add depth to the story, creators can foster a more interactive and imaginative relationship with their audience. This approach can lead to a more enjoyable and satisfying experience for both the creators and the fans. Embracing plot holes and continuity errors as storytelling devices open up new possibilities for enriching the narrative and fueling fan engagement."

2,2024-06-04,CMV: There no foreseeable solution for the I/P conflict for the next 80 years at least.,u/roydez,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d7yljt/cmv_there_no_foreseeable_solution_for_the_ip/,changemyview,"Preface: I'm a Palestinian citizen of Israel fluent in both Hebrew and Arabic who regularly reads mainstream Hebrew and Arabic news and have a bunch of Israeli and Palestinian friends whom I follow on social media I also live in a mixed city. I've also read most major reputable surveys and opinion polls. I (humbly)consider myself well-informed on the subject. Before you get outraged I don't deny any bias though I'll try to be as neutral as possible.

Root of the problem: Irreconcilable differences held by the overwhelming majority opinion both by Israelis and Palestinians, and unfathomable disdain, distrust, hate and racism towards each other. Both Israelis and Palestinians have a very deep conviction that all the territory between the river and sea(the British Mandate lines lol) rightfully belongs to them. The belief that this territory is called Israel/Palestine and belongs to your national group is the essential characteristic of the national identity for both Palestinians and Israelis. Both sides have popular slogans and poems espousing this belief. None of the historic negotiations lead to a lasting fulfilling resolution precisely because of this reason. Because compromising on this principle is viewed as an ultimate betrayal of your national cause and no Israeli/Palestinian leader was able to successfully convince his people to compromise on this principle. The closest thing to a compromise on this principle was the Oslo accords which lead to Israel's Prime Minister Rabin being assassinated and the rise of Bibi and the far right(Bibi led an immense hate incitement campaign against Rabin going as far as distributing leaflets of Rabin in an SS uniform and gave his famous ""we will never accept the partition of Jerusalem"", and ""I'm anxious for the future of my children"" speeches). Nowadays the Oslo Accords are generally viewed as the ""Oslo disaster"" in the mainstream Israeli society because Bibi has been fervently working to reverse them and has continuously propagandized against them during his tenure all these years. It is also worth nothing that much in the same way Hamas also viewed the Oslo Accords as a disaster and a national betrayal and capitalized on this and dramatically escalated its violence and attacks on Israelis to fuel nationalistic fervor and sabotage the peace process. It was very much a joint effort by both Hamas and the far-right in Israel to sabotage the peace agreements. Anyone who says only one side is responsible is knowingly lying.

People will point out to other proposals and negotiations over the years but none were done properly or in genuine good faith as the Oslo Accords and it's obvious to anyone with a bit of critical thinking that the other negotiations were mostly done for optics or political leverage or international pressure; and both Palestinians and Israeli leaders deep down wanted them to fail because they know it's impossible to agree on a satisfactory resolution. The landscape changed significantly since Oslo and it was a historic opportunity which was missed. Since then the populations only radicalized and shifted more to the right.

On top of the irreconcilable difference there's the endless trauma and suffering due to the violence. Most people have lost property and a relative/friend/loved one to this conflict. The dehumanization is off the charts due to massive propaganda campaigns and the abundance of media evidence material of Palestinians/Israelis acting like total assholes. Both sides are fed a 24/7 propaganda dehumanization campaign of the other side. Ask your average Israeli what he thinks of Palestinians and he will say ""Nazis"". Ask your average Palestinian what he thinks of Israelis and he will also say ""Nazis"".

I'll now talk why the commonly suggested solutions have no such chance of working in the upcoming future:

Two State Solution: A short [look at a map](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/22/israel-largest-west-bank-settlement-blinken-visit/) of the West Bank should be enough to demonstrate why a two-state solution is currently a fairy tale. Settlements are scattered all throughout the West Bank precisely in a way to make an establishment of a Palestinian state an impossibility. Palestinian territories are divided into disconnected enclaves surrounded by settlements. Hundreds of thousands of settlers live in those settlements some of which are cities connected by highways to Israel. Palestinian territory is not contiguous and it's simply not possible to draw coherent lines for a sovereign Palestinian state without evicting hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers which is never going to happen voluntarily. 63% of the WB(area C) is under complete Israeli rule and nowadays has more Israelis living in it than Palestinians. Obviously the settlers will never agree to be part of a Palestinian state. Gaza and the WB are landlocked and divided by Israel which is another massive hurdle. The Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2005 with less than 10k settlers like Oslo is also viewed as a disaster and they blame it for the rise of Hamas in Gaza and is commonly espoused as a reason why retreating from settlements and seizing control is non-productive and only leads to terror and insecurity. Hamas also marketed the Gaza withdrawal as proof why only armed resistance works pointing to the WB where no withdrawal was made. Another thing worth noting is that the disputed area is very small. How do you divide control over aerial and naval space when it only takes a few minutes to pass that aerial space? There's no trust by Israel to let Palestinians control airspace in which Israeli airplanes will fly which means Israel will only theoretically accept a demilitarized state in which it oversees security. Palestinian will not accept this because Israel security forces for them is the definition of insecurity from which they have PTSD.

One State Solution:
Personally, this is my dream solution one secular democratic state between the river and the sea in which Israelis and Palestinians can both live freely and securely wherever they want. Jerusalem, Akko, Haifa, Jaffa, the beautiful ancient cities beloved by Palestinians and Israelis alike are open to everyone to visit and live in. Unfortunately, this is a pipedream only amongst fringe leftists and peace activists. It's even less popular amongst Israelis and Palestinians than the impossible non-popular Two-States solution. Israelis won't ever willingly give up their Jewish majority and the Jewish characteristic of the State which every main stream of Zionism considers necessary and a goal for the continued existence of Israel as a Jewish state. Palestinians won't ever accept the state being Jewish as they consider this racist and the main principal reason behind their oppression. It is their biggest opposition to the Israeli state ""why does it have to be Jewish?"". There's also an obvious risk of a major civil war and anarchy if a one state solution is implemented in the current state. Palestinians and Israelis won't suddenly start collaborating with each other and each national group would start wrestling for control due to distrust of the other. It is worth noting however that the reality right now is much closer to a One-State than a Two-State. The economies are intertwined and people are living close to each other and Israel defacto controls most of the territory. With time it will become impossible to escape the apartheid accusation but it's a very slow burn. Most Palestinians in East Jerusalem still don't have Israeli citizenship and that territory was annexed in 1967. And that's in the *capital* with a much smaller Palestinian population than Gaza or the WB. The international community not being consistent with what it wants is also slowing this down. It simultaneously advocates for a two-state solution and a one-state solution when advocating for one hurts the prospect of the other.

Three State Solution: There was a time when I thought WBers to Jordan and Gazans to Egypt with force and billions in bribes was a somewhat realistic possibility considering how strong Israeli domination was perceived prior to 7th of October but after seeing this not materialize after the 7th October when Israel had the biggest opportunity ever to capitalize on it I concluded that this is an impossibility in the foreseeable future.

Lastly, please don't jump on me I know I have my biases and I'm not pretending this is the most neutral view on the conflict(It's on CMV and I hope someone can convince me of a more optimistic outlook). I know Israelis will disagree with how I'm presenting things and will feel that I'm understating or overstating some things. I'm not a scholar just your average dude. I would in a heartbeat scrap both Israel and Palestine and replace them both with a different concept entirely if it would lead to a cessation of people burning each other alive, and bring peace to ALL people living here. Peace."

I couldn't help but notice that the poorer the parent is, the less involved they are. I had so many students coming to school without their homework. I phoned and emailed all of the parents to speak about the situation, but the vast majority did not intervene. I only had a few parents meet with me face to face at parent-teacher conferences. The rest didn't know (or care) that their child wasn't doing what was required of them. I had to fail 1/4 of my entire class and sent them to summer school.

I currently teach at a school that is located at an upper-middle class community. Instead of dealing with uninvolved parents, I am now dealing with helicopter parents. I am in communication with pretty much all of my students' parents. They are constantly on top of their child's progress and are always making sure their child is doing everything that is required of them. The vast majority of my students don't come to school without their homework on them. THAT is parenting done right. A child can't properly learn unless he or she practices the problems that were taught in class.

You're probably going to say, ""but those parents had no time because they were working multiple jobs!!"". Since when is a poverty an excuse for neglect of any sort? They decided to have kids, so it is their job to figure it out. If they can't do that then they shouldn't have had kids."

I spent 50% of the time trying to get them to take their education seriously. Most just did the bare minimum. There were a few good ones here and there but they were a rarity. I couldn't help but blame the parents. The parents are not a actively involved in their child's education. How do I know this?

It‚Äôs like saying that a man should be forced to defend the country from threats, but we still supply them the weapons, ammunition, supplies and support them. It‚Äôs still not respecting bodily autonomy or consent.

Likewise, woman have the right to revoke consent from childbirth and pregnancy despite whether or not there‚Äôs high chances she can raise the child. People forget that pregnancy takes a toll on your body. Why should a woman be forced to risk health problems associated with pregnancy just because the resources to raise the child are there? Also, who determines what is enough to raise a child on? 

Let‚Äôs also not forget most women don‚Äôt want to care for a rapists child. Even if she could raise it with government assistance, we would be sending a message saying that her consent doesn‚Äôt matter. Tell me why a woman not consenting to sex is not seen with controversy, but suddenly a woman not consenting to pregnancy makes her a murderer? Why aren‚Äôt we viewing both of these as equally disturbing? They both have severe consequences for the woman!

In conclusion, the consequences of having a child and denying women abortions are not patched up just because you supported the child outside of the womb. Otherwise, this backwards logic would dictate that consent and bodily autonomy don‚Äôt matter as long as we give the victim resources for something they never wanted in the first place.

277,2024-06-04,CMV: Castle doctrine is a good idea. Stand your ground is not.,u/BiryaniEater10,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d8308p/cmv_castle_doctrine_is_a_good_idea_stand_your/,changemyview,"With castle doctrine, the point is that you have a right to defend yourself in your home. It essentially says, well, in the home, we don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre lying or telling the truth about an intruder being a threat, so we will give you the benefit of the doubt because it‚Äôs your property. Also, this includes the fact that you‚Äôre unlikely to be able to retreat safely in your home, so you may be even more justified in using lethal force. 

Stand your ground is essentially castle doctrine but just apply it everywhere. But it is that application of it everywhere that is the exact issue in my book. First off, in public, you don‚Äôt have anymore right to be there than the person you believe is attacking you, so you should not be able to be the one who decides if your life is in danger or not. Additionally, it is generally much easier to retreat in public than in your home. 

Another thing is that stand your ground can be easily abused. Someone can just shoot someone and tell the police that the person they shot did x or y. 

Now, if someone does retreat and then has no choice, or is unable to retreat, then yes, deadly force is fine but this is true in all 50 states and doesn‚Äôt need a stand your ground law.

It makes sense that you can defend your castle without needing to retreat, but the entire world was never your castle.

0,2024-06-04,CMV: The majority of gay men are sex predators,u/Danieloureiro,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d83ryk/cmv_the_majority_of_gay_men_are_sex_predators/,changemyview,"
I used to be fine with homosexuals. I voted in favor of legalizing gay marriage in Washington state before it was federally legalized. I found most things associated with ‚Äúpride‚Äù and the public displays to be rather disgusting and crass, but I ultimately didn‚Äôt care.

In the last few years, I‚Äôve become a magnet for gay men trying to violate my consent in one way or another. Most commonly, they try (and fail because I verify everyone) CONSTANTLY to catfish me. They pretend to be a woman, with no regard to my consent whatsoever. They don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm explicitly seeking a woman. They don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm straight. They don‚Äôt care that I don‚Äôt want men. All that matters to them is satisfying their disgusting urges.

When this happens to you 10-15x per day, every single day, it opens your eyes up.

Now I see things like: **47% of homosexuals ADMIT to being molested as children** (meaning that number is much higher in reality than is being reported). Anyone who knows anything about criminal deviancy knows that often (not always) a victim goes on to become a predator, perpetuating the cycle of abuse. The fact that more than half of gay men (maybe significantly more) have been molested, and the question of whether or not that influences their homosexuality and whether or not that makes them a higher risk group to be a predator, is not allowed for discussion anywhere. I‚Äôm 99% sure the mods will remove this post.  **(Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11501300/)**

I also see the sex offender registry. In relation to their share of the population, the 2SLGBTQIA+ community is overrepresented on the sex offender registry by 5x in proportion to their share of the population. 4% of the US population identifies as LGBT, whereas 20% of the representative sample of the sex offender registry identifies as LGBT. **(Source: https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgbtq-sex-offender-registries/)

The public displays of gay fetish and gay kink and gay sexuality, and the insistent NEED that seems to exist to expose children and adolescents to this, is also deeply concerning. But as usual, it is hand waved away by the people running cover for this community.

**The truly dangerous part** is that discussion of this sort is impermissible and even if it is tolerated, defensiveness and emotionality completely dominant the pro-gay side of the discussion.

So change my mind. I am a person whose view was changed diametrically because of the actions and behaviors of the group in question. You can and should and MUST judge people by their actions and behaviors, and I‚Äôve gone full circle from guy who would vote to enshrine gay marriage legally to guy who would vote to revoke that privilege (yes, privilege) in a second. This transformation took place over the span of about 14 years. Seeing the way this community behaves shocks and disgusts me. I‚Äôm not a victim and I don‚Äôt really care about a gay sex predator being too dumb to try to trick me into anything more than 5 minutes of small talk, but there are a ton of people being victimized every day because they don‚Äôt see how predatory this community truly is.

If you know you are gay and you commit to a heterosexual relationship without conveying that information to your partner, you are a liar and a genuinely horrible person. Both to yourself and your partner.

I would like to clarify that in this post I am strictly speaking about people that know they are gay BEFORE they commit to marriage. If you find out your sexuality later on in life, that's unfortunate for the other person but not your fault.

The single most important factor in a healthy relationship is trust. Withholding something as significant as, ""not being attracted to your partner"" is the ultimate level of betrayel.

Being born into an anti-LGBTQ+ family is not an exception. You have a moral obligation to not marry someone who is hetero and distance yourself from your family. I know that sounds harsh but that's how I feel.

A really popular show that addressed this was, ""Grace and Frankie"". A Netflix series about two middle aged women finding out their husband's have been together for the majority of their marriages and the fallout afterwards. 

On twitter I saw that people really liked both the gay husband's but I just couldn't bring myself to. When I looked at them I felt anger and frustration that they would do something so backhanded and disrespectful to their partners.

Before there was computers or electronics, there were mathematicians developing and studying concepts like trigonometry, calculus and complex numbers. At the time, they never considered what the real world applications of these formulas were. They were just trying to push the boundaries of knowledge of the academic community. These were people who made up a small fraction of the population, had no interest in doing a ‚Äúregular job‚Äù at the time (maybe a blacksmith or stable hand) and who were steeped in complex mathematical study from a young age. To get to that level of study, you have to start from a young age. More importantly, you need to put every student through those programs to see who is gifted and steer them on the right path.

Fast forward to modern times. All the technology we use, including ‚Äúregular people doing regular jobs‚Äù is based on the work of highly skilled mathematicians and scientists in academia. And the technical breakthroughs of the future, which will drive the economies of tomorrow will be derived from academics working today.

Back to school curriculum. In order for any country to have the edge on innovation, they need to have the edge on higher education. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the countries with the best universities also have the most innovative industries. If we stop putting a focus on complex math and science, we‚Äôre almost certain to lose that edge.

Do I think every student needs to learn complex maths up until graduating high school? No. I think once a student is around 14, if they have no inclination towards STEM fields that should be allowed to focus on trades or other less academic fields. But to find the next Tesla, Newton or Einstein who will push humanity forward, we do need to test every kid‚Äôs potential."

Besides that, going to the theater is quite costly. If I can't bring my own snacks then at least price yours appropriately. I have better food options at the house and better comfort.

It feels more and more like Google and FB are really trying to establish a permanent monopoly in AI for the next generation as if they are the inventors of this technology.

More and more we see them going to governments and getting them to create some AI that represents us as if they are the holy authority that we must bow down too.

Over and over again I see people like chairman of Google and FB executives who haven't really contributed anything major in the last three decades for any research, let alone AI - acting as corporate lobbyists while duping the public into thinking they are the godfathers of AI or something.

It is plain as day what they are trying to do and the governments are too stupid and ignorant to stop this or even talk to the public about it. This latest event in France being the perfect example of it.

When people like Sam Altman and other billionaires are planning to control AI with total monopoly, it doesn't bode well for the freedom and individuality and independence of the smart people in academia and industry and everyday folks as well.

Its time we stop this nonsense today for the generations of the future.

0,2024-06-04,CMV: GameStop Retail Investors Are Behaving Irrationally and the Associated Subreddits are Echo Chambers Causing Financial Harm,u/rimales,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d86tzo/cmv_gamestop_retail_investors_are_behaving/,changemyview,"Note: I currently hold GameStop shares, and I am not saying the company is doomed or that trading its stock is always bad financial practice. 

I am looking to change this view as if I do not I plan to sell most of my stock the next time it is around $35.00, and to use some of those profits to buy back in at lower prices and repeat this trend. 

While I intend to hold a few stocks, I think that I have been essentially tricked into bag holding for institutions flipping stock and am only not selling the last out of FOMO.

----
**Core Arguments:**

1. Individual shares rising from the current price range ($20 - $50) to a price at least 1 order of magnitude higher than the upper end of that range (~$500) is unlikely to occur within a reasonable timeframe (~3 years)

Supporting Points:

A. If there was a reasonably likely chance to achieve returns in line with these numbers there would be more institutional investment in GameStop that could easily directly register all shares. 

B. Based on the claimed impact this would have to the market, if somehow random people on the internet have figured this out and spent years shouting about it without others in investment institutions realizing it is correct and also investing,the US government will not allow multiple major financial institutions to be bankrupt to appease a few people on the internet. 

C. There have been several events that have been falsely hyped as the beginning of a squeeze,all have petered out at around the $50 dollar mark. If these were genuine it demonstrates that hedge funds have a reliable method to prevent the expected event, and they will continue to do so. Alternatively, this demonstrates that they are inaccurate about their predictions. 

2. The Reddit community around GameStop encourages individuals to hold stock well past any reasonably foreseeable price point. 

Supporting Points:
I dont think I need to do much other than point to the SuperStonk or GME Subreddits to support this point.

People regularly state their floor for a sale is 6 digit prices or higher.

Discussion of selling is immediately suppressed with heavy downvotes and bans.

Various ""special tricks"" get promoted as the last thing needed to make you rich. 

They constantly claim that they are being suppressed but if you look at top of the hour they are constantly flooding it. If anything remotely notable happens with the stock it is usually within the top 25 posts of the day. 

The subreddits have ridiculous account age and karma requirements to prevent dissenting comments. 

----
**What wont change my view?**
1. SuperStonk or GME ""DD"" about this stock. I don't have the financial expertise to pick them apart but I do not trust that random Reddit users have performed better financial analysis of this stock than 100s of hedge funds and 1000s of high net worth investors, and that if these were reasonably accurate that they would be ignored by these investors. 

2. Conspiracy talk. I'm not saying a conspiracy is impossible, but if one exists and has worked so effectively to suppress this institutional investment and keep the stock down it will likely continue beyond the control of these individuals. 
---- 
**Conclusion:**
The current discourse around GME is inaccurate and harmful to the individuals in these communities. 

GameStop invester Subreddits use cult like mentality and suppression of dissent.

GameStop investors should abandon a holding strategy and instead buy dips to 20ish and sell around 30-40 depending on risk tolerance. Those hoping to get rich quick should divest the majority of their shares at a similar price and not reinvest."
0,2024-06-04,CMV: Dating has morphed from getting to know each other to understanding each others' drivers A.K.A. what do they really want from me,u/Substantial_Bus4022,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d870rz/cmv_dating_has_morphed_from_getting_to_know_each/,changemyview,"Dating has morphed from fun activities where we figure out if we are compatible to learning how to filter people who are honestly interested in you with a genuine ambition for long term relationship from ones who are just shopping around / use you for...things / ego boosting / lonely / etc.

For men:

Dating is about passing through gates, men have two gates, one where you will be an ""eligible bachelor"" and one where you will be a ""promising prospect"". For the first one women look for physical features, your social status, lifestyle, financial stability, your career, masculinity, the activities you do. For the second one they look for more personal aspects such as similarities in the variation of humour, ambition, emotional stability, and others.

If you want to pass the first one you have excel to a certain extent, although after passing you can still be outmatched. For the second its about pure compatibility. Since OLD is mostly about showcasing the first batch...it gets more emphasis and hence the morphing outlined in the title. Major challenges include realizing that the relevance of the first gate has increased significantly, maturing in a way where you actually reach an ideal partner's level both as an eligible bachelor and a promising prospect, learning to realize if they have serious intentions with you, learning how to deal with the many forms of rejection, and understanding your own boundaries (if certain expectations make sense to you).

For women:

Dating is about passing through gates but mostly filtering and filtering correctly. Passing through gates as being in decent shape and be attractive. Men place a huge emphasis on looks because well they dont really care about most of the other stuff. Some they do, which are being kind, empathetic, loyal and playful...but not really more.

Women are on the receiving end so their task per se is in selection. Before the 2-3rd date most heavy lifting is done by the men, but thats why women have to use this time and pay attention. Obviously filtering for aggression, sexual innuendos, toxicity, abuse (emotional or physical) and as well as compatibility.

Major challenges include realizing the many forms and hidden signs of danger / abusive behaviour, learning to realize if men have serious intentions with you, understanding the specific needs which make women happy, and overcoming the ever lasting dilemma of ""is the grass greener on the other side?""

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I honestly think dating has morphed into a state where genuine connections are pushed to the back and danger detection, expectation questioning, boundary setting, intention detection were placed to the spotlight. 

This newly created social bubble has replaced general talks on do they make you happy to discussions on socially reasonable expectations and what behaviour can be socially accepted, the over analysis of every interaction and expectation so you get a generalised pseudo idea of the perfect healthy partner. By the time you figure out through tiptoeing around what partner is acceptable for you, you realize they dont even resemble the slightest what you are really looking for so you have to make cuts in your needs and expectations which just makes dating time consuming and taints it as it is."
157,2024-06-04,CMV: Health influencers who cause harm by knowingly spreading misinformation should be considered criminally negligent,u/ifitisntconnor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d87csm/cmv_health_influencers_who_cause_harm_by/,changemyview,"I‚Äôll start anecdotally; one of my family members has terrible thyroid issues that propagate a ton of symptoms, both physically and mentally. Although she has regular contact with a physician, she also works with a chiropractor and ‚Äúhealth and wellness expert‚Äù who advises the most pseudoscience bullshit i have ever seen. ‚ÄúNo, you don‚Äôt need medication, you just need these $100 fruit gummies to help your gut biome, and this special detox to help cleanse the toxins from your system‚Äù. As a result of this advice, not only has my FM spent a ton of unnecessary money on quackery, but her symptoms have grown worse as a result of her being told that alternative medicine will solve her problems.

This is something I also see more and more on social media and youtube. Self proclaimed health and wellness experts talking about magical juice cleanses, varying Ph levels of water, and all sorts of herbs and minerals that can cure everything from a stomach ache to brain cancer. If this advice were being offered in conjunction with actual healthcare, I don‚Äôt think it would be as much of a problem. Sure you‚Äôre spending lots of money on stuff that likely has zero effect, but at least an actual doctor is treating you at the same time. The main problem I have is that more often than not, people promoting these alternative treatments are actually oppositional to standard healthcare, meaning they advise everyone to AVOID proven treatment methods in favor of vitamin shoppe boloney.

While misinformation is hard to combat due to the free speech nature of the western world, I feel as though holding the sources of misinformation liable in instances where someone is harmed or killed due to it is not unreasonable. If you want to make a tiktok page where you tell cancer patients to skip the chemo and replace it with some mediterranean herb cocktail, then go ahead- but if people start dying because they took your advice over a doctors, then you should be held criminally negligent for providing false information in the first place."
135,2024-06-04,CMV: The term BIPOC is too redundant and ambiguous to productively contribute to DEI or social justice,u/superturtle48,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d87cww/cmv_the_term_bipoc_is_too_redundant_and_ambiguous/,changemyview,"I want to start off by saying that I consider myself very politically progressive and in support of DEI principles and initiatives, so I don't mean for this post to spark a debate about DEI. I'm frankly not very interested in hearing arguments against it.

What I DO want to discuss specifically is the term BIPOC. I have no issue with the constituent terms Black, Indigenous, or people of color, which are clear and make sense to me in the American context of race, which is the context I am familiar with and where I want to center the discussion. I've seen BIPOC arise since the 2020 protests after George Floyd's killing (protests which I very much supported), and the term is used in different ways that variably include or exclude different groups. Some use BIPOC to mean ""Black, Indigenous, and/or people of color,"" in which Asians and Latinos/Latines/Latinx would generally be included (yes I know the terms Latine/Latinx are also rather fraught and that some Latinos are White, but not the subjects of this post). On the other hand, some use BIPOC to mean ""Black and Indigenous people of color,"" in which Asians and Latinos would NOT be included.

I personally would prefer that speakers just be precise about who they are referring to - say the discrete terms Black, Indigenous, and/or people of color as you mean it. I understand that Black and Indigenous Americans are arguably the racial groups who have been subject to the harshest discrimination and oppression in American history, and I am definitely not against people talking about the circumstances of Black and/or Indigenous Americans that distinguish them from other people of color. But using BIPOC, with the different plausible meanings mentioned above, strikes me as alienating to Asian and Latino listeners who may not know if they are being included or not in the conversation (which has practical implications for programming like resource groups or scholarships designated for ""BIPOC"" - there are several posts in r/asianamerican from Asians with confusing encounters with the term). I also worry that it's alienating for generally moderate listeners of any race who aren't fans of jargony acronyms and may be turned off from the progressivism and the DEI cause entirely (DEI being another one of those jargony acronyms, but I digress) because of the head-spinning vocabulary. For a term intended to invoke solidarity, I wonder if it is doing the opposite.

For some more context, I'm Asian American myself and do consider myself a person of color, but I don't know if I'm supposed to identify as BIPOC or not and I have just avoided using the term altogether. I'm very open to learning more about the term to better understand why it has been picked up. Is there a use of the term BIPOC that is significant and distinct enough from other more precise terms to justify the existence of this new term? Am I misunderstanding its intended meaning? Is there any additional history I'm missing that would contextualize it?"

I think that when you're comparing dating for men and women in heterosexual romantic encounters, dating is significantly easier for women.

First of all, options. The average woman is much more attractive to the average man than vice versa, which means the number of men willing to date the average woman is much greater than the inverse. A typical rebuttal I see to this point is that it's like looking for water in swamp, which is coupled with saying men are looking for an oasis in the desert. This is strange to me because it implies that any woman is a good woman and the majority of men are bad men. I think it's probably equal numbers of good and bad men and women. Because of this, I would argue that even if the majority of women's options are bad, it's still a plus as a woman can sift through 20 options in a week. Men are waiting for their drip feeder to drop another option which could be bad.

I also think it's a lot easier for women because women typically play the passive role. Women usually aren't asking out because they don't have to. They don't have to risk rejection or humiliation. They're not forced to undergo a constant self examination of ""what's wrong with me"" following every single rejection like men are. And to top it off, women still have the option to approach if they wish. Men, aside from incredibly attractive men, only have the option to approach, so we struggle a lot more.

A point I see made is that women don't have easier access to relationships only sex, which again, makes no sense to me. A woman who has access to sex means a woman that is desirable. The whole reason dating is easier for hot people is because they're desirable and people want to be with them. That desirability doesn't make it harder. Women are just more desirable to men than we are too them."

If I told you that he rapes kids, you would instantly be angry and want him dead.

Even though if you think about it the person who beats kids isn't any better then someone who molest them. In a lot of those conservatives countries that have the death penalty for pedophilia, the laws basically never apply to people who only beat kids and in some cases beating your kids is an encouraged part of the culture.

I am anti Pedophilia (I think this goes without saying) but I think that a lot of ""anti pedo"" sentiment has kind of started to miss the forest for the trees. A lot of anti pedophile people don't actually care about children they just want someone they're allowed to hate. In fact Mamamax this big youtuber who made a huge career of exposing pedophiles (before it was revealed everything was fake) straight up said in one of his awful videos that he doesn't care about children and just likes hurting pedos. 

I admit I am keeping the post contents a bit brief because I like the actual discussion and I want to answer the questions people actually have not bloat the post with billions of hypothetical questions I think of. "

The most common example would be with coin flips; if a coin flips heads five times in a row, someone might think its more likely to land tails on the next flip. However, each flip is an independent event with a 50/50 chance regardless of prior outcomes. With that in mind, while its understandable that negative experiences with men lead to warranted caution, assuming all men are evil spawns of satan because of a few bad encounters is the gambler's fallacy. Each person should be evaluated on their own merits.

By automatically distrusting all men, these women are effectively treating individual men as if they are part of a predictable pattern influenced by their OWN previous negative experiences. This overlooks the individuality of people and unfairly projects the faults of some on an entire gender.Of course, I'm not suggesting that women shouldn't be cautious or that they should ignore red flags. It's vital to protect y. But distrust based on the actions of a few isn't a fair or effective strategy.

59,2024-06-04,CMV: Louisiana‚Äôs law approving surgical castration for criminals is wrong,u/clavitronulator,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d8bo49/cmv_louisianas_law_approving_surgical_castration/,changemyview,"A new Louisiana bill [introduced](https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-surgical-castration-sex-crime-offender-234cdd9da804382d90dec409756dc445?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share) by a Democrat and passed by the Republican state legislature should be vetoed by the governor, before judges are allowed to order ‚Äúmale or female‚Äù surgical castration of offenders against children (don‚Äôt ask me how female castration works).

Here are a few reasons why the bill is wrong:

* The Eighth Amendment applies to Louisiana. The amendment [prohibits](https://hrlr.law.columbia.edu/hrlr-online/death-wish-standards-for-deciding-to-waive-eighth-amendment-protections-against-cruel-and-unusual-manners-of-execution/) cruel and unusual punishment. The Supreme Court explains one of the ‚Äúbarbarities‚Äù the amendment intended to protect against was ‚Äú[castration](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/408/238/).‚Äù Regardless of [where](https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/facultypub/215/) you stand on chemical means, surely physical castration by court order is unusual or cruel. You don‚Äôt have to be an originalist to understand the framers‚Äô views on suffering like this.  

* The evidence that surgery as a medical treatment should be recomennded [isn‚Äôt clear](https://jaapl.org/content/jaapl/33/1/16.full.pdf), because the studies are difficult to design properly and there are [ethical and other](https://www.wsfa.com/2019/06/06/aclu-mandating-chemical-castration-could-violate-th-amendment/?outputType=amp) issues. It may reduce recidivism, but chemical castration [does also](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3565125/), and castration does not prevent offenders from physically being capable offending again. This likely barely scratches the surface of the medical ethics and costs involved. 

* It is [unseemly](https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2458&context=lr) for America to ‚Äúinnovate‚Äù in punishing its citizens by force, in a permanent and invasive way. The result has the [stench](https://www.mp.pl/auschwitz/journal/english/311389,x-ray-sterilisation-and-castration-in-auschwitz-dr-horst-schumann) of Nazi Germany‚Äôs worst offenses. 

The legislature did not present radical new findings about criminal justice, either, appealing to emotion over a sensitive subject, over our general sense. This ‚Äúoption‚Äù is not rationally or otherwise how victims should be recompensed, or probably want to be either.

This sort of extreme partisanship and groupthink is not productive.  We should be encouraging honest, good faith discussion with peoples recognizing that as individuals, we don't have all the answers.  Each of us brings a different perspective, shaped by millions of variables, to the table.

More and more people now are unable to afford basic necessities which all contribute to the collective suffering and mental health crisis we are seeing today. And the worst part is we are so divided that no one has a viable solution that everyone can agree to anymore. 

During the 2008 recession, President Obama helped repair the economy by applying a bunch of beneficial responses, such as the Recovery Act, that massively helped the economy grow to the great state it was in the mid-late 2010s. Back then, whenever there was a crisis happening in our country, it was handled swiftly and effectively.

The polls are currently close, and are expected to remain close until the election.

If Trump loses, he is done. He is scheduled to be tried for crimes that are much more serious than those he's already been found guilty of, and it is very conceivable that he will be found guilty again.

Because of this potential outcome, prominent Republicans in government and in the media will have to make contingency plans. These plans will involve making public statements distancing themselves from Trump. These people are primarily concerned about their own careers, and they do not want to be in a position where their success is tied to a ""loser"" (for lack of a better term).

These public statements will make their way through the population and will cause a nation-wide drop in support for Trump. Polls will then show this decline in Trump's support. This will be the critical point, after which Trump's support will plummet because no one will want to vote for a criminal who is predicted to lose (except his core base of devout followers which is around 25-30% of the population).

Biden will then win the election by a substantial margin."

I always hear how streaming services keep jacking up their prices, cracking down on password sharing, and generally pulling moves that make their customer base unhappy. But, coming from other hobbies, I personally feel that streaming services are surprisingly cheap for the content they provide. How this is a profitable model?

With video games, for instance, I expect to be paying between $15-40 per game (during sales), or $10-15 for an MMO subscription/battlepass (WOW, Runescapet, etc). Watching one movie - $7-15 per in-person ticket, or $5-10 for an Amazon Video digital rental. Cable TV today starts at $70/month in my area plus a cheap flatscreen to watch it on. Even the New York Times is $5 a month.

Meanwhile, streaming prices are anywhere between $8-12 with ads or $15-30 for the more premium options. And that's *everything in the catalog, for a month*.

You can't really do cheaper than that unless you're on YouTube or TikTok. And that's a totally different business model which profits off free user labor and advertisements.

With all that said, why do we call streaming expensive? $10 is barely enough to get you one takeout meal in most US cities nowadays. It's still a decent chunk of money and it adds up, but *everything* is expensive nowadays. One trip to Walmart or the drugstore for even basic necessities (pads, razors, shampoo, etc) and you're already well past $10. How is one shopping trip's worth of toiletries the same as 30 days of unlimited TV shows?

Coming from someone who hopes to find work in animation one day (and is watching the U.S. industry with dread), I can't fathom how studios are able to keep their doors open when consumers can buy viewing rights to their show AND over 100 shows of equal quality for ten bucks a month.

Why do we call streaming expensive? How does this profit model even work? Why shouldn't we charge more for entertainment that is so expensive to produce? Please help me CMV that streaming is underpriced."
23,2024-06-05,CMV: All drugs should be legalized.,u/LadyAyem,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d8hmnt/cmv_all_drugs_should_be_legalized/,changemyview,"All drugs should be legalized, in my own opinion, at least when following a Portuguese-inspired model, which is where drugs are able to be legally produced by the state and consumed in a safe, medically-supervised environment. This legalization does many things:



- Overdoses are far less likely to happen, as drug consumption happens in a supervised area.

- Cartels are mostly killed off by competition with the state

- Addiction and drug usage drops compared to a non-legal drug country (see Portugal for this example)

- Drug use stops being financially crippling, as the state can produce drugs at a far larger scale than an illegal organization ever could.



However, legalization alone cannot solve this issue, this is why the following measures must be made:



- All drug consumption is in a medical environment ran by the state through a cadet branch of whatever national Ministry of Healthcare runs state hospitals.

- Drug education must be taught in schools, letting citizens know the possible danger of drugs while also letting them know that, when of age if they wish to do so, they can safely and legally acquire drugs in a state-run recreational facility.

- Rehabilitation must be pursued alongside this policy. Drug addicts and drug addiction will never magically disappear under any policy, and thus rehabilitation facilities must be maintained alongside recreational drug facilities.

- Spending cannot be slashed for any prolonged period of time. In Portugal, the 2008 financial crash and subsequent economic setbacks caused their drug program's funding to drop by over 5 times, causing the problems of the system to be evident by around 2020-2023.

- While nearly all domestic cartels are eradicated by this policy, border security and checkpoints must still be enforced to combat foreign illegal drug cartels to prevent a spread of illegal, non-state managed drugs from being distributed among the populace.



With these proper policies on education, healthcare, border enforcement, and finances, the results of such a system are very promising. Let us look back at Portugal for this example:



""By 2018, Portugal‚Äôs number of heroin addicts had dropped from 100,000 to 25,000. Portugal had the lowest drug-related death rate in Western Europe, one-tenth of Britain and one-fiftieth of the U.S. HIV infections from drug use injection had declined 90%.""

""The cost per citizen of the program amounted to less than $10/citizen/year while the U.S. had spent over $1 trillion over the same amount of time. Over the first decade, total societal cost savings (e.g., health costs, legal costs, lost individual income) came to 12% and then to 18%.""



Not only did addiction, drug death, and disease infection sharply drop as a result of this policy and the required policies as mentioned above, but the program as a whole was far cheaper than simple inaction, as evident when comparing the per capita spending of the Portuguese drug ministry compared to what the United States had spent on an equal service but without doing as Portugal had.

Portugal arguably had a drug problem even worse than what America has, meaning they did not have easy footing to start this program out from. In 1999, Lisbon carried the moniker of the ‚Äúheroin capital of Europe.‚Äù Consequential diseases such as HIV infection reached an all-time high in 2000, with 104.2 new cases per million people. America today has around 118 HIV infectants per million people in total, let alone that rate happening within a year like in the case of Portugal.

In America, every single year, 1.16 million Americans are arrested and charged with crimes relating to drugs due to the failure of the system of criminalized drugs with little support for addicts. In a system described above, 1.16 million would not be charged with such crimes and be able to have the support they require.

Thus, I believe that following a Portuguese inspired model with the policies and results I have explained above is the most effective, cost-effective, safe, and humane way to combat drug addiction and crime so far, and the Republic of Portugal is an example of how it can succeed but also how it may fail without proper mechanisms to support it.

When I say that ""murder is wrong"" I'm simply saying something like ""boo murder"".

The neuroscience on this topic also seems to support this view. The parts of our brains that are linked to emotions, light up when we're making moral decisions.

I'm not sure exactly what would change my mind on this, given that we can't perceive or examine ""moral facts"" much like we can observe and study rocks or trees or galaxies. 

Nevertheless, I should say that just because this is the case, it doesn't necessarily diminish the importante and the meaning we give to morality."

Similar to games, you'd have people talking about twists in games like Bioshock they stayed up all night playing others didn't. People live tweeting reactions to show's debuting, etc. 

But now you see people crying about spoilers because a movie isn't on streaming yet. Or they're waiting for the whole season to drop so they can binge it, or they're waiting for the game to go on sale. 

I recently saw a post on twitter with Spoiler warnings for BG3, a game that's been out nearly a year, what they spoiled is something that happens at the very beginning of act 3. Something I got to in mid August of last year. I went hard on that game, but even people I know who didn't go hard have gotten there. 

Those aren't viable reasons to not be spoiled. If you care so much, there's ways you can hide content online so you don't see it. Heck maybe instead of doom scrolling reddit, facebook, or twitter, you could be watching what you're concerned about being spoiled. 

For me spoiler limits are. 

TV shows 1 week - When the next episode drops previous one is free to talk about. 

Movies 2 weekends. -Some people don't want to deal with opening weekend crowds, but if you want to avoid spoilers better hit it quick. 

Videogames 2 months, 2 months should be enough time to hit all key plotpoints. 

Finally, if the only value you get from content is knowing what happens in the end, then the journey wasn't worth it. It would mean you never rewatch or replay any content. Because the ending is ruined. Which is a wild way to live to me. "

Due to a unique condition, this person feels no physical sensations (like pain or heat) and no emotional distress. They are a true nihilist with zero expectations in life. Now, consider this person in the context of heaven and hell, which are traditionally seen as places of ultimate pleasure and ultimate suffering, respectively.

First, examine the characteristics of these places. Heaven is often described as a realm of eternal joy, free from pain and filled with happiness. Hell, on the other hand, is depicted as a place of endless torment and suffering. These descriptions are clearly based on what humans find most pleasurable and most dreadful.

Now, apply these concepts to our hypothetical individual. This person would not fear hell nor desire heaven because they do not experience physical pain or emotional distress. The conventional incentives to avoid hell and seek heaven lose their power for this person. Thus, the characteristics of heaven and hell appear to be tailored specifically to human sensory and emotional experiences.

Next, consider the implications of this. If the concepts of heaven and hell are purely based on human sensations, what would they look like for other beings? Imagine a dog believed in heaven and hell. A dog's heaven might be an endless field of fascinating scents and opportunities to play, while hell might be isolation and a lack of sensory stimulation. For a bat, heaven might be a cave full of rich echoes and abundant insects to eat, while hell could be a silent, empty cave.

These differences suggest that the depictions of heaven and hell are not universal. They are human constructs based on human experiences and what humans fear and desire most. This lack of universality implies that the concepts were created to reinforce certain ideologies and behaviors within human societies.

Consider further that even among humans, different cultures and religions have varied depictions of heaven and hell. These variations are influenced by cultural, environmental, and psychological factors specific to each society. This diversity supports the idea that heaven and hell are not absolute truths but rather constructs designed to guide behavior and maintain social order.

In conclusion, the hypothetical individual who cannot feel physical or emotional pain reveals that the concepts of heaven and hell are intrinsically human-centered. These constructs reflect human sensory and emotional experiences and are not universally applicable. They serve to reinforce specific ideologies and ensure their persistence over time."

But ultimately, isn‚Äôt the main team goal for all of us fellow passengers to get where we are going as safely and quickly as possible?

Imagine if people seated in the rear of the plane boarded first, walked all the way to the back, and could futz with their bags and stuff way back there where they aren‚Äôt blocking all the other people boarding who are seated in rows further up. Literally everyone could board as quickly as possible and get to their seats immediately without waiting for other people to get out of their way and sit down, or having to go against the entire flow of people boarding.

As far as overhead bin space, I assume all first class, business class and other premium class passengers already have reserved space. Maybe they‚Äôd make it an upcharge to guarantee bin space, but it would be worth it for the benefits of all planes boarding and leaving more efficiently and reaching their destinations faster. 

I know airlines do it the way they do because it makes rich people feel superior to board first. There are many solutions. 1) Just use common logic and explain that we will get to our destination faster this way 2) have a separate door so coach and first class can board simultaneously or 3) offer some kind of ritzy lounge and other perks at the gate, so rich people feel superior about the fact that they DONT have to board early and sit on the plane for longer."

For someone on the left of politics, to do this is horrible on multiple fronts. First, it is outright immoral to implement such policies and a complete antithetical to what America stands for. Second, it proves that the Republicans are ""correct"", that the solution their proposing is the only solution, thus feeling vindicated and bolstered from it. Third, more Democrats will now think this policy is actually necessary and is not as immoral as they though, which means the Overton Window on immigration policies is shifting to the right. Fourth, as a result of this shift, voices of the more extreme Republicans will be strengthened as Republicans still need to differentiate themselves from the Democrats.

Which science seems to believe is important as maintaining cognitive agility can delay or mitigate the effects of aging-related conditions such as dementia.

Moreover, AI can offer personalized educational experiences that are often more flexible and accessible than traditional learning environments. Platforms that use AI to adapt content based on an individual's learning pace and style can be particularly beneficial for older adults who might be reintegrating into education or exploring new interests. 

Finally, AI technologies in healthcare are becoming pivotal in monitoring and managing health conditions that are prevalent among the older population.

1. Safety 

Often women report that a man approaching them wasn't necessarily about how charismatic etc he was but more so about Safety. If they turned him down or even accepted would he follow her home , is he some weirdo  etc. 

2. It's a superficial engagement built purely on physical characteristics.You aren't approaching the woman because of her amazing personality or what have you but merely because of certain physical characteristics caught your interest. 

3. Superficial engagements aren't how relationships usually start. Most people meet in school, at the job /co-worker , friend of friend and church . These are spaces where you can casually meet people and engage without any expectation whatsoever of a relationship. Superficial engagements quite often just don't work in the long run.You won't hear your parents or grandparents saying how they met their significant other aisle 4 of Walmart. 

4. Many women find it offensive for men they consider ugly to hit on them. Once again this is a superficial engagement. This isn't a person you can swipe on some app but real life superficial engagement so some women may feel offended 

5. Because of so many underlying factors the rejection rate is high meaning it serves to lower men's self esteem when it may have absolutely nothing to do with looks or even how charismatic you are . Because this is a superficial engagement men will hyperfixate on looks for failing 

6. Distance and living arrangements. Like I said most people meet their spouses in casual spaces they frequently meet at so factors like distance are often not an issue when getting to know each other because you are already meeting somewhere. When it comes to random superficial engagements at places you don't know how far this person traveled to get there , who they live with etc .

I go on about other factors but the main point is that superficial engagements don't work in the long run. What's proven to work is being in casual places where you speak to the opposite sex frequently like school , work , church and friends of friends to enter a long term relationship. "

I wish I didn't have to say this but I want people to focus on what I have to say and not say shit like ""your privileged so you just don't see the warning signs""

1: The demographics aren't there. the White population is declining in both numbers and influence. I remember Sweden was like the whitest white country imaginable as a kid and now I think POC are 25% of the population, white people just don't have kids. I am not in the mood to argue why but it's true. Unlike other groups they can't make up the difference with intermarrying because white men are not popular in the dating market. I am black right and I have so many white women who just simp for me, I have actually gotten sick of white women meanwhile I never see white men get simped for just for being white. White men are just kind of weak you know, they just don't got that dog in them.

2: LGBTQ acceptance is on the rise. I think like 25% of Gen Z is queer, how is the far right going to win elections against that ? They won't and more of Gen alpha will be queer.

3: Rise of feminism and women's autonomy, the far right vision kind of hinges on women being submissive and having families. Most women especially Gen Z and millennial women don't want that. I think among young people women actually make more then men, women can make great money on onlyfans while being a dude in today's economy isn't like that. The man vs bear meme went mega viral,barbie was the highest grossing movie in it's studios history. Let's keep it a buck most women don't actually love men for who they are but for what they can do for her. All of my female friends have told me this, my mom said this.

This can be attributed to various factors, including usability challenges, perceived relevance of new technologies, and economic considerations such as retirement and fixed incomes.

Also, the tech industry is driven by rapid innovation and frequent updates, which aligns less well with the purchasing habits of the over-50 demographic. This group tends to value durability, reliability, and ease of use over cutting-edge features or design innovations. For example, while younger consumers might chase the latest iPhone release, older adults might stick to older models or simpler devices that meet their needs without unnecessary complexity.  
  
Lastly, the focus of technology development itself often caters to the interests and lifestyles of younger consumers, who are seen as more tech-savvy and open to adopting and promoting new technologies through social media and other digital platforms.

The politics of the Barbie movie are very centered on upper class feminism. It strangely discounts the real concerns with fashion, materialism, and beauty standards to focus on patriarchy related to barbie. It kind of addresses them but does so half heartedly and often just makes jokes about it.  

As my wife explained, she has never felt oppressed because of her gender making minimum wage or not making a living wage at work because she looked around and saw a bunch of men working in the same jobs for the same pay as her with no opportunity to get promoted.

 The Barbie movie cares zero percent about this fact that the majority of women face and actually doubles down on it, by not only ending with Ken not having a defined role in society in Barbie land at the end of the movie but by dismissing the basic human desire for connection. It's like, it what world would anybody objectively think Barbieland is a just society at the end. The movie more or less just tells Ken to go away, not bother Barbie and figure himself out. 

If you think about what Ken did wrong, he just tried to have Barbies life...the movie doesn't fix this in the end and in fact even though the movie establishes that Barbieland is better off for having women in charge, Barbie maintains that power structure but still prefers the real world. Why?

TLDR: the politics of this movie take a stand against men but not the system. It wants women to replace men as oppressors. Greta Gerwig wants some women to have more power but doesn't care about all the other people left out....including the 99% of women who don't get to benefit from that privlidge....because she is rich and famous....

The politics of the movie are in continuity with what I consider a a massive anti-solidarity propaganda campaign in the modern media. The movie basically says women need to work together and gaslight men to get men to go to war against other men. It plays this off with a silly dance scene but these politics both would never work and are extreme at their core. 

It's not that I think patriarchy isn't real or that the behavior of men isnt a problem, it's that the Barbie movie distracts people for more concrete and impactful issues that effect both women and men alike. I don't think it's a coincidence that we have gone the longest time on the history of the minimum wage without an increase and that this kind of propaganda is just wholly accepted by society.

I consider myself a feminist (or a male feminist ally or whatever else you want to consider me) but I can't stand the message of the Barbie movie. To me, feminism should be rooted in tangible gains for women. This should include tangible gains for men making minimum wage/ who have insufficient housing/ who have insufficient healthcare/ etc. Not only because it's wrong to ignore the people who need the most help, but from a feminist perspective, women will benefit from men having less stress and better mental health."

Literally the only way Biden wins is if the same people who strongly disapprove of his job performance, people who strongly dislike him, decide to show up and vote for him anyway.

Silicon valley companies are driven by rapid innovation and frequent updates, which aligns best with younger people who are keen to try new products versus a more hesitant older population. That's why Silicon Valley companies like Instagram, Netflix, Snapchat target them and shun older demographics. There's more return on investment for younger populations.

903,2024-06-05,CMV: People who claim evolution is false almost never understand it.,u/KaeFwam,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d8vr7d/cmv_people_who_claim_evolution_is_false_almost/,changemyview,"In my experience and experiences I have heard from other people, individuals who claim that evolution is false or unproven rarely have a good understanding of the theory.

This can range from many different levels of understanding, but there is always a hang-up where the person in question fails to grasp the concept well enough to make any good argument against it.

I do not like the terms ‚Äúmicro‚Äù and ‚Äúmacro‚Äù evolution, but I‚Äôll use them here for simplicity's sake. These terms are problematic as there is no definitive line between the two. There are many different speciation concepts, all of which are arbitrarily defined thresholds.

There are those who flat-out deny that evolution happens at all, including microevolution. This is usually a position held by deeply religious people in my experience who also have no understanding of evolution at all and often no understanding of what a scientific theory is. Microevolution can be directly observed relatively easily in the wild and in lab settings.

Examples of microevolution can include insects evolving to become resistant to an insecticide or bacteria evolving to become resistant to a drug.

There are also those who accept that microevolution occurs, but deny the occurrence of macroevolution, which is often defined by the biological concept of speciation.

For starters, if we are defining the line between micro and macroevolution as the occurrence of biological speciation, we *have* observed macroevolution and consequently speciation. We can see examples of this in plants such as *Brassica oleracea* and bacteria such as *E. coli*, notably in the famous at the University of California.

As for massive phenotypical *and* genotypical changes, such as that from species such as Homo sapiens from other human species is impossible to observe within a human lifespan. This however does not mean we do not have massive amounts of evidence that proves that we are great apes that evolved from an ancestor we share with all life on Earth.

We have a large collection of fossils that are from transitional phases between different known species.

e.g.
Achaeopteryx
Ambulocetus

We can see vestigial structures in animals today.

e.g.
Hind legs in blue whales.
Tail bones in Homo sapiens.

We have observed vestigial structures in embryos as well.

e.g.
Tails in Homo sapiens.
Legs in whales.

We can compare DNA of plants, animals, etc. and see that the more closely related two species are, the more similarities can be found in their DNA. All life also shares similar DNA, further supporting common ancestry.

e.g.
Homo sapiens and chimpanzee DNA is ~99.99% the same, while Homo sapiens and mouse DNA is ~79% the same.

These are just a very few of the available examples.

Even lacking direct observation of these events, we still have very solid evidence to support them. Direct observation is also not required to prove the existence or occurrence of something, which is a common misconception from people who do not accept macroevolution. 

A well-known example of this was how Einstein predicted the existence of black holes in 1916, long before they were ever observed. But even Einstein didn‚Äôt do this first. Reverend John Mitchell proposed the idea of black holes in 1783.

We can also see the effects of evolution in other Homo sapiens populations. For example, if we take a person from Germany, where their ancestors would have interbred with people from all over the continent and a person from Japan, where their ancestors would have largely interbred with other people from the same area, we see some glaring differences, such as in facial structures. 

We also see genetic differences. A popular example is that many people in this area lack a functional ABCC11 gene, causing them to not produce underarm odor, as well as causing dry earwax. These are small differences, but the beginnings of larger evolutionary changes among different populations.

Given the massive amount of evidence we have to support the theory of evolution, it is basically impossible for one to have a good understanding of the theory while claiming that it is inaccurate. There is a common, but accurate phrase that the theory of evolution has more evidence to support it than the theory of gravity. It is one of, if not the most well documented, tested, and understood scientific theories."
0,2024-06-05,CMV:  I Believe 1+1 Might Actually Equal 1,u/TFT_TheMeta,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d8w8b6/cmv_i_believe_11_might_actually_equal_1/,changemyview,"Hello r/ChangeMyView,

As a data scientist with a deep interest in philosophy, I've recently been captivated by the notion that ""1+1=1"" could be more than just a mathematical absurdity. While it initially sounds nonsensical, I believe exploring this idea could yield insightful perspectives, especially in fields like mathematics, philosophy, quantum physics, and even ethics/politics.

Consider an example. If we combine two drops of water, we get one new (bigger) drop. When a sperm and egg combine, we get one zygote. 

**Mathematics:** In set theory, the union of two overlapping sets can lead to a situation where 1+1=1. For example, if Set A and Set B both contain the same single element, their union still contains just that one element. This idea could potentially redefine or expand our understanding of quantities and their relationships.

**Philosophy:** Metaphysically, consider identity and change. If two entities are so integrated that they are indistinguishable in essence, could they not be considered 'one'? This challenges our notions of individuality and separateness.

**Quantum Physics:** The principle of superposition and entanglement might support a 1+1=1 scenario, where particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously, or two particles can act as one entangled system with a singular state-dependent behavior across distances.

**Ethics/Politics:** In the context of social groups or collective identities, the idea that the sum of individual parts might achieve a unified identity (1+1=1) raises questions about the nature of individual and collective responsibility, identity politics, and the greater good.

Despite these musings, my colleagues and friends quickly dismiss these ideas as mere play on numbers or philosophical dead ends. They argue that in practical, empirical terms, 1+1 will always equal 2, and that entertaining anything else is illogical.

I'm here to have my view challenged: is there a substantive reason to consider ""1+1=1"" as fundamentally flawed or impractical across these diverse fields, or does it indeed offer a legitimate frame to re-evaluate well-established concepts? Your insights or critiques are welcome!

**TL;DR:** Believing in the potential of the idea that ""1+1=1"" across various intellectual fields. Change my view if you think this is just a trivial or erroneous contemplation.

Looking forward to your responses!"

The main purpose of pride month is to celebrate and highlight those that were historically marginalized for being, for a lack of a better term, sexually deviant from the norm. For people against celebrating pride month,  ""Where is our straight month?"" is usually argued ad nauseum. This is usually met by counterarguments stating that there is no point celebrating what has been the default and what is the superior position historically for many cultures. 

Thus it begs the question why this couldn't also be applied to men and patriachy which has been very dominant throughout human history. The equivalence is that men should not be celebrated with a Men's Day, because women are a far more marginalized group, and only Women's Day should exist.

To avoid hypocrisy, the latest conclusion I have is that either pride and straight month should both exist, or that men shouldn't be celebrated for being in a position of power historically with patriarchy and all.

To be frank, I'm disgusted by the conclusion I came up with and would really like my view to be changed, because it sounds really wrong."

That got me thinking that we're too risk averse and safety oriented as a society today. My idea is that it's fair to want to protect ourselves from some risks but we have to accept that risk is just part of living life and we can't stop enjoying ourselves or letting others enjoy life just because there's a very small chance something bad will happen. I'm really not a ""YOLO"" person and don't want to take or to encourage people to take reckless risks but small risks like sitting in a tree shouldn't be banned because there's a chance someone might fall and break something.

There's also helicopter parenting and it seems clear that parents are more and more overprotective of their children and in many places letting them ride go to school alone is less common. I'm not saying that everyone is like this but there's definitely more of it than there would've been 30-40 years ago is my take. 

Generally though I think people are less accepting of people taking risks and those people are called reckless or careless but I feel like ""no risk, no reward"" is a thing and you can't always be super cautious about everything. I'm not really talking about things like seatbelt laws where the slight inconvenience outweighs the risk (but that's debatable too of course) but mainly of things that are banned/regulated based on a single incident or on a very small chance that someone one day might get hurt.

- Both sides suck;

- All politicians are crooks and cannot be trusted / I hate all politicians;

- The whole system is broken and needs to go;

- Etc. 

However, I've yet to come across someone who says this and votes liberal / Dem. It's ALWAYS people who vote GOP / conservative saying this. After all, if it were actually true, you'd see more of a 50/50 split among people who say this and the way they actually vote. 

A careful distinction is the word ""equally"" - the premise held by utterers of this phrase is that both sides are THE SAME level of bad; that they're six of one / half dozen of the other. In other words, this would not account for someone saying something like ""yes, the Democrats are far from perfect and have their issues, but their awfulness does not begin to approach the awfulness of the GOP."" In that way, someone is saying ""both parties have their flaws, but they are not *EQUALLY* bad."" 

My theory is this line of reasoning is merely refuge-seeking for the minority of well-adjusted people who recognize that Trump is a uniquely horrible human being, and that many GOP policy positions are reactionary and retrograde, but for whatever reason (the way they were brought up, peer pressure, their financial position, etc.) nevertheless are looking for a way to rationalize and justify their decision to continue voting for Republicans. If you can convince yourself that the other side is ""equally bad"", then it causes less cognitive dissonance & shame & embarrassment when you ultimately pull the lever for the side that's demonstrably worse.

\- The Saddam regime in 1). Invading Iran (with the help of the west) in a brutal war where some wild warfare practices were used. 2). Invading Kuwait. 3) Repressing his own citizens and especially Shi'ites and Kurds minorities (Yes I know that Iranians and Kurds in other countries protested Saddam) but the Sunni's in other Arab countries just kept silent.

\- Speaking of Kuwait? How many of you knew that there are actually people indigenous to Kuwait and the government refuse to grant citizenship to. [The bedoon of Kuwait as documented here](https://bit.ly/3yHhhbh). Why don't Arabs protest for their self-determination like they do for Palestinians?

\- The war in Yemen that caused the biggest massive humanitarian crisis and was instigated by both Saudi Arabia and Iran, again no massive protests was seen in the Arab world to reach a ceasefire.

It seems to me that the only consistent thing here is that when the aggressor is not Arab/Muslim the protests are massively launched, even though Arabs have violated themselves to an arguably greater degree.

Another thing noticed inside the Arab discourse is that the holocaust existence is taken with suspicion and never embraced, same with the Armenian Genocide. Compare this with the war in Gaza where in most mainstream discourse it is referred as an unfettered genocide in Gaza.

Tell me in one instance a sizeable group of Arabs disapproved another Arab country/leader for a particular violation. I'm not talking about government officials, I will change my view if this instance pertained considerable members from society."
0,2024-06-05,CMV: Having zero ethics when it comes to dating will massively benefit a man.,u/darthplagueis032,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d921z4/cmv_having_zero_ethics_when_it_comes_to_dating/,changemyview,"Hey everyone,

This is my first time using CMV, so I don't know how it works, but here goes.

As a 31 year old man, I've had both short-term and long-term relationships with women in the United States, Asia, and Europe. I would add South America to that list, too, but god damn I was lazy as shit learning Spanish.

I believe having little to no ethics in the dating world can **objectively** benefit a man. If you simply don't give a shit about social mores, your results will proverbially launch into the atmosphere.

I'll list a few examples:

**Age gap relationships:**

I've dated dozens of American women in the 19 - 25 range, despite having a greater ""power imbalance"" over them. My dating life skyrocketed in Milwaukee and Chicago in my late 20s (e.g. 27 - 29). A majority of the women I dated were still in college and incredibly inexperienced in life. 

I'd 100% use my life experiences, crazy shit I've done at her age, etc to make me seem like a cool guy.

While a majority of my relationships were short-term (longest was six months), I still had no issues getting laid when I wanted. Compare this to the average man today who is struggling in the dating world.

**Being a ""passport bro"":**

At 29, I grew bored of the 9-to-5 and left my cushy position as a software engineer to become a freelance technical writer. Since I saved up a ton of money, but had little revenue coming in starting off, I traveled to countries like the Philippines, Thailand, Colombia, and Peru.

My dating life was **more** insane abroad than in the US. 

I had to work my ass off to get laid in Chicago/Milwaukee, but internationally, girls seemed to fall in my lap in Cebu City and Bangkok. It was nuts. I had dates lined up virtually every day of the week to no end. I've slept with so many Asians that I couldn't count.

Yeah, they were hoping for something long-term, but I couldn't care less about that.

Hell, even when I traveled to the Netherlands for a month, I felt like I had an easier time dating there than in the US.

**Cheating**:

I cheated on my girlfriend in Milwaukee and my girlfriend in the Philippines. Honestly, I didn't feel any remorse or guilt. Easy as that.

In the Philippines, I simply grew bored of Cebu City and wanted to experience Manila. I knew they had a 15 million population with a ton of hotties lounging about on Tinder, FilipinaCupid, etc.

My girlfriend at the time  was distraught since foreigners have a reputation in the Philippines. I explained to her that I wouldn't cheat and I simply wanted to check out the biggest, most famous city in the Philippines. After relenting, she let me go.

Of course, I did, but that's beside the point.

After returning, she kept questioning me until I simply grew bored of the Philippines as a whole and traveled back to the United States so I could nomad across South America.

**In conclusion**:

It's no secret I have zero ethics when it comes to dating. Then again, there have been zero social repercussions. The worst I've experienced was my girlfriend in Milwaukee tell me her dad ""didn't like me"". That's it.

So, the CMV is this: as a guy, **why should I have ethics in dating?** Convince me to care. Morals will not work. In my point of view, they only stifle men. Throwing buzzwords like sexist or ""gross"" does not work, either.

I simply will not care. I will continue my typical dating habits."
153,2024-06-05,CMV: Separatist movements are most often rooted in ethnonationalism. There is nothing inherently progressive about them.,u/JosephvonEichendorff,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d92beo/cmv_separatist_movements_are_most_often_rooted_in/,changemyview,"I want to preface by saying I obviously don't blanketly oppose all historical or contemporary separatist movements. The majority of countries on earth gained their independence from another country at some point. Often they had good reason for doing so (i.e. colonial oppression, cultural marginalisation, economic interest etc.) and there are several modern separatist movements (especially in authoritarian countries) that I sympathise with. So don't interpret me as saying that any particular country doesn't have a right to exist.

However, I do strongly disagree with the popular framing of these movements as being somehow ""progressive"" or ""left wing"", fighting for the liberation of their people, as most modern separatist parties claim. For the record, I wouldn't call myself a leftist, so I'm not trying to gatekeep leftism here, I just like to define words in meaningful ways. And if the left stands for international solidarity, multiculturalism, cosmopolitanism etc. well... separatist movements are usually directly opposed to all that.

If we look at Catalonia for example, on the surface you might think that separatist parties like the ERC and Junts are clearly left-wing (they use left-wing imagery and rhetoric after all) but if you actually look at what is driving Catalan separatism, it's a combination of linguistic nationalism, xenophobia and being richer than the rest of Spain. Even in Scotland, which I'd say has a more plausibly left wing independence movement due to it being poorer, you have to ask: what is ultimately motivating the desire for independence (other than opposition to the Tories)? It isn't just material disadvantage (Scotland is less poor than Northern England), it's an expression of romantic national pride and chauvinism. Not to say that's illegitimate, just that it's being dishonestly framed as a universalist fight against (virtually non-existent) oppression. The same goes for Quebec, where the supposedly left wing Parti Quebecois has become more and more explicitly ethnonationalist over the years.

  
Even in an case like Ireland and later Northern Ireland, where they had genuine grievances against the British government, the notion that Irish republicanism was ever actually a ""left wing"" movement (as many modern leftists like to believe it was) is belied by the fact that as soon as independence was achieved Ireland become one of the most conservative countries in Europe, led by the same people who led the independence struggle.  Today the same ""anticolonialist"", ""anti-plantation"" rhetoric that was used to oppose British imperialism is used by ultranationalists to oppose immigration, because ultimately that rhetoric was always xenophobic, it just happened to be directed against more powerful foreigners then and is directed against poorer foreigners now.

So, in summary, the usage of left-wing rhetoric by many separatist groups (particularly in western democracies) is deeply dishonest and hypocritical. I am open to considering how my characterisation of these movements might be mistaken, however, and am curious to hear your counterarguments."
0,2024-06-05,CMV: Foreign interference in —Ä–æliti—Åal —Åampaigns is not especially wrong.,u/tiltwolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d92drd/cmv_foreign_interference_in_—Ä–æliti—Åal_—Åampaigns/,changemyview,"In my country (Canada), there is a lot of media coverage and —Ä–æliti—Åal rhetoric right now about ele—Åtoral interference by the governments of China (and perhaps also India) in our federal —Åampaigns. The accusation is that the Chinese government has directly financed the —Åampaigns of —Ä–æliti—Åians who they believe serve their economic interests best. 

To be clear, if the accusation was that a foreign government was directly hacking our v–æting records to change v–ætes, then I would obviously agree that it is inherently wrong. However, this current situation doesn't make any such accusations - it's just about —Åampaign money. 

Is there really much of a moral difference between a domestic mega-corporation making big 'donations' to —Åampaigns as opposed to when a foreign government does it? If we think that foreign interference is wrong, then why don't we think that when local companies do the exact same thing? 

Which brings me to my main viewpoint: swaying democratic outcomes using big money is the thing that is inherently wrong. The identity of the actor doing the swaying is not relevant - it doesn't matter whether it's a foreign government, a local oil billionaire, a large worker's union, or anything else. Pushing the democratic needle via financial manipulation is unacceptable, no matter who's doing it. 

The amount of money donated to —Åampaigns by foreign governments is comparatively small, at least in Canada, compared to the amount donated by local corporations and other entities. To me, the outrage-farming being done by the mainstream media and the major parties about this issue feels disingenuous at best. 

Democracy should be about the free exchange of ideas for v–æters to choose from, not about a race towards who can board the biggest pile of cash. That's most of why I'm so tired of hearing about allegations of financial interference - it's a fake issue that is absolutely dwarfed by the real problem of having cash dictate —Ä–æliti—Åal outcomes. 

But I'm open to being proven wrong, either in full or in part. Change my view."
0,2024-06-05,CMV: The media is dishonest about Robert Kennedy Jr. and the major stories that have come out about him over the last few months.,u/bdun21,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d931pa/cmv_the_media_is_dishonest_about_robert_kennedy/,changemyview,"I will start this off by saying I just heard of RFK Jr for the first time around a year ago and was iffy about him until about 2 or 3 months ago when I started doing research about him. What I have come to learn about him from listening to him and what the media says about him has left me to figure out that what the media says about him is without context for much of what they post about him. I will give some examples and then show why they are wrong:

  
1. RFK Jr. has a brain worm. The NY Times posted an article saying he had a brain worm. This was true that he had a brain worm, but the article title makes it seem like RFK Jr. has the brain worm now and it is a huge problem. The fact of the matter is that the brain worm he had is not some rare phenomenon and he is cured from it now. The NY Times posted the article likely to make it seem like he is not in a healthy condition to run for or be president.

2. RFK Jr.'s own family isn't supporting him. This gets emphasized every time I see RFK Jr. be mentioned on the internet or in person, and it is true that some members of his family are not supporting him, the media tries to make it seem like his whole family is against him. This cannot be further from the truth. Right now, only 6 members of his 105 family members have endorsed Biden, but the picture with less than half of his family at the White House has made its rounds to make it appear that they all endorsed Biden. The fact is that only 6 members have endorsed Biden, and Kennedy has family members working for his campaign. My biggest issue with this story isn't even the fact that the media posts these photos without context, it is that Kennedy is being held to a higher standard than other politicians. Trump has family members that don't support him. Obama has family members who don't support him. The fact that Kennedy has a huge family and 6 members have come out and endorsed Biden isn't as big of a deal as it is made out to be, and it is misleading.

  
3. Kennedy is antivax. RFK Jr. promotes safety in vaccines and wants them to be safer. He is not calling for people to not get vaccinated, he simply is promoting his goals of making them safer. If someone finds a flaw in the design of a baby crib and wants to fix it to make it safer, they are not anti-crib. They just want to make it safer. Also, the media throws around the term anti-vax like it is a derogatory term, ignoring Kennedy's actual views and simply dismissing him.

  
4. This point is the most important point. The 3 stories above are the biggest slanders and only things I really see the media discuss about him. The trouble that I have with the media is that 1 and 2 have nothing to do with his campaign, and 3 is only a small part of his campaign. His policies that he runs on are ones that are uniting people who stand in the middle or are reasonable on either side. He believes the wealthy ought to pay their fair share, the border needs to be secure, our government is controlled by regulatory capture and it needs to be fixed, we need to stop fighting in forever wars and promote peace, we need to seriously protect our environment, free speech, pro choice but do everything to limit abortions, make home ownership more accessible by taking on black rock and these companies buying single family homes, and be transparent in our government. Kennedy takes the good from conservatives and the good from liberals and puts it together and actively talks about solutions to our problems, yet the media only covers him by smearing him. We are trapped in a two party system and the media is doing everything possible to keep it that way.

  
I am willing to change my mind on this, but it will take a good discussion. Thank you!"

Israel has accrued more bad will this year than in any other instance that I remember in my life. We have all seen Israelis calling for rape, multiple videos of Pro-Israelis saying things like ""I hope you get raped"". They are blocking humanitarian aid, which Aryeh Neier, survival of holocaust, founder of human rights watch, calls genocide. Their politicans have been expressing genocidal intent/rhetoric, they put that rhetoric to action in annihilating Gaza. Most Israelis support the IDF's actions.

All human beings are equal, and it's not the fault of Israeli children that they are indoctrinated into terrorist, dehumanizing ideologies from childhood. But unless someone can change my view, I'd say most Israelis are indoctrinated into terrorism. Israel just stole more land from West Bank, and the Settler violence is at an all time high. Settlers literally shoot Palestinians with automatic rifles, and the IDF does not intervene, and the murdering, terrorist Settlers face literally no consequences.

How is this not terrorism? Does this not indicate that vast majority of Israelis are intolerant, dehumanizing terrorists?"

The complaints from incels reek of misogyny. A lot of them think women owe them sex or a relationship. They do not see women as human beings.

0,2024-06-05,CMV: Affirmative Action may have been designed to disadvantage Asians for being model minorities,u/leapingfro9,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d97mez/cmv_affirmative_action_may_have_been_designed_to/,changemyview,"This is of course is a conspiracy theory and I really really hope that I am wrong on this. I can really think of two reasons why Affirmative Actiom happens to be prevalent on education where Asians are dominant: 1) simply because it doesn't matter for the policy makers/ schools (for instance, admitting bunch of students on non merit basis would not hurt the school directly as opposed to hiring a CFO on non merit basis); and 2) because the liberals want to punish the Asians.

Affirmative Action itself in fact is a good example of the liberal narrative where it is impossible for a minority to excel due to systematic racism. Hence, a special accommodation has to be made for such minorities. However, Asians basically broke that narrative by becoming the model minority. Hence, AA is mainly practiced in education, where Asians are considered as majority.

Oh yeah, I wanna mention that AA is still around after the court ruling. Medical field is a good example and Harvard emphasized on including life experiences on personal statement for obvious reasons."

Every academic definition of fascism I have encountered has been elaborate, unwieldy, imprecise, or outdated. I have seen this play into the hands of authoritarians arguing online that they cannot be called fascists if no good definition/description can be provided. Indeed it is very hard to come up with any definition or description which encompasses old and contemporary fascists while necessarily excluding totalitarian regimes such as the CCP, North Korea, or Iran.

It is clear that sexual attraction is in large part a socialized aspect of a person. The level of wide spread acceptance of sexual relations with younger males, led to an almost ubiquitous adoption of the practice in the Ottoman society amongst the social elite. The fact that the majority of men in that society viewed younger men sexually attractive and sought out sexual relations with them, should prove that people can be socialized to find different groups of people sexually attractive regardless of sex or gender. I can‚Äôt think of any other way to view it.  the idea that the only determinant for someone‚Äôs sexual preference regarding gender/sex is genetic or something hormonally that happens  in utero doesn‚Äôt seem tenable with what we know about ancient and even semi contemporary societies.

2. Muhammad was a warlord who united the Arabian Peninsula under his rule primarily through conquest. His immediate successors, the Rashidun caliphs, who were his closest friends and family, continued this legacy by launching wars of conquest against the Romans and the Persians. Many parts of the Quran and *hadith*(the record of words and actions attributed to their prophet) explicitly extol the virtues spreading their religion by the sword. None, to my knowledge, forbid or discourage it except in the limited context of honoring a treaty you have a made. **Islam was founded as a militaristic and expansionist religion, and modern jihadist groups are merely a continuation of this legacy.**

3. Islam is as much of a political and legal system as it is a religion. The Quran and the hadith provide a substantial amount of rules and guidance for everyday life, in matters ranging from grooming, diet, family law, sexual morality, and criminal punishment. Although some of these are seemingly compatible with liberalism and secularism, such as dietary guidelines, others clearly are not, such as Islamic criminal punishment, sexual morality, and family law. **For this reason, Islam should be regarded as being incompatible with liberalism and secularism. Jihadist groups who advocate for a greater role of Islam in governance are more closely aligned with these values than the largely secular governments of the ""Islamic world"", their supporters, and ""moderate Muslims"" in the west who profess acceptance of liberalism and secularism.**

4. To my knowledge, there are no parts of the Quran and no widely acccepted hadith that generally forbid the killing of noncombatants. As a matter of fact, in one known instance Muhammad explicitly sanctioned the killing of non-combatants. When the Muslims led by Muhammad defeated the Banu Qurayza, an Arabian Jewish tribe at the time, all the men and pubescent boys of that tribe were executed, with the women and young children being taken as slaves. 

With regards to the Islamic State specifically: 

5. To touch further on the topic of slavery, I.S. was widely criticized for it's sexual enslavement of Yazidi women and girls. However, the Quran explicitly permits this practice in [Surah Al-Mu'minum, ayat 6](https://quranx.com/23.1-6). 

6. Furthermore, its massacres of Yazidi males are also sanctioned by the Quran, under the general obligation to kill pagans(non-Abrahamics) in [Surah at-Tawbah, ayat 9.](https://quranx.com/9.5)

7. I.S. was also widely criticized for its policy of imposing *jizya*, a religious tax, on Christians under their rule. However, again, this practice is sanctioned by the Quran. "

Gamestop then started to explode when the short bets failed, trapping all these shorts in and making the price rise dramatically 

Markets then halted the stock and turned off the buy button for retail and shorted the stock back down and created swaps for their short orders to push it back.

After everyone made money it brought even more eyes on it how the short squeeze rise of prize should still happen. The shorts that couldn't get out lead to collapses of some banks such a Swiss bank CS.

Then a community spent 3 years trying to understand market corruption and have found that the problem of the naked short selling is creating a bomb just like the banking crisis of 2008 shown in the big short.

3,2024-06-06,CMV: The self-consciousness to self-love and the ability to achieve it are the two most important skills to develop in our lives,u/Glass-Fix-4624,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d9eh33/cmv_the_selfconsciousness_to_selflove_and_the/,changemyview,"I'm a 23-year-old single male (about to turn 24), an Asian foreigner living in a European country. I've been quite unfortunate, and I'm a loser on every front of life. 

My family used to care about me, but that changed when my parents had another child when I was 12. Since then, they have focused only on my brother's interests and feelings, at the price of mine, which they don't care.

My parents are very traditional Asian parents who only care about what I can bring to them: a good reputation, my ability to earn money, and to have offspring. Ever since my first year of high school, around 16 years old, they have been pressuring me to get out, earn money, and have humiliated me ever since because they see me as a liability and a cost to maintain. 

For example, my father would yell at me for buying things like a 10-euro mouse from Amazon, would refuse to let me eat more than what he deemed necessary, and would humiliate me in front of other relatives. My mother would forcefully take away snacks I took from their room, all because they considered me worthless. Since my role as the sole child through which they found satisfaction as parents has been replaced by my brother, all that remained for me was to fulfill a material function. Since I couldn‚Äôt and can‚Äôt give them satisfactory results on that front, it's no wonder they've treated me very badly.



To make matters worse, I'm a huge failure at relationships and academics as well. I didn‚Äôt realize the need to get a job ASAP and studied economics in both high school and university. I got admitted by a reputable local university at 19 years old, but due to economic reasons and psychological pressure, I decided to drop out. Imagine being looked down upon by your parents every single day, and getting interrogated every week about the progress of your studies and when you're going to make money. 

They even suggested I return the money to my brother, since it was supposed to be for both of us. However, before my brother was born, they promised that they would only love me and never harm me. That was not true, full of lies. 

I cried countless times starting from my high school years and have had suicidal thoughts ever since. I tried to fill the emptiness inside me with friends and love. But I was betrayed hard by a close friend over trivial issues from my POV. Then, being average-looking and of average height, as a foreigner without a dime who's also very psychologically unstable and doesn't know how to deal with relationships, I‚Äôve only faced failure. No one was interested in trying with me, and I couldn‚Äôt find the lack of motherly love from other women.



At the age of 21, I switched my university to a public one, still studying economics. I still didn‚Äôt understand what I needed to do. For the first seven months, I didn‚Äôt study a thing. During that period, I was lost and spent time on porn, games, the internet, and so on. Then in May of 2022, I started studying, and was able to take and pass 10 exams in 12 months with low grades.



However, I was still super lost. I finally realized that I needed to be strong and independent. But undergrad degrees in economics aren‚Äôt very useful in the country where I live, and I would‚Äôve liked to do postgraduate studies as well. But I needed to get a job ASAP. So in March 2023, I basically stopped studying and decided to enroll in a technical college to become a programmer in October 2023. I had to spend 4 hours to attend lectures and was the only one self-studying programming languages and doing projects in my class. Then I found, all by myself, a paid internship at a decent local company a few weeks ago, which I'm about to start next week.



So what made me write all this? Two days ago, I was chatting with a girl my age, and she was in a similar situation to mine a year ago: poor family, studying economics, low self-esteem, and anxious. I thought I might have had a chance to fill the void inside my heart, and I wanted to do everything I could to help her, in exchange of her love.  But then she said that all the chats for her were just to kill time, suggested that I'm not suitable for her, and it's better for me to focus on my studies and work.



Suddenly, it became perfectly clear that, for someone like me, self-consciousness to self-love and the ability to do so are the two most important abilities to acquire. For self-consciousness to self-love, I mean the ability to focus only on myself and my feelings, and don't have any expectations for others. For the ability to do so, I mean money, a stable job and high paying job, savings, and house of my own. 

I'm just a low-value tool with substitutes for my parents, women, friends, and companies as well. No one will ever care to understand my feelings and interests, and no one will really care about me. I need to find the ability to love myself from within, by stopping my attempts to find unconditional motherly love from others, and gaining financial indenpendence. 

Because every one can and will betray me. My parents ditched me because maybe they thought I wasn't enough to satify their psychological needs, and needed someone cuter. No one wants to try to start a relationship with me because I'm not good enough for them. "

  -Violent crimes are committed mostly by men, so if there is a smaller proportion of us, it would obviously be much lower. Sexual crimes from men to women would also be lower because if almost everyone is a woman, there is less competition and desperation to get one.

  -Women would not be pressured by society to marry and have children because the majority would be single (studies show that single women are happier than married women), so it would be more of a choice than an obligation.

  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat would happen in this situation came about when, in a conversation, this topic came out (and I brought it in other talks), and, both men and women I've talked to about this case of ""what if,"" agreed that the world would improve, or at least, be better than a society made up of 90% men and 10% women (these numbers are an example, it could be also 80-20).

The socks are usually held together with a thin piece of plastic that has a T shape at the end to hold the bundle together.

I believe that this packaging is intentionally designed to lightly damage the socks. A few fibers get cut and damaged, and this starts the fraying process and reduces the lifespan of the socks.

* If you pull them apart without thinking to get the socks out, the T shaped plastic part at the end will rip a hole through them.
* They're held just tightly together well enough that using a knife to cut it risks you just knicking the sock a bit and starting the fraying process. 

Big Sock will deny this, but this packaging seems intentionally designed to reduce sock lifespans."
0,2024-06-06,"CMV: It is better to become a plumber, welder, or most other trades than to become a doctor. ",u/The0Walrus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d9gyeg/cmv_it_is_better_to_become_a_plumber_welder_or/,changemyview,"I get that doctors will eventually make more money but you don't have the risks of a doctor, you have the job security, and you stand to make potentially the same or even more money. Not only that, but you won't have the debt that a doctor would have.

Some of the risks of a doctor would be killing a patient, seriously injuring, or harming in some way a patient. You can be sued. You can traumatize yourself. Some doctors have to make decisions that later on they may regret regarding a patient's care. Remember, you can't save everyone. There are specialties that are even more depressing and painful possibly such as the pediatric oncology unit, trauma, adult oncology unit, etc. you also have to remember you will deal with family members going through grief and their own traumas and stress.

Doctors can make more money sometimes but not always. They also have to worry about the massive debt they graduate with and they also for the first few years make minimum wage basically.

You do have great job security since healthcare is absolutely recession proof and there's always a shortage. Trades also have serious shortages in part because many people don't respect them. I have a friend who is a trucker because he doesn't like to be around people. He also made about 110k just driving a truck and picking up all the jobs he can. He sleeps in his truck and rents his apartment many times to friends. The cost to become a truck driver in NJ/NY area was roughly 5k. The job likes him so much they started teaching him some diesel mechanic skills. Many of these tradesmen are knowledgeable but many people don't see the glory of becoming a tradesmen. Trades are also for the most part recession proof. When COVID was at its peak doctors were among the most important. Plumbers and even many aircraft mechanics continued working. Electricians were also considered essential workers and so were linemen and many others.

You do make more as a doctor many times but not all the time. Sometimes plumbers can end up opening their business and through word of mouth expand their business.

I understand the risks of tradesmen which can lead to serious health problems, death, disability, and so on. The same goes with doctors though. If a tradesman is smart with his money he can retire also and invest into properties. The plumbers can fix any issues with pipes, electricians can fix electrical issues in the house, some tradesmen can't really fix anything in the house (aircraft mechanics, auto mechanics, truck drivers, etc) but they can definitely work hard and invest.

I'm a registered nurse. I respect the doctors but I also respect the truckers and many tradesmen. I had this argument with a few other nurses who were mad the UPS truck drivers were maxing out at 170k while they weren't and they went to school.

0,2024-06-06,"CMV: Senator McCarthy was right, and the HUAAC did nothing wrong",u/Most-Travel4320,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d9hp01/cmv_senator_mccarthy_was_right_and_the_huaac_did/,changemyview,"I believe that Sen. McCarthy was correct about communist infiltration of the government, and so called ""McCarthyism"" was actually correct in both it's analysis and actions taken against communists in US government. Let's go over a brief history of why I think this is correct.

First off, let's start out by getting something obvious out of the way. The Soviet Union was objectively engaged in massive campaigns of espionage and spying within the US. They were never truly our ally, and they used the temporary alliance with the US during WW2 to steal our nuclear secrets, and deepen and entrench their espionage rings in American society. It was two Americans, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were ideologically brainwashed by the idea that giving Stalin nukes would advance the cause of world peace. Another fact about this is that the CPUSA can hardly even be called a real political party at this time, more like a legal Soviet front for spying. The line of the CPUSA was completely decided by Moscow, party leadership took it's orders from Moscow, and this was especially prominent before 1943, where the Comintern essentially served to turn global communist parties into arms of Soviet influence and espionage. If you want good evidence of this, take a look at how the CPUSA actively campaigned against American entrance into WW2 from 1939-1941 in the name of ""peace"", then quite literally on day the Soviet Union was attacked, the position of the party completely flipped and became extremely pro-war. Nothing about the CPUSA served the interests of anyone here in America, the ideology of the time was ""Support the Soviet Union to advance world communism"", and that ideology was used to recruit it's members as infiltrators for the USSR.

Perhaps the most prominent person to ever be smeared and jailed over communist connections by the HUAAC was Alger Hiss. Alger Hiss was a high ranking state department official, having been appointed Director of the Office of Special Political Affairs, attended the Yalta conference, and served as executive secretary of the Dumbarton Oaks Conference. A key figure in this whole situation, Whittaker Chambers, a former Soviet spy who testified against his former conspirators, named Hiss before the HUAAC in 1948. Hiss sued for libel, but lost, and was ultimately sentenced to prison time over his role in Soviet espionage. The Verona Papers, released in 1995, confirmed beyond a doubt that Alger Hiss was indeed working as a Soviet agent, along with many other people, including those involved in the Manhattan project, such as Klaus Fuchs and David Greenglass.

Now, one of the biggest criticisms of the HUAAC was that it persecuted mostly innocent people for their political beliefs. But what political beliefs were those? As I stated before, the line between communist ideology and outright treason became rather blurred, as communist ideology within the US at the time was basically ""Support the Soviet Union so that communism can prevail"". If your ideology calls on you to commit crimes against your country in support of another, you cannot just say ""innocent people persecuted for their political beliefs"". Their political beliefs were treason.

I'm just going to go over two prominent individuals who were summoned before the HUAAC, and blacklisted as a result of their communist activities.

Paul Robeson: Visited the USSR multiple times, in heavily propagandized, state run visits, the first being in 1934. In 1934, he explicitly toed a Soviet propaganda line, saying no racism existed in a country that had committed genocide in Ukraine quite literally the year before. Won the ""Stalin Peace Prize"" in 1952, and in 1953 wrote of Stalin ""Through his deep humanity, by his wise understanding, he leaves us a rich and monumental heritage."". These beliefs are patently abhorrent, and they are made even more abhorrent by the fact that he was actually defending this guy while he was alive, killing millions. Most people have no problem with deplatforming those who express views like Nazism, well, that's pretty much what this was to me. I wouldn't want to associate with this guy and I can't imagine any decent person back at the time would either. I don't care if racism formed his experiences, racism doesn't give you an excuse to become a mouthpiece for mass murderers. Paul Robeson deserved what happened to him.

Herbert Biberman: Member of the ""hollywood ten"", his Wikipedia page starts off with something that quite self evidently portrays where his loyalties lay. ""Though he would become firmly pro-war after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, during the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop pact, his outspoken opposition to U.S. Lend-Lease to the United Kingdom was so intense, the FBI suspected Biberman (who was actually Jewish) of being a Nazi"". Do I need to explain more?

Many of the other people blacklisted did not take quite such a hard line of absolute undying loyalty to the USSR, but nevertheless had demonstrable communist ties at a time when the ideology of communism in America was in my opinion tantamount to treason. The deplatforming of these people was just as easily justifiable as de-nazification in post war Germany. CMV."

We are at ‚Äúthe end of history‚Äù as a book I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm reducing to its title says. There‚Äôs no more conquest. No more expansion. No more anything. Just the fifty states milling about, making tiny adjustments here and there.

And who could blame them for that perception? The geographic stagnancy of the US at least mirrors the political stagnancy in an eerie way, if not affects it. Hell, none of the state capitals have changed since the early 1900s. This was unheard of before 1900, when new states were being added every couple years.

The fact that it hasn‚Äôt happened in a while I think also sows a bit of division. The US is no longer invested in any sort of manifest-destiny-esque project that functions to unite more people as citizens under its umbrella. It‚Äôs actually on the brink of division at any point. People seriously talk about the US losing states through secession as if it‚Äôs a more serious political possibility than it gaining states.

When the next state is added to the US, it will be a landmark event in political history. The realization by US citizens that they are part of history and of the American project, and potential vehicles to change it, and not simply looking back on the changes as inhabitants of the US‚Äôs final stage will finally click with a lot of people who think silly things like having 50 states is a constitutional requirement or deep tradition that must be respected, or that the empire is in decline.

Plus, what was the mood like politically after the last two states were added? They were the first ones admitted in 47 years. You‚Äôd expect something drastic to happen then too if my theory were right. Did it? I‚Äôll let people more familiar with the civil rights act answer that one. "

I imagine I  might be responsible for another's safety if I intentionally made something unsafe, like setting a trap or something. (Separately, does the idea of  lack of action make things more complex here? If I walked through a park and saw an open bear trap, do I assume some responsibility of any potential victim if I simply ignore it?)

I would imagine that I might be responsible for another's safety if I had already assumed or accepted it beforehand. For example, having a child, or becoming an employer, or simply stating ""I will keep you safe"".

I say, unless Im acting unsafe towards others, or I've already accepted or assumed responsibility, I am not responsible for another's safety. Mostly because it seems to me that utilitarianism says this is unreasonable, i.e. I cannot be responsible for everybody's safety individually.

What needs to be told to simps is this: Do kind things for the sake of being kind without strings attached. Kindness won‚Äôt get you sex but it will make you likeable.

Someone can argue that memoirs can offer lessons or inspiration but the primary driver is ego or self preservation of some sort.

Then you have attendance bonuses given out. Then you have extra credit. Then you have grading bias (not the fault of teachers, it just happens) and differences in grading requirements. These differences make it difficult to compare success across districts and states. 

Standardized testing nullifies this issue (aside from the differences in grading style in the writing portion of the SAT, but that's not even a requirement for most institutions). It says ""everyone is being compared by the same standard"". It gives us a much more clear idea of what schools and teachers are succeeding and which aren't. 

Yes, it sucks to take these tests and gives students anxiety. But this is the best way we can find teaching and education styles and methods that work and spread them around the country, not just making it nearly impossible for a student to fail. "

I come here to view content. Subreddit moderators are not essential to keeping reddit functioning. The members who post on reddit are. Without subreddit users posting content you have dead subreddits. There are some subreddits with millions of users with barely any posts because the moderators are so strict about what gets posted. There are some subreddits where every post must be manually approved by a moderator before it goes live. There are subreddits where users are banned with zero explanation or because the moderators don't like their opinion. The reason these people are bad for reddit is it turns off users from wanting to post content. They are barriers to content creators.

 Reddit ownership should adopt a User Bill of Rights -- a series of reforms -- to protect the user experience so it isn't overridden by tyrannical mods:

1. *Mods are limited to bans for a maximum of week. If they want to ban someone for longer than a week, they have to request an admin do it.*
2. *Mods are required to follow their own rules. If you report a mod for violating the sub rules, it's reviewed by an admin.*
3. *If you think you were banned unfairly, you can appeal to the admins and the admins can decide whether you violated the rules.*
4. *Mods are required to be respectful and civil to all users. If they aren't, the admins remove them as mods.*
5. *Mods can't ban you for what happens outside the sub, such as participating in another sub.*
6. *Term limits for mods. You don't get to be the head mod of¬†¬†with for life because you were the first person to think of creating a sub called¬†¬†when Reddit was created, like people claiming obvious domain names in the early days of the internet.*

Persona and Voice

**MINOR TO MODERATE SPOILERS FOR PERSONA 3, PERSONA 5, WITCHER, AND FALLOUT 4** 

I am working on my extensive review of Persona 3 Reload (Not making content - Im a weirdo that loves doing this shit for me and my close friends). That‚Äôs the game freshest in my mind but I also beat Persona 5 Royal a couple years back and just as much applies there. 

I have a set opinion on the silent protagonist in both of those games and am looking for other perspectives. Now, I‚Äôll elaborate on my view:

**The Spectrum of RPG Protags**

For the record, I *generally* prefer a protagonist that is not voiced. My favorite RPGs include BG3 (rarely given voice), Dragon Age Origins, Fallout New Vegas, etc. Not having a voice typically allows more diverse options so you can embody a wide variety of personalities, archetypes, and so on.
 
Games such as the Witcher give you a voice protagonist that is also a fairly defined character. That series is also widely beloved and I like Witcher 3 quite a bit. It is not my favorite and I think it‚Äôs slightly overrated. However, I don‚Äôt deny that it‚Äôs a quality game and Geralt is a compelling protagonist for an RPG despite not having a wide variety of possibilities and having a monotone voice to boot.

Fallout 4 is in the middle of the spectrum and I think that it doesn‚Äôt satisfy the strengths of either of the previous approaches. The character‚Äôs backstory is defined, primary motivation is defined (and it isn‚Äôt self preservation as seen in a lot of recent RPGs, which is a neat trick that lets you play *almost* any type of character), and you have a voice. 

I will say that I think Fallout 4 gets more hate than it deserves. The voiced protagonist I think is a mistake but both actors do a solid job. Some scenes have impact that is rare for a Bethesda game (confronting Father if you don‚Äôt side with the institute at Bunker Hill comes to mind). You have a voice, but they haven‚Äôt committed to a character as defined and well written as Geralt, so you don‚Äôt have a performance or a combination of dialogue options and your own imagination to fill out the RPG protagonist. This leaves the Sole Survivor feeling‚Ä¶samey and bland. At best you can be consistently sarcastic. 


**Turning to Persona**

I believe Persona is also in the middle of the spectrum in a way that is different from Fallout 4, but still is not a great way to have an RPG protag.

Persona handles choice in a different way than other RPGs both western and eastern. You get tons of little choices concerning how to spend your time. Do you prioritize relationships or something else? If the former, which ones? That‚Äôs cool. It gives the series its identity. However, in the games I‚Äôve played, they don‚Äôt give the protagonist much of an identity.

Your character is silent while having something of a defining backstory. Not much of a personality outside of the stylishness of your outfits. You have almost no choices that affect the trajectory of the story or even the illusion of impacting the trajectory of the main plot and setting as a whole when compared to other RPGs I can mention - even one as widely sneered at as Fallout 4. 

Dialogue choices seldom matter either. You‚Äôre nice, a rude dick for no reason, or occasionally a smart ass. This has even less of an effect on relationships and quests than it does in Fallout 4. 

If there isn‚Äôt a wide band of personalities you can embody, with choices and diverging paths to reinforce them, why keep the protagonist silent? You have this packed cast of social links with unique stories that, if you spend sufficient time with them, will come to adore and idolize (if they‚Äôre female they will throw their panties at you and meow like a cat in heat no matter what) Leader/Joker despite them being this completely blank canvas. 

A blank canvas exists so you can paint a picture. Leader and Joker are just empty spaces where something should be. The only areas where you can actually define them include

1. Do you accept the bitchmade ending or the real ending?
2. Which waifu you want? 

And with #2 I think the relationships effect even less. Shepard seems like a different boyfriend with different (better) tastes if he romances Jack instead of Miranda. The romance scenes have substantially different flavors.

With persona you just decide to spend time with them and they‚Äôll quickly become so infatuated that they would crawl through a mile of broken glass just to sniff the hair of the last woman you made eye contact with. The romance option‚Äôs personalities and stories don‚Äôt rub off on Joker/Leader the same.

I think, if they‚Äôre not going to put more focus into dialogue options and choices affecting these social relationships, then just give the protagonist a voice. If done well it can fill the empty space and make the stories and relationships feel more real and impactful.

That‚Äôs my 2 cents. Also I enjoyed both Persona games I played and highly recommend them to people with a tolerance for anime stuff and an excess of free time. I know I criticized and made fun of them but don‚Äôt mistake me. 

**TLDR Version**

Sure Leader and Joker don‚Äôt have voices because they are ‚Äúplayer inserts‚Äù. The problem is that there is insufficient means for the player to actually insert. It‚Äôs a blank space that I end up feeling less connected to than even a character as defined as Geralt.

0,2024-06-06,"CMV: Despite millennials complaining the most, Gen-X actually had things the worst.",u/ninetofivedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d9uthq/cmv_despite_millennials_complaining_the_most_genx/,changemyview,"It‚Äôs a common narrative that Millennials have faced unprecedented challenges, and they often vocalize their struggles loudly and frequently. However, I believe that Generation X (born roughly between 1965 and 1980) had it worse in many significant ways. Here‚Äôs why:

Generation X came of age during economic recessions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, facing high unemployment rates and inflation that made it difficult to secure stable jobs and affordable housing. By the time Millennials were entering the workforce, many of these economic conditions had stabilized or improved.

Moreover, Gen-X witnessed the birth and rapid evolution of technology. Unlike Millennials, who grew up with the internet and digital devices, Gen-X had to adapt to these changes later in life, often without the foundational tech education that Millennials received. This made career advancement and staying relevant in the job market significantly more challenging.

Socially and culturally, Gen-X experienced the breakdown of traditional family structures at higher rates, with many growing up in single-parent households due to rising divorce rates. This often meant less financial stability and emotional support during their formative years. Additionally, they dealt with significant global events such as the Cold War, which created a pervasive sense of uncertainty and fear that shaped their worldview.

While Millennials undoubtedly face their own set of challenges, from student debt to housing market fluctuations, the struggles of Gen-X were marked by a unique set of economic, technological, and social hardships that are often overlooked. It‚Äôs essential to recognize the resilience and adaptability of Gen-X, who navigated these turbulent times with far fewer resources and support systems than subsequent generations.

If I won the Powerball, mega millions, at a slot machine or a table, or the top prize on the $100,000 pyramid, for example, I should be able to take home every penny of it and not be burdened with taxes on something that will more than likely never happen again.

I left out time-related losses because they are not always applicable.

1 and 2 result in a win/loss (0,1) and 3-5 each result in a tie (represented as 0.5, 0.5).

I believe that Stalemate should either result in a (0.75, 0.25) or a loss for the player who cannot make a legal move, and that Stalemate resulting in a tie is inconsistent with the general rules/mechanics of the game. Basically, I think that the core mechanic of chess is that when it is your turn to play, you must make a legal move or lose. You cannot skip your turn, even if every legal move worsens your position.

Think of checkmate. There are two components of checkmate, the first being check. A player cannot legally end their turn while their king is in check. When a player's king is placed in check, the player *must* ""cure"" the check by the end of their turn, either by 1) moving the king into a non-threatened square, 2) blocking the threat, or 3) capturing the checking piece. If the player cannot cure the check with a legal move, they are checkmated.

Stalemate is really just checkmate without the check - the player (who is not in check) cannot make a legal move. Under the current rules of chess, this is a tie.

I do not think that this rule makes sense. There is nothing magical about check. Check does not end the game. There is no ""check-counter"" that rewards a player for placing their opponent in check a certain number of times. Check is only important insofar as it reduces the number of legal moves a player has. The player only loses when they cannot make a legal move by the end of their turn.

The most consistent ""value"" for a stalemate would probably be a loss by the player who cannot make a legal move. 0.75 vs 0.25 would be a compromise that reflects one player's failure to achieve complete victory and the other's ability to avoid total defeat. Either way, 0.5 vs 0.5 doesn't really make sense."

0,2024-06-06,CMV: English classes should not be required for all 4 years of high school.,u/sexyimmigrant1998,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1da0hl1/cmv_english_classes_should_not_be_required_for/,changemyview,"(Background: I'm 26, so I graduated high school less than a decade ago. I went to a relatively high academically performing public high school in San Jose, California. The school had a magnet business program focusing on graphic design, web design, and entrepreneurship, but the school overall placed a huge emphasis on STEM, with many students becoming engineers due to our location in Silicon Valley. In this school, it was expected that anyone who took the AP Calculus exam (AB and BC) should get a 5. We also had a variety of other departments, with a particularly impressive drama department known for high quality productions. I say all this to inform you of any biased I likely have). 


Like any other demographic, high schoolers in any given school have a wide range of skills, interests, and passions. The point of school is to expose students to different areas of study as well as technical skills to let them gauge their interests for future career prospects while also building up their basic fundamental skills they'll need later in life.

There's a little variation district to district and state to state, but from what I've seen, math is typically required for 2-3 years. The sciences? Usually 2 years. Social sciences? 2-3 years.

These make sense. High schoolers don't usually know what they'll specialize in in life, and even if they choose something now, they can very well change their minds in undergrad or beyond. So I agree that they should be required to get sort of a ‚Äúsampler‚Äù education, with at least some exposure to base levels of math, social sciences, and sciences. If they wish, they can take more of those courses and at higher levels if this is an area of interest. Ideally, a high school would also have a variety of other courses, from technical skills like woodshop and robotics to visual and performing arts like photography and music and acting. 

So to my main point: As far as I know, every high school I've seen requires you to take an English course for all 4 years. Why?!

Like with math, science, and social science, I can definitely agree to a 2-year requirement, *maybe* 3. But all 4? Come on, now.

Now I by no means wouldn't want to stop any student who loves English from taking more English courses if it's their passion, I'm merely saying it shouldn't be forced every year on the other students. 

English classes tend to be very similar every time, with the same routine of reading literary works and analyzing the story and its ideas and writing essays on it. But we've been doing this since kindergarten through middle school and now all through high school. It's just so‚Ä¶ repetitive and impractical if it's not something you want a career in nor something you find interest in. 

AP English Language and Composition (AP Lang) is an exception to this, typically taken by juniors (but also sometimes other grades, mostly seniors). It's a non-fiction-based writing class that's all about critical thinking when analyzing real-world articles and ideas as well as writing to form strong argumentation. There was plenty of crossover skill here with World History AP (WHAP) and AP US History (APUSH) and writing in standardized exams like the SAT or ACT. 

Unfortunately, this was the only class of its kind. All other English courses were the same fiction, literary-focused classes analyzing fictional novels and poetry. AP English Literature (AP Lit) was obviously that but at a higher level, but even if you did not want to take this, you would be required to be at a lower level English class anyway. My high school did offer journalism, but to my knowledge, this did not fulfill the English requirement.

So that's really my argument. I don't see why we have to be bombarded with chapter books again and again just to have us write essays about the call to action of the hero or the rising action and the climax. If it's not your passion, English classes, which almosy always focus on fiction, don't really do anything to build your practical skills nor will they help you get a career in most fields, especially STEM. Even for a path like law ,which is all about logic and argumentation and analysis, most of these English classes don't do anything for you because they're too focused on literary work. 

I'm by no means arguing to require math, science, or social science for all 4 years, but hell, I'd much rather require any of those 3 areas for all 4 years over English, at least they're teaching you something new and expanding your knowledge.

Happy to hear your thoughts."

All these are impacts from failed parenting. No, You are fine to blame 100% on your parents on how you turned out to be. And yes, people did say you are an adult now, you have decisions to make on yourself blah blah blah... Quite right at that point but WRONG. Even as an adult, they have made many stupid decisions and mistakes because they have lack of support supposedly to lead them to the right path. These kind of damaged adults will eventually turned to suicidal attempts, alcoholic, drugs, self-destructive mechanism.

But, what I'm going to say is that this kind of ""defending parent"" statement are parents themselves who want to get away with their wrongdoings they had done to their child.

It's as good as saying, ""Oh, so you mean I can be a parent and get away with putting traumas onto a child? Great! I would love to be a parent, satisfying my sexual pleasure, popping out kids, hopefully they can support me when I go old, but before that, let me lash out all my stress at work and anger onto my children because they are young and vulnerable. Wait till they are 18, ready to kick them out, You are independent on your own now, Sorry, but no sorry with all the damages I've done onto you, but you're an adult now, deal with yourself. ""

Parents are like silent murderer that get away from their wrongdoings killing their children emotionally, mentally and physically. It's not a big surprise when you've seen huge amount of crimes happening due to failed parenting.

There's a need for jail time or penalty for parents who did damage to their child not just physical but also emotional and mental."

This is kind of a followup on my [""East Asian is more developed than the US""](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cv6in1/cmv_east_asian_countries_are_more_developed_than/) post here, except for a single city. For a while I considered Tokyo to be the greatest city in the world, and quite a few people agree. One of my friends visited Tokyo a few months ago and she said it was the ideal city, becoming yet another tourist amazed by the city. Reddit seems to agree with this sentiment, [like in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/1cq0h7r/what_is_the_best_megacity_to_live_in_today/), where a plurality of commenters say Tokyo is the best city to live in. And then there's [this article](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/tokyo-is-the-new-paris) by economist Noah Smith flat-out declaring Tokyo to be the greatest city in the world. Unfortunately it's paywalled, but this post repeats most of his points.

A big reason is surprisingly simple: Tokyo is the largest metropolitan area in the world. More people, more economic impact, more things to do, more culture. Of course being the biggest city isn't worth it if it's underdeveloped or dangerous, but Tokyo is the total opposite of these things.

Tokyo is well known for being extremely safe, having a crime rate Western cities are envious of. It is also well known for being super clean. Furthermore, it has one of the best, if not *the* best, public transportation systems in the world, with the metro going to every nook and cranny while being connected to the rest of Japan via the Shinkansen.

Another reason that Tokyo is so great is that it is one of the, if not the, most YIMBY cities in the world. Thanks to Japan's permissive zoning regulations, Tokyo just keeps building housing, [unlike its peer cities](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5f42b84-cdf6-4623-b422-55d1f29ccf41_636x440.png). As a result, [its rents are way cheaper than in peer cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/11/opinion/editorials/tokyo-housing.html). This high supply of housing ensures that people of all social classes, not just the wealthy elite, can live in the city, leading to a more egalitarian society and practically non-existent homelessness. Not only that, but thanks to the freedom in building whatever you want, Tokyo features a wide range of urban environments, with quiet, relaxing alleyways next to bustling urban nexuses; it's a city with a little something for everyone.

Contrast to the city I currently live in, New York City. NYC is probably the anti-Tokyo: it's dirty, its subway is falling apart, it has a way higher crime rate (and it's *safe* by American standards!), and its NIMBYness has pushed rents out the wazoo and made it [the most expensive city in the world](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/nyc-is-officially-the-most-expensive-city-in-the-world-120122). Ask people which city they'd rather raise their kids in, and I bet most if not all of them will say Tokyo.

Now NYC does have things it does better, like cultural diversity (after all there's a reason I moved there despite its issues). But Tokyo is catching up on those fronts, and is ahead of the curve of other Asian cities. Already, [1 in 8 new adults in Tokyo are foreign born](https://japantoday.com/category/national/roughly-one-in-eight-of-tokyo%E2%80%99s-new-adults-is-foreign-born-study-shows), and that doesn't include racial minorities born and raised in Japan. This increasingly cosmopolitanism is augmenting Tokyo's already-amazing art, music, anime, and food scenes (fun fact: Tokyo has the most [Michelin-starred restaurants in the world](https://www.byfood.com/blog/best-michelin-star-restaurants-in-tokyo-p-591)). The diversity is still a far cry from Western cities, but it does combines what diversity it does have with the other positives I mentioned.

So yeah, to sum it all up, Tokyo is clean, safe, has good public transport, inexpensive, and is increasingly cosmopolitain. All these factors have convinced a lot of people, on Reddit and elsewhere, that Tokyo is the greatest place in the world. But obviously no place is a utopia, so I'd like to hear some of the reasons why Tokyo *isn't* the place all these people make it out to be."

Moreover, the chemical understanding of biology and the physical understanding of chemistry have blurred the line between living and nonliving systems.

With social constructs and mental shortcuts like gender, species, chairs, rigid bodies, etc, this blurriness is acceptable, but in my view consciousness seems irreducible, in a way that implies it has to be accounted for unambiguously by the workings of nature. Unlike the examples I listed, I think consciousness is real independent of how we construe things.

If we can't draw a precise line between conscious and non-conscious systems, then as I see it, we have only two options: Either nothing is conscious (obviously false(?)) or everything is. The implication that very simple systems must be conscious doesn't actually seem that silly to me. Their consciousness would just have to be very different from ours.

Neuroscience has established that thoughts, memories, sensations, and emotions are mechanical, not magical. It seems like the only part of our minds that doesn't promise an eventual naturalistic explanation is our subjective experience of these things, our awareness.

But when you think about it, awareness is not actually that complicated. It doesn't entail having feelings, opinions, thoughts, sensations of any particular kind, or even the knowledge that one is aware. All of these are just behaviors of the brain that we are aware *of*; they're objects. The awareness itself need not have any complex cognitive machinery associated with it.

A simpler system than a brain, like a rock, has fewer things going on within it, so it doesn't have a lot to be aware of, maybe just some internal and external forces. But is there any reason that it couldn't have awareness of those few things? Of course, what it is like to be a human and what it is like to be a rock (if, as my current view goes, there is such a thing) would be so totally incomparable that any way we could imagine the inner life of a rock would never come close. But our inability to imagine it doesn't mean that it couldn't exist.

The apparent absurdity of a rock having a subjective experience is acceptable to me because I have never heard an alternative to panpsychism that is less absurd. I hope to change that with this post. Obviously the origin of consciousness is not a settled question, so I want my view of the problem to reflect this.

EDIT: I'm aware of the combination problem, and I believe that minds combine to the degree that they physically influence each other. I could be convinced that this isn't a good enough explanation."

0,2024-06-07,CMV: A Voluntary Tax System Doesn't Exist,u/JustReadingThx,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dafxq9/cmv_a_voluntary_tax_system_doesnt_exist/,changemyview,">In a fully free society, taxation ‚Äî or, to be exact, payment for governmental services ‚Äî would be *voluntary*

*-* [Ayn Rand on taxation](http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/taxation.html)

I don't know much about Ayn Rand philosophy, but this specific topic sounds interesting. While I appreciate the sentiment, I don't believe that it's possible. Ayn Rand doesn't offer the solution:

>The question of how to implement the principle of voluntary government financing‚Äîhow to determine the best means of applying it in practice‚Äîis a very complex one and belongs to the field of the philosophy of law

Ayn Rand advocates for a small government -- responsible only for common goods such as the courts, the police and the military. While I may not necessarily agree, I acknowledge that his form is the *cheapest* form of government, requiring less financing. I don't see how it's possible to finance even such a minimalist government without (involuntary) taxation.

Common goods are by definition - common. Everyone benefits from them. There is no reasonable way of directly linking the paid service with services rendered. Therefore no individual is incentivized to pay. If no one wants to pay - the voluntary system doesn't work. The solution of course is mandatory payment in the form of taxes.

The only exception I could think of is war bonds. These are government bonds issued during wartime in order to finance the war effort. They are different from regular bonds by their interest rate. The government offers a smaller ROI with these bonds. Any person buying war bonds over regular bonds has effectively gave up some money for a government service - making it a voluntary transaction to finance the government. However, this system only works during a crisis. The bonds are often marketed as patriotism. This isn't a scalable solution for times of peace.

CMV

Edit:

Clarifications:

I'm aware that ""voluntary taxation"" is an oxymoron. I am looking for voluntary means of financing the government (that isn't based on taxation).

The crux of the argument assumes that the only significant revenue stream of the government is its people. Saudi Arabia finances its entire government without the need for taxation. It's able to do that not by a system of voluntary financing, but with vast natural resources.   
I am of course in favor of all the governments being rich enough to self finance.

Deltas awarded:

- Ancient Athens had taxation in the form of Liturgy. The ultra-rich would often overpay in taxes and boast about it for social status.

- Donations can make up a significant portion of financing. Religious organizations are good example of this. It's possible for a very homogeneous and charitable society to finance its government by donations.

Common interesting arguments:

- All tax systems are voluntary. You can always refrain from economic activity and avoid sales tax. You can move to a different country in order to avoid income tax.  
I find this position not convincing, and frankly, indefensible.

- Lottery - a ""tax"" that is entirely voluntary. The big difference between lottery and other government services is the fact that lottery is profitable. To me this is just the government owning for-profit businesses. "

709,2024-06-07,CMV: It is completely unacceptable for general practitioners to routinely run over an hour behind schedule. The practice does more harm than good.,u/indigo-jay-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dajon0/cmv_it_is_completely_unacceptable_for_general/,changemyview,"I understand that being a doctor is difficult. I understand that not everything can be predicted. But all the excuses I've heard for general practitioners who are always severely late fall short:

* ""Some patients have more complex issues than others."" Then pencil them in for a longer appointment. I've heard insurance companies in the US (which is not where I live) demand appointments stay capped at a certain length. If that's the case, fine, report the 15 minute appointment, but leave a large enough gap before the next appointment.
* ""Some patients bring up issues right before their appointments end."" Tough luck for them--they can come back at the end of the day or book another appointment in 3-6 weeks like everyone else.
* ""Patients are always late."" See above. I don't understand why inconsiderate people get priority over everyone else.
* ""People have physical/psychological emergencies, doctors can't just abandon them."" Obviously this stuff happens, but it doesn't explain *routine, extreme* lateness--emergencies are not routine. I simply do not buy that people are constantly having heart attacks in the last 5 minutes of their appointments on a regular basis. I could be convinced to change my mind on this entire issue if shown that this actually is a super common occurrence. If someone has a severe-but-not-urgent issue, they can be asked to come back at the end of the day.
* ""It takes time to read through/update files."" So plan for buffer time in the schedule.

When people have to wait hours to see the doctor, they lose money and credit with their employers. This turns people off of going to the doctor at all--all of my non-salaried friends basically avoid it all costs, even when they have concerning symptoms. I believe the number of health issues that are being missed because people have to sacrifice an unnecessary amount of time and money to get checked outweighs any benefit that a small number of people gain from the ""higher-quality care"" enabled by appointments being extended.

EDIT: Answers to common comments:

* ""It's not doctors' fault!"" I know a lot of this is the fault of insurance/laws/hospitals/etc. The fact that I think this practice is unacceptable does not mean I think it is the fault of individual doctors who are trying their best.
* ""That's just how the system works in the US, it's all about the money!"" I am not in the US. I also think that a medical system oriented around money is unacceptable.
* ""You sound like an entitled person/just get over it/just take the day off work."" Please reread the title and post. My claim is that this does more harm than good *aggregated across everyone.*
* ""Changing this practice would make people wait weeks longer for appointments!"" I know. I think that is less harmful than making things so unpredictable that many people don't book appointments at all. I am open to being challenged on this.

I will respond more when I get home."

I think some people, especially in the literary world, have an understanding that it is unethical for a white person to translate ""non-white"" literature. The field feels subtly hostile to white translators of languages that are used by mostly people who are not white. If that's true, fine, but I just wish people would come right out and say it instead of being coy or wishy-washy about it, because now I feel like I've wasted my life studying Chinese and developing a love for Chinese literature only to feel completely rejected by the the Chinese literary publishing world. I wish I'd never had this false hope in the first place. If white people aren't allowed to translate Chinese literature anymore, just say that with your whole chest. Don't gaslight me into thinking race doesn't play a part in who gets hired for these kinds of roles so that I keep chasing a goal that I'll never be able to reach.

To clarify further: My current perception is that, if a Chinese-American person (who speaks English fluently and understands Chinese at the same level I understand Chinese) and I applied for the same translation project from Chinese into English, even if my writing samples were more well-translated from both a semantic and a syntactical perspective, the Chinese-American candidate would very likely be hired over me at the average international literature organization.  This perception is based on the current academic conversation surrounding white authors translating Asian works, African works, indigenous works, etc."

Might be because I watched them almost bully some other kids to suicide. While I wasn‚Äôt anywhere near their main focus, I still got my fair share of bullying and have PTSD and social anxiety resulting from it; I need medication such as SSRI and benzos for anxiety attacks. Man, I‚Äôve never seen a creature more ruthless than a secondary school child. You are poor and your parents can‚Äôt afford to buy you designer clothes while their do? Oh boy, better get ready because you are not gonna be allowed to forget it. Any. Time. Soon. You will get beaten, spat on and fucked in your ass, maybe even literally if you are very unlucky and their little cocks can get hard already. Even animals don‚Äôt bully their own kind. Children behave like cats do with mice they have cornered.

And now, you might say: but there are also adults that do these kind of things. Well, I haven‚Äôt met a person who would bully me since I exceeded 15 years old. You see, all these people who bullied me and other guys just grew out of this. We all drunk together and made peace at parties. Fuck man, this poor mentally challenged guy who almost killed himself after he was beaten and degenerated like an animal ON A DAILY BASIS FOR YEARS ultimately made peace with his bullies because he recognized they are normal adults people now and their brains were underdeveloped back then, he recognized that the main reason they did it is was not because they are inherently evil; it was because they were CHILDREN and CHILDREN are inherently evil. Even looking at the neurobiology of children (I‚Äôm a med school student) their brains are so underdeveloped in areas that in adults decide whether we respect someone or not: mainly prefrontal cortex which is responsible for self control, understanding, critical thinking, impulse control, determination and self-discipline among others.

Children have no inherent moral compass. The whole point of upbringing is eradicating the evil out of them and installing moral values; slowly, painfully, using punishment and rewards in the process. All they care about is their joy and pleasure. Nothing else. It‚Äôs suffering that makes you get outside yourself as you are getting older. And understand it‚Äôs love and taking care of others, especially those weaker than you, that is the very point of existence."

Criticisms as natural to say as they'd rather spend their money on useful things should be let go. People who say these kind of things should not be punished.

All these are disrespectful and against what was established at the beginning of the relationship. So my post is less about ""cheating isn't wrong"" as many other posts I've seen around here, but more about why the discrepancy in public opinion regarding a variety of different relationship mistakes.

I think all of this stems from how our society perceive sex, which seems like one of the biggest talking points in society but also one of the most tabu.

8,2024-06-08,CMV: Hamas is a terrorist organization and the IDF is not.,u/YogiBarelyThere,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1db3n6w/cmv_hamas_is_a_terrorist_organization_and_the_idf/,changemyview,"Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are two fundamentally different entities with distinct histories, objectives, and modes of operation. To understand the distinction between Hamas as a terrorist organization and the IDF as the military arm of a sovereign state, it is crucial to examine their origins, charters, actions, and guiding principles.

# Hamas

**Historical Context and Origins:** Hamas, an acronym for ""Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya"" (Islamic Resistance Movement), was founded in 1987 during the First Intifada (uprising) against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It emerged from the Muslim Brotherhood, a transnational Sunni Islamist organization.

**Charter and Objectives:** Hamas's original charter, published in 1988, explicitly calls for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic state in historic Palestine. It is deeply rooted in Islamist ideology and often uses religious language to justify its goals. The charter contains anti-Semitic rhetoric and rejects any peace process or recognition of Israel.

**Nature of Operations:** Hamas employs a range of tactics, including suicide bombings, rocket attacks, and kidnappings, targeting both Israeli civilians and military personnel. Its military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, is responsible for executing these attacks. Hamas's use of violence against civilians is a primary factor in its designation as a terrorist organization by many countries, including the United States, European Union, and Israel.

**Influence of Muslim Values:** Hamas claims to be guided by Islamic principles, advocating for jihad (struggle) against perceived enemies of Islam. However, its interpretation of Islamic values is highly contested, as mainstream Islamic teachings generally condemn the targeting of civilians and promote peaceful coexistence.

# Israel Defense Forces (IDF)

**Historical Context and Origins:** The IDF was established in 1948, following the creation of the State of Israel. It was formed by consolidating various paramilitary groups, primarily the Haganah, which was the main Jewish defense organization during the British Mandate of Palestine.

**Laws and Objectives:** The IDF operates under the laws of the State of Israel, a liberal democracy with a complex legal framework that includes military law and international law obligations. The primary objective of the IDF is to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Israel and protect its citizens.

**Nature of Operations:** The IDF conducts military operations that include border defense, counter-terrorism, and conventional warfare. While it has been criticized for actions that have led to civilian casualties, the IDF maintains a doctrine of ""purity of arms"" (Tohar HaNeshek), which emphasizes minimizing harm to non-combatants. This doctrine is part of the ethical code derived from both military ethics and Jewish moral principles.

**Influence of Jewish Values:** Jewish values inform many aspects of Israeli law and the operations of the IDF. Concepts such as ""Pikuach Nefesh"" (the preservation of human life) and ""Tzedek"" (justice) are central to Jewish ethics and influence the conduct of the IDF. The Israeli military often engages in extensive legal reviews and operational protocols designed to comply with international humanitarian law.

# Comparison and Contrast

1. **Objectives and Charters:**
   * Hamas's charter explicitly seeks the destruction of Israel and uses terrorism as a means to achieve its ends.
   * The IDF's objective is the defense of a recognized sovereign state, operating under a legal framework that seeks to balance military necessity with humanitarian considerations.
2. **Operations and Tactics:**
   * Hamas employs tactics aimed at causing maximum harm to civilians to instill fear and advance its political goals.
   * The IDF, while conducting military operations that sometimes result in civilian casualties, operates under guidelines aimed at minimizing such harm and often undertakes significant efforts to avoid civilian casualties.
3. **Guiding Principles:**
   * Hamas is driven by an interpretation of Islamic values that many argue is at odds with mainstream Islam, particularly in its justification of terrorism.
   * The IDF is influenced by Jewish values that emphasize the sanctity of life and the pursuit of justice, which are integrated into its operational ethics.
4. **Legal and Political Frameworks:**
   * Hamas is not a state entity and thus does not adhere to international laws governing state conduct, which contributes to its classification as a terrorist organization.
   * The IDF, as the military of a recognized state, operates within a framework of both domestic and international law, subject to oversight and accountability.

# NOTE

It is important to critically evaluate sources of information, as historical narratives can be manipulated by various actors for political purposes. Propaganda and misinformation can distort the perception of both Hamas and the IDF. While Hamas may seek to portray its actions as legitimate resistance, its tactics and objectives fit widely accepted definitions of terrorism. Conversely, while the IDF is sometimes criticized for its actions, it operates within a recognized legal and ethical framework that differentiates it from terrorist organizations.

Based on the historical context, charters, objectives, and actions, Hamas is widely recognized as a terrorist organization due to its use of violence against civilians and its stated goals. In contrast, the IDF, as the military force of a democratic state, operates under legal and ethical guidelines aimed at defending its citizens and adhering to international norms, distinguishing it from organizations classified as terrorist.Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are two fundamentally different entities with distinct histories, objectives, and modes of operation. To understand the distinction between Hamas as a terrorist organization and the IDF as the military arm of a sovereign state, it is crucial to examine their origins, charters, actions, and guiding principles."

I see a lot of comments about how ""her father failed her"" under a topic about some online sex worker but is it really parents fault that she turned out to be like that or is it more nuanced than that? what if her father was present in her life, tried to teach her values and supported her financially/emotionally but she still decided to get the easy money? or become a slut?

It does feel nice to put the blame on someone else for your shortcomings but at the end of the day you are living that life and I do not think your parents really have the sole power to decide how you have turned out."

People always talk like there's a big risk involved, but if you take away day trading and short-term investments, it's actually much safer than people think. So where's the problem? The problem is that to be able to play this ""game,"" you need to have a good amount of money, a starting sum of several thousand dollars.

This is extremely problematic because, as in most things in life, it makes the rich richer, and the gains far outweigh the risks. If you have at least $20,000 in the bank and consistently invest 10-20% of your capital in a diversified portfolio over 10 years, you will most likely make good money. The majority of people can't invest because either they don't have the money to do it, or the 10-20% would be so small that the growth would be really slow and increase the risk.

And yes, someone in the comments probably started with 10 euros and is now a millionaire, but statistics show this isn't common. Also, yes, most people lose money on stocks, but not because of the market. It's a matter of financial illiteracy that again benefits the richest.

There are many issues and criticisms of the ICC but I'll list some here.

In theory, if the US (a non state party) attacks the UK (a state party) the President of the US can be prosecuted by the ICC because it attacked a state party. This makes no sense to me and simply feels like a complete waste of time because realistically the President of the US will never be brought to stand trial at the ICC. 

There is also the whole ""complementarity"" thing where the ICC is only supposed to prosecute people if their states are unable or unwilling to. But if states are unwilling or unable to prosecute they will very rarely be willing or able to actually bring the people that the ICC wants to their headquarters for a trial. It's only happened in relation to Africans mostly.

Bottom line is that it seems the ICC kind of works for certain African war criminals where the states can't really prosecute them but are fine with bringing them to justice but will never work with European countries or Israel for example because those countries are just not willing to hand people over. So that means that the ICC's work is a lot of the time a waste of time as people won't be brought to it, it's a Court without enforcement power. No one is going to hand over Putin or Netanyahu and no other ""Western leaders"" have or likely will ever be brought before the Court regardless of what they do.

To give a US-based eample it's as if a court in California tried people for their crimes committed in Texas and then the bench warrant if they didn't appear only applied in California. Sure it's a bit inconvenient that the Texans can't go to California but they'll just not go and therefore the California court wasted its time.

Therefore, we either need to get rid of the ICC or if we find it useful for prosecuting people from Africa (which to my knowledge are almost exclusively all its defendants) we should just have Africans create their own court with experts and do it there locally. But I don't think the ICC will ever manage to bring someone from Western countries to justice."

0,2024-06-08,"CMV: If Trump gets a second term, it will be the Left's fault",u/LonelyCentrist,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1db7kq0/cmv_if_trump_gets_a_second_term_it_will_be_the/,changemyview,"Baseline statement: nobody knows what will happen in November.  But it looks like there's a good chance Trump will get a second term-- and if he does it will be the Left's fault.  In particular, the progressive Left, but also the moderate Left for not being willing to muzzle or challenge the crazies.

My view is based on three things:

**1) Progressives are a\*\*holes.**  No, not *you* personally (prove me wrong).  But in general, the progressive left has taken on a narcissistic, entitled, puritanical tone that presumes moral superiority and an authority to cast judgement.  They don't say, ""Hmm, I'm going to think about that"" or ""This is something where reasonable people can disagree.""  They say: ""I have come to *teach* you.  And you will agree, *or we burn the house down*.""  They believe they are the anointed saviors of the oppressed, that their cause is so righteous as to be infallible, and that anyone who questions them is an enemy to be silenced or crushed.

Lots of ordinary people have dealt with this, and they *don't like it*.  Many back down to keep their jobs or their sanity, or stay silent to avoid becoming a target, but they take notes.  Notes like, ""*This has gone too far*"" and ""*These people are crazy and must not be given power*.""  You cannot control what someone does in the ballot box.  As Michael Moore once said, the message that comes with every vote for Trump is ""*F\*ck you*.""  And over the past four years, progressives have given millions more people a reason to say that.

**2) The far-left refuses to acknowledge that their ideas are unpopular.**  Far-left ideas *are* popular among the media elite and young social media addicts, and this is where most Democratic strategists live.  So Democrats have apprently told themselves this is the future and can't be resisted.  But the average American voter does *not* agree with the progressive worldview and does *not* like far-left ideas.  The 2016 election should have been a wakeup; we were all told that Trump would lose, and then he didn't, and we were all surprised.  Millions asked ""How could this have happened?""

It happened because the Democratic Party lost touch with ordinary Americans and either doesn't know or doesn't care what they think.  Even among regular Democratic voters, *far-left ideas are not popular*.  We found this out in 2016, and we could have moderated our tone.  Instead the reaction has been ""No, we will never compromise.  Pedal to the floor.""  You can force through some orders this way, but you cannot convince, and you have to convince people to win elections.  

**3) Israel.**  Without the Israel-Gaza war, I'm pretty sure the Republican's stupidity with abortion would have tanked them.  But the progressive left's fervent embrace of the Palestinian cause (""From the River to the Sea"", ""No Justice, No Peace"") has exposed for many Jews that the Left are not your friends and will sell you out in a heartbeat.  At the same time, ironically, Biden's erstwhile support for Israel has made him an absolute pariah among progressive and politically-active youth.

So you're cooked both ways.  Maybe they won't all vote for Trump, but they *will* stay home or vote for Jill Stein.   I can't count how many young people who, when questioned about the possibility of ensuring Trump's victory through their inaction, turn to the camera and say ""*I don't care.*""  Punishing Biden is more important on their priorities than preventing Trump's return.  (They're going to find out just how much worse it can get... but not till after they finish cutting off their noses.)

**To summarize: you don't need to convince people on the far-right to win the election.  Mostly you need to convince people in the middle, and Democrats have allowed progessives to so alienate people in the middle that they won't show up for them.  Change my view.**  

(Please don't argue with me about Trump being bad-- my view only has to do with who is responsible for the outcome if he does win.)"

It feels like a forceful implementation of pride onto places that otherwise were innocuous or neutral. Like I recently heard that a town near me had a local pier that was painted in rainbow colours repainted. And personally that alone is not a reason to take offense. If the town decides that they don‚Äôt want their local pier to suddenly represent a community that may not reflect their own, then so be it! However, the people who want the bridge repainted because of purely homophobic reasons (I hate gay people so I want my pier back) is obviously problematic.

You either believe in equality regardless of race, sex, gender, etc. or you don't. And that means men, are included. This idea that men have had their time in the spotlight, and now it's over, is hurting society as a whole. The world now has fewer men in education, healthcare, and sciences than ever before. Men have less access to healthcare, education, and career chances than ever before. Even though men suffer from more health problems than any other, demographic. Men's suicide rates are at an all-time high, 60%+ higher than all other demographics combined. 

Young men are less likely to finish school, or attend higher education. You don't have to like it, but these are facts. What have has this crisis of missing men done to society? It's made men more conservative in their beliefs. It's pushed men into more, and more hazardous career roles, or risk-prone lifestyles. Men are less likely to seek healthcare until it's too late. 

How do we fix this? Truly stand for equality for everyone, not just a few. What happened in the past can't be changed. What happens now can be. Do better.

It is unbelievably annoying the frequency that apps and websites sign you out. At this point is time, most of us literally use hundreds of apps or websites, across many devices - no exaggeration. On a given day, I almost always use my desktop, laptop, phone, watch and possibly a TV or two. I spend substantial time signing into apps/sites, verifying 2FA codes, and resetting passwords. It‚Äôs like a daily occurrence anymore. It‚Äôs gotten absolutely out of hand. 

In my mind, there is no reason at all that non-financial institutions should be closing sessions. It‚Äôs both annoying, and serves no security purpose. 

Example: Gmail signs me out of all of my emails every few days to ‚Äúverify it‚Äôs me‚Äù. Yet, my gmail account in chrome saves those passwords, so I never have to retype them, I just have to click through a few screens for each account on each of my devices every few days. 

Stuff like this is utterly pointless. You‚Äôd have to first get through my device password to get to a signed in account, and if you did, my passwords are saved anyway. 

It makes sense for banking apps and the like, but the rest just doesn‚Äôt matter and makes our lives more annoying. 

I assume some with say you manage with a password manager and it‚Äôs a non issue - but I use browser saved passwords, and LastPass, and it‚Äôs far from foolproof. I routinely find that things get out of sync, or you forget to hit update password, then of course you‚Äôre just resetting it. 

In general, security has gotten out of control. Apple prompts you for your password anything you do absolutely anything. I shouldn‚Äôt need a password to install or update a program. My sons Nintendo switch asked me for a password to view the Nintendo eshop, then another password entry to make the purchase of a game, along with two confirmations that I really wanted to spend a whole 10 bucks. It‚Äôs mind boggling to me. 


So CMV - is there a point to any of this annoying mess that I‚Äôm missing?"

7,2024-06-08,"CMV: If Trump is elected in November, conservatives will shift over to saying that the economy is strong, even though it will likely not change much from where it is currently.",u/VanillaIsActuallyYum,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1db9bcf/cmv_if_trump_is_elected_in_november_conservatives/,changemyview,"Inflation in the US is at 3.36% as of April 2024. This is obviously a huge improvement over its peak of 9.06% in June of 2022 but not as good as, say, the 0.33% we saw in April 2020, just before the pandemic really took hold. [Source](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_inflation_rate)

Nobody should be under any illusion that the catastrophic rise in inflation was due to anything other than the pandemic. You have to be willfully dishonest to blame any elected official for these historic leaps in inflation. You could maybe, MAYBE, say that 9% could have been more like 8.5% if our leaders did X Y or Z, MAYBE. But blaming them for the huge leap? No way. The fact that these massive jumps in inflation happened across the world, across all forms of government and political persuasions of all kinds, should be more than enough evidence to tell you that this wasn't the fault of any elected official.

Nevertheless, no matter how well the economy is recovering or how well it is doing in present time, I always hear the same common refrain from conservatives: ""I'm not feeling it."" Honestly, it's a piss-poor excuse, as it is essentially the same as saying *since I am not consciously aware of how the economy is improving, I contend that the economy has not improved.* Do you see how dishonest that angle is? And yet that's exactly the angle that conservatives take.

We also learned on Friday that the US economy added [272,000 jobs in May](https://apnews.com/article/jobs-hiring-unemployment-economy-inflation-federal-reserve-d1d73005dbc40b081a555850a44e73d1), considered a strong showing. Since January 2022, only five months have had job growth below 200k for the month ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/02/us-economy-added-353000-jobs-in-january-much-better-than-expected.html)) and the mean over the past couple years is about 300k from what I can tell, or 3.6 million jobs created per year. For reference, from 2014 to 2019, the US averaged 200k jobs created per month ([source](https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/ces0000000001?output_view=net_1mth)). Unemployment is currently at 4.0% (see earlier sources), which is only a bit higher than the historic low of 3.5% in February 2020. And this is only a couple years removed from a pandemic that once pushed the US unemployment rate to 14.8%!

So I look at these numbers, and I find it pretty darn easy to conclude that the economy is doing just fine. Sure, I know people are uttering the words ""I'm not feeling it"", but why should I care? The reality of your situation, on a national scale, seems totally fine to me. Just because you aren't CONSCIOUSLY aware that something is happening does not mean it is not actually happening.

In short, it seems really clear to me that conservative arguments about the economy are not actually based on fact, they are based on their desire to win, to put their dude in office for whatever ends they feel are important. And since the numbers for the economy are already solid, I guarantee that if their party took over, they'd just magically change their tune and say ""oh you know what, the economy is great, unemployment is near its historic low, job creation is a lot better than historical average, inflation is still continuing to go down AND by the way let's not forget that policies enacted by politicians don't have a whole lot of influence on inflation anyway!"" I mean these are literally the words I would say right now, and I'd be 100% correct in saying it all, and I am willing to bet that if Trump wins the election, conservatives will just immediately say the same and forget all this ""I'm not feeling it!"" business.

Let's speak purely on humanitarian grounds here.

Whatever happened in iraq for the removal of Saddam Hussein was required as by that point that guy was like a dog with a loose tie murdering his own citizens and army officers in thousands on monthly basis to keep himself in power. His sons were also contributing a lot in the efforts of there father to terrorize the people of iraq into submission..the famous ""football incidents"" are a good place to look at if you wish to find out about the works his oldest son.

The guy was also a reason for the stupid invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent diplomatic and economic isolation it caused for iraq which destroyed whatever economy iraq had after the brutal iraq iran war.

Thousands of Iraqis were starving to death by that point as a result of sanctions and Saddam murderous rage was only growing day by day consuming more people inside it..

The guy was a nut job with even his own backers in Syria turned into dreaded enemies..he was in short despised by both his own people and his neighbours fully.

As a matter of fact majority of Iraqis approved of the  American invasion and the subsequent toppling of the dictator! That was all before things went to hell with a bit of bad decisions of the US government..

If the invasion had never happened iraq would either had collapsed from internal unrest probably ending up like Yemen and Syria with no external military force entering to end the bloodshed unlike the coalition did during the Iraqi civil war..

Then there is the second option that can happen with it being Saddam and his family succesfully keeping themselves in power..by continuing to run the streets of iraq with blood.

Iraq effectively becomes another Turkmenistan or north Korea which is still terrible for its citizens...

In a way US saved iraq by getting rid of the psychopaths that ruled Baghdad. In short term they caused damage and in long term too a lot of damage was caused due to political and economic mismanagement on the side of US but overall iraq got actually liberated from a far worse fate.

The thing that shocks me the most is that modern day Iraqis admire Saddam Hussein..the man that there grandfather and maybe even father hated..like the same way modern Russians admire Stalin that can be considered behind one that most brutal periods of Russian history.

The stupidity of people shock me."
95,2024-06-08,CMV: Much of political discourse is over-generalization,u/BicycleNo4143,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dba3ym/cmv_much_of_political_discourse_is/,changemyview,"Yes, I know, the irony is not lost on me that I may be over-generalizing in this post itself.

What I am referring to in my view is my observation that political discourse often needlessly over-generalizes in unproductive ways. Capturing beliefs and sentiments as a ""group"" or a ""demographic"" generalizes and neglects the nuance and variety within each individual of a group.

How often do you hear the adage ""Conservatives say X"" or ""Liberals want Y"" or ""Men always A"" or ""Women nowadays all B"", ""\[insert demographic here\] always \[inserts generalization here\]."" Pretty often, right? But these statements are virtually meaningless, and value-less, in actual political discourse.

They are useless because they fail to capture reality, and entirely miss individual variance. For example, if you were to speak to a ""Conservative"", it is possible that you could challenge 20 different ""widely-held Conservative beliefs and stances"", and that individual could literally not hold any of them. You can wheel out pro-immigration arguments, pro-choice arguments, pro-Biden arguments--- but it's entirely possible that a Conservative exists who, for whatever reason they may wish, is pro-immigration, pro-choice, and pro-Biden already. 

Similarly, you could say the same about liberals. It's entirely possible for a liberal to exist who dislikes the Democratic candidates of present and past, who holds disdain for far-left social ""woke"" elements, who agrees with some traditional family and religious values. These things are not really, truly, necessarily incongruous.

So much of political discourse is bogged down nowadays by many different things, like polarization, over-moralization, misinformation, etc.; but I believe that over-generalization is also one of those elements which inhibits healthy discussions. When any dialogue begins that has a political lean to it, people often assume others inherit positions from their supposed ideological peers. ""Oh you're a Trump voter, you must believe X and Y view common to Trump voters"" is a worthless statement if said Trump voter does not hold those views. 

More political discourse should engage with the individual, not the group. I believe political discourse would be more productive, more genuine, and more engaging if the over-generalizations ceased. When you speak to a ""\[insert demographic here\]""--- don't speak to the demographic, speak to the PERSON you're speaking to. "

For background  I‚Äôve been in 2 serious monogamous relationships. About 2 years for each. 

Otherwise I‚Äôve had a couple girlfriends for a few months, that I never ‚Äúfell in love with‚Äù, but of course I loved them all to their own regard.

But anyways ,
Why do I feel the way i do?

The human ego is always looking for a good experience, not a displeasurable experience. In this the human ego looks for the best thing for itself- the nicest tasting food, the most comfortable bed, etc. 
A female and a male will naturally search for the most sexually desirable counterpart. In result of looking for the most sexual satisfaction, And so, this is how most relationships begin. People buying what the can afford with their own body. 

I‚Äôd say most people aren‚Äôt with their first sexual choice. The thought of going out in public and seeing other guys or girls that your partner wants to have sex with more makes me not want to fall in love with them or have sex with them. 
Lol, and before you shame me for being insecure, every human is naturally insecure of their superiors. 
For girls that‚Äôs the hotter girl that would be the better woman to get off to, for the guys that‚Äôs the more manly man with a more mature genitalia . 


Anyways, What‚Äôs the point of the dinners, cuddling, romance and flirting if she/he wishes it was another body that has sex with them at the end of the day? 
To me, the relationship is just over. Pointless. 

I think most people end up naturally falling in love as they become closer to their partner. No such thing as love at first sight. With the increasing bias/love comes delusion. For example, you may now be more sexually attracted to your partner and feel the most intense sexual feelings from them because you now have bias towards them, despite how physically hot they are or how mature their genitals are. They‚Äôre perfect, even though they aren‚Äôt actually. And to make the nail hit harder in the coffin, if someone else were to take their place in the same regard you would feel the same about that person, and say how their flaws are ‚Äúperfect‚Äù just the same. 
When in reality if you saw those same flaws on another human you didn‚Äôt know, you would call it what they are, flaws. And you would be repulsed by them. 

To put it plainly, if your partner got their first sexual choice and saw you walking down the street they would be glad they‚Äôre  with the hotter person rather than being with you. And your flaws wouldn‚Äôt be perfect to them, they would just be flaws. 


. At the end of the day, the way they got to know you they could have gotten to know that hotter person just the same. So you‚Äôre not special. No one is inherently special. Not even that hotter person. They‚Äôre just hotter and your partner would rather f-ck them more because they are hotter, and the Reason you and your partner can be together given that there is someone in the same space-time that is hotter than you  is because of this emotion we call love, I suppose.
To me, that‚Äôs pathetic. 



I‚Äôm not here to be negative. 
I‚Äôm here because I would like to see other peoples thoughts, why are you in a relationship? 
Personally I don‚Äôt want to be so alone, but it seems like the only logical way to live given these facts. (To me)





TLDR: I think people fall in love to compensate for the fact that their partner wasn‚Äôt their first sexual choice,

Imagine you work for a company. And that company's CEO is retiring. 

The company now creates a mandatory event that you and every other employee are required to attend. 

Bleachers will be set up for the executives and their families to set in. Every other employee will be required to stand infront of the bleachers while the CEO gives a speech about how great the company is and all the great things it has done. The new CEO will then come up and give a speech about how great the company is, how great the last CEO is, all the great things the company did under the previous CEO and all of the great things he will do as CEO. 

All of the non-executive employees just stand quietly while the executives talk about how great the company is. 

This event is mandatory. Not showing up will result is harsh punishments. 

This kind of egotistical circle jerking is incredibly toxic, out dated, and unfortunately still happens regurally in the miltiary. I am of the opinion that the military needs to stop doing this kind of toxic nonsense. It serves no purpose I am aware of and only makes lower ranks hate their lives and hate their command.

But it seems to be a very convenient way for a partner to shame their partner for opening up, while in turn expect that their traumas should be able to be fired off at any time.  I find this especially true in relationships.

**Example:**

Woman gets home from a long shift at work, and wants to start venting about the day.  The guy doesn't really want to listen to all her over nightmare stories constantly, explaining in detail about how everything made her feel and how she's the victim all the time. He's deemed as unsupportive, and selfish.

A man does the exact same thing and is told that he is being disrespectful and and trauma dumping, and it's not her job to be a sounding board or a therapist for you.

**Another example:**

It's date 5, she's starting to get comfortable opening up.  She starts going on a rant about every man she's ever met has been terrible in graphic detail.  You know full well you're only hearing one side of the story here, and that makes you feel uncomfortable, but you know for certain that if you told her that she was committing the offense of trauma dumping, she'd flip out.

Conversely, if a man responds with his own nightmarish relationship stories of yesterday on date 5 and the woman responds that you don't seem like you processed anything and have too much baggage.  That you need to get over it, and let it go.  Ultimately what you did is described as trauma dumping.

  
**Conclusion:**

I feel this term by and large has more to do with simply what you're willing to listen to.  If the information you are being presented upsets your worldview, the act is far more likely to be determined to be 'trauma dumping'.  If you can relate to the topic, you can garner empathy for the situation, which allows you to put yourself in their shoes during the discussion, it becomes engaging, and 'productive'.

This allows the term trauma dumping to be used as a tool to shame someone else for your their own inability to look outside of your box.  To me this places a lot of the use of 'trauma dumping' as an opinion rather than a determinable social injustice.  Ultimately I feel this weak concept can do a lot of harm to relations by and large."

I love the fact that time is so critical in that show, as it really adds to the trauma and suspense not to mention all the unexpected twists and turns it takes. Of course, Kiefer Sutherland will forever be known and associated with the character of Jack Bauer; he played that role so perfectly!

In season seven, you can argue that jack faces a reckoning of sorts when he's confronted with everything he has had to do in the name of protecting and defending America from terrorists. The season gets especially powerful and poignant after he is exposed to a weaponized virus the season's bad guys have developed, in a similar vein to when George Mason, played by Xander Berkley, was exposed to a lethal level of plutonium and was forced to come to grips with the choices he'd made in his life. Watching the toll that virus takes on Jack not only physically, but mentally as well...

There's this scene in the final episode of season seven between Jack and his partner for that season, Renee Walker (played by the late Annie Wershing,) that really captures who he is, what he's had to do and how conflicted he is about all of it; coupled with his knowledge that the virus is extremely advanced at this point, he isn't long for this world and has accepted that, but wants to pass the baton so to speak‚Ä¶
Probably one of the most powerful and poignant scenes in the entire series, and that's saying something.

What I think should've happened was have Kim, Jack's daughter still volunteer herself for the experimental stem cell treatment that had a chance, however slim, of neutralizing the virus, but Jack succumbs to it before the procedure can be performed. You talk about an unexpected twist? Viewers would expect Jack to go out like a bad ass in a blaze of glory, thanks to the series turning him into this invincible tough guy; no one would expect him to die like this and because ""24,"" in my opinion anyway had declined in quality throughout season six due to their over-reliance on previous plot devices, improved in season seven for sure but then became way too over the top, even borderline cartoonish and almost pathetically predictable in seasons eight and nine, this would've been a good way to send him off. Not everyone goes out like a bad ass; in fact, I'd venture a guess that most people don't. The fact he has accepted, embraced, even welcomed death at the point of the scene I'm linking to here. This is how he should've gone out, not as a fugitive on the run from his own government or being tortured in a Russian prison. https://youtu.be/8xj-a1n8puI?si=qkcmtIDejsOcQGo9"
0,2024-06-08,"CMV: HR 7521 is constitutional, does not violate the First Amendment, and ByteDance Ltd. lacks Article III standing to challenge to the law in federal court ",u/Keylime-to-the-City,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dbe9j4/cmv_hr_7521_is_constitutional_does_not_violate/,changemyview,"In April, Congress passed, with President Biden signing into law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (or simply ""HR 7521""), which requires Chinese firm ByteDance, owner of TikTok, to divest its assets to an American company or be banned from any app store or web hosting service in the US by January 19th, 2025. 

ByteDance and a host of influences on TikTok filed suit in the District Court of DC challenging the law as unconstitutional under the First Amendment. There is a lot more nuance to the suit than the media protrays, such as facts documented in ByteDance's filing and in the District Court for the District of Montana which held Montana's statewide ban of TikTok was unconstitutional under simular (but importantly different) legal arguments. 

ByteDance alleges HR 7521 violates the 1A, that national security concerns cited do not stand up to strict scrutiny, and that the law would ""silence the voices of our 170 million Amerocan users"". The last argument is absolutely absurd, as I doubt the actual number is 170 million **active users**. This argument will not persuade me, so we will focus on the first two. 

**First Amendment**

The lynchpin of ByteDance's argument is that HR 7521 violates the 1A. This is nonsense. As influences have sued for harm to their own speech as users, we must instead look at how ByteDance's own speech is harmed. The company is freely using the media, and their little stunt in March where they sicced the nation's teenagers on Congress to oppose a law they do not understand (more on this later), demonstrate the law does not harm their ability to engage in speech. The majority of the company's own speech does not occur on TikTok anyways. Trump tried twice, unsuccessfully, to use an executive order to ban TikTok. That failed, and in 2019, ByteDance engaged with the government after a previous tech worker testified before Congress that the company's data harvesting was a national security risk to the country and to Americans' private data to being given to the CCP. Following this, ByteDance attempted to tame the growing scrutiny by agreeing to invest $2 billion to build a domestic database with Oracle to hold Americans' data. They also gave the US the ability to activate a killswitch on ByteDance's ability to operate in the US. These were documented in the successful lawsuit in Montana, where a federal judge enjoined the state's use of its TikTok ban last year. However, the judge himself noted this was preliminary as a trial was still pending to he held on the merits. To me, the company's own speech isn't chilled in any way by HR 7521, so it cannot raise a successful 1A challenge on the merits. 

**National Security**

In its DC filing, ByteDance argues such a law is ""unprecedented"" and the national security risks raised do not pass the strict scrutiny such laws must muster to pass. They further argue that claims of data sharing with the CCP has ""never occured"" due to a ""lack of public record"". And of course there isnt a public record, why would there be? Do people realistically expect a surveillance state like the CCP to put out a press release saying as much? China launches cyber attacks on the US. After Asutralia banned Huawei, China launched cybersecurity attacks on the Aussies in retaliation. But surely such claims are unprecedented, right guys? 

No matter, unlike Montana, the Commerce Clause permits Congress to exercise exclusive control over interstate and international commerce, unlike an individual state. Additionally, national security has historically passed strict scrutiny on Constitutional rights in the past with the Supreme Court. Given China *is* a foreign Adversary, *is* an aggressor of cyber-terrorost attacks on the US, and **is** a surveillance state of its own people, there are indeed enough merits to support bypassing the 1A. While ByteDance wants to argue that it is not a vector point of attack or danger, it's stunt of unleashing a bunch of ignorant teenagers who cannot comprehend geopolitical matters like this was further proof of the danger of TikTok. It doesn't matter if there is no CCP propaganda examples (to my knowledge), as this incident proved they are capable of it. 

Finally, I believe the courts should go a step further and state that foreign entities cannot possess Article III standing to challenge laws like this in federal court. Chinese businessmen who do not have American citizenship are not entitled to our legal rights and should not be permitted to weaponize our laws against us to stifle our ability to combat our enemies (sorry Reddit communist, but the CCP hates you). They should issue a landmark ruling which permanently ends the ability of foreign businesses and governments to keep attack vectors open.

Feel free to state your opinion about how do humans form opinion.. here‚Äôs mine 

Like as I understand it, opinions are preceded by emotions, we form arbitrary emotions depending on a situation that are out of our control: emotion are deep, hard to describe or explain, they have an arbitrary nature and are unpredictable.. now our inherent introspective capabilities allow us to interpret our emotional state, such that we can reflect on it, think on it, hence we create sentiments by reflecting on our emotions.. 


Well for exemple; you are  in math class, can‚Äôt solve an exercise for the life of you, you feel despair, helpless, devastated,demoralized, demotivated, you beg for this nightmare to end, can‚Äôt endure it any longer, at any moment your world could collapse. 



Once it‚Äôs over you finally feel relieved, relaxed, you are now able to think correctly you‚Äôre no longer under the influence of your emotions.. now unconsciously you start reflecting on said emotions and come to the conclusion that you suck at math, and that you will never succeed at it hence there‚Äôs nothing you can do that‚Äôll help, if you will never succeed why bother even try, hence you come to the conclusion that mathematics is useless.. hence you will avoid math as much as possible all of your life, it‚Äôll reflect on your choice of field of study, job etc.



On the contrary if you had a math teacher such that when you come to class he makes you feel joyful, happy, you will come to the conclusion that he‚Äôs a good,genuine person: hence you will want to get good grades to thank him or to pay him back for being such as a good person, as if you were indebted to him, and having good grades is way to pay him back.. hence you will get motivated etc ..

Also there are a lot documented bias in scientific literature on human behavior, halo effect..  where the sight of a good looking face suscites a strong positive emotion in humans, surprisingly it‚Äôs not reproductive, it‚Äôs just a feel good emotion, and you unconsciously associates said person with a good looking face with positive attribute such as honesty, respectable, etc you will form an opinion of said person; he‚Äôs a good guy. All because he made you feel good..  

Or maybe for politics , maybe you hear a politician said one thing that happened to upset you or hurt you : you feel upset etc now your opinion is that he‚Äôs a bad guy: you won‚Äôt for him etc

I think it's time we give up the softer and more empathetic policies which clearly aren't working. I think we can take a cue from two countries that have policies showing some ideas that really do work:



**EXHIBIT A: EL SALVADOR**

I just watched an interview with Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador.

This is a [story](https://www.itv.com/news/2023-06-26/el-salvadors-murder-rate-has-fallen-dramatically-but-at-what-cost) that has gone woefully under-reported in the western media, and I think it's because it shows something that makes a lot of people uncomfortable in 1st world countries: when you crack down hard on crime, it can be extremely effective.

Short version of [what happened](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_gang_crackdown)...

El Salvador used to have one of the world's highest murder rates. Violent gangs ran roughshod over the terrified citizens living in El Salvador, killing and committing other capital crimes with little to fear from law enforcement.

>El Salvador used to have the world‚Äôs highest murder rate; **106 homicides per 100,000 people** in 2015.

Then in March of 2022, there was a slaughter of civilians in the street with apparently no rhyme or reason, apparently the gangs just decided they wanted to flaunt their murderous barbarity in a very public way just to assert their domination and mock law enforcement.

If this happened in the United States, it would be the equivalent of the gangs killing 5000 people in three days.

>From 25 to 27 March 2022, 87 people were murdered in El Salvador, including 62 people on Saturday alone, the highest single-day tally in decades; by contrast, 79 people were murdered throughout the entire month of February. **The victims were targeted randomly.**

This seemed to have been the last straw for the El Salvadorian government, and they decided it was time to shut down these murderous monsters once and for all.

So then what happened is, the government of El Salvador built a megaprison to house all of these killers for decades, maybe even life. The controversy comes because these gang members were arrested and jailed without due process.

The thing is, if you're a gang member in El Salvador, you almost always have gang tattoos. This makes it very easy to identify who is in a gang, as you can imagine. Denying membership in a gang is hard to do when you're covered in gang tattoos.

As much as we value due process, this is one of those relatively rare situations where the idea that someone is ""innocent until proven guilty"" is a bit silly. It's like having a tattoo on your face that says ""I AM A GANG MEMBER WHO MURDERS PEOPLE"" and trying to argue that you're just an ordinary citizen.

And wouldn't you know it, after this crackdown, the homicide rate plummeted.

>The homicide rate has fallen to **7.6 per 100,000** and may drop even lower this year.

We as Americans and people from other first world nations might take issue with removing due process to stop the mass slaughter of innocent civilians, but maybe we should listen to the people actually living in El Salvador.

>Domestically, the crackdown was popular. An April 2022 Gallup poll found that 91% of Salvadorans supported the government's actions, including 78% who ""very much"" supported them. Many Salvadorans explained that they were weary of violence, and many Salvadorans living in the United States supported the crackdown.

Even though the dramatic drop in homicide rate kind of proves that these guys are the cause, they're still putting forth the colossal time and financial resources to give them all fair trials, even though their guilt is literally sprawled on their bodies.

While it's true that a tiny minority of people who were arrested because of their gang tattoos might be posers or otherwise not guilty of capital crimes, this has been accounted for by the defense minister.

>Human rights advocates have criticized the arrests as often arbitrary, based on a person's appearance or residence, and expressed concern that innocent people are being caught in the sweeps. Bukele claimed that only 1% of arrests would be incorrect, and Salvadoran Defense Minister Ren√© Merino Monroy claimed that arrested persons found to have no links to gangs would be freed, saying that ""the people need to know that if they're not involved in anything bad, nothing bad will happen to them.

So yeah, this is a story that I think is not reported on enough, and it shows that sometimes cracking down hard on crime might just be the right thing to do when nothing else works.

What do you guys think about this? I don't see a big problem here. The government saw a state of emergency going on with gangs of violent monsters slaughtering innocent civilians, eventually out of pure wanton frenzy, and they put a stop to it by making the sacrifice of temporarily suspending due process. And guess what? It could not have possibly worked better.

**How this can work in the United States**

While we don't have the same ease of prosecution since gang members might not so easily display their membership here, it should be good enough to arrest violent gang members normally. The difference is how we punish them.

Unfortunately, under the constitution, caning would be considered ""cruel and unusual"" punishment. That's really unfortunate, because I think having public canings would drastically reduce gang crime. The reason is because it takes away the ""street cred"" and ""cool factor"" of being in a gang. So it's really tragic that we can't use caning as a punishment for gang activity.

So, instead, we're forced to be more draconian. Drastically increase sentencing. Make it so that being arrested for gang crimes is not something where you go on a stint in jail, learn how to be a better gangster, get street cred, and return to a life of crime. That's not working. We need to make it so that if you're involved in gang activity, you go away for a long time. You're missing out on huge chunks of your life.

We should make it so that any crime affiliated with gang activity, even if it's something relatively mild, has a minimum 10 years in prison. First offense. No slaps on the wrist, no plea deals, fuck that. **It's time to solve the problem.**

Much of what will help solve gang crime under this policy is related to drug charges. Since drug dealing is a big part of gang ""culture"", a big part of that will be solved by a policy introduced in the next exhibit:

  
**EXHIBIT B: SINGAPORE**

I'll try to make this one shorter.

In America, we've tried treating the drug epidemic as a matter of public health. but I don't think there's good evidence to show that this works. When it comes to the stranglehold that drugs have on the brains of their victims, I believe that there's really only two ways to stop people (or greatly limiting) people from doing drugs:

1) Harsh punishments for drug users

and

2) The death penalty for drug dealers. First offense.

Singapore has proven that this works - they have both policies, and they work extremely well. Furthermore, the population of Singapore is very happy with this policy and they overwhelmingly support it.

>As Singapore is a small island nation with no exportable¬†[natural resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resources), its¬†[economic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy)¬†at the time was based on¬†[added-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added)¬†activities (such as¬†[factory work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing)¬†or sea-bourne¬†[cargo logistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Singapore)) from an industrious and efficient society, which the possibility of a large percentage of the population becoming unproductive due to¬†[drug addiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_addiction)¬†posed an enormous economic threat. The Government of Singapore responded with a¬†[zero tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_tolerance)¬†policy regarding the abuse of all types of drugs, aiming to rapidly contain the sudden heroin epidemic via new laws that proscribed harsh punishments for both traffickers (such as¬†[the death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Singapore)) and consumers (including¬†[caning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caning_in_Singapore)) alike

Unfortunately, as I say, when it comes to the extreme stranglehold that drugs have on addicts, in my view, the only thing that could possibly dissuade addicts from using or dealers from dealing is draconian punishments. Many addicts become that way because the drugs are ubiquitous and easily accessible. You severely limit the supply by executing drug dealers on the first offense. The profit potential skyrockets, but the risk is entirely unreasonable for the vast majority of drug dealers. Supply plummets, and thereby, the number of addicts plummets.

And as I mentioned above, this will help drastically reduce gang culture in America because drug dealing is such a big part of it. If getting caught dealing drugs means you're executed on the first offense, a big part of gang culture disappears overnight.

So with these two policies implemented, I believe this will drastically reduce crime, drug addiction, gang activity and gang culture, and thus countless lives will be improved. Once it's been made clear that the state will genuinely not tolerate these things, these crimes will, in large part, come to a screeching halt. El Salvador and Singapore have shown us this.

I believe this is all perfectly constitutional as well. We just need to have the courage to do what needs to be done. But I already know that many of you disagree with this - why? Change my view."

She doesn't actually have any proof that he is cheating on her. She is talking about what she THINKS he is up to, not what he is ACTUALLY up to. 

What most likely happened is that he went to a bar with his friends to escape his crazy bitch of a girlfriend for one single night, and she found out. She immediately jumps to ""he is cheating on me"" and takes the completely sane and level response of vandalizing his prized, expensive truck. "

Believers of any religion often describe it as a peaceful way of living that emphasizes treating others well. However, on closer examination, religions also enforce certain ways of living and believing. Modern political correctness is similar. What started as an ideology to fight discrimination has, in some cases, become a force compelling others to adopt specific beliefs and practices. This includes memorizing numerous pronouns, allowing individuals previously identified as male to compete in female sports, implementing affirmative action, or requiring three bathrooms in every facility.

Many of these ideas are contentious and not universally accepted, much like the tenets of any religion. It is troubling that the government is attempting to enforce these beliefs, as it leads to resistance and division."

It seems like there‚Äôs daily news stories about record inflation and housing/living costs and hundreds of comments of people outraged over immigration.

The odds are probably no greater than getting crushed by a rock that tumbled down a hill. I don‚Äôt think moving rocks is destroying bugs habitats either. Humans are part of nature. And we interact with nature. Stacking rocks is a part of it. We throw down gravel for trails, clog up streams with trash, chop down trees for parks. It just sounds like a joke that my miniscule outdoor activity has any real negative effects on the environment. 

NOW I will say in tourist areas where there are rivers, creeks, streams, etc. I can see why this could be bad. You could potentially block a stream or creek. Which can‚Äôt be good for the wildlife. But stacking rocks at the beach? Or in an area where not a lot of people travel and more importantly there are no other rock stacks? I see no problem with practicing this activity in these places. "

They may be forced to house hostages

Feel free to state your opinion about how do humans form opinion.. here‚Äôs mine 

Like as I understand it, opinions are preceded by emotions, we form arbitrary emotions depending on a situation that are out of our control: emotion are deep, hard to describe or explain, they have an arbitrary nature and are unpredictable.. now our inherent introspective capabilities allow us to interpret our emotional state, such that we can reflect on it, think on it, hence we create sentiments by reflecting on our emotions.. 


Well for exemple; you are  in math class, can‚Äôt solve an exercise for the life of you, you feel despair, helpless, devastated,demoralized, demotivated, you beg for this nightmare to end, can‚Äôt endure it any longer, at any moment your world could collapse. 



Once it‚Äôs over you finally feel relieved, relaxed, you are now able to think correctly you‚Äôre no longer under the influence of your emotions.. now unconsciously you start reflecting on said emotions and come to the conclusion that you suck at math, and that you will never succeed at it hence there‚Äôs nothing you can do that‚Äôll help, if you will never succeed why bother even try, hence you come to the conclusion that mathematics is useless.. hence you will avoid math as much as possible all of your life, it‚Äôll reflect on your choice of field of study, job etc.



On the contrary if you had a math teacher such that when you come to class he makes you feel joyful, happy, you will come to the conclusion that he‚Äôs a good,genuine person: hence you will want to get good grades to thank him or to pay him back for being such as a good person, as if you were indebted to him, and having good grades is way to pay him back.. hence you will get motivated etc ..

Also there are a lot documented bias in scientific literature on human behavior, halo effect..  where the sight of a good looking face suscites a strong positive emotion in humans, surprisingly it‚Äôs not reproductive, it‚Äôs just a feel good emotion, and you unconsciously associates said person with a good looking face with positive attribute such as honesty, respectable, etc you will form an opinion of said person; he‚Äôs a good guy. All because he made you feel good..  

Or maybe for politics , maybe you hear a politician say one thing that happened to upset you or hurt you : you feel upset etc now your opinion is that he‚Äôs a bad guy: you won‚Äôt vote for him, you can no longer stand the sight of him or the sound of his voice etc 


Now the craziest part is whatever opinion is it you hold, nobody can make you change it without you disregarding or reflecting on said emotions that caused you to create this opinion.

Let‚Äôs say you say ;mathematics is useless

One could use a thousands of rational and concise answer to help you change your opinion, they could even have a PHd in psychology and philosophy  you wouldn‚Äôt change your opinion.even Aristotle himself revived from the dead couldn‚Äôt make you change opinion using rhetoric. Logos would simply not work on you.


But maybe pathos would actually work, maybe a random guy could make you change opinion, if he suscites in you good emotions, maybe he‚Äôs charming, funny , when you‚Äôre around him you feel only good emotions, hence you think he‚Äôs a good guy, maybe once he has gained your trust he can try to help you reflect on said emotions. Maybe you would think ; mathematics are not that useless after all‚Ä¶

This disparity in expectations seems unfair and, in my view, can be considered a form of racism.

Here are a few points to support my perspective:

1. Israel's actions, particularly in conflicts, receive intense international scrutiny and media coverage compared to those of neighboring countries. For example, human rights violations or military actions by other countries in the region often receive less attention and criticism.

2. The United Nations and other international bodies frequently criticize Israel. While holding any nation accountable for human rights is essential, the disproportionate focus on Israel compared to countries with worse human rights records seems biased.

3. Israel is a small country surrounded by many adversarial states. The unique security challenges it faces often lead to measures that, while controversial, are deemed necessary by its government for national security. However, these measures are often judged without considering the historical and geopolitical context.

4. Israel is often compared to Western democracies and expected to uphold similar standards. While it's reasonable to expect democracies to adhere to high standards, it seems unfair not to consider that Israel operates in a significantly different and more hostile environment.

5. Some of the criticism against Israel appears to blur the lines with anti-Semitic sentiments, where the Jewish state is held to standards that are not equally applied to others, potentially fueling prejudice against Jews worldwide.

I believe that holding any country to a standard is important for international accountability. However, the disproportionate expectations placed on Israel, while overlooking the actions of its neighbors, reflect a biased and unfair approach that can be seen as a form of racism."

We're holding regional, federal, and EU elections today in Belgium.  Vlaams Belang is currently polling to become the largest party (\~25% of the votes).  However Vlaams Belang is a far right Flemish nationalist party.  It is also the only party in Belgian history to have been convicted of racism.  (Technically speaking Vlaams Blok was convicted of racism and they no longer exist, after it was disbanded a new party, Vlaams Belang, was formed by the same members.)

For those unware, the cordon sanitaire is an agreement between the other major political parties that no party shall form a coalition with VB.  This used to be a written agreement in the Vlaams Blok days.  

So, why do I believe it should remain intact:  I believe it should remain intact because VB hasn't changed significantly since it was created.  They are still, in my opinion, a group of racists with fascist tendencies.  They want to return us to 'traditional values', members of their party have been caught implying that women belong in the kitchen, not in the workforce.  They want to take away basically all LGBT+ rights, including the right to marry.  They want to limit access to euthanasia, if not take it away all together.  They want to basically pull us out of the EU.  They publicly say that they will declare Flemish independence if no agreement can be made on how to do this peacefully.

  
So, change my view, why should other parties form a coalition with VB?"

I see many people calming everything was fine for the Palestinians bEfOrE oCt 7 when it wasn‚Äôt. 

I will mention some quotes from the [Amnesty international](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/) : 


Soon after Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, in June 1967, the Israeli military authorities consolidated complete power over all water resources and water-related infrastructure in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). 50 years on, Israel continues to control and restrict Palestinian access to water in the OPT to a level which neither meets their needs nor constitutes a fair distribution of shared water resources.

In November 1967 the Israeli authorities issued Military Order 158, which stated that Palestinians could not construct any new water installation without first obtaining a permit from the Israeli army. Since then, the extraction of water from any new source or the development of any new water infrastructure would require permits from Israel, which are near impossible to obtain. 

Israel even controls the collection of rain water throughout most of the West Bank, and rainwater harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities are often destroyed by the Israeli army. As a result, some 180 Palestinian communities in rural areas in the occupied West Bank have no access to running water, 

 As a result of continuous restrictions, many Palestinian communities in the West Bank have no choice but to purchase water brought in by trucks at a much high prices ranging from 4 to 10 USD per cubic metre. In some of the poorest communities, water expenses can, at times, make up half of a family‚Äôs monthly income.


This is the worst part :

‚ÄúIsraeli settlers living alongside Palestinians in the West Bank ‚Äì in some cases just a few hundred meters away ‚Äì face no such restrictions and water shortages, and can enjoy and capitalize on well-irrigated farmlands and swimming pools.
In Gaza, some 90-95 per cent of the water supply is contaminated and unfit for human consumption. Israel does not allow water to be transferred from the West Bank to Gaza‚Äù

they become negative when exaggerated and therefore can cause outbursts of violence and hurt other individuals; However, in themselves they are positive and should be encouraged: being strong, knowing how to provide for yourself and others and having the ability to tolerate both emotional and mental pain without annoying others are all EXTREMELY positive things.

We leftists never side with war, we hated it with russia and ukraine, israel and palestine, the US and iraq, vietnman,and just any war that was not defensive basically. I want to mention though, that we have, a sick mindset, a hypocritical and an almost blind mindset, as we tend to disrespect people who came back from the claws of war.

No, I am not pulling the classic ""respect veterans"" type of talk that you see on youtube or on bing news comment sections, I am instead arguing for a more civil approach when you deal with this sort of stuff. We are not hate mongers who hate landlords, rich people and war veterans. We are supposedly advocates for peace and a place for everyone, we are civil, and if you're gonna accuse every servicemen of being a fascist and a child murderer, then I would argue that you are missing the point, and well, you're kind of a dick.

  
My proposal to anyone reading this who gets heated when they hear the cursed phrase ""thank you for your service"", is that, instead, we could say ""Glad that you are home"". 

Glad that you are home? Well, think about it. This phrase does not support the foreign affairs a country had, and thus you are not an advocate for war, you are instead displaying gratefulness that someone came home safe, because truth is, most soldiers just wanted that the second they saw the horrors. 

A soldier is a guardian, and every society no matter what your political stance has a soldier, different word, different purpose, different nation, but the same concept, someone who protects people from outside threats., And our problems are when a guardian is used to attack rather than guard. Let us not insult and disrespect the guardian, as I instead offer that we become more civil, and show gratitude that someone made it safe from the sharp claws of death, while always and always acknowledging how unjust and disgusting the governmental act was to send guardians to become aggressors. 

  
So far so good? Uh, no?

Well, no indeed. There is a point to be made, that is, most soldiers have a mindset that advocates for national interest, and most of them may call you a hippie for criticizing that, I mean, let's look at Vietnam. 

  
People often say ""thank you for your service"" when someone talks about their experience, however, when you are an advocate for peace, you will not acknowledge this service as necessary, you'll instead call it as a waste of human life, as we got ourself somewhere we didn't need to, and ended up killing our own people and their people. 

What you could do, instead of saying that the vets are fascists child murderers, which is a terrible terrible overgeneralization that has no basis, and even if most soldiers went voluntarily, it does not serve justice to the soldier's intentions and it generalizes every soldier as a war criminal, which is an unhealthy mindset. 

I offer that we show gratitude that they are back home alive, while continuing to fight for the peaceful cause through protests and other means, because we are peace advocates.

  
It's more civil, more understanding and less jumpy and ridiculous, and uh, to frank with you, it makes people actually listen to us, which is what we are fighting for, for our voice to be heard, and we really want to represent our ideas as reasonable educated that call for peace and harmony, and not as jumpy overheated online arguments that the right often associates us with.

  
The change needs to start within, and this change involves us to be the bigger headed here, and realize that, just because someone doesn't share our view, no matter how morally low it is, resorting to disrespect should be the last on the list (not that you can't resort to it, there are times where it's needed, but you know, just, don't be disrespectful to people if no one insulted you), and if you thought that peace was not the way for us to be heard, then you do you, but I just wanted to offer a chance that we show more humility and social decency when presenting ethics to an issue.

The operation was brutal, with Hamas fighters fighting to the death to prevent the hostages from being rescued, and civilians caught in the crossfire. Hundreds of civilians died and Israel was able to rescue four hostages.

This strongly debunks the myth of the so called ‚Äútargeted operation war‚Äù that many on Reddit call for. Proponents say Israel should not bomb buildings that may contain or conceal terrorist infrastructure, instead launching targeted ground operations to kill Hamas terrorists and recover hostages. This latest raid shows why that just isn‚Äôt practical. Assuming the civilian death to hostage recovered ratio remains similar to this operation, over 17,000 Palestinian civilians would be killed in recovering hostages, let alone killing every Hamas fighter. 

Hamas is unabashed in their willingness to hide behind their civilians. No matter what strategy Israel uses in this war, civilians will continue to die. This operation is yet more evidence that the civilian deaths are the fault of Hamas, not Israel, and that a practical alternative strategy that does not involve civilian deaths is impractical. "

- However, it can be the case that the best goal scorer on one team is not the best penalty taker, while the best scorer on another team is. This means that the latter player has an advantage in season-ending rankings due to benefiting from additional goal chances.

- For example, the list of [top Premier League goal scorers by season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_top_Premier_League_goal_scorers_by_season) simply lists the top goal scorers. However, it does not break out the penalty vs. non-penalty goals. Thus, while Haaland scored 36 goals in 2022-23 (setting the Premier League record), the context that 7 of these were penalties is left out. 

- So while Haaland only earned 1 in his record-breaking season, he was able to take 7 penalty shots. 

- ""Does this matter when one can look deeper into the stats and find this same information?"" Probably not at a deeper level, but on the surface level it is almost gifting goals that the player didn't earn (or did, but not to the extent of a goal from open play).

- This would not lead to a substantial increase in the number of penalties given per game, as penalties are still a high-conversion opportunity and the risk of fouling in the box is still not worth giving the team a free shot against the keeper.

- ""What if the player who was fouled was not even going to shoot, they were going to pass to a different player that would shoot?"" Well in that case the goal still relies on the player completing a pass, now it relies on them completing a shot. 


Note:

- if the player who was fouled is injured and must be taken out of the game, then a different player can take the penalty"

but there is some countries  that have done very well with a dictator for example Singapore/ and el salvador with homicide rates. i can admit these are outliers and most dictators in history has been evil people.

but i think a lot of people should not vote. a lot just vote on teams democrat or republican instead of seeing what policies the leaders support.or people dont understand what happens if x country does that  look at Brexit wick sucked for the economy of the uk and made it worse for the people. but at the end of they day it was the people choice not leader

i think if you had a dictator  that wanted to do good things and help the country instead of being a tyrant.  you would have a better leader. than elected for example Donald trump

I believe this is a logical view since otherwise, why wouldn't the hostages just leave? Or the rescuers could have simply walked in without taking any fire. 

Therefore the presence of the hostages proves that militants were operating in the Al Nuseirat area, which makes it a legitimate military target. Israel conducted a raid on a legitimate military target and was under fire during the escape, meaning even more militants were around. The bombing and shelling to clear a path for them is a legitimate use of force because the goal was to kill the militants preventing the IDF from rescuing the hostages. 

I think like 270 people died, and though there is no clear indication of how many were militants, it's a very safe assumption to say that a portion of those deaths were indeed militants. The rest are civilian casualties, which are terrible, but that is a result of the battlefield that Hamas has chosen.

Just stressing the amount of casualties on the Palestinian side isn't going to change my view. The IDF was under fire and Israel is under no obligation to put it's soldiers in harms way and not try to eliminate the enemy combatants.

What would change my mind is reporting that the IDF was not under fire at all, any kind of reports that indicate they were bombing areas that where nowhere near the hostage locations or escape route, anything that indicates the militants laid down their arms but were executed after surrendering, etc. "

Those people do not work nearly hard enough to EARN a living wage. You don‚Äôt need a college degree to get a real job and there are plenty of opportunities. Yet, many laws are being changed to raise minimum wages throughout the United States of America, but why? This causes the prices of items to go up, so it generally doesn‚Äôt really help at all. 
In my opinion minimum wage jobs are made for people that are in school and saving money for things like college or a car. I also think minimum wage jobs are for retired people that still enjoy working. There is no reason the minimum wage should support living for a middle aged citizen. It‚Äôs the minimum wage for a reason, they are the easiest jobs.

https://youtu.be/-bv-xiUddv4?si=Ihsf3GSjiPZ6tWuJ

Efilism is the view that life is intrinsically bad because it is full of unnecessary suffering so it is better for all life to go extinct.

All humans constantly experience negative feelings such as boredom, hunger, thirst, fear, tiredness, anger and loneliness. Consider the hours of hunger before eating a meal or the boredom of school and work. Compare that to the laughter of a joke that made you happy for a minute.

Some humans experience more extreme forms of suffering such as depression, crime, natural disasters and diseases. Farm animals experience terrible conditions on factory farms. Wild animals frequently get eaten alive or die of starvation (see the video).


Let me ask you a few questions; 

If you could live every life on the planet, would you do it?

If you could press a button to populate a planet with 1 thousand tortured beings and 1 million happy beings, would you do it?

If your answer is no to both questions, then you should be an efilist. 

Even if some lives were worth living it would not justify the extreme suffering of other beings.

Non existent beings have no urge, no desire and no need to become happy. Happy beings do not need to exist. So, it is illogical to allow happy lives to exist at the expense of unhappy ones.

0,2024-06-09,CMV: America should give North Korea a nuclear weapon.,u/Jew_of_house_Levi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dc13e1/cmv_america_should_give_north_korea_a_nuclear/,changemyview,"**More specifically, by giving nuclear weapons to North Korea, America could turn North Korea from a Chinese-dependent state into a Chinese antagonist state, which would benefit America, without substantially increasing the risks America currently faces.**

Ok, give me a chance to explain this idea.

This is how I understand the current dynamic of North Korea/United States/Chinese relations/

Kim Jung Un wants to maintain power in North Korea, and has shaped his country to be highly resistant to regime change. Part of that strategy is reducing his people's contact with outside influences, part of it is having a huge military with a lot of conventional firepower, and part of it is having nuclear weapons.

America, generally, opposed totalitarian and rogue states, and is wary of the immense danger that nuclear nations have, and seeks to reduce this risk. As such, it has strong sanctions on North Korea in hoping to weaken North Korea.

NK, being sanctioned, requires food and energy imports to sustain its economy, which it gets from China.

China both opposes American hegemony and North Korean nuclear weapons. That is to say, while China would prefer for American hegemony to decrease, China wants to be the sole power in the region, and a nuclear armed state right on its border is an obstacle here.

**Main argument:**¬†If America were to ""give"" North Korea a nuclear weapon, that wouldn't substantially change the balance of power on the ground. One additional weapon will not change the result of a nuclear exchange.

North Korea would likely accept, as this would slightly aid Kim Jung Un's regime stability.

China, however, would likely perceive this as North Korea ""accepting American influence"" and be very upset with North Korea, straining the relationship there. This might have a wide variety of outcomes, but in general, would put America in a better geopolitical situation, as China would be just a little more geopolitically isolated.

**How to change my mind:**

1. Show that the risk to America would actually sharply incline, rather than a marginal change.
2. Show that the North Korea-Chinese relationship would not change for the worse.
3. Show that America wouldn't somehow benefit from this, or that the benefit would be tiny.
4. Show that Chinese hegemony decreasing wouldn't necessarily lead to America benefiting.
5. Show that this could have some unintended negative consequences elsewhere (specifically being vague, allowing for flexibility here).
6. Show that America could accomplish the same result with less risk or less cost (should be different than just ""Send a different military system"").
7. Show that the political leaders here are likely to act irrationally (will require HIGH bar of evidence though).



**What won't change my mind:**

1. Morality argument - I'm not trying to argue about American imperialism or whatnot. Sure, you might think that if America has greater dominance in the world, that is a bad thing, but I'm not here to argue that.
2. ""Allies would be upset"" - this is probably true, and I already agree that allies could make the situation worse. The only reason I wouldn't cmv here is that I already agree.
3. ""This is crazy"" - great, I think it's a crazy idea too, but I think it would work. Tell me why it *wouldn't* work.

Alright, ready to argue!"

I disagree, because letting a beginner feel the succes of being able to speak a new language makes them confident enough to keep talking, as they pick up on the language and have more conversations they compere their own language to native speakers and by time corrects the mistakes they‚Äôve been learning.

I do think there‚Äôs an exception when you can tell someone‚Äôs repeatedly making the same mistake over and over, you should probably let them now, but if someone learning a new language and the message comes across, I think the confidence and motivation to keep going is more important than correcting insignificant mistakes.

But sometimes I feel like people haven‚Äôt actually made an effort to try tools beyond asking chatgpt to write basic cringy lyrics.

Through music we share emotions, stories, and empathize with each other. At the end of the day AI cannot come up with it‚Äôs own experiences. Only artists are capable of deeply empathizing with people and translating their experiences into music.

Which brings me to the next point, the invention of multi track recording didn‚Äôt wipe out the music industry. It propelled it to places most people before couldn‚Äôt even imagine. New genres emerged which were not possible before. In my opinion AI vocal and song tools like suno and udio will make it easier to experiment with ideas and find inspiration. They will unlock new forms of art. For example drakes use of AI vocals, while now controversial, may be interesting in the future as artists find creative use cases.

Similarly using a rhyming dictionary doesn‚Äôt mean your songwriting isn‚Äôt legitimate, in fact I would argue using a tool lets you write better music since you can discover words you wouldn‚Äôt have though of before. Songwriting tools like freshbots should be seen as just that, tools to help you find inspiration for how to translate your personal experiences into lyrics. I don‚Äôt see how that is different than a rhyming dictionary?

Growing up away from India, I went to religious school every Sunday and was blessed to be in the presence of a Swami at our Ashram. Many wise teachers from around the West came every Summer to teach the kids at summer camp, and I feel like I really had a great philosophical education as a result. 

One thing that I was taught was that Hinduism isn't a religion, it's a lifestyle entrenched in beliefs. The term religion was essentially forced upon Hindus for Christians/Muslims to make sense of the way of life, but it differs from Abrahamic religions quite a lot. From my Vedantic school of thought, what was preached at the end of the day was that if you're educated and living life to the fullest of your truth, that is all the matters. 

This extent can be gone so far to even reject the stories that Hindus believe as their history, but embrace them as morals to learn and grow from. To quote one of the wisest Acharyas I've met, ""If someone in 2000 years found a Harry Potter book, then dug up Hogwarts at Universal Studios, would they believe this story is real?"" As I grew up and researched more through the lens of fair science, it became very clear that holding onto these beliefs as truth is self-damaging and hinders any growth in a person.

Since I'm American, I grew up around many Christians and Muslims, and what I've learned is that even the most educated ones in these groups also come to the same consensus. So why is it that people continue to listen to books preaching rules with 0 historical evidence or basis? Well, I don't think I need to spell it out further.

In turn, this notion that we *have* to respect beliefs as if they aren't inherently politically charged, in my opinion, is ridiculous. But the idea that scientists have to uphold the sanctity of these institutions for the sake of inducing psychosis in *someone else's* mental health is even more ridiculous, because it blatantly ignores the many groups of people across history that have all come to the consensus that it's not real and what matters is what you take from it, not to obey it."

And the bad ruin it for everybody. For those that aren‚Äôt familiar, the type of people I‚Äôm describing, are a kind of entitled poor. They‚Äôre happy to reap the benefits of taxpayer funded programs but they feel no major incentive to better their situations by getting a certification, a license or a degree. To be sure, they don‚Äôt *want* to be poor but their method of trying to escape usually the passive ‚Äúscratch-off lottery ticket‚Äù method. 

Short attention spans, short tempers and quick to resort to violence when they feel their honor has been insulted. They‚Äôre not the types to cultivate learning in their homes they‚Äôre the types to hand their phones off to their kids to distract them on public transportation rather then give them a coloring book. They‚Äôre ignorant and they‚Äôre proud of it. 

That wouldn‚Äôt be an issue in itself except we force these peoples kids to go to school and the parents, in spite of all the above, expect their kids to be just awarded good grades. Not because of their merit but because their kids are a reflection of them and if their kids are getting in trouble, failing or absent they understand that as an insult on their personal honor inflicted by the school 

So you get situations where a teacher gets beaten up by an angry mom because her precious angel baby failed her lameass Spanish class and they‚Äôre not about to let this bitch get away with it. 

I mean, it‚Äôs the only thing that makes sense to me, because these schools get billions of dollars in federal and state funds and they still suck. Their grades are still terrible. And the kids don‚Äôt seem to be doing any better now than they were doing 30 years ago. Usually the most sensitive and empathetic teachers come from middle to upper class backgrounds. And those people are too soft for these environments and dealing with those parents makes both too stressful and threatening. 
And if the teacher is white that adds a whole other layer of complexity to it.

And if it's a rule that most people can't break, then simply having a strong spiritual opinion about it shouldn't mean the rule doesn't exist for you.

Examples: Either wearing a hat for a Driver's License is not okay, or it is. Either having a beard hinders your ability to do the job, or it doesn't. Either you can use a space for quiet reflection, or you can't. Either you can't wear a face covering, or you can. Either you can sign off on all wedding licenses, or you can't.

I can see the need for specific religious buildings where you must adhere to their standards privately or not be welcome. But like, for example, a restaurant has a dress code and if your religion says you can't dress like that, then your religion is telling you that you can't have that job. Don't get a job at a butcher if you can't touch meat, etc.


Changing my view: Any example of any reason that any rule should exist for everyone, except for those who have a religious objection to it. "

Are volunteer soldiers murderers?

From what I understand, soldiers, whether volunteers or conscripts, operate under the laws of armed conflict and follow the rules of engagement. Legally, they are not considered murderers as they are performing their duties within the bounds of what is acceptable in war. However, I know that this is a multifaceted issue with various legal, moral, and ethical dimensions.

Here are a few points that I find particularly challenging:

* The distinction between lawful combatants and unlawful acts.
* Ethical frameworks like Just War Theory versus pacifist views.
* The impact of the context (e.g., defensive vs. offensive wars) on how we perceive soldiers' actions.
* Individual conduct and accountability for war crimes.

I'm open to hearing all viewpoints, whether you agree or disagree with the notion that volunteer soldiers could be considered murderers. How do you interpret the legality and morality of their actions? Are there any specific philosophies, historical examples, or personal experiences that shape your perspective on this?

I appreciate any insights or resources you can share to help me see this issue from different angles. Thanks in advance for your thoughtful responses!"

NATO has long served its purpose, and has served no cause since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Currently, the main view amongst our politicians, both Democrat and Republican, neoliberals and neoconservatives is that we actually benefit from NATO somehow. I will go through the 5 main common arguments about how we supposedly benefit from NATO.

1. ‚ÄúWe hold soft power over our allies‚Äù No, we do not, and I hesitate to call Europe our allies.

A. Merkel withheld, and even ignored information about how Russia would [blackmail](https://kyivindependent.com/handelsblatt-merkel-russia-gas/#:~:text=Former%20German%20Chancellor%20Angela%20Merkel,classified%20documents%20it%20had%20obtained) Europe

B. Hungary basically [invites](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/03/09/chinese-police-patrol-alongside-hungarian-officers/) China into their country

C. Turkey considers our allies in Syria as terrorist, and harms their operations in the region

D. Operation Prosperity Guardian was basically useless in [organizing](https://thecradle.co/articles-id/16852) support, and our ‚Äúallies‚Äù could not even send a single fucking navy ship to deal with the Houthi‚Äôs

E. Germany still [joined](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/germanys-nord-stream-2-gatekeeper-long-road-until-gas-flows-2021-11-16/) Nordstream 2 even after Ukrainian protest, sure, they halted it, but the US warned them several times not to join, and that their dependency on Russian gas will effect them

F. Poland for some reason [blames](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/west-must-help-ukraine-more-prevent-spillover-polish-fm-says-2024-02-26/) us for the invasion of Ukraine, and if the Ukrainians fail?

G. European leadership were warned by several administrations, Bush, Obama, Trump, to build up their armies, and to lessen dependency on the US, and they ignored or even laughed at us, their failure's are there own faults, but demand we help them

H. European polls show they do not want to join us in a [war](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/06/07/europeans-want-to-remain-neutral-in-possible-us-china-conflict-survey-shows) with China, even though Taiwan will effect them just as much as it will effect us if it is invaded.¬†

The only European ally we seem to have is the UK, and even then, they [demand](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-to-u-s-were-your-top-military-ally-now-help-our-economy-527d1b05) us to help them with there economy because their own politicians are in a crisis and cannot run their own country.¬†

2. ‚ÄúRussia will invade the rest of Europe without the US ''¬†

Russia was surrounded by NATO countries, and still invaded Ukraine, and even then, I doubt Russia could get as far as Poland. NATO, even without the US, is still a very strong alliance that can handle Russia without us. France and Germany have their own regionally strong military industrial complexes, Finland and Sweden have large conscription armies, The M16 is still a very powerful intelligence agency, on par with the CIA, Europeans are not ‚Äúhelpless little countries '' without us.¬†

We have to worry about our own defense, not of other countries who can handle themselves, and not just ourselves, but China. Europe has shown they will not join us in any way with China, so, we are largely going to defend Taiwan alone, besides our allies in Japan and South Korea.¬†

3. ‚ÄúUkraine needs US arms‚Äù 

Sure, but the EU has largely taken [over](https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/united-states-america/eu-assistance-ukraine-us-dollars_en?s=253) defense for Ukraine, and Ukraine has done very well. I do not mind giving aid to Ukraine, but we need something directly up front, and not just cross our fingers that, a corrupt democracy, pay back any debts. But, overall, China is the bigger threat, we need to focus 100% of our attention on the Pacific, we do not have the ability to split it between Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. We have enough problems domestically, and our country cannot even provide better necessities. Europe has largely been able to provide social democratic policies for its citizens because we upfront the bill so much, how about we try to focus more on ourselves? The US can, and should, pull out of Europe, because it has largely been a pain in the ass for our foreign policy.

I believe maturity is forged in the fires of experience, not simply bestowed by the passage of time.  While a 40-year-old may have lived twice as long as a 20-year-old, that doesn't guarantee a double dose of maturity.

Here's why:

- Experience is the teacher:
Life throws challenges, successes, and failures our way. Navigating these situations shapes our decision-making, responsibility, and emotional control - all hallmarks of maturity. A 20-year-old who's overcome personal struggles or tackled significant responsibilities could possess a maturity that surpasses a sheltered 40-year-old. 

- Perspective from diverse experiences:
Sure, a 40-year-old has accumulated years, but were those years spent in a monotonous routine? A 20-year-old who's actively traveled the world, volunteered in underprivileged communities, or even held a demanding job might have a broader perspective than someone stuck in a predictable cycle.

- Maturity is a choice, not an inevitability:
Growing older doesn't magically make someone mature.  Some people resist learning from experiences and cling to childish behaviors.  Conversely, a young person can actively seek challenges and growth opportunities, accelerating their maturity.

With all of the reports that more right-wing ideologies are rising in Europe and the United States as well as extensive plans for severe immigration control and restrictions, it feels like the West is becoming heavily nationalistic. Globalism seems to declining and people are growing seemingly more violent. As an American, our nation has a lot of loud people who do not represent the minority, but at the same time, many people who lean left (or at least claim to) have become increasingly complacent. It could just be that same old loud minority, but it feels like something is historically changing, and we are beginning to see the pre-WWI nationalistic ideologies that inspired that conflict.

This is simply a discussion about entertainment and pornography.

Asian porn is, in my opinion, the *worst* category of porn among all ethnic groups (perhaps next to Indian, which is also Asian).

Asian pornstars and content creators often appear lackluster.

Asian male pornstars often seem awkward, with performances that resemble science experiments on the actress, using toys and fetishes that feel strange to watch. This isn't about the ""small penis"" trope, but solely about the performance.

As for the women, their biggest asset is their appearance, which seems to be all they have to offer.

* Most Asian actresses in the porn industry lack the intensity or dirtiness of White actresses, even down to dirty talk during sex.
* They don't match the performance and sultriness of Latina actresses.
* Many are slender, lacking the curves and ruggedness of Black women.

Additionally, most Asian women primarily work with White male actors. While this isn't inherently bad, it is limiting compared to the diverse pairings amongst White, Latin, and Black actors.

The only well-known Asian stars are Asa Akira or Sharon Lee and, more recently, Kazumi Squirts and Nicole Doshi. While there may be other notable actors, their numbers are small compared to other ethnic stars.

Even Asian content creators on platforms like OnlyFans often produce extremely boring content. Many people subscribe because of their appearance but end up dissatisfied.

Censored Asian content is already problematic, but ***boring*** censored content is even worse.

It's almost redundant."

Criminality: the left's solution to high crime rates is improving education and life conditions. That is effective, but it's too long-term and people need to be safe now. As some criminals can be quite cruel, people will support harsher policies, not unlike what Bukele did in El Salvador.  
Immigration: one of the main reason people, especially in Europe, oppose lax immigration is because some immigrants will keep some ""traditions"" that the host country finds barbaric, like honor killings, homophobia or forcing women to cover their whole bodies. Poland accepts very few immigrants and is safer than some Western European countries that receive a whole medium-sized city worth of immigrants per year, and some of those immigrants are lazy bums that refuse to integrate. The rich countries should help the poorer ones to catch up so citizens of the latter don't need to move to the former to have a good life or safety, but, like with criminality, the citizens of poor countries need safety and money now. Also, rich countries rely on some immigrants because the local people aren't reproducing enough for the economy's liking, so they're stuck with this dilemma.  
Transit: a reason why public transit is unpopular in some places is because of the presence of people taking drugs, the likelihood of being mugged and the presence of perverts. The mugging was kinda discussed in the ""criminality session"". Dealing with the junkies relies on another long-term policy of dealing with possible economic and psychological problems, but people need to be safe now. Getting rid of the perverts relies on an even longer-term work of educating the population, maybe even wait for human evolution, as every major human culture is full of entitled cumbrains who think all women are objects for their delight."

So it's easier to stop listening to rock than to go around canceling singer by singer. And they are dead.  They can no longer fix their mistakes or be punished.

0,2024-06-10,"CMV: racial epithets such as ""the inward"" should not be used by anyone",u/Isleland0100,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dcjkxe/cmv_racial_epithets_such_as_the_inward_should_not/,changemyview,"To preface: this is not intended as a post to grandstand about egalitarianism, dictate to anyone how they should use language, or shame people of color- especially black folk- about their reclamation and use of former racial slurs. I do sincerely hold the belief that it's best for these words not to be employed as I'll lay out shortly. But it's not my intention to mandate and police language of that type (never do irl), merely to express my view so that I have the logic validated or update my perspective when challenged

The title is the gist of it. I believe that historically derogatory epithets of all types- racial, sexual, gendered, etc- are unable to be reclaimed and used without problematicity that could be avoided by avoiding the epithets altogether. There are too many to list but ""faggot"", ""spic"", and ""the inward"" [aka the n-word, aka \*\*\*\*(\*/\*\*)] are all instances and ""the inward"" will be the prototypical example used, as it's widely known and an archetype in itself

Why do I believe this? Firstly, while the majority of a community may accept epithet reclaim as America has seen with ""the inward"", there will always be a minority of people who absolutely do not want to be referred to with those epithets. Some may dislike it because they feel otherized, others may have wildly negative personal experiences that make the word recall trauma, and others simply want to label themselves in different ways and not be placed into any one box. I'm not saying that massive numbers of American black folk, for instance, are ""the silent majority"" or whatnot. Just that there is certainly a subset of people who hate the trend, even if there numbers are small

Secondly, epithets, even when reclaimed, reinforce archaic notions of artificial group identity and obselete ethnoracial classifications. ""the n-word"" is applicable, in narrow sense, to racially black individuals, a totally invented and near meaningless categorization outside of the history of the western hemisphere. These classifications are widely and rightfully despised for the damage they've wrought and we seem to eliminate them in most areas of society (by grouping humans by characteristics that matter, not naive colorblind policy). Even if we try to be less arbitrary and define the class as specific skin tone of a certain pigmentation, hue, and absorbance, black Dominicans in the US exist yet they commonly don't identify as black and some black individuals may take issue with their use of the word. Which brings me to...

Thirdly, the main reason I believe it's best to abandon these terms, is because it absolutely requires society to collectively decide who is permitted to use their terms which requires gatekeeping people of mixed, partial, and spectrumized identities. For instance, if someone has one ""fully black"" African grandparent and three white ones, they would be considered black historically. Does their one black grandparent make the use of ""the n-word"" not problematic? Would it still if they were entirely white-passing and have never been treated as anything other than white? Would it still be if they were a quarter ""black""? Eight, sixteenth, hundred-twenty-eight? What if the 1/128th one was serendipitously very dark skinned and adopted by a black family while someone with one black and one white parent was nearly albino in paleness and adopted by a white family?

Continuing the third point, you could stop defining by appearance and adopt the mindset of some people that ""you can use the word if you've been victimized by it"". This does a better job, seemingly, but black individuals also commonly call out other groups such as Latin or Indian individuals when they use the word, despite there being dark skinned yet ""non-black"" (depending on who you ask) individuals who may be called that word by racists who care little for accuracy

Hence my thesis statement: using reclaimed racial epithets necessitates widespread gatekeeping and exclusion of others, often based on assumption and conjecture, and disaffects individuals that very group because they weren't [group] enough, a true [group], or not [group] presenting

Two last minor points: 

Fourthly, people can lie about all kinds of stuff super easily and, as ""the n-word"" has shown us, people will absolutely try their damnedest to be able to call others those slurs. I know gay people who say ""faggot"" and unlike racial epithets, anyone can claim their sexuality is anything and it's hard to deny them. Does that mean we let ""faggot"" slide now? Do we have to ascertain everyone's sexuality when we hear the word? If someone might be trolling and lying about their gayness, do we decide they're lying or give them the benefit of the doubt so that someone isnt mistakenly invalided for essentially ""being gay wrong""?

Fifth, all of these epithets are a legacy of past times. ""The n-word"" was born out of one of the most disgusting chapters of human history thus far and keeping it around today serves to reinforce the collective societal conception of the world. If your world has racial slurs for Koreans, Japanese, and Chinese, you'll differentiate. If It doesn't, you'll use the lovely ""c-word"" epithet lobbed at Asians. In contrast, ""spic"" Is a distinctly different epithet for a different group than the ""n-word"" in America, whereas in Turkey, a moderately dark brown-skinned Mexican national would probably be hit with ""zenci"", a slur primarily African blacks, but that also is used for any black or dark skinned person, even if more brown than black

Sixth and finally, every epithet you use sets the standard for the rest of the world who doesnt speak English or intimately understand our history and customs. People in other countries see black Americans using ""the n-word"", they see the fashionability of black America in modern times, and they imitate the behavior. There might be more foreign nationals who say ""the n-word"" than do black Americans, dead serious. Even without internet evidence, travelling abroad made this point crazily clear. Most of these people do not understand the problematic nature of the word and will it toward, and sometimes exclusively toward, black folks (on one occasion, a non-native English speaker was using the word often and continued to do so even after repeated serious and earnest attempts to explain why they shouldnt be frivolously tossing it around. they seemed to think I was overreacting, making it up, or that it didn't matter because we weren't in the US)

If you read even half of this, I sincerely thank you. It took a while to type this out.
.
.
.
.
tl;dr: using reclaimed epithets, especially racial epithets such as ""the inward"", causes rampant purity testing gatekeeping, otherization, and perpetuates the same toxic mentalities that originated the now reclaimed epithets to begin with 

[Please understand that I made this post not to imperially subject others to my belief or chastise members of any community for reclaiming offensive terminology, but to offer a perspective I haven't seen in discussions previously as well as learn why this perspective is wrong and why a majority of people would likely disagree]

There are two problems with this. 1: The term ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù is so poorly defined it doesn‚Äôt ban weapons with virtually identical capabilities to AR-15s and Kalashnikovs, so it‚Äôs trivially easy to circumvent. 2: It is a proven fact that rifles are used in only a tiny portion of violent crime, as a matter of fact bare hands are a more common murder weapon than rifles, as are clubs or knives.

https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls

So this proposal does not make logical sense. So-called ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù are not uniquely dangerous, they are not used in a large amount of crime, and the entire category is cosmetically defined.

I anticipate the primary argument in favor of an ‚Äúassault weapons ban‚Äù to be to prevent mass shooting.

132,2024-06-10,"CMV: The Romney ""martyrdom"" theory simply exists for anti-Trump Republicans to absolve themselves of guilt for inadequately preventing Trump's rise",u/BloonsFan-1306,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dclezg/cmv_the_romney_martyrdom_theory_simply_exists_for/,changemyview,"Over the past few years, I've seen one theory come up from time to time, one that while at first glance seems like it may have merit, in reality is nothing but a stupid and pointless argument meant to absolve blame. And one that's very easy to poke holes into at that.

  
#1. Mitt Romney himself is one of the most vocal anti-Trump voices still standing in the GOP.

  
#2. Long before 2012, Republicans had used downright scathing attacks on Democratic candidates based on lies. (Palin literally accused Obama in no uncertain terms of being a terrorist sympathizer for gosh sakes) Democrats did not respond in kind by nominating a literal socialist specifically nominated to make life a nightmare for Republicans.

  
#3. Obama mainly attacked Romney based on facts and things Romney himself has admitted to being true. Romney DID strap his dog to that car it's well documented. Romney DID say Let Detroit go bankrupt. Biden did say Romney would put blacks back in chains, but everyone with common sense knew that was a metaphor and it still didn't really compare to Republican attacks on Obama.

  
#4. Romney was not this ""saintly moderate candidate who will do everything right for everyone if you just hand him the keys to the White House"". He ran as a hardcore conservative especially on issues like Social Security, and not only that, he not only accepted but EMBRACED the endorsement of one of the leading voices of the birtherism movement, Donald Trump.

  
#5. Conservative challengers also made some pretty damning claims about Romney.

  
In general: This whole argument stems from ""Democrats being mean to Romney"" without them specifying how we could've been nicer. Given that the attacks in 2012 were generally a lot more fair than past campaigns, I could only conclude that the anti-Trump Republicans blame the rise of Trump for Obama not literally going up to Romney and personally handing him the keys to the White House. Uh, surely you knew that's not how campaigns have EVER worked right? I am open to being wrong though, maybe there is something I'm missing. This is Change My View after all, and if you got something you feel like it might change my mind on, Comment your rebuttals."

30,2024-06-10,CMV: The rich are already going John Galt to a very worrisome degree,u/AstridPeth_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dcmdgh/cmv_the_rich_are_already_going_john_galt_to_a/,changemyview,"From Gemini:

>To ""go John Galt"" refers to the act of withdrawing one's talent, skills, and productive efforts from a society that is perceived as exploitative, oppressive, or unjust. It is inspired by the character of John Galt in Ayn Rand's novel ""Atlas Shrugged,"" who leads a strike of the world's top innovators and producers.

>In the context of the novel, ""going John Galt"" signifies a rejection of collectivist ideologies and a reclamation of individual autonomy. It symbolizes a refusal to be exploited by a system that punishes success and rewards mediocrity. It also represents a form of protest against policies or societal norms that hinder individual initiative and creativity.

>More broadly, the phrase ""go John Galt"" has been adopted by individuals and groups who feel disillusioned with societal trends or political policies they perceive as stifling individual freedom, economic opportunity, or personal achievement. It can be interpreted as a call for self-reliance, a celebration of individual achievement, and a rejection of systems that discourage or devalue personal initiative and ambition.

I recently saw [this chart](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbcd931d-bea7-4b95-86a4-1aafcc9389ef_680x594.jpeg?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) of population projections in California, where 2060 forecasts are now 13M people less than 2060 forecasts in 2013. 

In the information age, where the most valuable companies hold little to no physical assets (of the [three largest companies in the world](https://companiesmarketcap.com/), two, Apple and Nvidia, basically do not make any capital expenditures). Others, like Microsoft, Google, Meta, Eli Lilly, Broadcom, and JPMorgan Chase are relatively fixed capital light for their size. 

This means that it's much easier to move companies today, because it's just laptops connected to the cloud. Henry Ford couldn't walk away from Detroit so easily. These companies can:

* [CNET - Oracle to move HQ from Silicon Valley to Texas](https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/oracle-to-move-hq-out-of-silicon-valley-to-texas-citing-worker-flexibility/)
* [Reuters - Hedge fund Citadel to move headquarters to Miami from Chicago](https://www.reuters.com/business/hedge-fund-citadel-move-headquarters-miami-chicago-2022-06-23/)
* [BBC - Tesla: Elon Musk says company headquarters will move to Texas](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58838874)

But it's more complex than that. 

Due to the normalization of Work from Home, many of the high-earning people can just walk away from places with high levels of collectivism, mostly high-taxes, but not just that. Internal immigration figures in the US show that, but also the high level of digital nomads immigration to Canada (mostly from people in the 3rd world).

I don't want to make the impression that it's just a US phenomenon. Although I couldn't find data, I'm Brazilian and basically every reasonably good software programmer I know get a job at an international corporation in 5 years of career. And then, many of them, just leave Brazil. Brazil has a 36% tax revenue as percentage of GDP, comparable to the US 37%, but at one fifth of the GDP per capita. It's basically impossible for Brazil to develop at this rate, if STEM labor is this mobile.

In South Africa, as the African National Congress destroys the country in a 15-year stagnation, [20% of the country's millionaires already left the country](https://fortune.com/2024/06/07/africa-loses-millionaires-currency-depreciation-ultra-rich-south-africa/). Other people, when they decide to stay, basically they try to insulate themselves the most from the state: South Africa has the highest levels of deployment of domestic solar.

And as most of the high-achievers of society enjoy the high-mobility of the information era, public policy needs to adapt. Particularly because the rich has a high-correlation to the most capable and skilled in our society. We need to rewrite the social contracts and expectations. I am sure the rich has fraternity, but they aren't accepting being exploited to the level they currently are. And they are going John Galt."

>**Hire a sensitivity reader:**¬†Get professional feedback from people who belong to the communities you‚Äôre writing about.

Basically a bullying victim can get the permission of someone trusted like a counsellor or a teacher, a family member or a cop to take revenge on the person/s involved without punishment ranging from assault to even murder, helping cut down on bullying as potential bullies have to think twice about bullying their potential victims least they get beaten up by their victims or worse killef.

  
Now about the whole 'escalating into bloody family feuds' that could happen? Have the 'revenge permission' be limited to the person/persons involved in the bullying themselves and the family members are not to be harmed.

They destroy virtually everything in their path, and this harms not only the native plants, but also the native animals that eat them. However, a much more overlooked invasive species are feral cats. There are a lot more cats than hogs in the US, and they are arguably just as destructive to the environment. Their populations are also out of control. Cats kill 650 million reptiles, 2.4 billion birds, and 20 billion rodents every year in the US alone. Even if every cat owner decides to keep their cats inside (which they should anyway), only 11% of cat-related native specie deaths are attributed to pets. The other 89% are feral.

In the US, it is legal to kill feral hogs. Circumstances vary by state, such as time of year and if you need a hunting license, but in general it is encouraged to kill hogs. This isn‚Äôt the case with feral cats. Many states do not specifically mention feral cats in their laws, but some states protect them. However, it is generally considered to be frowned upon just because they are cats. If they weren‚Äôt also kept as pets, I think it would be much more acceptable to hunt them. If the general public was persuaded into being able to hunt feral cats, I think we would start to see their populations decline, which is good for native wildlife. I also believe this will encourage pet cat owners to keep theirs inside for safety reasons. Native wildlife will thrive much more without an unnecessary predator!!"

For this CMV, I just want to focus on John Galt the character.

I agree Objectivism as a philosophy has flaws.  I also concede that some people take Galt's philosophy too far.

But, for this CMV, I want to focus on the character himself and his actions in the story.

For a high-level summary, John Galt was an inventor who got annoyed by his former employer stealing his inventions without proper compensation and decided to leave and start his own country in peace.

The company predictably failed without him.

And other innovators started joining John Galt's new community, leaving their companies to fail without them in similar ways.

I fail to see anything immoral about this.

John Galt felt unappreciated by his employer, so he left.

He started his own independent country where he could make and use his own inventions in peace.

Other people with similar ideas joined him willingly in this new country.

He later gave a long-winded radio broadcast about his thoughts on life.

I think it's a little unfair to use those suits as examples as they go for a purely retro look that is intentionally campy while mostly only using spandex material, which doesn't necessarily represent how they are portrayed in modern comics. For example, Captain America doesn't have the feathered chest armor he usually has with the classic Christ Evans suit. 

With that, I think there would definitely be creative room to use different kinds of materials with the suit to modernize them without sacrificing comic book accurateness. 

This Superman cosplay being a perfect example:

[Hyrbrid Superman Cosplay- Breakdown and Reveal! (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tb2YDhX1mI)

Other examples of comic-accurate suits in practice being the Moon Knight series, Sam Wilson's Captain America, Aquaman 2, Shazam, Ben Affleck's Batman (accurate to Frank Miller), and of course the ending suit in Spider-Man No Way Home. 

There was a big disservice done to character like early Scarlet Witch, Tom Holland's Spider-Man, Cyborg, Joker, Shang-Chi, Captain America, Ant-Man, Star-Lord, and so many other characters in the universe by using all these muted colors and over-designing to try and modernize them.

I don't want to change for women and improve myself. I feel so bitter and upset that I have to ""self improve"" to have a chance with hot women.

I have seen some super hot girls that make me get butterflies in my stomach and make my heart beat so fast. I really wanna be with these girls more than anything.

but why should I self improve when so many other guys out there seem to have no issues with women? I have heard of and even seen losers and abusive assholes still have attractive women. why cant that shit happen to me?

it makes me feel so bad. why dont those assholes have to self improve?

I have seen hot female correctional officers fuck male inmates.

and hell, I always see cases of hot female teachers having sex with male students. I know that last part will be controversial on reddit. but these boys dont have any money, any life experience, anything to offer, yet these hot women are throwing themselves at these boys.

I had some hot teachers at my school, and i know its wrong in the eyes of the law but ifcf. I would have loved it if one of those beautiful women invited me to their apartment and had sex with me daily (which has happened to these boys).

why do I have to self improve? why cant I have a beautiful woman want to have sex with me? why does it seem to happen to so many other guys but not me?

I am taking steps to change myself, not for women, but for myself. I used to be someone who spends a lot of time playing video games and watching anime. I am building a better social life and making friends. I started cosplaying and going to conventions and socializing more. I am also trying to lose weight.

but it just angers me so much that I had to put it in so much work just to have the same results as other guys. part of me even wants to break the hearts of women who find me attractive when I finally change myself and just be an asshole to them. if they didnt like me before, why now?

and btw, no i do not ""feel entitled"" to anything, nor do i view women as just ""sex objects"" its not even just about sex but feel desired and loved. why do you think im not going for escorts if it was just about sex?"

I hear a lot of calls for those who support Israel's attacks on Gaza that ""Hamas must be destroyed"", but I cannot understand how the current approach to ""destroying Hamas"" is going to work without backfiring. Hamas appears very much¬†[not destroyed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/03/hamas-still-strong-in-areas-cleared-by-israel-in-northern-gaza-say-experts)¬†in areas of Gaza that have been practically razed to the ground, but even suppose that the IDF can destroy Hamas. 40K people have been killed, and unless Hamas was a huge organization made mainly of women and children, most of those killed were not members of Hamas. Killing innocent people must create resentment, it must lead some people to hate, and it must fuel anger against Israel in survivors. This will increase new recruits for Hamas, or whichever organization next taps into this hatred. How can Israel be secure if more of the next generation of Palestinians grow up hating Israel? I can only think of two answers: one is that some people would like to ensure no Palestinians are left after the attacks, or they will be too busy dealing with famine/disease/finding a place to live to attack Israel. This is the genocidal argument and I don't (currently) believe all supporters of Israel's actions are justifying genocide to themselves. The second is that maybe people believe there has already been too much damage done, that there is already a ""critical mass"" of Palestinians who hate Israel, and increasing this number won't effectively change anything.

But this second group of people should still care about public opinion around the world around Israel. Public opinion was very much supportive of Israel after Oct. 7th, but the longer the war goes on, the more that is shifting. Strikes on clearly marked aid trucks, strikes on hospitals and safe zones, obstruction of aid, mass graves, the genocidal language of Israeli politicians, political interference by pro-Israeli lobbyists around the world, the rulings of the ICC and ICJ. None of these have toppled Israel so far, but if I cared about the future of Israel, I would be very afraid, and I certainly wouldn't want this war to continue in which Israel has been making blunder after blunder in exchange for what...? What has Israel gained meaningfully from all this?

I truly can't understand those who purport to support Israel yet call for this to continue. The only conclusion that I can draw is they are driven by an irrational desire for revenge without consideration for the long-term security of Israel, but I welcome you to CMV."

Donald J. Trump*, it is my view that the trial was conducted unfairly and the conviction should be overturned.

First, he law that Trump was convicted of, NY Penal Code 175.10 ""Falsifying business records in the first degree"", reads that ""A person is guilty of falsifying business records in the first degree when he commits the crime of falsifying business records in the second degree, and when his intent to defraud includes an intent to commit another crime or to aid or conceal the commission thereof."" - in the case of Trump, the persecution argues that he was falsifying business records to commit either tax fraud, federal election fraud (FECA) due to Cohen's contribution/hush money went over campaign donation limit, or other crimes.

Reasons for my view:

1. **No misdemeanor should be upgraded to felony predicated on another misdemeanor** - all three underlying crimes are misdemeanor, I fail to find any laws in country that would upgrade a misdemeanor to a felony due to another misdemeanor. I am sure people will point out to conspiracy to murder (A and B planned to murder C, but you don't have to prove that specifically A or B was going to pull the trigger); however, those are all felonies to start with, not misdemeanors upgrading to felonies.
2. **The State of New York cannot persecute Federal crimes** - The Issue is that the word ""crime"" in this law refers to state crimes, not federal crime, otherwise it is unconstitutionally overbroad. Out of the three possible underlying ""intended crimes""; tax fraud and federal election campaign fraud are federal crimes and should not be persecuted by NY state.
3. **""Other crimes"" is far too ambiguous** - Again, I have never seen a persecution where they only need to prove that I intend to commit a crime in general, without proving which specific crime(s) I intend to commit.
4. **Jury instruction did not require unanimity in which underlying crime(s) was/were committed/intended to commit to convict -** this goes against *Schad v. Arizona*, where the US Supreme Court ruled that jurors must agree as to which crime was committed. I am sure people will again point out murder conspiracy, and again, those are felonies built upon felonies, different from this case.

Therefore, it is my view that Trump's conviction should be overturned in the next appeal; please change my view by citing legal precedents or rulings."

I was talking to a colleague after hours about politics and she was going in on the Republicans for abortion issues. It struck me that, yeah, they have been campaigning on this for my entire life. Why did the Democrats not codify it into law? Why didn't RBG step down after Trump won allowing the Dem controlled Senate and Obama to ram through a younger, more progressive judge? Why did the Dems leave it up to nine old people in Washington to maintain the ruling of nine old judges in Washington? A Republican is gonna Republican! 

This goes both ways, obviously, and my main point here is how are the American people blaming politicians WE keep electing to office over and over again, voting for the same two parties over and over again blaming the politicians  for doing what they are doing? They are not being held accountable in the least. 

OK, let's *assume* there are two restaurants in town which receive 90% of the business. These restaurants continue to serve horrible food which actually poisons some people and it's not the food most people want. Everyone blames the restaurant and yet continues to frequent the joint. When the consumers get really loud, a restaurant will fire the chef or the ma√Ætre d' and hire someone new to mollify the patrons, but, otherwise, change absolutely nothing! You would look at the people of this town when they complained about the food scene and say, ""Why don't you eat at another restaurant? Or, abstain form both for two years and support someone else starting their own? Why is it the restaurant at this point? You KNOW it is shit! Yet, you still spend your money there and complain! It's the colloquial definition of insanity at this point!!""

One of the key benefits is its comprehensive all-in-one approach, which contrasts sharply with Adobe's model requiring multiple programs for different tasks, each with a separate subscription fee.

First, Clip Studio Paint provides robust customization options, including the ability to create and use an unlimited number of custom brushes. This feature is particularly valuable for artists looking to personalize their workflow and achieve unique textures and effects. Additionally, the integration of 3D models directly within the program streamlines the creative process, eliminating the need to switch between different software for modeling and painting.

Moreover, Clip Studio Paint has made a name for itself by respecting the rights of its users. Unlike some concerns surrounding Adobe, where fears about artwork being used without permission have surfaced, Clip Studio Paint ensures that artists retain full control over their creations. This assurance of intellectual property protection is a significant consideration for many professionals.

Financially, Clip Studio Paint is more accessible. The older version, Clip Studio Paint Debut, is still available for purchase at an affordable price, providing a budget-friendly option without compromising on quality. In contrast, Adobe's subscription model can become quite costly over time, especially when multiple programs are required.

In summary, Clip Studio Paint offers a more unified, customizable, and cost-effective solution for digital artists, making it a preferred choice over Adobe's fragmented and pricier ecosystem."

0,2024-06-11,"CMV: The prosperity of the Jewish people despite horrendous historical and modern oppression shows that ""historical oppression"" is not a valid explanation for modern disparities in other communities.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dd59wb/cmv_the_prosperity_of_the_jewish_people_despite/,changemyview,"A common explanation for why some groups in modern American society (and other countries too, I'm sure) are suffering disparities and other problems is that the echoes of oppression in the distant past continue to perpetuate indefinitely into the future.

However, there are two groups in particular which I think cast some serious doubt on this idea: first and foremost, the Jewish people. And to a lesser extent, Japanese-Americans, who suffered horrendous discrimination and were put into internment camps during WWII. Both of these groups are doing extremely well in modern society, but since the oppression of Japanese-Americans is arguably less severe than those of American Black folks, I only use them as a supplementary example, not the primary example.

Of course we're all well-aware of the historical and modern oppression, discrimination, and prejudice that Jewish people suffer from. However, despite this acute and continuous barrage of hate and discrimination, they continue to do very well in society, to the point where there are actually conspiracy theories about how they secretly control the world. They also have high IQ's relative to other groups - despite being only 0.2% of the world population, they're responsible for [20% of nobel-laureates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_Nobel_laureates).

On the other hand, the Black community in America has major disparities and is responsible for a vastly disproportionate amount of crimes: as you may have heard, the old 13/50 meme: despite being 13% of the population, they're responsible for 50% of violent crime. It's basically the inverse of Jewish prosperity.

One might be tempted to compare the ""severity"" of slavery of black folks vs. Jewish oppression, but I think that is misguided. The holocaust is rightly remembered at the worst travesty in human history, with over 6 million dead and a continued negative perception and antisemitism ever since, even into the modern day.

So I think historical oppression is not a valid explanation for why the Black community continues to suffer like this. I think the real cause is a self-inflicted wound in the Black community which could be called, for lack of a better term, ""gang culture"". What I think happened is that the historical conditions that gave rise to what might be called ""gang culture"" have long since gone, but the Black community has unfortunately collectively decided to make this culture a part of their racial and ethnic identity. It's like the psychological concept of [""Learned Helplessness""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_helplessness). I think that, even though the conditions that might have forced the culture in these communities being gone, they decided to adopt them permanently in a misguided attempt at forming a racial identity. There is also a sort of satisfaction that comes from making victimhood a part of one's collective identity group, as though they're fighting a righteous battle against oppression. But unfortunately, as we see, I believe that making this a central part of your identity only creates a self-fulfilling prophecy where conditions must be kept poor in order to justify the oppression narrative. The Jewish people do not have this desire, and so they prosper. It is their **culture** to strive and succeed despite oppression, whereas with the Black community, their culture is such that they must be kept down in order to justify their oppression narrative. But in reality, this is self-inflicted.

So I think that's what's going on, but I imagine many people on Reddit will disagree. What am I missing? Change my view."

I don't know if this the best subreddit for this idea but I am just looking to bounce off some ideas. I see a lot of discussion about how, for example, the British museum should return its stolen statues to greece or the British crown should return its stolen jewel (koh-i-noor) to India so I wanted to discuss this. Most importantly how should rightful ownership be defined.  

1. Original ownership

This one is the most straightforward, if you produced it first you are the rightful owner of this artifact and, assuming it was taken from you in illegitimate matters (however that's defined), you should return it. 

However, when the history of trade and manufacturing is so vague with 90% of products this criterion falls apart quite quickly. The British so easily justify the koh-i-noor being handed over to them just because it was done legally (through a treaty after consequence and not just taking it straight up). Plus, ownership can't be traced back like a straight line, do we give things back to a specific family, institution, temple, church or government? If we go all the way up to governments, then that leads me to my second point.

The Mona Lisa was originally from Italy but is justified in being in France for totally legitimate reasons, so we can't really just base it off original ownership as well.

2. Borders, countries and governments change over time.

How can we even define what is 'stolen' if the nations itself change over time? I would hardly call ancient Egypt the same entity as modern-day Egypt. In what way does one have right to ownership to something if they didn't even know it existed for 3000 years and any sort of institutions that were related to that specific item is gone. The ottoman empire owned Greece and gave away the pieces of the Parthenon to Britain. Britain obtained it entirely legally and legitimately, in what way is it immoral for Britain to keep it just because suddenly the nation's borders changed and now the new nation wants it back.

Looking at a lot of artifacts, I felt that pattern emerge quite a bit, where the British obtain it fairly legitimately but then there's a later backtrack due to changing control. Should the British give back these or no?

3. Preservation

I think its well known fact that if it weren't for western archeologists, a lot of what has been dug up would have been lost. Egyptians literally [started eating mummies for medicine](https://www.unisq.edu.au/news/2022/06/the-conversation-eating-mummies#:~:text=Mummy%20mania&text=Mummies%20were%20a%20prescribed%20medicine,Not%20everyone%20was%20convinced). If these museums have spent so much time and money and effort preserving it, where otherwise it wouldn't have been gone, maybe the British are then justified in saying that they 'own' it now. This links with my previous point. In what way did Egyptians truly own something if they never held on to it for a few thousand years. 

I admit in this point there is a bias. My bias is that I want these mummies to be preserved as valuable history and I don't want them to be eaten (because who cares what the Egyptians do with the mummies its their mummies). But I don't think that bias is too extreme I'm sure most Egyptians would agree with that sentiment nowadays. I think its ok to intervene in another civilisation if one can deem that the acts they do are detestable (e.g Nazi Germany at the most extreme example). Could we not say the same for the preservation of valuable history?

The British shaved the Koh-i-noor, it is a distinctly different product then when the British took it originally. Does that mean anything when trying to establish true ownership?

4. Geography??

Once again, if nations change borders all the time who should we even return it to. Does the Koh-I-noor go to India or Pakistan?? Both have a legitimate claim because the nation the British took it from crossed both borders. Most artifacts transcend borders as well. 

5. Time

Ownership can also be defined by time, maybe because the egyptians held it in their land for 3000 years it makes it theirs.  There are definitely products that were made then immediately stolen to another locations or entity, that doesn't suddenly give the other person the rightful ownership.

I could really keep going. I feel like all these points lead it to it being such a mess when trying to establish ownership. Overall, I believe that the majority of artifacts that are in western hands nowadays, there is some element of these that make it fairly ambivelous as to who should own it. Answering questions like these make the difference between the British returning 1% and 50% of the artifacts taken. So what do you all think.

Arguably the defining trait of the Nazis was their militarism and expansionism, their regime was centered around warmongering and ultimately that is what caused most of the death and destruction in Europe during the Second World War. The modern European right on the other hand, is generally isolationist. With regards to foreign policy, their overwhelming focus is on restricting immigration, not aggression against other countries. Whether you agree with that or not, it's dishonest to liken this stance to Nazi ideology. Nativism and nationalism  are ubiquitous attitudes that spans across all colors and nations of the world, from Indians to Japanese to black Africans and evidently white Europeans as well. "

Just look at the Hearing Protection Act in the US senate, which deregulated suppressors off of the NFA list. It was introduced a year ago and still hasn‚Äôt made it out of committee and I doubt that will make it out of committee even if Republicans take back the Senate in 2024.

You could make the argument that deregulating SBR‚Äôs and SBS‚Äôs would be good for disabled persons, especially for people with only one usable arm, but the main issue of concern regarding conceal ability still pops up  even though most mass shooters make no attempt to conceal their firearm upon entering whatever building they intend on shooting up. 

I guess you could chalk this whole thing to being either complete disinterest in this issue by the general public, uninformed fear about these types of firearms and firearm accessories and a small number of individuals wanting this kind of deregulation to come to pass."

That as well as taking care of his mind. Thankfully, due to AI surge, that kind of knowledge is way more accessible than before and we are getting to this goal closer. 

I also always thought that the same way everyone should have the ability to die. The government could create reliable process with steps which needs to be taken so that one could get assisted  suicide. That kind of person could decide what to do with its body before - whether give it for the hospital, give away usable organs, or just cremate everything etc. Thanks to that some people, friends or family wouldn't have traumatic experiences when finding the body and also we would have way more donated organs for the people who would actually want to live.  Disadvantages are the fact that many people choosing that method would leave their friends and family in mourning. In terms of  mortality rate its hard to predict whether there would be more or less death from that form of suicide, since there would be reliable way to check whether if person is eligible or not for that.

Example: Lets say someone has suicidal thoughts, he would need to go through a series of questions, run some tests to see if its not curable medical disease, do something for ''n'' days to see if after that period he wont feel any better, join support groups, etc.  After all the boxes would be ticked and his final will written he would get assisted suicide. People with will to live but needed organ transplant wouldn't need to wait that long for it since availability of those would probably skyrocket.

Now you ask yourself, on what end you will find me ? Well I don't have any medical conditions which require me  to replace organs, I work out, study and travel from time to time. And yet since I was 13(now 28) I always think that I should die. I've been checked for clinical depression, but I am healthy in that matter also had some therapy sessions but that didn't helped. After many years I truly don't care about my family, I don't feel anything when I think about people who know me what they will feel about my death. I truly don't. Now I know, many of you had harder, some of you probably were drug addicts for 60 years and after that time you managed to enjoy your life, but, again,  the point is, I don't really care about all that. It doesn't matter to me. That's your story. One thing that always boggles me is the fact that my whole body will go to waste.

Even their movements will be tracked and monitored 24/7 with cameras to their residences and trackers surgically implanted in their bodies, allowing our citizens to know what they are doing so that our citizens can make informed choices. If it means that our citizens have to sift out the more intimate moments for our officials so that they can know what they are doing, so be it.

Well? If it causes issues for diplomacy? Well, everything being open and nothing being classified means nothing left to leverage as blackmail for foreign powers

What if people don't want to stand for office because of this? Impressment (forced into office) at random and those impressed have to stand for a election at the end of their term as an assessment of their policies at the hands of the citizens, otherwise they'll be forced out of office.

I have difficulty feeling empathy when they're doing something that I feel is morally bad. It's unjust for those who respect the rules and I feel like anything that comes after is deserved.

When a bus driver argues with someone for not paying a ride, isn't it fair that they feel humiliated and get a fine? There must be a consequence or else why shouldn't I do the same?

I live in a poor neighborhood where theft is common. I've had my phone stolen when I was younger and I've always felt like the kids who do this kind of thing have an inflated ego and pride over their actions even when they're doing it towards corporations . It creates a normalized culture of theft and distrust.

I may be exagerrating archetypes because of my own personal experiences and I do feel bad on the moment when the person is caught and humiliated, but I have difficulty not reacting in a way that gives right to government laws and my own principles instead of empathy for a human.

I want to have this view changed as I feel like it's disrespectful to the person's own personal experiences that could've led to that. Perhaps it's not actually morally bad and I'm being self-righteous to exploitive corporations instead of believing in individuals because of my own difficulty for introspection.

We have been together for 4 years. The beginning of the conversation started when I realized he left his work shades at home. I asked if he needed me to bring them, and then he also asked that I bring him lunch too. When I sounded like I didn't wanna do it (I didnt! I have an 8 month old and don't wanna do a whole routine to get him packed up just to bring him lunch 5 minutes away, also started my cycle) he got upset and complained about everything ""I don't do"" meanwhile I've been upset because I carry my load of work and his too.
Linked above is my original post from a couple days ago regarding our financial incompatibility. He wants me to be a SAHM and I have been for the past 4 months, but for a while now he has always looked to me to either have the entire rent to pay up front or at least half of it he doesn‚Äôt have. So I pull from my savings to make sure our home is protected, and it‚Äôs starting to get on my nerves which I think is a valid feeling. I do everything else I‚Äôm supposed to do but I‚Äôm also carrying his load. He feels like this is what a partner ‚Äúshould‚Äù do, which yes, but not every single month when you know what day the rent is due‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs his only expense. There also was a situation where he is supposed to be buying my old car from me, and his mom is helping him pay for it. She sent me money twice and I didn‚Äôt know what it was for, he just told me to send it to him. I found out a few days ago that it was for the car but he‚Äôs just been keeping the money for himself and not paying anything to me for the car. The part that pisses me off is that he spent money to get a tint job done on the car a few days ago without asking me or mentioning it to me, but he hasn‚Äôt offered to give me any money towards the rent I paid. Anyway, today we argued about it and I wanted to kn ow if I was too harsh on him. I feel better though, even though he's not speaking to me. I couldn't care less because what was said, needed to be said. It almost seems as if he's trying to bring up unrelated stuff to gaslight me and make me feel bad for him, but l'm not sure. I‚Äôm trying to decide if I‚Äôm being too harsh on him, and if I was too harsh how else was I supposed to have gone about bringing this up to him? I don‚Äôt think he realizes how much I actually do for him and this family, because he‚Äôs acting like it‚Äôs just a small ask. I‚Äôm not sure what to do anymore. I can‚Äôt decide if I‚Äôm being selfish or if I‚Äôm right in thinking that I have every reason to be irritated and stressed out. He hasn‚Äôt spoken a word to me since yesterday still. Oh well. If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong but I do feel a little bad for some of my word choice but then again, I really don‚Äôt because I‚Äôve been holding my tongue on this for so long. He wants the title of being a provider but clearly can‚Äôt do it, and when I pick up his slack he makes it seem like it‚Äôs nothing. Meanwhile I have to make sure I stay on top of every little thing as a SAHM. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong. Can anyone CMV?"

This can be big:

""I don't like this plan of action because it might help someone I feel undeserving even if it helps a magnitude of people.""

For example the way we deal with homelessness is actually more expensive then providing homeless people homes but we don't because we perceive some of these homeless people as undeserving. There are alternatives to police car chases which have the high risk of getting civilians hurt but we don't turn to those alternatives because we don't want to give someone we preserve as a bad person the satisfaction of getting away.

They will say things like how this is illegal under international law, contrary to our ethics or standards as a country, etc. 

The contrary to our standards or ethics is a subjective claim and my response to that is... well that's just like your opinion man. it's not contrary to my ethics and I live in this country as well so it's certainly not some mathematical truth of the universe, it's just how they feel about the situation.

Regarding it being contrary to international law my response is... I don't know if that's true first and even if it is true I don't really care. I don't think it's a reasonable law to require any country in the path of a mass migration to allow unlimited amounts of people into their country. I didn't think it was wise or reasonable when there was a migration crisis from the middle east to Europe and I don't think it's wise or reasonable now.

In general I don't really value the opinions or input from countries in the international community saying how you must allow unlimited amounts of asylum seekers into your country when geographically those countries are not in a position to ever be negatively impacted by this. Off the cuff, Canada seems like an example of a country in a geographically advantage position in that regard. It's easy to be on a high horse as a country like Canada when they do not have a land border where thousands of asylum seekers are coming through every day for years. If Canada or any other country in that kind of position is so offended by Biden's actions they should offer to take in all of these asylum seekers themselves but they're not doing that... so it's just moral grandstanding in my opinion.

He tried to get legislation passed on this and certain parts of the republican party made it clear that they will not support that legislation because they didn't want to give Biden a win on this issue and instead wanted to allow the crisis to continue in order to use it in the upcoming election. 

Overall I think it's a good move by Biden. I think it's another example of him showing that he's willing to actually lead and make hard decisions on issues that will upset certain people but that are in the end the decision that is most in our interests."

I'm a liberal, preferred Bernie but voted for Hillary in 2016 and Biden in 2020. I thought Trump had a 25% chance at victory in 2016, and maybe 45% chance in 2020, but now is definitely the favorite to win in 2024.

....

Now, most of Reddit thinks Biden has anywhere from a small edge to a huge edge on Trump to win. They think the overwhelming, visceral hate and distaste of Trump around the country, coupled with his long rap sheet of impeachments, corruption, and convictions, are enough to keep him out of office.

What they are missing is most of Trump's worst foibles were already ""baked in"" in 2020. Everyone knew he was a corrupt criminal ahole who slept with porn stars and lied on his finances and cheated his taxes. Literally everybody knew/ assumed that. And he lost to Joe Biden in say 3-4 swing states by < 1% of the vote (the median swing voter is the dumbest of the dumb by the way).

So now take 2024.

Biden went from Obama Lite, mostly a blank slate, to a guy mostly regarded as ""senile to not so senile perhaps"" or at best ""lost a step"" -- and is generally though to be responsible (rightly or wrongly) for massive immigration and massive inflation, both of which 80% of the country hates at least. The Gaza sitch ain't helping him much either (I personally don't blame him for Gaza or inflation, but many do).

Trump started a turd and has remained a turd, but his stock hasn't dropped like Biden's since 2020. In fact, it may have RISEN, as in 2020 -- Trump botched the pandemic badly, and also the 24-7 Trump Show was extremely fatiguing. America has a short memory though.

Trump is way up, Europe just lurched right. The Biden Campaign needs a wake-up call.

Gaslighting people into saying their economic anxiety is invalid is not a winning strategy.

And saying anyone against ""unlimited immigration"" is racist as some Biden surrogates have suggested --- is not a winning strategy. Talking past people and being obtuse/ not understanding the issue -- it doesn't work.

0,2024-06-11,CMV: The word ‚Äúwoke‚Äù has its definition misused by anti-sjws to describe bad media compared to what the word originally meant and used for. ,u/Available_Reason7795,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ddix6t/cmv_the_word_woke_has_its_definition_misused_by/,changemyview,"All throughout social media, i have heard people crying out when any modern media tries to push in a message, the people on those platforms are calling them ""woke"" in the process. However, I think that the word ""woke"" in this case has now lost its meaning due to the white anti-sjws that decry bad media. I want to make a statement that media has always been woke for ages since the creation of the Bible. 

In fact the word ""woke"" was originally a slang word by African Americans in the 1930s-1940s to describe alertness to any kind of racial prejudice and discrimination. The word was then picked up by the mainstream audience in popularity during the Black Lives Matter movement during the early 2010s. The word then came to be awareness of social injustices in society. 

Now this is where the word ""woke"" was misused by anti-sjws to describe any piece of bad media the represent a social injustice. An example of this would be the live-action remake of Cowboy Bebop in 2021. The real reason why people didn't want to watch the Cowboy Bebop live-action remake isn't because it's woke, but it was poorly written, poorly acted, and it fails to live up to the original 1998 anime. Contrast to the X-men 97 reboot when people are complaining that the reboot is ""woke"" when in reality, the X-men has always been woke since the beginning including the 1992 original cartoon. The difference is that the X-men 97 reboot was well-written and it pays homage to the original '92 cartoon and the comics where as the live-action Cowboy bebop didn't. 

So, I want to conclude that the word ""woke"" should not be used to describe poorly written media and be used to describe the awareness of any social injustice. "

Alex Jones is, rhetorically, a populist. And while that word has gained a lot of baggage because of people like Jones, it's just a style of speech. It's not inherently good or bad, left or right 

If you listen to Jones with some passivity, particularly his younger self, that's what you get. It's the decent, honest people versus the ""elites."" That's what populism is. And what makes it compelling and ""dangerous,"" is that its appeal is universal. There really are decent, honest people, and there really are elites. Back in the early 2000s, when he spent a lot of his time labeling Bush jr a heinous war criminal, ""called"" 9/11, was against the Iraq war, and so on, even many liberals were giving him space. It's only when you start to get into the specifics when ideology comes out and we get problems

Alex Jones himself is many things, including a compulsive liar, a bigot, and a religious zealot. But he's also a uniquely gifted broadcaster, communicator, and storyteller. He is both popular with a political base and outside the mainstream media and party circles. He is also, and always has been, openly political and willing to take ideological stances (for at least a month or two) and ""fight"" against the ""establishment."" Wondering about that combination naturally had me wondering about an alternative history idea of a similar person with a different politics, and whether or not they could exist

As far as ideology goes, what matters with Jones is that he grew up basically an upper middle class Bircher and extremely religious. As a Bircher, he's not only an insane neocon, but his world view is based on virulent anti-communism. His opposition to regimes of all sorts, both American and international--and also ""elites"" in general--is barely comprehensible as standard libertarian jargon about small government. The real issue is that everyone in power is, secretly, actually a goddamn filthy fucking commie. And also a satanist. Which is why he can never find any real common ground, despite the populism, with anyone to the left of William F Buckley 

Birchers are related to the red scare, and I believe that particular history and those ideas are what allow people like Jones to exist in public, while a ""leftist"" version of the same couldn't. What I mean is that the western liberal project is built with many of the same materials, the exceptionalism and anti-communism included. You take a population that has been aggressively propagandized at from birth that communists are the evil enemy, in their essence anti ""American"" and anti ""freedom,"" then top that up with a lot of religion, and when some guy gets on the radio and starts screaming about how all the liberal capitalist billionaires around you are actually putting chemicals in the water because of the Frankfurt school and Marxism and Satan, they have some priming to understand and accept it as naturally bad. That's the zeitgeist which also allows for him to make broad insinuations without having to go into detail 

To get it out of the way, a ""liberal"" Alex Jones couldn't work because any time where a liberal could claim radicalism and populist anti establishment credentials would be before the invention and adoption of mass communication like radio. Liberals simply are the establishment and the elites and they have no problem with ""globalism,"" so there's no real basis to be complaining about it as a populist (plus the whole individual actors in a free market thing that is core to neoliberalism)

Meanwhile, a ""leftist"" (and I'm working with a definition here that includes ideological positions that are anti capitalist and anti hierarchy, with maybe a bit of space at the edge for socdems) can't make simple, blanket assertions about ""elites"" and the plight of the working man to that degree because that consensus hasn't been built. In fact, it's been purposely dismantled

Which is also a large issue with how ""populism"" is perceived, and why we still have intellectually dishonest political memes like ""horseshoe theory"" in proliferation. If someone wants to go on a rant about the problem the international establishment, Western imperialism, foreign interference, the ""deep state,"" government surveillance, conspiracy and ""false flags,"" police states, and any number of other problems that populist rhetoric can tackle, they have to spend all this extra time and effort explaining what they really mean and what their solutions are for people to understand what they're saying, and that's before any effort to overcome ambient biases 

It's never going to be as straightforward as a personality like Jones needs it to be. Because, if it's not already clear, the positions Alex Jones holds are baby-brained nonsense, only as vague and non-contradictory as is required for him to get through the next segment without showing a smoking gun on air. Which he can get away with also as a consequence of the inferences having been baked in. If you have to spend 45 minutes of every show defining terms, then you're not ranting, and you're also not as allowed to just make shit up on the spot and pretend what you said a month ago never happened 

As final points, I believe that the ultimate fate of people like Russell Brand, Matt Taibbi, and Glenn Greenwald indicate that even initially well meaning anti-establishment, populist ideas that aren't built on top of a sufficiently distinct and grounded ideology, will eventually sink down to the bedrock of right-of-centre politics we exist upon. And also that while Alex Jones is good at what he does, I'd lay out pretty similar arguments for other demagogues like Tucker Carlson. He can make stupid, bewildered faces at the camera while asking leading questions because he has an audience that has been culturally primed to follow those inferences. Basically, if you have to explain yourself, it doesn't work 

You might also point at people like Jon Stewart or John Oliver. Aside from them both being very mainstream, the former has mostly been anti-populist, and the latter has his show built around the fact that he has to go into incredible detail to explain problems. It may just be that's the limit for that sort of content, that is must be in this different form

The last person on my list is Michael Moore, who was both a populist and broadly progressive, but worked in a much slower medium, and often fell short of real politics (eg ""slacker uprising,"" his unwillingness to explicitly endorse or dismiss political candidates when he was most active, and a tendency to leave off with a shrug after describing problems and getting to the part where coming up with solutions begins). And I'm not sure how much of that is by choice. The backlash he received was always harsh, and though he was popular and influential, I don't know if someone with his talents and drive to produce political media could have found success if he'd been even 10% more open about ideology. You can say, ""the country has problems that need to be fixed and the politicians aren't doing a good job,"" and that's okay, but if you end your movie by recommending people read certain pamphlets, you're going to have trouble 

These are idle thoughts, and I don't think that because this person doesn't exist currently that's evidence that they can't. Nor do I require a real world example to prove it wrong. Even if it's possible, it probably won't ever happen. That's fine. And obviously, this is localized to the global north and recent history"

By consistently supporting the major party that aligns with your views, you help strengthen its influence and ability to enact change, creating a political landscape that closely mirrors the values of its constituents. Over time, this can shift the political spectrum towards your viewpoint, as parties adjust their platforms to attract a growing base of aligned voters.

However, some argue that strategic voting, or voting for a party with the best chance of winning even if it doesn't fully align with your views, is wrong or distasteful. This approach might prevent a less desirable party from gaining power, but it can also dilute the representation of your true beliefs and lead to voter disillusionment. Additionally, people who get upset that their chosen party doesn't do everything for them can end up feeling betrayed and disengaged, ultimately harming themselves and others by fragmenting support and weakening the party's ability to push forward meaningful changes.

While I am open to considering that there might be situations where ""throwing away your vote"" in the two-party system is best, I still maintain that voting for one of the two major parties based on alignment with your personal views is fundamentally the best approach for achieving long-term political progress.

I mean as an ideological concept among Europeans, after the new elections in the EU I started to think that people have already subconsciously chosen that it is acceptable to lose democracy. This is evident from many factors such as:

- Low turnout: too many people decided that it was better to stay at home, this indirectly means that people let others vote for the far right (this was predictable from simply reading the polls in countries like Austria or France). Deciding to ignore the votes is an indirect stance in ignoring the results of the elections, I think this is frighteningly close to the concept of collective guilt attributed to the Germans (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German\_collective\_guilt) after the second war world. Not voting because you disagree with the parties does not justify you in ignoring worrying political developments in your country.

- Lack of confidence in voting: most people, even those who voted, no longer have confidence in the parties, many did not vote out of ideological convictions but to vote strategically or according to the ""least worse"" logic. If voting begins to lose importance then so does democracy.

-High tolerance of the right: many moderate parties have decided to accept the withdrawal of the right as their voters have done, the justification of parties that want to violate the laws of the nation, the rule of law, international laws and the moral obligations established by the united nations is unacceptable, no matter if for reasons considered valid such as migration.

-High ignorance among voters: yes it must be said, many of the voters, despite living in Western countries and therefore highly educated compared to the rest of the world, show serious ignorance on political issues on both the left and the right. This problem is easily exploitable in issues that frighten voters, such as migration or the recognition of homosexual rights, etc. Phenomenon TOO similar to how the fascists and Nazis attracted the population through their fear of communism and their hatred of the Jews.

In conclusion, most people have directly or indirectly decided that extremism might be acceptable under some conditions and, by this logic, might become more compromising in the future. Therefore they accept that the presence of elements that can compromise democracy can continue to exist.

Watching Oppenheimer left me with a horrible feeling. The ending sent shivers down my spine. I've never had a film to that to me like it did. Because the idea of global nuclear war actually happening is by far the most outrageous thing humanity would ever face so people just forget that it's still a possibility. There are LITERALLY THOUSANDS of fucking missiles just sat in silos which together have the capability of ending humanity. Just sat there. 

With the right circumstances and crazy people in charge, one wrong move and it could start a chain reaction and happen quicker than we know it. It all slowly builds and then bang that's it. We already have those circumstances and crazy people in charge and to even put humanity in that situation or play around with it is by far the the 2nd most insane and stupid thing humans can do. The first insane thing was creating the bomb in the first place. Global powers wanted this to happen they want global war. If they didn't then wouldn't be in this situation. Why risk it all just to flex your power? Why fuck around? Because one day it will slip and humanity will find out. 

There is one thing that we can learn from history that humans are obsessed with our own self destruction. We are so advance technologically yet we are so immature mentally and emotionally. The people in charge care about themselves and the people care about the people. We literally can't do fuck all. I don't why I'm even worrying because of how little we can do but I think what annoys me I see people just casually speaking this country has the right to do this and that defend themselves, empty threats empty threats blah blah blah. But no one is talking about the fact how obscured it is do even play around with this amount of danger to humanity. We shouldn't even be going anywhere near it yet we just fuck about with it like it's nothing. Let's hope we make it to the next century."

It‚Äôs just added for shits and giggles for no reason at all. 

I find this extremely weird because why? What is the reason? In African American movies there are never any mention or attacks towards Italians overall. 

And I understand the argument that a lot of these mob bosses and individuals were more than likely extremely racist, but why does that need to be added in a film or a TV show, that is supposed to be an escapism? Also I‚Äôm sure Mob bosses were also extremely homophobic, but that is hardly ever incorporated in the movies, so what gives?

It's less exercise than just walking, which is basically nothing (unless you're talking about hiking mountains).  
  
But my kid just started playing and we have a rule that you have to do some activity that is exercise. I'd like to believe baseball is exercise so I can wholeheartedly embrace this hobby... well maybe not whole-heartedly, since it'll always be unbearably boring (and I have to watch every god-forsaken second because that's what good parents do), but at least change my view on so that I can remove a source of conflict in my household.

Why isn't it exercise?

Most of the game is spent just sitting and waiting your turn.

There's minimal cardio. Even when you're playing, you primarily just stand there. They could do a lot of running at practice, but they don't. If you're lucky you get on base and have a chance to run a short distance a couple times. If you're in the field you might accumulate 30 seconds of sprinting over the course of the game. 

  
No muscle building to speak of. You swing a moderately heavy bat once in a while. Otherwise... what?

You don't even break a sweat unless it's just hot out.

Even professional baseball players aren't necessarily in shape. You ever see a chunky swimmer? Basketball player? I can't come up with a team sport that's less vigorous than baseball.

  
What would convince me:   
Some kind of stats about fitness between kids who play baseball and those who don't.   
  
Some kind of analysis of how it compares favorably with other sports.

Some kind of medical insights that show that the amount of exercise baseball gives is enough to provide the known benefits of exercise."

Visual Effects: still one of the best. They keep up even until this day

I'm sincerely confused as to why that would be the case though because: 

1. Hunter Biden is not running for President.
2. Hunter Biden is a 50-something year-old man who presumably made his own choices. It's not like this was the case of a minor where the parents are ultimately responsible for his behavior. 
3. Hunter Biden does not write the President's policies, domestic or international. His conviction has no bearing on how President Biden will govern, set policy, make his budget, etc.  
4. President Biden has been convicted of nothing, charged with nothing. 
5. Donald Trump is literally a convicted felon. Shouldn't being a felon be worse for a campaign than being related to a felon?

Given those reasons, why is the Hunter Biden case even an issue? Most Americans are related or know someone personally that has a drug problem, and people who are in the midst of their drug issues are generally not known to be the best law-abiding citizens. The equivalency drawn between Hunter's court case and Trump's court caseS seems like a huge reach. Am I missing something?"

For example, if you punch someone in the head who‚Äôs coming after you and they fall down unable to attack you, that will be considered self defense in a court of law. However if you kick them in the head while they are down, you now just gave yourself an assault charge.

I‚Äôve been to many martial art schools and none of these have been talked about enough if at all. Self defense is often treated like a power fantasy rather than the legal battle it truly is. A good instructor should make their students understand what they can and can‚Äôt do with regards to the law. 

The worst one is when certain Krav Maga and self defense schools teach dirty fighting techniques for self defense. This includes but isn‚Äôt limited to eye pokes, ball kicks/punches, bites, headbutts, neck strikes, and throat strikes. Not only can your opponents use these same things against you, but if you use them outside of what would be deemed reasonable force by law, you will go to prison.

It‚Äôs not always a choice between jail or death in a self defense situation. It‚Äôs possible to avoid both. If you aren‚Äôt striving to avoid both, you are not a moral fighter and you are most likely the people we are trying defend against.

Here‚Äôs what it will take to change my view:

‚Ä¢Prove that there is a good enough reason(s) to not teach the law to martial arts students to the point where it‚Äôs not worth the effort

‚Ä¢Demonstrate a good alternative to teaching self defense laws in martial arts so people won‚Äôt go and get themselves killed or in prison."

So as humans we have no memories or any recollection before our life on earth. Even though the universe has been here for millions of years. We only know this life. I believe that this is what happens after death. We are unbelievably lucky to be in this life because someone how we lucked out on an infinite chance of life and have made it here today. If you start to really dive into just how big the universe is, like I mean really dive in then you start to see just how terrifyingly insignificant we are. And I think deep down this is terrifying for people to acknowledge. So we make up things like afterlife and religion and so on. We put meaning into fucking everything because it's all we have. We're all alone on this tiny rock floating in nothingness. And we need more than what we have because it's terrifying to accept that this life is all we have.

I believe for a lot of humans they just can't accept that really there is a massive chance that there is nothing after death. I say may because I haven't died yet. And that maybe will never know because life stops when we leave. We spend all our lives wondering that even upon death we may never know. and from what I have observed in religion is that there is a massive emphasis on afterlife. (Just what I have observed). I think it's human nature to want to feel immortal in the context of how minute we are in the existence of the universe. Which is ok like by any means believe in what you want to believe nothing wrong with that. This is just what I believe. In doing that there is like this subtle acceptance and living upon life's terms. There is kind of a peacefulness to it.¬†

The only thing I hope for is that I live a long life and make the most of my time here on earth, and have a peaceful death. I guess that is what we all want. I find myself more torn and locked in fear if I start to believe in an afterlife. And if I don't accept this fact I can immediately feel the fear come in. I think that is the whole underlying reasoning for religion. It's based upon fear. It's all i've ever observed. When you live upon life's terms there is no fear. And I think a lot of people fall into religion is because they are not willing to accept a few of life's truths.

4: the destruction of REASONABLE social constructs and standards.(I.e letting people call you what you look like instead of what you identify as, gender neutral public restrooms,etc)
5:mass delusion


One thing conservatives do is stay pretty consistent. Regardless of if you agree, they are not wavering even when they come off as unhinged.

Mass delusion: 
The ‚Äúright‚Äù knows project 2025 is possible because the majority of people against it can‚Äôt get over their ‚Äúcrippling social anxiety‚Äù and Phonophobia ( a literal fear of sounds) in order to do something. Yet run around talking about brick by brick

Hypocrisy : The left boycotts a company over genocide and then buys cute cups they were too lazy to realize are made by the same company they are boycotting.

My opinion:
I on the other hand am planning my exit because I‚Äôm not willing to die for people who value comfort over their beliefs.

My view on gender is that men and women are different, but equal and that they should share positions of power equally. I think the model used by many European Green parties (having two leaders, one male, one female) should be adopted by countries in respect to heads of state and other important departments. 

Ok with that out of the way, on to my main point. If you look at that subreddit on any given day their will be posts celebrating concepts such as ‚Äúdecentralising‚Äù men from your life which is described as switching all your service providers (doctor, therapist, electrician) to women, prioritising female friends over male ones, abstaining from any sexual or romantic relationships with men, only hiring women if you are in a position to do so etc. 

Can someone please explain how this is not just the white supremacy of gender theory? They‚Äôre using all the same talking points and philosophy that straight up fascists use? 

They regularly advocate for what is essentially a gendered apartheid system and will say that males and male characteristics need to be continually devalued and diminished in society. 

I have never heard any of these ideas said in real life, only on that subreddit which leads me to believe it is a fringe ideology on the edge of acceptable thought and should really be looked at more critically. If you speak to people in real life about gender, the overwhelming majority will agree that cooperation and mutual understanding between genders is essential for society and that increased respect between the genders can only be good for society, and this is the view we should be promoting‚Ä¶ surely?!

Also the subreddit operates as a massive echo chamber which is don‚Äôt think is healthy, I was banned for trying to discuss the intersectionality of class and gender as from the perspective of a working-class man it seems like a lot of their views come from a position of privilege and do not reflect the realities of working-class relationships, social norms and family dynamics. 

Basically, I‚Äôm hoping someone can give me a better understanding on where these viewpoints (which seem extreme and dangerous to me) come from and justify why they are valid so I can be better informed.

The Zionists themselves claim that antizionism is antisemitism. So the Zionists hide behind anti-Zionist Jews and use them as a shield against all criticism. Any increase in actual antisemitism (instead of antiZionism incorrectly labeled as antisemitism) would be unfortunate collateral damage in their fight against terrorists (Israel/Zionism).

Which is why I need to discuss this, I also recognize that this is the extreme end of the spectrum, and this does not represent all feminist views or beliefs.

The original views of feminism were to create equality for men and women by empowering women while not demeaning men, and I believe that has changed. Feminism is currently in a position where a large amount of the feminist population has tipped the scales in the opposite direction; instead of promoting equality, they focus on switching the roles and making men less powerful than women. Many young women still hold onto the belief that men shouldn't cry, both because it might show ""weakness"" and adding to that they do not feel like men's feelings are important. Interviewing many women shows that they do think men are lesser. The original goal has been completely lost, and it is especially affecting young men as they grow up.

Women now dominate many workplaces, which may not be a bad thing, but those work places have become harder for men to get into. For example, my male english teacher growing up was terrified to be in the same room with me alone for fear of what that stigma could do to his career. He was subjected to much more rigorous investigation than any of his female co-workers, which are treated as if they could never harm a student. The majority of jobs in some fields are still male dominated, which needs to be fixed, however it isn't progressing toward equality, it is just tipping the scales (that may not be a proper use but oh well).

Because of this large amount of negativity towards men, and the tendency of teenagers/young children to take on many beliefs without much critical thinking, many kids now treat male classmates as if they might assault them when given no reason to suspect so, and not only that, but they vocally express their belief in that men are lesser. Suicide rates for men 10-14 and 15-24 have massively increased since 2000. I have first handedly experienced this and can attest that it takes a massive toll on the health to be generalized and viewed in these ways.

Please change my view."

This mindset then creates men who don't see themselves having a long term relationship with women and only seeing their interactions as one night stands to increase the amount of women they associate with and not putting any effort in.

First off, the volatility is a real bitch. One day you're on top of the world, and the next day you're broke as hell.

Then there's the issue of security. Hackers and scammers are everywhere, just waiting for you to slip up. One wrong click or a stolen private key, and your hard-earned crypto is gone. There's no FDIC to save your ass.

And let's not forget the environmental disaster that is crypto mining. Bitcoin mining, consumes a ridiculous amount of energy, contributing to the climate crisis. It's an environmental shitshow we could do without.

Regulatory issues are another headache. Governments are still figuring out how to regulate crypto, and every new policy can send the market into a tailspin. It's a tax nightmare. Also, good luck trying to spend your crypto. Sure, it can be spent, but only with other suckers who accept it. Most businesses look at you like you're trying to pay with Monopoly money.

The crypto world is also crawling with scams. The chances of getting ripped off are high unless you know exactly what you're doing. It's a jungle out there. Messed up a transaction or got swindled? Tough luck. There's no reversing a crypto transaction once it's done. You're shit out of luck and money. Traditional banking offers consumer protections like fraud alerts and dispute resolution. With crypto, you're on your own. If something goes wrong, too bad.

Also, many people treat crypto more like a speculative investment than a currency. This leads to wild price swings and instability, making it unreliable for everyday use. Some cryptocurrencies struggle with scalability issues. As more people use the network, it can become slower and more expensive to use, which is a major drawback.

While crypto *promises* anonymity, it's not as private as you might think. Transactions can be traced, and your entire transaction history is public. All of the main Crypto Exchanges have a KYC (Know your customer policy) that requires you to send them their ID when signing up.. Most people rely on these exchanges to buy and sell crypto. These exchanges can be hacked, or go bankrupt, taking your funds *AND your ID* with them.

**TL;DR**:

Crypto is volatile, insecure, environmentally disastrous, legally murky, hard to use, prone to fraud, manipulative, and barely accepted anywhere. It's a speculative nightmare with no consumer protections. Use at your own risk."

1) They don't actually believe the texts are from God (therefore they are not Jewish/Muslim/Christian by default).

Even their movements will be tracked and monitored 24/7 with cameras to their residences and trackers surgically implanted in their bodies, allowing our citizens to know what they are doing so that our citizens can make informed choices. If it means that our citizens have to sift out the more intimate moments for our officials so that they can know what they are doing, so be it.

Well? If it causes issues for diplomacy? Well, everything being open and nothing being classified means nothing left to leverage as blackmail for foreign powers

What if people don't want to stand for office because of this? Impressment (forced into office) at random and those impressed have to stand for a election at the end of their term as an assessment of their policies at the hands of the citizens, otherwise they'll be forced out of office. (though those forced out of office will get their rights to privacy back)

  
We need to make the government more accountable. The era of 'It's classified' has to end if we want to know what the government is doing or spending our taxes on.

People that are staying the night at colleges? The people who run it? They sitting at home they chilling your harassing the people who live there for school.

Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but most people that are doing this big protest right now are people who have little to no life and think they are doing better and barley paying for there apartment then wanting it handed to them.

Research your protests are no longer valid. Please give me any details of where you all on the street is causing them to drop there guns.

But, I can't really say Iraq had it worse with their wars (including Desert Storm, which actually did most of the military work). From the prospective of an average Iraqi, a few months of bombing, then terrorist insurgencies for a few years seems like they got off easy compared to their neighbor."

120,2024-06-12,CMV: Jesus was not a convicted felon,u/WippitGuud,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1de650k/cmv_jesus_was_not_a_convicted_felon/,changemyview,"Been seeing a lot of stuff online about Jesus being a convicted felon recently. The problem with that: he wasn't.

The trial of Jesus was carried out by the Sanhedrin, a legislative Jewish assembly in the state of Palestine. His trial is mentioned in all 4 gospels - Matthew 26, Mark 14, Luke 22, and John 18. It is described as being taken before the high priests, scribes, and elders and tried for (among other things), violating the Sabbath, threatening to destroy the temple, claiming to be the Messiah, and blasphemy. And of course, they find Jesus guilty and sentence him to death.

... except...

The Sanhedrin have no power at this point in time. Palestine is ruled by Rome. So, this trial is akin to being convicted by the Catholic Church, or by Black Lives Matter, or by Moms for Liberty. It's not real. They had their trial, they ""posted their opinion on social media"", and they claimed victory. But it meant nothing.

Having make their conviction, they take Jesus to the government of Palestine, lead by Pontius Pilate. Now, none of what they just convicted Jesus for carries any weight in Rome. They don't care if he calls himself a Messiah, or breaks any rules of a religion they don't follow. So, the Jews tell Pilate that Jesus has declared himself King of the Jews, which is something Rome *would* have an interest in.

Pilate interrogates Jesus, but finds he is not guilty of any crime. Pilate even sent Jesus to another ruler, Herod Antipas, because he discovers Jesus is from Galilee and not Judea, thus under Herod's jurisdiction. Herod also finds Jesus committed no crime.

And Pilate tells the Sanhedrin that.

> I having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him. (Luke 23:13-15)

Jesus was found not guilty. Jesus was not a convicted felon."

Casino gambling is heavily regulated by governments to ensure fairness and transparency. Casinos have to implement responsible gambling measures like self-exclusion programs, bet limits, and providing help for problem gamblers. They also strictly enforce age limits, so underage gambling is not an issue. On the flip side, pseudo-gambling often flies under the regulatory radar, leading to potential exploitation. Lootboxes and gacha mechanics sit in a legal grey area with fewer consumer protections and are easily accessible to minors, who might not get how much money they're really spending.

When it comes to transparency and cost awareness, casino gambling is pretty straightforward. You can know the odds, stakes, and potential payouts, making it easier to see where your money is going. (Depending on your jurisdiction, to some extent) Pseudo-gambling, however, often hides the real costs behind in-game currencies, making it harder for players to track their spending. The odds of getting good items are often hidden or buried in fine print, leading to potential deception.

Psychologically, casino gambling is known as risky entertainment, which can lead to more cautious behavior. Regulatory bodies often require casinos to include warnings and educational materials about gambling risks. At some point you have to physically leave the casino. In contrast, pseudo-gambling games are designed to be super addictive, using tricks like variable rewards to keep players hooked and spending. These elements are often part of ""free-to-play"" games, which can deceive players into spending a lot without realizing it. Social elements and peer pressure can also push players to spend more compulsively. And your phone is always in your pocket unless it's in your hand.

While both casino gambling and pseudo-gambling mechanics have their downsides, casino gambling is generally better regulated, with clearer costs and better harm prevention measures. Pseudo-gambling often exploits regulatory gaps, lacks transparency, and uses psychological tricks to encourage excessive spending, posing a bigger risk, especially to kids and teens. So, from a harm perspective, traditional casino gambling is likely less harmful than these new forms of pseudo-gambling.

At the beginning of the movie Rush Hour the bad guy gives a whole monologue about how casinos are the best business because people give you money and you give them nothing. But that's only true in the long run of land based casinos, in the short run they absolutely do give some people money back. Cash sunk into a gacha game or even Candy Crush is just straight gone. Fake casinos where you pay real money for the opportunity to win fake money are strictly worse than real casinos where you pay real money for the chance to win real money, CMV."

I feel this practice should be ruled unconstitutional and all in segregated housing should be immediately integrated into the general population. 

You might argue against this using the 8th Amendment by claiming its ""cruel and unusual punishment"" of the state to put them in danger. However, this does not textially violate the 8th Amendment. It's only an 8A violation if the state itself commits any violent acts the befall the criminals in question here. State negligence is not an 8A violation as the state did not knowingly put them with cell mates who would engage in harm against them. Unless the victim of any act of harm can prove intent on the state's part, then it does not transgress the 8A.

So I thought I would post it here. Curious to get better refutations.

Hello! So I've been looking into Christian nationalism lately, and I have been fairly convinced it is probably the right way for Christians to engage in the secular sphere. So I am asking for people to basically give me the best arguments against it.

Definitions:

Nation: a descriptive group of people collected under a common culture and/or characteristics, and is not a state

State: the governing apparatus and set of laws under a particular government

Nationalism: [edit] the belief that a state should favor a nation as a moral foundation 

Judeo-Christianity: the interpretive tradition transmitted to us by Christians and Jews who have spent over 2 millennia studying and debating the intersection between, and margins of revelation, religion, and reason

Basic description of Christian nationalism as i have come to understand it: The belief that the state should be influenced by the nation of Judeo-Christianity as a moral grounding. This seems to be a good belief for multiple reasons. 

1) this seems to be the historic Christian position, both in terms of what the Bible says, and in terms of what Christians have typically believed
2) there are no amoral laws, and there are no faithless morals. The enactment of laws seems to be a direct result of the set of ethical beliefs a person has. If it is true that Christianity has an ethic, and as a Christian, I am compelled to believe in that ethic, it seems fairly straightforward that I would try to enact laws in favor of that ethic. 
3) the Christian ethic is the best approximation of the true ethic. Again, if I am a Christian, then I believe that Christianity has a true revelation into the nature of the things that the revelation speaks on. The revelation we have speaks on the true nature of man, a state, and the man's role within the state. Because this is the case, then it seems like my duty to make my state better, and by believing Christianity is the best ethic, then I should make my state closer resemble the character given to it in the revelation. 
4) a state's character requires grounding. There is a paper called something along the lines of ""The Illiberal Roots of Liberalism,"" wherein the author discusses the fact that Liberalism cannot be its own efficient cause. This seems to generalize to any secular governing principle. If this is the case, and principles like Liberalism are desirable, then there should be an efficient cause for such desirable state characteristics. If this grounding is God, then it also stands to reason that the other elements of the religious ethic should have a role in the state equal to their gravity in the faith. 
5) it seems like if we take the obvious moral areas and ignore them for the marginal ones (i.e., if we all agree on murder being wrong, we may disagree on pornography or greed being wrong), an answer to such questions does not seem to arise out of secularism. On questions like ""should pornography be banned,"" and the question of whether it is art vs vulgarity, the secular seems to be unable to answer it, but the religious seems to be able to answer it (this is only an example). If such questions as these morally marginal ones are not answered by the secular in a seemingly beautiful and satisfactory way, then it seems we unthinkingly rely on our religious instincts to distinguish between art and vulgarity. If this is the case, it seems that we already apply a religious instinct to the state, so it then would make no sense not to do it explicitly.
6) the idea of normative principle that a state's and nation's character should be distinct seems arbitrary and unfounded. So if that idea is generally unfounded, and the opposite idea has more of a foundation, it seems like I should choose the one with more foundation.

I think those are the basic propositions I've been wrestling with, and that have generally pushed me in the Christian nationalist direction. So any insight would be appreciated. Thank you!"

So, judge a city's anti-homelessness efforts based on the number of *new* cases they prevent.",u/bennetthaselton,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dehxoa/cmv_its_relatively_easy_to_prevent_an_increase_in/,changemyview,"We know that large increases in rent are followed by large increases in homelessness (e.g. in Seattle where I live and where this has been very obvious in the last 15 years). But people often miss the conclusion: If rent going up leads to homelessness going up, that means the increase in homelessness was not caused by ""drugs"".  Even if the newly homeless started doing drugs to cope after they became homeless, the drugs did not cause the increase in homelessness.

In fact, if rents going up is generally followed by homelessness increase, it means that almost by definition, the increase in homelessness could have been prevented by keeping the rent down. The simplest way to do this is to build new housing (either government or private-sector). You *could* keep rents down by setting rent control, but this solution has drawbacks since it disincentivizes people from building new housing. But however you do it, it seems clear that to prevent an increase in homelessness due to rent increase, all you have to do is keep the rent from increasing.

On other hand, once a person is *already* homeless, getting them off the streets and back into housing is much harder -- they may now have addiction issues or mental health issues aggravated by living on the streets, they now have a gap in their housing history, a gap in their employment history, etc.

So when a city attempts to reduce homelessness \*overall\*, they're faced with an almost unsolvable problem, since it's so hard to reduce the number of existing cases.

So instead, judge a city's ""success"" based on reduction in the number of \*new\* homeless cases.  This will incentivize a city to spend their resources where they will make the most difference (under the assumption that, for example, for a given fixed number of dollars, you can choose between preventing 100 new cases of homelessness). Provide humanitarian services to the existing homeless population, but when looking at the costs of getting them back into housing, the blunt truth is that we can help more people (and reduce homelessness more overall) by putting that effort into preventing new cases of homelessness.

* **Group A** says race is a method of classing people together based on appearance and really has no support in reality.
* **Group B** says race is something that is determined by biology, and isn't just a decided social grouping.

There's definitely other groups, but these two are the most prevalent every time.

I think both groups are talking to the other with the wrong vocabulary. Group A is definitely referring to race as a subjective cultural and social grouping, whereas group B is without a doubt in my mind referring to ancestry and ethnicity. I don't think either group are inherently hateful or anything of the sort, but I think group A leans more towards ""why does it matter?"", and group B leans towards ""people are different, how so?""

Its very odd to see these groups interact because very rarely do other terms outside of race and ethnicity appear. Especially other terms that both sides may have an agreed upon definition for. I've seen outliers in each group that make this discourse more complicated by making unprecise claims such as ""humans are 99.99...% similar in DNA, there are no *major* differences,"" as well as ""all humans possess a common ancestor so we are all basically the same."" A lot of these claims mean well but tend to lack the necessary support to stand up to questioning. 

More likely than not group A would agree that humans have trait differences which often originate from a specific population, and groups B would likely agree that humans inappropriately and inaccurately group each other by appearance.

I think that this sort of issue only exists because neither side actually knows enough about what they're discussing, or neglects to discuss the other groups points in a meaningful way, when in reality both are closer to truthful about their own side than not."

Donald Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. That's not just the Jan 6 riot, it's his efforts to submit fake electors, have legislatures overturn results, have Congress overturn results, have the VP refuse to read the ballots for certain states, and have Governors find fake votes. 

This was bad because the results weren't fraudulent. A House investigation, a Senate investigation, a DOJ investigation, various courts, etc all have examined this extensively and found the results weren't fraudulent.

So Trump effectively tried to overthrow the government. Biden was elected president and he wanted to take the power of the presidency away from Biden, and keep it himself. If he knew the results weren't fraudulent, and he did this, that would make him evil. If he genuinely the results were fraudulent, without any evidence supporting that, that would make him dangerously idiotic. Either way, he shouldn't be allowed to have power back because it is bad for a country to have either an evil or dangerously idiotic leader at the helm. 

So, why is this view not shared by half the country? Why is it wrong?"
0,2024-06-12,CMV: We should have a progressive consumption tax,u/Major_Needleworker36,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dek3hx/cmv_we_should_have_a_progressive_consumption_tax/,changemyview,"Big spending should be taxed progressively. 

Purchases above $1k: 10% consumption tax

Purchases above $10k: 20% consumption tax

Purchases above $100k: 30% consumption tax

Purchases above $1M: 40% consumption tax

Purchases above $10M: 50% consumption tax

This kind of taxation won't effect low income and the rich can't structure their way out of consumption taxes the same way they can with income.

I fully believe this is the most fair taxation system. As a millionaire, you'll still be able to buy a huge mansion to show everyone that 'you made it', but you'll also be taxed heavily on your purchase, and the taxes will go towards UBI and ensuring that the plebs outside your mansion don't rob you when you go outside for a walk. Everyone wins.

It might lead to a decrease in demand for luxury goods like expensive cars, houses, watches etc., but it won't kill the luxury market entirely (rich people will always want to show off), and I honestly believe this decrease in demand is a good thing. 

Bonus: No individual tax returns. Individuals pay taxes only when they consume (as part of their bill), or when they import stuff from outside the country. This reduces tax administration to dealing with businesses and customs.

TLDR; If you wanna buy expensive stuff, you gotta pay. If you wanna live a modest lifestyle, you are free to do so without paying."

I'm sure you guys have heard about the white girl on tik tok who got fired from her job and the internet roaring saying the N word but she was clearly saying it in a endearing context when she said, ""broke as n*****"".
The N word has been a term of endearment, it's said in rap songs literally ALL the time. Other black people call each other it very frequently as well. Even Hispanics and Asians sometimes says it in the same context but there's never any pushback. But as soon as a white person says it everyone loses their sh*t. 
Now I know people might point out how whites have used that word as a slur during slavery days blah blah so it has some trauma to it but we don't apply this logic when it comes to any other slur word that's used for endearment. Can only women use the word slut, whore, b*tch while men can't say that word because it's used to degrade women? Are only gays allowed to use the word f*g and homophobic slurs while straight people can't according to that logic? I've never understood why if a white person says the word n*gga it's a big deal"

This belief largely stems from me personally witnessing anti-Israel/zionist protests on my college campus in the last few months. One in particular, the pro-Israel ‚Äúcounter-protestors‚Äù and the pro-Palestine protestors were just viamently yelling at each other for an hour straight, mostly just a bunch of epithets of ‚Äúgenocide enabler‚Äù or ‚Äúanti-Semite‚Äù. Lots of cameras recording, news coverage and all. Then when it got to 5pm, most of everyone just‚Ä¶ stopped? I was sat at a bench a little ways away, just watching, and it seems like everyone was just on a schedule for this to happen, and then be done. Even more erroneous, a few people from the opposite sides said hi to each other in a casual way and went home, or even chatted to each other. And while I don‚Äôt think race/gender is inherently a part of this, most of the protestors on both sides were white and black women, with mostly white men on the pro-Israel side. I‚Äôm saying all of this plus the ‚Äúsome‚Äù in the title, because a few weeks later a long term sit in took place at my campus as well, by pro-Palestinian protestors. Lasted a few weeks, was much more peaceful, more diverse group, and didn‚Äôt stop past some set date or news coverage. It was also more successful, with the university denouncing some arrests that took place there, and pledging a donation to the PCRF (Palestinian Children‚Äôs Relief Fund), which was not the goal of the protest, but was better than nothing. 

And while it is not my place to speak on it, I do have an African American friend who feels very similarly in relation to the George Floyd protests. 

To summarize, I think one day, screaming protests accomplish nothing, and sometimes are just used as publicity stunts for posturing your beliefs as a ‚Äúsupporter‚Äù of said cause. "

This causes a significant problem, they are effectively deciding the outcomes of these meetings for the rest of the population, meaning planning will almost certainly cater towards this group and their specific issues only.

I want a good argument why we should maintain the status quo of public participation, and maintain the current demographics of groups that attend the public participation meetings."

To say anything else is the equivalent of heresy in our modern secular religion. I don't agree. I think a swift German victory in 1914 or early 1915 would've set the world on a significantly better path than the one we find ourselves on now. 

For clarity, when I say Germany Victory, what i mean is this; France loses at the Marne. Germany takes Paris. A negotiated peace is reached with France and England, probably not unlike the Franco Prussian war. Germany is able to pivot to the east and they halt the Russian advance, probably gaining some new territory in the treaty. The stalemate ww1 is famous for never comes, the US never gets involved, and country's like Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman empire die of old age on their own. In large, the 19th centuries global structure continues, but with Germany in a dominant position in Europe. 

Hitler: 
This one is pretty obvious so I won't spend too much time on it. 
Without 4 years of brutal war and an allied victory, there's no treaty of Versailles. Which means there's no economic and political humiliation of Germany, and consequently no Hitler. No third Reich if the second one never ends.

Middle East:
If the Germans had won early on, the Ottoman empire would likely have avoided death at the hands of the French and British empires. The sick man of Europe was still on its way out, but it's collapse and the subsequent rise of various independent states would've come about more organically. This means no arbitrary colonial borders cutting up the middle east, and less ethnic conflict in the region. Not saying the middle east would be a utopia, but it wouldn't be the shit show it's been since 1918. 

Israel:
With no British control of the Levant, there's no Balfour declaration. And with no Holocaust, the future of European jews is obviously very different. The Jewish diaspora was making great headway with integration and assimilation prior to Nazism and the need to flee Europe. With no Hitler, I struggle to see why this wouldn't have continued. They'd simply continue living in Europe, those in the east either assimilating or immigrating to the west when possible. Much less incentive or pressure to steal the Levant from the Arabs using British muscle. Zionism is still a thing, it existed before the Balfour declaration so it'd presumably still exist after, but it wouldn't have caused the things it did in our time line. With no need for a Palestinian liberation movement, you don't see the japenese red army import the idea of suicide tactics to desperate and extremist Arabs. This means no 9/11, and no invasion of Afghanistan, or Iraq (see above point)

Communism: 
In our time line, a desperate, late war Germany put Lenin on a sealed train car back to Russia with enough money to start a revolution. With an early war victory this wouldn't have happened. Much like the Ottomans, Tsarist Russia was a struggling empire when it entered the war. I don't doubt a revolution or coup or restructuring was coming, but it's a lot less likely it'd come in the vile form of Leninist communism and later Stalinism. No red terror, no soviet gulags, no Holodomor, no iron curtain, no pitesti prison. Basically a lotta eastern Europeans would've seen old age that didn't in reality. I'm no expert on Russian history. Something had to change no matter how ww1 ended. Maybe a negotiated Russian defeat would've been enough to end the tsarist regime. Maybe it's replacement still would've been communist. But it almost certainly wouldn't have been lead by the devils we got. We'd also likely have been spared the graceful leadership of Mao, Pol Pot, and the rest of the sadistic communist dictators the 20th century gave us. Unified Korea anyone?

American foreign policy:
Maybe globalism was inevitable, I sure don't know. But I do know that American involvement in the world wars ended what was left of American isolationism. Unfortunately, it was replaced with Wilsonian foreign policy. Spreading democracy one bomb and one dead American and one fucked up country at a time, all on our tax dollars. I'd like to think afghanistan and Iraq would've put this in its grave, but Ukraine is proof it's as strong as ever. An early war German victory would've prevented American involvement in Europe and probably the entire old world. I think that'd be awesome, but that one could be a bit more subjective I guess.

Globalism:
After World War Two, the American navy began patrolling Global sea routes, the UN was created, NATO was created, and the stage was set for the shining city on a hill we call Globalism. Turns out it's a crock of shit, the death of sovereignty, the death of any sort of cultural, religious, or racial hegemony in the west, and more recently a slippery slope into tyranny. Mass immigration, legal or otherwise, absolutely destroying Europe, and America's probably not far behind. For God's sake, Swedish is the most popular language on duolingo.....  in Sweden. Now we have the WEF trying telling you you'll own nothing and you'll like it. You can talk about how much you like it while you enjoy some bugs in your house you'll never own. Had Germany won the great war, the Anglo American system of Global trade wouldn't have taken the form it has, if it came about at all. Germany was a strong, nationalist, conservative country, and they would've become the dominant power in Europe. The old world would've continued into the 20th century, at least as far as geopolitics and Global interconnectedness are concerned. America would ostensibly have continued being a dormant isolationist power. The global economic system we see today almost certainly wouldn't exist, and hopefully neither would all its weird societal and cultural baggage. 

Obviously, alternate history is a crap shoot. I don't know what would've happend, and neither do you. For all we know, the day Germany accepts Frances capitulation some geopolitical tripwire is crossed and the mongolian horde comes out of retirement. That being said, the above points seem like reasonable estimations on how the events triggered by ww1 could've gone differently. No one knew it at the time, but Germany was fighting for the old world. They lost, and here we are. 

I'm sure I could come up with a dozen other reasons, but these are definitely the core of the argument. 

I should add; I'm willing to change my point of view on any specific point, you don't have to take on the whole idea. Maybe you agree with me on israel but think Globalism is the bees knees. If I think your right I'll happily concede a delta, even if I still think a German victory would've been a net positive for humanity."

Here is my own research:

[firmament] Genesis 1.7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 


[firmament] Genesis 1.8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.

[Stationary earth] Psalm 93:1 ‚Äú... the world also is, stablished that it shall not be moved‚Ä¶‚Äù 


Quran

[Firmament and waters above] (2:22) ""It is He Who has made the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy, and sent down water from above wherewith He brought forth fruits for your sustenance.""

According to holy scripture, earth represents the terrain earth and not the planet earth. A plane is flat surface  hence ""flat earth."" The earth has a firmament or dome shaped encasing that connects to it - hence why a rainbow has an arc when light reflects the firmament. We cannot leave the firmament because its impenetrable.

Operation fishbowl proves this when rockets were sent to the firmament and they failed to penetrate it. Also, Wernher von Braun, the creator of NASA and lead rocket developer, quoted a verse about the firmament on his tombstone.
Water exisits on the other side of the firmament which is why the sky is blue. This can also be observed when Elon Musk sent his Falcon 9 rocket into the firmament - causing the rocket to make water ripples in the firmament  as if it were a water boat in the sky. The sun and moon exist inside the firmament and rotate around the stationary earth. "

However, as flawed as it is, it's actually quite generous to the average person that doesn't workout, whilst harsh towards people who rigorously train.

Now, I understand this very common argument that people make: Oh, people who lift weights regularly and eat well for years can gain a lot muscle, and generally professional athletes and muscular people can exceed a BMI of 25 which is ""Overweight"" but still stay lean.

Yes, I agree, those highly muscular athletes, and people who have been going to the gym for years have a lot of muscle mass ‚Äì they can get into an overweight BMI purely from muscle and still stay lean. But, those people are outliers, I am in no way, shape or form referring to them.

Now, moving on to the average person who doesn't workout ‚Äì BMI is actually quite generous in this case.

A lot of average and sedentary individuals have a ""skinny-fat"" body composition, where even if they are a ""normal weight"", they have much lower muscle and much higher fat deposits than they should due to their sedentary lifestyle and bad diets. Infact, the only reason they are not overweight is because they consume a bad diet in reasonable portions ‚Äì which will not exactly make them gain fat, but it will ruin their body composition.

So, for a typical average individual, BMI actually underestimates body fat, as BMI only labels an individual as fat when a BMI rating of 25 is exceeded. There are plenty of average people who don't workout, have a normal weight with a BMI of 22-24, and yet have more than 25%+ body fat if they are male or 33%+ if they're female. 
BMI is generous towards these individuals by labelling them healthy.

Hence, an average person should ideally look to join a gym, eat a high protein diet and get in shape.
If, however, that's somehow not possible or plausible, then they should look to lose weight and get to BMI of 21 or under.


Most people look fairly slim at a BMI of under 21, so the chances of carrying extra fat go down drastically as you get to a lower BMI.

Think about it, if a person doesn't work out ‚Äì has no muscle mass, then how are they ending up at a BMI of above 21? Where is all that weight coming from? If you have no muscle, and you're also lean, then you'd be quite skinny and have a BMI of under 20 or even lower. So, if one has now muscle and yet has an BMI that exceeds 21, then that weight is coming from fat and is very unhealthy.

I would like to hear your rebuttals to ny claim, as I might be wrong, although I am fairly certain that I am not. 

Thank you your comments!"

If we take the UN definition of Genocide, which you can find [Here](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml) we have to conclude that when people say ""Israel is committing genocide"" that they are in essence saying one of the following things:

**A. Israel has been attempting to wipe out all Palestinians for decades**   
**B. Israel has been attempting to consistently kill some Palestinians for decades**  
**C. Israel has been attempting to wipe out all Palestinians since Oct 7th**  
**D. Israel has been attempting to consistently kill some Palestinians since Oct 7th**

I think the first place to start is to review the numbers. There are two sets of numbers we have to review, those regarding the current conflict and some numbers since 1947 which we will use as the starting point for genocides accusations **A** & **B**.

***Oct 7th Conflict***

Hamas states the current death toll as around 35000 or roughly about 1.75% of the total population.  
The population of Gaza being 2 million. Therefore currently a bit over 98% of Gazans currently remain alive according to that number. So the vast majority, but 2% of a population dead in under a year is a big thing. 

So what can we extrapolate from this death toll number based on what we know about the IDF's capability. The thesis being *if* **C** *then* the IDF will be maximising the death toll.

Firstly Israel has the military capability to nuke Gaza, but more importantly they have enough conventional ordinance to do as much damage as nuke on Gaza would do. In fact they have dropped more than twice the explosive equivalent of the two nukes dropped on Japan and more than the combined bombings of London, Hamburg and Dresden (See [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chomsky/comments/1dae1v9/israel_has_dropped_over_70000_tons_of_bombs_on/#lightbox))

- The combined death toll of the initial explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki was between 60,000 & 80,000

- The combined death toll of the bombings of  London, Hamburg and Dresden was around 115,000 (giver or take a couple thousand)

Gaza city specifically has a population of 590,481 and was the most densely populated part of Gaza. It was significantly more densely populated than both the cities in Japan and was more densely populated than London, Hamburg and Dresden. These facts force a couple of points to be conceded. 

1. Israel's bombing campaign had it been indiscriminate should have killed 200,000+ people at a minimum (calculated from doubling the combined deaths of the bombing campaigns referenced above)
2. Therefore Israel's bombing campaign has been targeted and intentionally minimising casualties 

So this on its on disqualifies **C.**   
  
To disqualify **A** we can take the answer above, but we then need to also add the question has Israel had this ability to kill most Palestinians for decades? 

1. The answer to this is un-controversially yes. here are the reasons.   1. The IDF occupied the Gaza strip from 1967 - 2005. at any point during this period they could have culled or expelled the population as they had the man power and military ability
2. In 1967 the Gazan population was around 400,000, by 2024 it is over 2,300,000
3. Under Israeli rule of Gaza not only was no attempt to wipe out the population made, but in fact the population ballooned. 

So now clearly **A** and **C**  are disqualified. It is abundently clear that israel is not currently and has not previosuly  attempted to wipe out all Gazan Palestinians.

Now for **B** & **D** I have the immediate issue with them being far to loose in definition, so much so that almost any conflict ever could be explained as a genocide. As most conflicts include an attempt to kill a part of a group. So I think describing it in this way is redundant and not worth taking seriously. However I can see one potential argument here. ""Israel wants wo wipe out a portion of the Palestinian population in hopes that they will flee the land an Israel can take it over""

So a **B** or **D** in order to commit the main goal of ethnic cleansing. 

I believe **B**  is easily dismissible on the basis that Israel had the Gaza strip, as stated above they occupied it from 1967-2005 and then they gave it willingly to the Palestinians. The actions of Israel contradict the idea of wanting to land grab and ethnically cleanse then.

However perhaps **D?** Maybe they regret giving up Gaza and now, after Oct 7th, they have decided they hate Palestinians so much that they want to get rid of them and take the land for Israelis. Honestly I am unable to disprove this one. I am just also unable to prove it and I don't think there is nearly enough evidence to conclude it.   
  
People point to some examples but I find they generally come up short. 

For example ""Genocidal Statements by Israeli officials"" are exaggerated

0,2024-06-13,"CMV: With non-cis identities amongst Gen Z at ~6%, the ""Left Handed Prevalence Theory"" explanation is no longer convincing.",u/Rwandrall3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1detzni/cmv_with_noncis_identities_amongst_gen_z_at_6_the/,changemyview,"A couple starters to try and weed out the usual suspects:

* Trans women are women
* Gender is a social construct
* The Patriarchy must be dismantled, by violence if necessary
* Non-binary identities are valid

Hopefully that sets the scene a bit. 

So, a lot of people around me have been coming out as trans or non binary. I was curious about how often that happens. I found [this ](https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2023-05/Ipsos%20LGBT%2B%20Pride%202023%20Global%20Survey%20Report%20-%20rev.pdf)survey that states that 6% of Gen Z identifies as non-cis (non-binary, trans, etc. If there is a better umbrella term let me know). Meanwhile AFAB people identify [twice as much](https://news.gallup.com/poll/611864/lgbtq-identification.aspx) with these identities as AMAB, so roughly 10% of Gen Z AFAB people would identify as non-cis. 

A common explanation for more people identified with these identifies I see around is the ""Left Handed Prevalence Theory"", referencing the fact that the percentage of left handed people seemed to increase exponentially, to plateau around 10%, but actually it was just people being ok coming out as their authentic left-handed self.

The percentages are pretty comparable - 6% (10% for AFAB) compared to 10% of people being left handed.

So there¬¥s two possibilities: 

* 6-10% of people were always wrong with the wrong gender identity, living their whole lives without being able to express their true gender. For reference that would mean 4-5 US Presidents were actually not men, for example. It would mean something like 800 million people currently around the world are trans or non-binary but unable to express it, the population of Europe and the US combined.
* The ""Left Handedness Prevalence Theory"" is not a satisfactory explanation when it comes to explaining how many people are identifying with these identities.

0,2024-06-13,CMV: A 'Civil Service Hunger Games' might be a better selection process than the current selection process for civil servants,u/Cheemingwan1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1deu020/cmv_a_civil_service_hunger_games_might_be_a/,changemyview,"Okay, you know how civil servants are selected through appointments, elections (in the case of those in political office) and job interviews. The trouble with those methods is that they tend to breed an old boys network that tends to cover up misdoings in exchange for promotions (which are also self-selecting as well) and elections both tending to both divide the people and well, not to mention how vulnerable it is to money politics in the backroom.

I was thinking, rather than appointment, interviews or elections, in the civil service, we do a Hunger Games style selection where we have randomly selected tributes/schmucks (per GRC/state/town/city/district/state ) to compete in a Hunger Games like selection process where they are randomly given the most difficult tasks for a job  and the persons remaining getting the job.

Something like this. ""Tributes to the DMV. Here's a line of highly aggressive Karens waiting for you to process their forms. May the odds be in your favor."" or ""Tributes to the LAPD, here are your pistols, badges and uniform. We're bringing you into gang territory and we expect you to take down this gang in their turf without any backup. May the odds be in your favor.""

Political office like governors/mayors and the President/Prime Minister (depending on where you live) together with sheriffs/police chiefs and their assistants (if applicable) could do gladiatorial contests to the death a la the actual Hunger Games with the last person standing getting the job. Oh, and those guys have to still stand for reelection at the end of their term or they'll be booted out of office and a new selection will take place

It gets rid of networking and test if they are actually capable of doing the job. Moreover, the gladiatorial and various contest to select our civil service will provide entertainment for our masses. 

How to prevent people with diplomas or degrees from dominating in the selection process? Make sure that the jobs they are assigned to are way outside said qualification such as a law degree holder being assigned as a tribute for a surgeon in a hospital.

There are protests and activism that intend to improve the system, and make a country MORE democratic. For example, the [Woman's Suffrage](https://www.britannica.com/topic/woman-suffrage) movement.

This is not the kind of activism I'm referring to.

Alright, time to engage in something that I'm sure will blow up violently in my face! I've held this opinion for a while and I'd really like to change it to solve some moral panic xD

I'm a Canadian, who looks south and thinks the revocation of Roe vs. Wade was distressing, and supports a general lifting of restrictions on abortion. I have this view because of a couple points:

- I severely doubt that most pro-life policies are genuinely out of ethical concern given the strong evangelical lobby, and I'm concerned with how that might be abused to oppress women. If abortion is morally evil, that disproportionately affects women, which is innately unfair - I don't think this is really an argument against that stance but rather a reason why I wouldn't want it legally implemented in a society with such precarious women's rights at the moment.

- Cognitive dissonance from pro-life policies. Supporting rape exceptions, for example, seems silly if you consider a fetus a person; we don't allow circumstances like these to justify murder in any other analogous situation/hypothetical. Also using the death penalty, which I would find almost hilariously ironic if it wasn't a serious position held by many pro-life people.

That said, I can't help but think there is very little good reason to be pro-choice in a world where (especially) women's rights were more well fortified. A few more points here:

- Passing through a birth canal seems like such an absurdly arbitrary point to declare that a person comes into being. I've considered that all points are some level of arbitrary (imo conception is for example), but either brain function or simply viability outside the womb seem to be more concrete choices. Thus I'm inclined to believe that yes, there is a ethical loss in killing a fetus that could be similar to a person. I'm even more inclined to believe this because of the huge degree of emotional affection when one first hears their child's heartbeat, or grief caused by miscarriages. Parents of children often treat the fetus as their baby on its way; and indeed, why shouldn't they? Is there a compelling reason why it isn't exactly that? Human intuition seems to match this presumption fairly well.

- Bodily autonomy (violinist, etc) always seemed to be a weak argument to me. I'll assess it under the assumption that a fetus is a person, because its aim seems to be to demonstrate the ethicality of abortion regardless. In that case, I see a few problems. Firstly, the majority of women who get abortions are (to my knowledge) not being raped nor coerced/manipulated into unprotected sex. It's an important issue and not a small minority, but I find it kind of tangential here; we don't permit murders in cases even where the victim is abusive to the perpetrator. Secondly, pregnancy is nonpermanent and - with exceptions in which I'd freely support abortion - doesn't result in serious, permanent bodily harm. Unlike the violin case, there is a set end date, after which I see no ethical reason why the child should not simply be put in foster care. Obviously our society makes that a terrible fate (hence why I am broadly pro-choice) but that just seems far better an outcome ethically. If the violinist needed to be attached for 40 weeks and then I'd be free again, would it really be fair for me to cut his life support out?

I apologize if this seems too clinical/theoretical, I understand (especially in the modern day) how emotionally distressing either side of this is. Hopefully some good conversation can be found."

I‚Äôve been thinking about this semi-regularly over the last few years and want to test the theory on the rocks of debate I suppose.

Let‚Äôs start by defining an open relationship.
In my view an open relationship is when two people decide that they want to include more people in their personal and intimate lives by either both dating a new third partner or either of the partners in the original relationship finding another partner to date separately. 

In my view this is always gunna lead to major problems if not outright separation.

How?
Well I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious. People aren‚Äôt perfect and strong emotions like love are very complicated. Introducing ancillary factors into a relationship causes problems by bringing about jealousy, resentment, isolation etc etc.

Anecdotally I‚Äôve seen it done probably 5 times in my life and every time it‚Äôs lead to divorce.
I‚Äôve been introduced into one when I was exploring tinder and my best friend met his now exclusive wife after her ex husband opened the relationship.

It always seems like these things start more or less because one partner is either already cheating or wants to cheat without the consequences or wants to leave their partner in the wings in case their new pursuit falls through. Almost inevitably the partner that doesn‚Äôt initially want to open the relationship moves on with someone after realizing how shitty their original partner is.

I don‚Äôt think non-monogamous relationships can truly work. Being with one person in a lifelong commitment is a very serious thing to do and to introduce extras into that for the sake of fun seems kind of demeaning to that commitment. "

Imagine you're a programmer living in India, living in Mumbai. In Mumbai you can earn 1000 USD a month after tax and basic living expenses (excluding rent). In San Francisco, you can earn 5000 USD a month after tax and basic living expenses. The question I ask, how much more are you willing to pay for your rental in San Francisco then you would pay in Mumbai? The answer would be: a number close to but not exceeding 4000 USD. So long as your rent is under 4000 USD, the move will improve your lot in life. Of course it's troublesome to move halfway around the world, so you might not trouble to move unless the gain passes a certain amount, let's say for this example 1000 USD. That means the rent that a particular programmer in India is willing to pay to live in San Francisco is 3000 USD. That means, without any restrictions, programmers will keep leaving Mumbai and moving to San Francisco until the difference in price between the two to rent an equivalent apartment in the two cities is 3000 USD.

Speaking more generally, in a world with stark differences in wealth between different countries and cities, people will move from the poorer regions to wealthier ones, and the people moving from those poorer regions will be willing to pay high housing costs in the destination in order to move. This means existing residents will have to be willing to pay the same rents as those new residents in order to be able to continue to live in their city. This is how a teacher in [San Francisco ends up driving for uber or living in their cars](https://projects.sfchronicle.com/2016/teacher-pay/), they have to compete for their housing ""slot"" with a programmer from India who's willing to pay 3000 in rent to access the higher salary he couldn't in his home country.

I'd like to pre-empt a few arguments:  
Q: You're only looking at the demand side, what about supply? You can just build more housing to lower prices.  
A: This certainly helps, but the cost of migrating is significantly lower(and faster) then the cost of building housing in a wealthy city. The cost to build a single apartment might be 400,000 USD. The cost to immigrate is only 10,000 USD. Immigration will always outpace housing construction.  
Q: But if large numbers of people immigrate, won't jobs run out?  
A: [Immigrants don't steal jobs](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/do-immigrants-steal-jobs-from-american-workers/). In fact, the opposite is likely the case, immigrants tend to start more businesses on average and will likely make their destination city wealthier, making it even more attractive to immigrate to.   
Q: Why wasn't there high rents in the mid 20th century when the world was even more unequal?  
A: There are a few reasons: 1. immigration restrictions were much higher back then. 2. It was much more expensive to immigrate (EG flying even short distances was the preserve of the super rich), and the poorest regions were so poor that few could afford even the cost of migrating. Ironically as the developing world develops it becomes easier for people to afford to migrate. 3. Building housing was unusually easy due to the invention of the motor car opening up vast amounts of land around wealthy cities for the construction of suburbs. Today, almost all of those suburbs have been built out, and building housing quickly and easily in this way is no longer possible.

Q: You're oversimplifying, there's many more reasons a person might migrate then just money.  
A: This is true. But you can add all those factors together to calculate how much more they value living in a distant location then their current one. EG, let's say I work in Lieges, earn 2000 Euro there, and I'm offered a job in Lisbon that pays 3000 Euro. The combination of better weather, nicer architecture and better public transit and other infrastructure might mean that I'm willing to pay 1500 more euro in rent in Lisbon then I am in Liege, even though the job only pays 1000 euro more. If there are enough similar people like me, the rent in Lisbon will end up becoming 1500 euro higher then in Liege. 

I'd like to be proven wrong, as otherwise I think immigration is very much a good thing, not only that, I've migrated several times myself, and my parents met via immigration."

So like White > Asian > Brown > Black or Straight > Bi > Gay or Man > Women > trans. Christianity > Judaism > Islam. The left from my observation will basically always try to tip the scales towards the one with the most assumed oppression at all times.

In another post in /r/askaLiberal asking about principles the left has I referenced this and everyone said the progressive stack wasn't in their values but when exploring their stated values they always capitulated to the progressive stack. For example someone who sad secularism was one of his principles was fine with legal exceptions to laws for Muslims and stated that there wasn't a single time he was against Islam on his secular principle.

I made another post asking about any time they personally opposed the progressive stack on a specific issue or policy, said post was immediately banned and that action all but cemented the progressive stack being their holy cow in my mind. 

I want my view changed because well I'm a centrist and I think there's a lot we need for the left but as long as the progressive stack is their god I don't think the left can have any real world value which leaves us with half measures and half solutions to all our problems."

Therefore, when an employer does a drug testing, we should be measuring how the drug use impacts an employees behavior and psychology.

Drug use demonstrably affects behavior when it interferes with your well-being (i.e. being in good standing with your job). Therefore, it should be normal to do drug tests within a limited scope (not hair samples), to test a person‚Äôs capability to get themselves off any drugs they are on, on command.

Random drug tests may not test this in the same way. If they are too sudden or soon, they do not test a person‚Äôs ability to prevent drug-use from interfering with their work and wellbeing - more so just a person‚Äôs choices to leisurely do drugs (which may or may not affect their work, but you‚Äôd never know).

In a way, this practice might even be a net-positive to society, as this might bring individual‚Äôs awareness to their own chemical/psychological dependencies, rather than just being a ‚Äúgotcha bitch‚Äù scenario."

To start, I believe that in everything, there is a  **Will.** Think of the ""Will"" as a driving force in everything that exists. An energy in everything.

""Will power"" is the manifestation of an individual's will‚Äî It's basically your own force... ***pushing against*** another force(hunger, sex, drugs..etc..)

And *that* is the problem.   

Your Will is one amongst many other wills in the universe.

It's a droplet amongst a sea of many other droplets. So what's the sense in a single droplet trying to move against a current of droplets?  
It's like an ant trying to heft a hippo, an amoeba trying to heft 13000 elephants...
**Your will is moving against the current of other wills!**

One has to understand that will power is at war against even the most seemingly unimportant like cozy weather, the bark of a dog, smoke stinging the nose, a distant giggle sounding like that of an ex... E.g: You've been on a clean no alcohol streak. Then one night, rain patters on your window, like the soft knocks of a lost lover, seducing you into comfort. Hours later, you're slurping the last drop from the bottle... the last drop of your self-pity.. you feel shitty... and collapse into slumber.   

That's the will of the weather against yours,  
and you just couldn't stand. It's not chance nor happenstance. It makes perfect sense you'd fail! In fact we'd be surprised if you didn't. 

The spirit of will power is a solipsistic spirit: it assumes itself to be fighting against nothing but itself. And since it's equal to itself, it thinks the fight to be assured victory. Whilst in reality,  it fights against innumerable enemies.   
It's like the blind folded warrior flailing at nothing, thinking the battle field is empty... while daggers, spears, axes and the wrath of million men are few inches away. "

### The Hidden Data We Generate

We all know that our online activities generate data, but there‚Äôs so much more being collected from less obvious sources:

- **Smart Home Devices**: Thermostats track our temperature preferences, security cameras monitor our movements, and voice assistants record our commands.
- **Wearable Fitness Trackers**: These devices log our steps, heart rate, and sleep patterns.
- **Retail Loyalty Programs**: Stores track our purchasing habits and visit frequency.
- **Public Transportation**: Transit cards and bike-sharing programs collect data on our commuting patterns.
- **Healthcare Wearables**: Devices like glucose monitors and smart inhalers record health-related data.
- **Social Media Interactions**: Platforms analyze our likes, shares, comments, and friend networks.
- **Utility Companies**: Smart meters monitor our electricity, gas, and water usage.
- **Automotive Telematics**: Modern cars track driving behavior, vehicle health, and location data.

### How Much Data Are We Talking About?

The volume of data generated quarterly in the US alone is staggering. Here are some rough estimates:

- **Smart Home Devices**: ~9,001 PB (Petabytes) (source: [Consumer Technology Association](https://www.cta.tech/Resources/Newsroom/Media-Releases/2019/March/Consumers-Want-Privacy-Personalization-with-Smart-H))
- **Wearable Fitness Trackers**: ~3.564 PB (source: [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/612554/us-consumers-use-of-fitness-tracking-devices/))
- **Retail Loyalty Programs**: ~6.534 PB (source: [Colloquy](https://www.colloquy.com/latest-news/study-how-many-loyalty-programs-does-the-average-american-belong-to/))
- **Public Transportation**: ~1,488.267 PB (source: [American Public Transportation Association](https://www.apta.com/research-technical-resources/transit-statistics/))
- **Healthcare Wearables**: ~3.119 PB (source: [Mordor Intelligence](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/wearable-medical-devices-market))
- **Social Media Interactions**: ~5,197.5 PB (source: [DataReportal](https://datareportal.com/social-media-users))
- **Utility Companies**: ~2.376 PB (source: [Smart Energy International](https://www.smart-energy.com/))
- **Automotive Telematics**: ~91.8 PB (source: [Telematics Update](https://www.tu-auto.com/))

Total: Approximately 15,198 PB of new data every quarter.

### Conclusion

The sheer amount of data we generate every quarter is mind-boggling and highlights the enormous value created from our daily activities. With such vast amounts of data, there‚Äôs significant potential to harness this resource for societal benefits. As we as a society discuss economic policies and social programs, understanding and leveraging the value of this data should be a key part of the conversation.

What are your thoughts on how we can better utilize this data for the common good?

Please also take a look at the research papers and not just some knee jerk gut reaction that no one should be paid and no one deserves free money. I'm not arguing for free money per se I'm arguing that companies are making copious amounts of money off our data and we should have a say in that. "

I'm not saying that game sense and positioning doesn't matter at all, they do matter, but without mechanical skill those 2 don't even help if you use them. I would say that mechanical skill is like 80% of the win, 10% is positioning and the last 10% is game sense. Mechanical skill is literally the most important aspect in those kind of games.

It doesn't matter what good high ground or whatever position you stay on if you can't land any shot. Same with game sense, all this knowledge is useless "

0,2024-06-13,"CMV: With the exception of certain circumstances, a fully pro choice mentality is self serving",u/Brickscratcher,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1df68bx/cmv_with_the_exception_of_certain_circumstances_a/,changemyview,"
Let me start off by saying I am decidedly more liberal leaning, and even hold closer to utilitarian/socialist views than to conservative viewpoints, but I just can't get past the glaring ethical dilemma that everyone seems to ignore when it comes to abortion conversations. Id go as far as to say this ethical dilemma almost certainly is what played into the Supreme Courts landmark decision (as well as a bit of shadiness...so I do understand the general negativity regarding the decision, especially as it doesn't ensure proper medical care is still exercised in the appropriate context).

My opinion is that people who are fully pro choice in any situation feel that way due to the natural tendency of our own lives to be the most important to us. That doesn't make these people bad people by any means, it just means (at least to me) they are following a line of logic because it is convenient, not logical.

Before I get into the specific reason I feel this way, let me add a little nuance by saying I think abortion access should always be available in any kind of crisis situation where abortion may be the only way to save the mother from serious harm, should always be available to rape victims, and should be accessible for those under a certain age who likely are under informed or ill equipped to prevent a pregnancy. 

Now, to the meat of the conversation. I know the argument is 'my body, my choice.' But that just doesn't ring true to me when your choice is to remove another body, not yours, from within you. Its a choice that affects two people, not just one. Even if you want to argue that the baby isn't alive for x amount of weeks (my personal stance is that once it resembles a lifeform and not just a clump of cells is probably the point at which it should be considered a lifeform, but this is a philosophical debate that is mostly irrelevant to my point), the fact remains that you are still influencing the rest of its life. Much in the same way you can be charged with a double homicide for killing a pregnant mother. The only reason that is, is because it is easier to swallow where the blame lays, because it is on a murderer, not a mother who just wants a normal life. 

My argument that it is a self serving ideology is based upon the fact that it is *your decision* to become pregnant. I've been having sex for 20 years and never had a baby I didn't want, so you can't tell me you can't control it. You didn't wear a condom? Thats your fault. You can't snuff out a potential life because you made a mistake. You didn't take that pill one day? I bet you would have if the consequence was your life was going to end, not someone else's.

My argument is that the act of conception imbues upon you the responsibility to care for the conceived. At the end of the day, it was your choice to have that baby. I think it is a self serving narrative to expect to have the choice not to have a baby, *again*. You already made that decision, and I don't think you should get the easy way out at the expense of someone else. You may say you can't take away something they never had, but even if that is your opinion you cannot argue they never had the *potential* to live a full life. So regardless, you are taking away from someone else to serve your own needs.

But again, in the exceptions I listed above, I don't think that line of thought holds. 

And I just want to clarify, this isn't an attack on those who are pro choice. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I just genuinely wish to hear how someone who holds that opinion would respond to my stance. I don't view you as less if you've gotten an abortion or wish to, as I try my best not to judge based on complex personal decisions, and even the way I think about it natural survival instincts would tell you to get the abortion if you view it that way, so I can't fault anyone for listening to instinctual reasoning over rationality, or maybe I'm even missing something. Thats why I'm here.

Edit:

I'm not trying to debate anything regarding when/if the zygote/embryo/fetus is 'alive' as I would argue it is still self serving to take away the potential of life in a being that you directly brought into existence in order to make your own life easier. It would be different if we had no control over our own reproduction. Maybe in a different post this specific idea could be discussed. Too much to unpack here, as this is more philospical

Edit: 

This also doesn't apply to third world countries where contraceptives are much more difficult (or illegal) to find. I would group those people in the same category as preteens and adolescents with little to no contraceptive knowledge/access"
1,2024-06-13,CMV: cast iron cookware is overrated and has not a single advantage over stainless steel.,u/Hugh_Jazzin_Ditz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1df69w9/cmv_cast_iron_cookware_is_overrated_and_has_not_a/,changemyview,"Okay, there is one advantage: being cheaper.

""It holds heat better.""

* Cast iron, pound for pound, is not better at ""holding heat"". Aluminum has [twice](https://www.sunrise-metal.com/difference-between-cast-aluminum-and-cast-iron/) the heat conduction of cast iron. So to compensate for cast iron's piss poor heating, you need much more of it. So of course cast iron ""holds more heat"", because there's literally *more* of it.

* Due it having more heat capacity (because you have to use more cast iron to compensate for its weaknesses), it does well with deep frying. The extra heat capacity can ward off the sudden oil temperature dip from adding colder food. But you can solve this problem in other ways like simply having more oil in the non-cast iron pot. Or cooking in smaller batches. 

* Because you need more cast iron to compensate for its poor heating, it makes it heavier. This makes it harder to manipulate and flip on the stove. Cast iron is usually twice the weight of stainless steel. [Did people forget women cook, too?](https://youtu.be/GCRvGl2rVRw?si=wvFlEz7ew-cZaV11&t=152)

""It cooks my steaks so well.""

* Stainless steel heats evenly. Cast iron heats up in spots. [This causes un-even crusting on steaks.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCRvGl2rVRw&t=216s) You need to pre-heat the cast iron in the oven but even this doesn't solve the un-even heating.

* You can't cook everything in cast iron. You can't cook too much acidic food otherwise it'll strip the seasoning. Stainless steel isn't picky.

* Stainless steel cooks the [fastest](https://youtu.be/ov2nI9w2m4w?si=M9FeYia1LgLzYpJe&t=304).

* This taste tester can't even tell the [difference](https://youtu.be/ov2nI9w2m4w?si=Z3Yz0ZwO0w8bQjjE&t=570). Nor [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5m2bfZ8AVs&t=374s).

""Cast iron is will last forever. I can pass it onto my children.""

* Cast iron is brittle. When enough force is applied, it [shatters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOEG_fv0G_c&t=375s), not bends. But obviously, this point doesn't matter for every day use.

* Also, this implies equal quality stainless steel isn't durable which is untrue. I inherited some All Clads and they're still very good.

* Enameled cast iron has the same possibly [toxic qualities](https://youtu.be/TeXObJa4D4k?si=YkcbLGyDRKn4QeQn&t=279) as nonstick. The ceramic coating is delicate which defeats the ""durability"" of cast iron.

""It has that 'old timey, romantic, frontiers settling the west vibe' to it.""

* 100% agreed but 100% irrelevant.

Other points:

* You can't [boil plain water](https://youtu.be/AjSWq11tjGo?si=KM4I6VjylvU9ZoOn&t=88) in it without stripping seasoning. 

* [Extra iron](https://youtu.be/AjSWq11tjGo?si=TM_rbwr7oykEwCj5&t=120) is always released into your food. It's mostly okay unless you have a medical condition.

* The rough bottom may scratch your glass stove top.

* Doesn't change temperatures quickly if you suddenly need it to.

* Retains flavors and odors of previous cooking.

This was my breaking point after using cast iron for years:

* Cast iron is a princess. You can't be too rough cleaning it with harsh soaps or a Brillo. And when you're done, you have to dry it immediately so it doesn't rust. And forget the dishwasher. 

I've used cast iron for every one of my recipes and not once did cast iron excel over my stainless steel. It only made cooking and clean up more tedious. I also don't know where this idea of taking cast iron on outdoor trips came from. I've always taken my stainless on camping trips. Why use cast iron when stainless steel does everything for less hassle?

Between the weight and the tedious extra maintenance (cooking is already a lot of work), the lack of exceptional performance anywhere, the pickiness of it; it's very hard to ever recommend cast iron unless it's free."

Scalpers do not material affect the supply of products and services since they're almost never able to buy a majority of the supply (thereby avoiding a monopoly situation which would certainly be bad) and they're highly motivated to sell their supply and don't often get stuck with it (if they do, they've likely lost money and won't be able to continue operating like that for long).

3. Scalpers provide economic value by increasing the price of products and services to be closer to their true market value (the equilibrium price). This decreases demand and allows those who truly value the product or service or have more money available to purchase it.

4. There is no clear distinction between scalping, reselling, arbitrage, or any other type of market activity where someone purchasing a product or service from one market and sells it to another. Scalping just seems worse than the others because its less official we feel the lower prices are easier for us to obtain if not for the scalpers.

5. For items with limited supply there will always be a trade-off between price and availability. While we would all love to be able to attend a mega-popular concert for a low price, it simply isn't possible and thus if prices are set too low tickets will be unavailable for many people. Unavailability can be addressed via lotteries, first-come first-serve, or a variety of other contest like methods. So far, I have yet to see a truly ""fair"" contest and thus it is my view that these methods aren't more fair than simply raising the price. I would love to hear everyone's ideas for what a fair contest might be.

6. Companies aren't that motivated to prevent scalping because scalpers provide a convenient scape goat for them. Their products and services are being scalped because they didn't do a good job pricing them. That isn't to say pricing things accurately is easy, it's very hard to predict how much demand your product or service will command and marketing material has a lot of inertia once it's out there. Nevertheless, when their product or service has been priced too low scalpers will handle sales at higher prices for them which helps ensure their products sell out completely while the scalpers deal with the brunt of the customer's frustration and abuse (since nobody likes prices rising last minute). The frustration with scalpers also helps drive demand for their product or service.

7. The best way to get rid of scalpers is for companies to raise their prices and for people not to hate them for it.

The main counter-points to the above that I acknowledge going in are:

1. Scalpers can materially affect demand which is bad. Fair enough! Bubbles and crashes, pump and dumps, or even just popularizing niche products and services to a larger market are all frustrating to deal with. However, this starts to overlap heavily with marketing in general (some of which is certainly shady), and customers who get caught up in FOMO and these kinds of frenzies aren't blameless either. I don't believe that banning scalpers would prevent these issues, though I would agree that they are more likely to occur where scalpers are present.

2. Methods of dealing with low availability of supply like lotteries and first-come first-serve are more fair than high prices. This is subjective I suppose, but as I mentioned above, I have yet to see a contest I consider more fair and thus it is my view that these methods are less fair than simply raising the price. Likely those who have money will feel higher prices are more fair and those who don't will feel contests are more fair. "

I am going to focus on the UK as that where I am from but I think the principle applies to all countries. 

In the UK the Mean amount a primary school child gets for education is ¬£7500 but the Median is ¬£4165. This is because a small percentage of children take up a massive amount of the resources with 121 aid, specialized education ect. 

17% of UK children have special education needs and of those one quarter of these have a educational plan  which have significant additional costs.  

The nature of these educational Needs is that these people will go straight onto benefits when finishing schools. 

If you pretty much ignored these children and just ""looked after"" rather than teaching them you would release a significant amount of funding for the rest of the children.

More funding could be allocated to ""normal"" children increasing the countries educational standard and therefore our economic output down the line.

In the 90s up through the 2010s, I was an advocate and participant in Pride marches and AIDS Walk, working to achieve rights for same sex couples and acceptance of the LGBT community. Many of those battles have been won; same sex marriage is protected by law, people can be openly gay in the military and so much inclusion has happened in our society (there will always be pockets of haters or non-accepting sorts. That's reality).

But then a strange thing started happening. Identity started to seep it's way into the fold. People started creating new definitions for themselves and began modifying pronouns to disassociate themselves from gender norms. To me, non-binary and gender queer is the equivalent of Metrosexual. It's a made up thing that associates itself with a movement out of a need for attention rather than a real fight for equality. I can recall many friends in the 90s being ""fashionably gay"" because of the outpouring of acceptance and community that was created in that time. However, the first time they had a gay experience, they became acutely aware of their sexuality. This led to metrosexuals in the early 00s which, I think, largely fizzled out.

Non-Binary or the alphabet soup after LGBT is people looking to define their own identity, whereas everything before deals with sexuality and the fight for equivalent rights. These identities seek to define and categorize an individual outside of traditional gender norms, but are independent and largely irrelevant to the sexuality of the individual (as they will fall into LGB). I'd even go so far as to say it's harmful to the LGBT crowd, as one can argue that it's a choice; it's not a choice to be gay, nor a choice to have gender dysphoria,  but it is a choice to identify as non-binary, or use animal/gender non specific/made up pronouns. Rue Paul is gay, but chose to dress and present feminine. 

I'm open to have my opinion changed and would welcome discussion. At the end of the day, all people have a right to live a life that brings them joy, provided it doesn't harm others. I'll use a person's preferred pronouns because it costs me nothing but a little extra mental energy. But in the end, I feel it's actually harmful to the LGBT community. "

* they don't have food, but yet
   * they live next to big forests which are full of moos, dear and various birds, which they could hunt.
   * they don't even try to keep chickens, goats, cows or lambs which they could easily do, which would provide them with all the food they would need. 
   * they don't seem to even try to garden anything, which would seem like the easiest thing to do.
   * they don't collect berries nor mushrooms, which I bet the forest is full off. 
* they don't have firewood, but yet 
   * they live next to a huge forest in the middle of nowhere, so they could just shop down trees and get all the wood they need.
* they live in a poor quality house, but yet
   * they again live nest to a huge forest full of good quality wood they could use to make their house better, but for some reason they just don't do this. 

So due to these reason, I think they are just lazy. 

Like I have relatives who also live in very remote area in my country, and it seems like they have more of everything than me who lives in a city, since 

* they hunt and have plenty of meat always available 
* they collect berries and mushrooms, and make all kinds of foods from them
* they garden and seem to have plenty of stuff from there too
* they heat their house with wood which the get free from their forest

Like CMV if you disagree, but at the moment I just think that these people are just lazy. 

Like I somewhat get the poor old widow women who obviously can't do much physical labor and hence might not be able to get wood or hunt, but other than that, I just can't understand how one can live next to so rich resources and not have basic needs. 

Also, with ""poor"" I don't mean money, but the lack of food and necessities. Like obviously money doesn't grow in trees, so I get that they might not have money, but the fact that they don't have anything just baffles me."

Long story short, he was a top basketball player.  Was accused of rape (Which sounded fishy in the first place, as it was supposedly on a dancefloor at a crowded bar).  he was suspended, then reinstated as part of a lawsuit.  When he was allowed to play, plenty of news outlets discussed the accusation.  Plenty of talking heads had opinions on whether he should or shouldn't be allowed.   He had to endure ""No means no"" chants the remainder of the season. 

Was found not guilty, and a lot of the case just seemed like a sham.  At one point, the defense showed texts from the girl to her friend where the ""alleged victim"" sent the ESPN story, and her friend replied ""got em"" with smiley face dollar sign emojis.   Even the DA, his argument boiled down to no real evidence, just that ""he is the big man on campus and is used to getting what he wants, so its most likely that he did this""

And yet, I have a feeling that, even though ESPN did eventually put up a story (the verdict was out for hours before), there will not be nearly as much discussion, press, tweets by journalists, etc.   And ESPN is far from the only culprit.   By all metrics, he should've been named All American, but the writers didn't want to put him on because the trial was pending.

I feel that corporations should be required to dedicate the same amount of time to discussing this.   Because what usually happens is that there is a tiny fraction of the time spent clearing his name as there is slandering it.  And that just isn't right.   Yeah, you can't do anything about the fan bases, or random people on twitter.  But news organizations should have a higher standard.

0,2024-06-13,CMV: A Semi-Constitutional Monarchy Is Superior to Republics And Almost All Anti-Monarchist Arguments are Devoid of Reason or Actually Truth.,u/SonoftheVirgin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dfeqvc/cmv_a_semiconstitutional_monarchy_is_superior_to/,changemyview,"First, I'd like to point out that I am American who became a monarchist over time, so I hope that adds to my validity

Before I begin, please allow me to clarify what a ""semi-constitutional"" monarchy is. There are 2 types of monarchy...

1. absolute monarchy: a monarchy where the monarch has *de facto* unlimited power, a hereditary autocracy. Most monarchies were once this up until the 1800s.

2. Constitutional monarchy: a monarchy where the monarch has *de facto* limited power, usually in the context of being limited by a constitution and sharing power with other branches of government. This can range from being limited but still the most powerful branch of government, such as Kuwait, to having considerably power, such as the Princes of Liechtenstein or Monaco or the King of Morocco, or a near or complete figurehead, such as Malaysia and Japan, respectively.

However, since the most famous constitutional monarchy, the United Kingdom, has a figurehead monarch, the term slowly came to also mean a figurehead monarch. So the term *semi-constitutional monarchy* was coined to distinguish between a monarch where the monarch has limited power but isn't powerless and a monarchy where the monarch is a figurehead.

So, back to my argument: why do I believe this? Why do I believe such an outdated and old system should be given more credit than it is given?

Well, my first reason is that almost none of the arguments against monarchy actually hold weight. They are just lies that have been repeated so many times that people don't even question them. For example...

***Monarchies are just dictatorships and they are built on oppression:*** this argument displays ignorance of history or even basic human nature. As I stated above, a (semi)-constitutional monarch has limited power, just like any president. Even if all monarchs were autocrats, that would still not mean that all monarchies are dictatorships. Just like presidency's, it depends on the person, not the position. And if the monarch shares power with other branches, that means it will be harder for them to act tyrannically, due to separation of powers.

***Just because your parent was a king doesn't mean you will be a good one:*** This argument has a slight grain of truth. Yes, the talents of your parents do not instantly transfer into oneself. However, inheriting a position does automatically not mean one will be incompetent at it, either. Does anyone say that about inherited wealth or companies? Also, if one has parents who are good at something, that means that there is a good chance they will teach you all they know before you take their place. It is not ensured, and there should be a way to replace a bad prince with one of his relatives if he is incompetent, but it means their is a chance. If one is taught by his mom and dad, the people who love him most, to . A monarch has to do that to his/her child in order to ensure the continuation of the nation's good.

***Elected officials are chosen for their merit. Republics are more effective:*** This would only be true if humanity was perfect and political parties did not exist. Just because more people voted for someone, it does not mean that person is a Christ-sent angel to rule the people. Neither monarchs or presidents work more efficiently. And people often choose who agrees with them, not who will work more efficiently.

Also, I would like to point out that most constitutional-monarchies have elected officials as well as a king. That means you gain the merits of both democracy (change if necessary, people get what they need) and the merits of monarchy (stability, more neutrality)

***You can't vote out a King:*** No, but you can impeach one. A king can be impeached if he commits bad acts. Also, as I said above, semi-constitutional monarchs share power with elected and unelected officials, meaning that if the king is making a mistake, the elected officials can challenge him. And if the elected officials are doing something wrong, the monarch can challenge them.

***Monarch's did not earn their position! No one elected them:*** This is a misconception that democracy is some infallible god which should always be followed. Democracy is not perfect, even if it is important. And most monarchies these days are established by constitutions written by elected representatives. And there are other sources of legitimacy other than the people, such as Power, God, Culture, Law, or Tradition. I would also like to ask what about ""the will of the people"" instantly means something is bad or good? If the people chose to murder someone, would that be good? If the people voted to exploit a certain group or steal money from the rich, is that alright?

There are many more arguments I could point out innumerable misconceptions and flaws in, but I want to move on. There are several advantages to monarchy I want to share with you, my favorite of which are...

***Stability:*** a semi-constitutional monarchy provides much more stability than a republic. Even a figurehead monarch does. In republics, the leaders are constantly changing, meaning that first this Prime Minister and president are elected, then another PM comes in, then another, then another President....this means nothing stays the same. A monarch stays until or retirement, providing stability. This means that, if combined with the fluidity of a Prime Minister or Chancellor, you again gain the best of democratic and monarchical worlds.

***Neutrality and Unity:*** A monarch can have opinions, too. But since they were not elected, that means they are far more likely to be more neutral politically. The lack of election also causes them to unite the people better. In England, 65% of the population supports their monarchy. That's more than most presidents. And in most other monarchies, it is even higher (in Liechtenstein and Denmark, its over 70% and 80%).

Now, I would like to say that I respect others opinions. But I do think that a parliamentary, semi-constitutional monarchy is the best. What other government provides monarchical stability with democratic change? what real argument is their against a monarch that is not just something people in the media repeat over and over? What other government gives such a new meaning to ""mixed"" government?

If the line were ""5'8, brown eyes"", this still wouldn't fixate on non white men, because white men can also have brown eyes, and often do. The ""blue eyes"" line specifically focuses on white men.

It's a deeply racist standard, that men of color will never meet. 

The 6'5 part is less racial, but was also part of Nazi standards, the tall, blue eyes, forward jaw Aryan ideal, and is still a part of white supremacist discourse.

This issue is not taken seriously.

It denigrates not only men of color, but mostly men of color, as well as others, such as men in general who don't fit into the 0.000001% of men who are 6'5.

Some people might take this as a joke, but the same narrative in repackaged into different terms, videos, posts, all the time on social media, in mainstream trends.

It's hypocritical, because men's struggles are rarely focused on, although racism is always the talk of town.

When it's racism to men, it's not often talked about.

That's my view, which is backed by facts.

The doctor is the one with expertise in this and only their consent along with the child's should be necessary for a medically-necessary treatment of any physiological condition or any psychological illness within the DSM-V or ICD-11. The doctor can determine whether the child understands the risks and benefits on their own. Furthermore, I'd add that this doesn't extend to treatments that haven't been given clinical trials and established by the appropriate governing body and established medical science to be safe for children."

57,2024-06-13,CMV: Is healing the political divide not as complex as we think? But rather just using a big PSA campaign.,u/JamieMackenzie,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dfhejn/cmv_is_healing_the_political_divide_not_as/,changemyview,"¬†So I am a bleeding liberal, living deep in Trump Country. As much as I hate Trump's rhetoric, his \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ phobia rants, and his manipulation of millions of people. I actually really enjoy the people on the conservative side. I still may despise their ""political view"", but as the whole, complex, person they are, I like them. I like their hobby and interests, their care for their community members, their good manners and kindness to anyone on the street. I generally like more ""conservatives"" than I dislike.

And call me crazy, but that is how I feel. I truly believe we have more in common than we have different.

The problem I forsee, is that media and social media make us so tribal, instead of listening to what the ""other"" person truly has to say, we instead watch media to hear what the media people have to say about what ""they said"" , which is usually out of context creates a negative perception of the ""other"". So it is not a dislike in the actual person we think they are, it is a disliking of our perception of that person and what we think they stand for, which was influenced by media.

So, I am not the genius for knowing its the media that's the problem, I can give two shits actually if media continues to have influence. That's because my solution is simpler than regulating, canceling, or silencing media.

Post 1950's, people started earning more money, they were moving to the suburbs, and started going into their homes that had a nice tv set, tv dinners, but even better, a private fenced-in back yard with a porch and a grill. Where people after a long day of work could enjoy a drink and some peace and quiet.

However, back before the 1950's, most houses that were constructed had obviously no TV's and instead they had a front porch. And even though many of us would think we would enjoy the peace and quiet of a back porch over a front porch, according to science, we're wrong.

You see as people we actually find it more enjoyable to be around people, even if we think we like being by ourselves more (check out the Epley¬†and Schroeder Mistakenly Seeking Solitude Study). So, to improve our well-being sitting on a front porch is better than being on the back porch. And just environmentally, the front porch sets us up for more personal interactions with people walking on the street, sitting next to neighbors on their front porch, or watching the neighborhood kids play together in the street.

At that time, even if people pre-1950's didn't realize it, they were having real human interaction that people in 2024 would crave to have. They had a real sense of community. It was when people came together in real challenging times, they celebrated in all the good, and most days they where having just an average day shooting the shit. People were allowed to be human, with no expectations or desire for social media likes.

So my very a-political fix to a very politically divided country is to have a big PSA event where we advocate for people to just simply sit on their front porch. And over time... people once again will start talking, in person, to their neighbors, about life, family, jobs, and yes maybe even a hard conversation about differences. However, this time around, there will actually be respect for the ""other ""person.

This might sound like a pipe dream, but at the end of the day it could be a rather helpful piece in a very hard situation. This divide won't be fixed by the election, but who knows, maybe you can help start a movement by just sitting on your front porch. CMV"

0,2024-06-14,"CMV: On the topic of male rapists and feminists' attempts to demonize men because of so-called ""rape culture,"" I do not agree with the slogan ""It's all men until it's no men."" However, rapists are much more prominent than 0.5% of the population.",u/acerthorn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dfjcz8/cmv_on_the_topic_of_male_rapists_and_feminists/,changemyview,"MRAs often argue that it's an infinitesimal percentage of men who commit sexual assault. To support this fact, MRAs often point out that only about 3/4 of a million sexual assaults occur each year (at least those that are reported). However, considering that there are over 165 million men in the USA, that amounts to less than half a percent of all men, and that's assuming that each SA case was perpetrated by a different man.

Here is just one video out of countless videos that advoate this point: https://www.tiktok.com/@squirrellygirl1088/video/7368271645305326891

However, I've noticed a problem with that logic: You only consider SA cases that were reported in the most recent year for which full statistics are available. Only one year's worth of SA are counted.

This, in my opinion, seems egregiously short sighted. Yes, there are some crimes (in fact, most crimes) where, if the crime occurred long enough ago, and there is ample proof that the offender has thoroughly rehabilitated, then he deserves to move on from that part of his life and not have it follow him like a shadow. Rape, however, is not one of those crimes. Once a person is rightfully and justly proven to be a rapist (no miscarriages of justice, no extenuating circumstances, just 100% no doubt that he did it), then he really does deserve to have to live with the nuclear branding of ""rapist"" for the rest of his life. 

In books, movies, and television, this concept is known as the ""moral event horizon,"" a certain line where, once a character crosses that line, he becoems so evil, in the eyes of the audience, that he is effectively irredeemable, and if he were to switch sides and become a good guy, the audience likely would reject him because his past crimes are so heinous. Here is a YouTube video discussing the concept of the moral event horizon: https://youtu.be/lQMzbnnR5cA

Even for the crimes that one can move on from, it still would take a lot longer than one single year for those crimes to be forgotten and ""in the past.""

So I did a little research, and I found this article: https://www.statista.com/statistics/191137/reported-forcible-rape-cases-in-the-usa-since-1990/

That lists the total number of rape cases reported in the USA each year from 1990 to 2022. Remember that each and every one of these cases (assuming the accused party really is guilty) causes the person to carry that label of ""rapist"" for the rest of his life. The men who raped someone in 1990 are just as much of a ""rapist"" in 2024 as those who committed the rape in 2022.

As I add up all the numbers on this chart, I get more than 3.5 million rape cases that have been reported! And that comes out to a hell of a lot more than half a percent of all men!

And remember, that's ONLY the rape cases! There are plenty of other types of sexual assault that don't technically qualify as full-on rape. 

Of course, we also need to consider false rape allegations. However, according to this lawyer who specializes in defending clients against sexual assault charges ... https://www.meltzerandbell.com/news/a-rape-defense-lawyers-advice-for-handling-false-rape-allegations/ ... only about 2% of rape reports are genuinely false. Remember that it takes more than the defendant ultimately being exonerated for the allegations to be considered ""false allegations."" To be a false allegation, the alleged victim has to be lying. Not just wrong, but full-blown lying. There's a big difference. 

So if only 2% of rape allegatiosn are genuinely false, that leaves us with approximately 3.43 million rape allegationst since 1990 that are still true. With a national male population of 165 million, that amounts to 2% of men who genuinely deserve a lifelong label of ""rapist."" 

Now, at this point, you're probably thinking ""Two percent still isn't all that bad."" However, we must remember that (A) 2% is also the percent of allegations that are false allegations, so it balances out, and (B) again, that's only counting full-on rape, not all versions of sexual assault, so when we tally up all the sexual assaults, regardless of legal classification, the percent of men who are sexual predators will likely skyrocket!

To put this in perspective for you, that example above from SquirrellyGirl1088, there were about 785,000 sex offender convictions last year, but the total number of rapes in 2023 would appear to be somewhere in the ballpark of 100,000 to 150,000, if the statista source is accurate all the way through 2022. So that would mean that rape amounts to only about 1/5 of all sexual asault cases, which means the total number of sexual predators, from 1990 to 2022, probably comes out to a grand total of approximately 17.15 million, aka more than 1 in 10 men who have committed at least one sexual assault in their lives and, therefore, deserve to be permanently branded accordingly.

True, there is the possibility that some men are responsible for multiple instances of rape, but then again, if you're going to assume each rape is form a different man for your statistic that leads you to a third of a percent, then it's only fair that same assumption carries over here. It's not fair to arbitrarily hold different standards when the statistics suddenly don't support your narrative anymore. At that point, you are LITERALLY making up the rules as you go along! 

So while I do not agree with the idea that ""it's all men until it's no men,"" womens' fears are a lot more justified (or at least, a lot closer to being justified) than what the MRAs would have you believe."

But whenever someone gets uncomfortable or offended by swearing (and I mean just normal swearing outside of a workplace, like saying 'shit' or 'ffs' when you're running late or whatever, not calling someone a demeaning name which is obviously offensive), I automatically assume they must be religious. They believe that it's wrong because they believe their religious scriptures say so. (Even though most if not all swear words that exist today weren't around when those texts were written, but that's another matter). However, I have less understanding for someone who doesn't have any religious baggage and yet still gets offended when someone swears (again, using normal swear words that aren't targeted towards a particular person). Like, for what possible reason could you find using 'bad language' offensive? You might prefer not to use that language yourself; I get it. But to get offended by someone else using that language? Why? They're literally just words. I feel like people who get offended by swearing are just virtue-signalers who haven't really thought their own beliefs through. CMV."

I haven't seen my dad in 7 years (2017) and I haven't seen my sisters or my stepmother in 8 years. (2016)

Now, you're probably wondering why I wouldn't want to visit America to see my dad or little sisters.

So instead of giving you twenty paragraphs of text, I'm just gonna give you a full list of bullet points instead to make this easier:

* Since my dad moved from Ireland to America, he's only ever been to Ireland once to visit me and that's about it.

* My dad hasn't made any effort since to visit me in Ireland and has no plans to.

* I've been to America already 3 different times, the first time at 14 in 2013, the second at 15 in 2014 and the third at 17 in 2016. I've seen it and done it all before. I've been to all the ""interesting"" states besides Georgia and Florida. So not really phased by it.

* America is a pain in the ass to visit. I'll need at least 1600 dollars for flights and spending money, ESTAs, etc.

* I don't like Americans in general. (My little sisters and the Beastie Boys are the exception, not the rule.) They're very annoying.

* American culture is stupid in general and I don't like it.

* Despite having so many accents, American voices are ear grating. They can't even pronounce coffee or crayon right. American accents give me a headache.

* Americans get pissy if you have a nuanced opinion on politics. Even if you generally agree with them.

* American conservatives are obnoxious, self entitled, and get offended easily. Being gay I don't feel safe around them.

* American liberals are obnoxious, get offended easily and can never get off their moral high horse.

* Considering I once had to hide in a hotel lobby in Memphis because I thought an irate customer was close to pulling a gun out, I don't feel safe.

* There's a lack of public transport and considering I can't drive, if I have an argument with my dad, I can't just get up and leave like I can in Europe.

* Irish-Americans are everywhere and if they even get the slightest hint that your Irish, they don't fuck off and leave you alone and act like you should be their friend because they're ""Irish too"" (despite the fact that they're not.) and get offended when you point out that they're not Irish.

* My dad lives in one of the cousin-fucker states (Georgia)

* My dad won't even make the effort to see me in Ireland despite my dad being 51, my stepmother being 47, and my sisters being 13 and 15, so nobody's at an age where traveling would be in anyway difficult but expect me to waste my money to see them.

I love my sisters but it genuinely doesn't feel worth it. Everyone tells me that I should make the effort to but honestly, I'm conflicted about it.

So yeah, that's my argument.

I‚Äôll elaborate on why I constantly hate the site of people and noises they endlessly emit. 

First and foremost is our origin: history is not kind. I firmly believe a wrong means could never justify a good end. Slave trades, deforestation, ecological collapse, torture of human and nonhuman animals. We are the product of this behavior. Many social norms and order are built on these terrible practices, as we reap the benefit of sociopathic and ruthless attitudes brought over by colonialists. People often make the mistake of thinking these attitudes have been left in the past or are now only found in the pages of history. In fact, they are simply out of sight, and thus out of mind. They have been amplified by exporting labor to women and children in developing countries. Most developed countries condition citizens to consume at rates that far exceed the wildest dreams of white colonialists. Ironically, we harbor delusions that this level of exploitation is our right, while somehow also trying to cancel individuals who committed wrongs over 2 decades ago. It‚Äôs entirely hypocritical and illogical to say societies are exempt from this cancellation. Will you cancel yourself? 

Individualism: the bread, butter, and dash of petroleum for western societies. A true gem and necessity for colonialists. To think an individual can claim a massive track of land or wealth, and then own it in perpetuity.. it‚Äôs the height of egoism and hubris. Transformed in the modern world, most wealth is in the hands very few, while all the other ‚Äúindividuals‚Äù are reduced down to their prehistoric, early evolutionary state: rats. Scurrying around desperately trying to stay afloat while getting crumbs. Imagine one of those rats in a suit with a slightly larger amount of crumbs.. that‚Äôs the best you‚Äôll amount to with some luck and *hard work*. In the most ironic way, individualism is now the dominate mindset, yet being human has never been so utterly **pointless**, due to collective misdirection.

Pollution: even the most prolific defenders of the biosphere depend solely on its destruction to get their word out. The medium, mostly smartphones, in which their messages reach millions, is laughably unsustainable. Now, if you attempt to change my view on pollution, please only provide sources for further reading. I‚Äôm not interested in your coping mechanisms. It‚Äôs at the point where even our impressive cognition can‚Äôt fabricate a reality in which this level of pollution makes sense. If you find that hard to believe, I suggest getting off social media and picking up a book. This CMV is not for you, which I understand is difficult to hear for hyper consumers, as they‚Äôve been conditioned to believe everything is under their umbrella of hedonism

And finally, the vanished community: what was it like to survive with other humans? Most people work alienating jobs, and they spend their blood money at grocery stores. Incredibly complex supply and distribution chains provide us with the means of survival, and we don‚Äôt depend on our immediate environment/people for anything of substance. This dynamic destroyed solidarity. Coupled with little to no spirituality, as well as the competitiveness of late stage/ monopoly capitalism, people are technically your enemy. They don‚Äôt share your values. They likely see you as a means to an end, yet we are simultaneously told to be tolerant and give respect by virtue of simply being human. It‚Äôs a sadomasochistic world where people tell you one thing and all act entirely different. ‚ÄúSocializing‚Äù is about stroking highly inflated and manufactured egos and then waiting your turn to brag about what product or material currently defines your identity. Interdependence is dead as we have become corporate fodder. 

So tell me how this glass is half full, all while containing water with microplastics and glyphosate in every gulp. With this information alone, I believe it‚Äôs entirely justified to hate most people, whether they are decent or have ‚Äúgood vibes‚Äù, which likely just means they fit your current mode of consumption and the facilitating lingo. 

TL;DR: go somewhere else.

The main reason being is the haggling process, but that is not something I am trying  to discuss here as haggling maybe annoying but there is nothing wrong about it because they have inflated their advertisement price. But I am trying to point out is the opposite case: deflating the advertised price to lure the customers in.

I have seen various bs situations where dealers trying to charge me these mandatory fees in a form of equipment fee, cash purchase fee, inspection fee, warranty, insurance, restoration fee, document fee, certification fee, etc... Not only they are trying to force me into purchase stuff that I do not need, but also, at a price that is multiples of the market price.

Why is this a problem? Imagine walking into a pizza store after ordering a 5.99 large pizza special online. They ask you to pay 1.99 for cooking fee, .75 for oven fee, .65 for restaurant maintenance fee, 3.25 for special garlic sauce fee (which cannot be removed as it is sprayed all over your pizza), 1.25 for quality inspection fee, and 2.25 for credit card fee. Yeah sounds like a bs now right?


Yes, it is a problem because deflating an advertised price is nothing more than a scam to lure the customers to call or even walk into their dealership (even worse, sometimes dealers have a great luck with customers who sign the dotted line without realizing they are Bing charged with a fee). I am not trying to say it is wrong for dealers to charge more for their vehicle. The pricing is entirely up to them. What I am trying to say is they need to be transparent about it by including everything into the advertised price."

I do not see an advantage to it. It seems to be summarizing some popular results. I don't see why that is better than just searching and reading the popular results myself directly from the website. One potential advantage of AI search is convivence, but in its current form it doesn't seem any more convienent than just searching and reading websites in a traditional way. 

AI search has several disadvantages, because I do not know the source of the information. I do not know for example, if information is coming from a paid advertisement. If I am searching for a controversial political topic it is important to understand the biases of the sources. For example, if I am looking for news about Israel/Palestine The Times of Israel, New York Times, and Electronic Intifada will all have a different perspective. An AI search summary obscures the source of the information and hides from the reader any biases in where the information was obtained. 

I am a teacher and my students are already in the habit of just searching google for answers without actually looking at the source where the results came from. For example last year my students did a presentation on the history of a Native American tribe, when it got to the part about the tribe's religious beliefs the kid showed a picture of Vishnu. Obviously the kid had searched ""Indian religion,"" and just picked the first picture. AI search will make these poor media literacy habits worse, leading to adults who are increasingly susceptible to propaganda, fake news, and corporate marketing. "

This assumes these brothels are legal and regulated.

1: It's better for sex workers, being a sex worker can be dangerous but operating in a brothel minimizes that risk. IF you are in a centralized location where people can't see you without being seen by clerks or security then they are probably not going to try to kill or rob you. The kind of people who tend to prey on sex workers tend to be cowardly and rely on controlling the situation, in a brothel they can't control the environment. Compared to being a street walker you don't have to walk around looking for clients they come to you.

2: It's better for clients because while less risky then being a prostitute being a prostitute client also carries risk. The main benefit is access. you don't have to drive around looking for prostitutes that roam, you don't have to go on sketchy websites that might be scams,false adveritising,robberies or even police stings. With a brothel you can just go there pay your money and have your fun.

3: It's better for governments, brothels can generate tax revenue and be made to comply with regulations easier, if they don't then you can just blockade their building and they can't do anything about it.

Everyone has the same right to vote, whether it is a street cleaner or Bill Gates, they all have 1 vote in their hands.



I know that many people will think that this is right and this is the best. However, I would like to share my opinion with you.



For example, if a factory adopts one person, one vote to decide how to distribute this year's profits, what do you think will happen? I can tell you that all the money of this factory will be paid out as wages. Why? Because the workers definitely want to get more wages, and as for the future of this factory, the workers don't care.



So, what will happen if the boss has the final say in this factory? The factory will have a lot of money to expand its scale, and the employees can only get very little wages. Because the boss wants the employees' wages to be as low as possible, so that the factory can continue to grow.



Obviously, both methods are bad. The second distribution method, we all know it is called ""dictatorship"". I won't say much.



And the disadvantages brought by the first method are suffered by Europeans. In many European countries now, once a welfare policy is promulgated, you can never cancel it, even if the country has no money. People in these countries are calling for a higher level of welfare system every day, and no one cares whether their countries can afford it. In order to get votes, politicians can only cater to the voices of these people at the bottom. This is the ""welfare trap""



So, I conceived a brand new political system: how many votes a person has is determined by his contribution to society. For example, if you don't have a job and just stay at home playing games, then you only have one vote, and if you are a person with a legitimate job, you can have one more vote. If your job is meaningful, such as a teacher, doctor, etc., you can have more. If you have made a great contribution to the country, such as the CEO of Nvidia, then you will have a lot of votes.



Of course, the specific number of votes needs further research, but this is generally the case with this system.



This system can effectively dilute the impact of the number of people, prevent the elite from suffering political losses due to the small number of people, and prevent those who are lazy from getting what they don't deserve by relying on the number of people."

I've noticed increasing hostility towards white people in America, often from other ethnic groups blaming whites for their issues. While I acknowledge historical injustices, the current climate seems to foster a blame culture targeting white individuals based on their race. This is opening the gate to a new form of racism where other races feel like it is okay to treat white as inferior due to a growing victim mentality. essentially, we are replacing the racism of the past for another in the present, this time towards whites. 

I believe this trend hinders true equality.

Other points:

1. **Media**: Often portrays white people as inherently privileged and oppressive without considering individual circumstances.
   
2. **Academia and Corporations**: Diversity and inclusion programs sometimes imply that white people must atone for collective guilt.

3. **Social Movements**: Some movements generalize blame towards white people, affecting their broader acceptance.

4. **Pop Culture Quotas**: Including minorities through quotas can feel like tokenism and pandering rather than genuine representation.

I'm open to having my view changed. let‚Äôs keep it civil.

There are plenty of very smart and driven children out there and we still treat them based on their chronological ages, even if we might call them ""old souls"". There are also many elements of the worldbuilding which contradict the narrative. For example he is actually about the same chronological age as Roxy, or a bit younger. 

  
He's not the best person, but he certainly develops in a positive direction and never really does anything that bad, especially if you think of him as being his chronological age. I personally do not think he is a hero, at least not where I am so far, but having kind of unflattering thoughts and acting as a normal guy trying to live your best life really is not a problem. Nobody in our world will look at such a person with a high intelligence and shameful past life memories particularly negatively."

I see a VPN service being promoted, promising security, privacy and access to region-restricted content. I am saddened for I believe VPN providers are dubious and promoting them is not moral.

Virtual Private Networks are used all the time by businesses. They allow remote work, secure access to company servers and connect multiple company sites. This is of course a legitimate and useful service. I'm not referring to that at all.

VPN providers are also used by individuals. Instead of connecting the user to virtual network, they simply re-route all the internet traffic through their servers. Taken at face value this promises a few advantages:

* security - all the traffic is encrypted and anonymized.
* privacy - in addition to above, all traffic is addressed to the VPN provider. This keeps the list of sites visited a secret.
* content unlocking - a lot of streaming services limit content to specific countries. By re-routing your traffic through another country you can fool the sites into letting you access content you normally couldn't.

I believe that these advantages are mostly a sham, have much superior alternatives and support piracy.

* Security & Privacy - The entity with best access to your traffic is your internet service provider. They can collect information and use it against you. Using a VPN simply means there's now someone else you trust your data with. Maybe they are in another country with different laws. Maybe they promise they keep no logs of your activity. It's still based on trust - they have the same power of you as your ISP has.
* Content unlocking - This is a clear violation of the TOS of the provider. I don't see how this is different than piracy. Even if I accept it to be legal, it is at the very least dubious.

Security & Privacy alternatives: Every site you access should be used with https. I also suggest using an encrypted DNS service such as 1.1.1.1. If that's not enough for your use case, then you should use TOR. If TOR is not sufficient abandon all hope.

To be clear, I don't think VPN providers are doing anything illegal. I'm not advocating to shut them down. I'm not calling them out for fraud or anything like that. I just think that advertising them is pretty negative.

It kinda sucks seeing a creator I appreciate promote these, please change my view."

When I was growing up my parents were horrible to me, completely physiological and physical abuse. My mother has beaten me on many occasions, my father encouraged it. The worst was she almost took half of my ear off, as the years went by they started becoming more and more hateful people and extreme conservatives. Believe any anti-covid conspiracy and anti-vaccine bullshit, you name it, they believe it. 

This all came to a boiling point when I was going to college and because I told them I would be getting vaccinated against COVID because here, at the time (2021) it was a requirement to go. Their response was to kick me out, with almost nothing. All I had left was a bag of clothes and my guitar I had to fight to even grab off them. I was lucky to have people I could couch surf with, I had to dropout because I had no money as well as the loan system wouldn't help me because I was homeless. I finally got my own apartment after 10 months of struggling, I still live there now and my job is stable.

My point is, why should I be thankful that my parents hurt and abused me? Why should I thank them for giving my c-PTSD and I have to be in therapy forever to get over all the constant abuse. The endless adverts on radios, TV, etc on how great mom's/dad's are hurt the most. They make me feel worthless, like I deserved all that endless pain and torture. Over a year in therapy and this still hasn't gone away and it only makes worse on those days. It makes me rage in anger others can even be thankful, or the idea I'll never get what others easily get so simply. 

That's why I believe they're horrible holiday's, all they do is remind people who've been abused by good for nothing piece of shit as parents all their abuse. It re-opens wounds, night-terrors, spiraling. Reminders that I had to be abused. The constant praising everywhere I go, telling me I have to be happy that they existed to simply hurt me. I don't know if anyone would relate to this at all, or call me an idiot. But yeah, I hate these holidays and I generally things about families because all families have done is kick me to the curb (literally). I wish they simply didn't exist so I would stop feeling like shit constantly when they pass by every year."

So why on earth are gas stations enabling that behaviour by essentially selling drivers something they can easily use while already driving a vehicle? If you are at a gas station you are most likely gonna be driving a vehicle and CONTINUE to drive after you leave. So why are gas stations selling beer, wine bottles and more to drivers who enter it while filling up their cars?

When someone is trying to stop smoking you don‚Äôt sell them cigarettes. When someone is trying to stay away from drugs you don‚Äôt sell it to them. So why are gas stations selling something that can increase the chances of someone drink driving? It should be illegal.

a.) your responsibility

 b.) you've done anything wrong.

We all know that kiling someone in self defense is a legal nightmare that can potentially destroy your life. You never know if you're going to become the next celebrity self defense shooter like George Zimmerman. And if that happens your chances of getting a fair trial drop to near zero.

If you kill a scumbag, you should be able to walk without notifying anyone. It is law enforcement's responsibility to determine how somebody died and whether or not they were murdered or killed in defense. If it was determined that their ass was rightfully dusted, then case closed, they get ground in to puppy chow and their family is hit with a bill for the investigation.  But the shooter is never, ever obligated to identify themselves or stick around at the crime scene. 

The onus is ALWAYS on law enforcement to come up with an answer for how and why somebody died. Self defense is a RIGHT. it does not require cooperation with law enforcement."

People love eye candies and since it has been told numerous times that women love sex and eye candies too, it's only fair for women to get their share and have their desires be considered.

But here is the thing though.......I find that it is impossible to do so particular for straight women because women have a more varied preferences than men. 

When women are sexualised by men is there is almost always a common pattern of how they are portrayed. Sexualised women have all something thing in common that being their body type and it's almost universal among men in almost every culture. ( I'm talking about women with noticable ass and boobs etc)

But for women, it's much more complex and harder to pin point. Because while you will find almost every single straight men liking women with a hot body, women will have more different answers. 

Some women prefer a well built body, some prefer a skinny body, some prefer the dad bod, some prefer men to wear suits etc etc etc. and most of these men aren't even usually sexualised.

The sexualised men we see in media are often always for the male audience. 

Every single adult media that tried to carter to women ended up with two things. A large gay male following and the harshest critics being women.

Male strip clubs, male prostitutes and playgirl magazine are good examples

Hell even when women tried to carter to women ( like the author of 50 shades of grey or Twilight) it got a lot of push back from mostly women ( saying that this is not what women like) 

So with all this push back from straight women and ending with more gay male following than straight female following, leads me to be that it's impossible to make adult content that straight women can enjoy or sexualise men that would appeal to straight women 

I am hoping someone can change my view on this so that we can either decide to completely stop sexualization in media or eradicate the gender imbalance when it comes to sexualisation."

That would be a solution of so many of our problems!‚Äù

But would it? 

The United States is one of the 3 or 4 biggest countries in the world. *There is no nationwide transportation system linking major urban centers to one another that‚Äôs both cheap and efficient **and** that  wouldn‚Äôt be a money drain*. And this is without even considering the idea of rural public transportation, which is often spoken of in the same breath but is even more unfeasible. 

You need people to drive. You need to pay them a fair wage. You need to make a profit. 

You can get one or two of those things but in my experience, not all 3. People don‚Äôt want to live in some shithole 3 store town to drive their local diabetic grandmas to their appointment in x named dying Rust Belt city. So you have to pay them a lot to work there, but then you run into a problem. There‚Äôs not enough people to drive for the business to make a profit. So the whole idea falls apart.  

People want control or they want convenience. Ideally they want both but they‚Äôll settle, usually, for one or the other. This goes especially for transport. If the traffic is too bad in some major urban areas then the stress of driving outweighs the control one gets from it. So people take subway. Outside NYC however? It‚Äôs usually the opposite. The control of your own transportation outweighs the benefits of any public transportation. 

This is somehow seen as a ‚Äúuniquely‚Äù American problem to the same people that fetishize public transportation on the left. In fact, I‚Äôve had debates on this very sub with people who blame America‚Äôs loneliness. On the fact we drive too many cars and we don‚Äôt wri In fact, I‚Äôve had debates on this very sub with people who blame America‚Äôs loneliness on the fact we drive too many cars and we don‚Äôt ride enough public transportation. 

This isn‚Äôt an American thing, this is a human thing. And while we‚Äôre at the people that fetishize public transport, as if it‚Äôs the panacea to all our worlds ill are the people that never fucking ride it. Because if they did, they know how laughable it is the reason people chose to stop riding public transport, and instead thousands upon thousands of dollars buying cars to drive on the newly minted interstate highwayswas because your trapped on a fucking bus, a fucking subway, a fucking taxi with the general populace. 

When you sign up for public transport, you sign up for the bratty, ill raised, poor children running up and down the bus/train car like wild animals, screeching, and screaming. You sign up for the jackass that can‚Äôt be alone with their thoughts for 10 minutes and has to talk obnoxiously loud on the bus with some fuzzy voice at the other end of the phone. You sign up for the creepy homeless guy who smells like shit and who keeps twitching, and muttering to themselves. You sign up for the angry passengers that get into arguments with one another, that then break into fistfights, that then involve the police. Which means the bus or the car gets pulled over and you‚Äôre late to wherever you need to go.

And of course you get the local homeless population come summer and winter, who panhandle, harass, or generally make you and your children uncomfortable whenever you get off the bus/car at your local terminal/bus hub. 

Nobody rides public transportation because they want to, they ride it because it‚Äôs the most convenient. But don‚Äôt doubt for a second that people would choose to go to alone rather then communally. Because no company is better than bad company. "

I want so desperately to believe in unconditional love. I do not believe it exists. I believe everyone has conditions. 
Very simply for one single fact: would you still love your partner if they abused you? What about your child? A family member? The vast majority of you will say no. That is the condition. That is where you draw the line. 
I've seen some articles say that ""unconditional love is not unconditional tolerance,"" but love and tolerance are one and the same. Everyone has little quirks about them that their partners don't like. They tolerate those behaviors because they love them. But that tolerance has an end point. And if you reach that end point and your partner does something you can't tolerate then it has reached beyond the conditions of your love. Because if you had unconditional love for them there would be no end to what you can tolerate.

 When it comes to white people mass shootings are brought up , colonialism , and slavery to say that there's no contingent factor that may lead to those outcomes putting the onus on them to hint at it being their "" nature "" 

Want to test it ? 

Just ask any far leftist was slavery the result of peope being born in such an environment OR did they have free will and white people just happen to practice it . Nevermind the slavery that goes on around the world that isn't by white people 

2. They try to re-define racism to excuse black people from ever being racist . We have systemic racism and then we have racism which is executed on an individual level . To say that those in power can't be racist is tantamount to saying that black people can't be homophobic because we lack the power to enact laws to deny the right to marry etc 

3. The solutions hyerfixate on race. To even propose such solutions one must believe that the majority of police officers /systems are mostly racist or acting racist by legislation. This is inherent flawed and can be simply explained by human nature . I'm black myself and best believe if a black person is following me I get nervous but why ? 

Because everytime I've been jumped it's been by black people. Now how does that translate to crime ? There's no such thing as over-policing when a group of people are commiting close to 40 percent of the crimes. Those cops are responding to complaints , leads , people literally calling them for help so naturally cops will be in the area. And I know people are going to say what about people who are jailed that are innocent ? 

That does happen but it's not going to dampen the number significantly of those commiting crimes. On one hand far leftist will admit the reason why crime is happening because of poverty etc but then suddenly pretend the numbers are all exaggerated. 



4. Certain propositions would create black only spaces however it doesn't work the other way around.  I had a woman who said she doesn't feel comfortable getting a massage by non-blacks however why can't white people have an experience where they wouldn't be comfortable with someone who is black ?

 Certainly but white people have the potential to be racist or even racist against their own race which weve seem from the white peope from the far left . Who book was popular discussing white privilege? What group cancels you for even critisizing racist ideals from the far left ? 

When you say that white people are the majority it's to say that in virtue of their race they all think the same and can't hold views that negatively impact white people. On one hand we can acknowledge black conservatives which are shamed by far leftist however white people who hold positions of power are racist or can't be racist against their own race. You would think we freed ourselves from slavery. In a nutshell , if black people can't be racist because they lack the power then it's to say you believe white people all think the same or if you are saying they have the potential ?

 Then they have the potential to be racist or even racist against their own race which permits black people to be racist by your own logic because people In power can enact laws against white people potentially.

This is inherent flawed and can be simply explained by human nature . I'm black myself and best believe if a black person is following me I get nervous but why ? 

Because everytime I've been jumped it's been by black people. Now how does that translate to crime ? There's no such thing as over-policing when a group of people are commiting close to 40 percent of the crimes. Those cops are responding to complaints , leads , people literally calling them for help so naturally cops will be in the area. And I know people are going to say what about people who are jailed that are innocent ? 

That does happen but it's not going to dampen the number significantly of those commiting crimes. On one hand far leftist will admit the reason why crime is happening because of poverty etc but then suddenly pretend the numbers are all exaggerated. 



4. Certain propositions would create black only spaces however it doesn't work the other way around.  I had a woman who said she doesn't feel comfortable getting a massage by non-blacks however why can't white people have an experience where they wouldn't be comfortable with someone who is black ? 

Not only are the propositions put forward racist but in its own logic hypocriticaly deny white people the same feelings and course of action "

This one is grave and I don't want to have this opinion, but I do because I don't see any other option. Anyone who can convince me otherwise will make me a better person, overall.

Humans are in a snowball effect of creating bigger and bigger destructive forces like bombs and viruses (not specifially mentioning COVID btw, I do not claim to know which viruses were man made and which were not.) I believe that despite this being bad and wanting it to stop and being an advocate for peace, the advancements need to be made because without them, the nation which decides to halt development will fall behind in terms of global power.

Example: There is currently a bird flu virus, H5N1, that is spreading to mammals like cows, rats, cats, and a lot of other random ones, which previously had never happened. In reference to Robert Redfield, former CDC Director, when he was talking about how H5N1 could mutate and be transmissible from human to human: ""I know exactly what amino acids I have to change because in 2012, against my recommendation, the scientists that did these experiments actually published them."" 

So, the recipe for how to make H5N1 the next global pandemic is out there and available, if he is telling thr truth. (I understand the results may have been fake, but this applies to other things like bombs.) Now, the major world powers may and likely will use this information to develop deadly viruses, which they already have. This is bad, but I believe it must be done in order for my nation to not fall behind its enemies in terms of defence and technology. However, I am not sure if the development of these technologies will slow or accelerate the downfall of humanity. I support my country working to have the upper hand againt its enemies because I love my life overall, and don't want to lose it. I want my peace loving neighbors such as me to live long happy lives. However, the result of always gaining the upper hand is mutually assured destruction.

To relate this to something else such as the fishing industry. If two fishing boats are overfishing a lake, eventually there will be no fish left for anyone. Each fishing boat wants the fish to flourish, but if one stopped fishing, the other may continue to fish in absense of its competitor. Thats why we have government regulation of industries. We do not have regualtion of the world."

Disclaimer: I‚Äôm not trying to dispute the existence of reincarnation or rebirth. My aim is to explore the philosophical and logical issues these concepts raise regarding personal identity and moral responsibility.


Hey everyone! Let‚Äôs dive into some core concepts in Buddhism (and other Indian religions) - samsara and karma. For those new to these terms:

Samsara is the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, which is considered full of suffering. The ultimate goal is to escape this cycle.

Karma is the principle that every action has consequences. Good actions lead to positive outcomes in future lives, while bad actions lead to negative outcomes.

In the world of samsara, karma is the driver. Your actions in this life impact your future rebirths. The aim, especially in Buddhism, is to achieve nirvana (or moksha in Hinduism), breaking free from samsara and its inherent suffering.

One major issue with samsara and karma is the problem of personal identity. If you‚Äôre reborn into a new body with no memories or characteristics from your past life, can we really say you‚Äôre the same person?

In philosophy, identity is typically understood through several key components:

Memory: Our memories play a crucial role in forming our identity. They link our past experiences to our present self, creating a continuous narrative of who we are. If reincarnation doesn‚Äôt carry over memories, it disrupts this continuity.

Consciousness: The continuity of consciousness, or the ongoing experience of being aware and thinking, is another pillar of personal identity. If this continuity is broken between lives, it challenges the idea that the same person is reborn.

Character Traits: Traits like personality, values, and preferences contribute to our sense of self. These are often shaped by our experiences and memories. A new life with a completely different set of traits further complicates the idea of a continuous identity.

Without memories or personal traits carrying over, the idea of a continuous self becomes problematic. If you can‚Äôt remember your past lives, how are you the same ‚Äúyou‚Äù? This breaks down our usual understanding of personal identity, which relies heavily on memory and continuity of experience.

Philosophers like Derek Parfit have discussed identity in terms of psychological continuity. In reincarnation, the lack of this continuity poses a challenge. Are you just a different person every time you‚Äôre reborn? This makes the concept of an enduring self across lifetimes difficult to sustain.

Another big issue is moral responsibility. The idea that you‚Äôre suffering or prospering now because of actions in past lives (which you don‚Äôt remember) raises some ethical concerns.

If you can‚Äôt remember your past actions, it seems unfair to hold you accountable for them. Imagine being punished for a crime committed by God-knows-who in Luxembourg ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt align with our usual ideas of justice and responsibility.

Responsibility typically implies awareness and intent. If your current suffering is due to past-life actions, but you had no control or memory of those actions, it‚Äôs hard to see how you can be morally responsible. This disconnect challenges the fairness of karma as a moral system. Additionally, the idea that pain caused by sins in this life is carried over to the next life does little to motivate us to be good people now, since the consequences are disconnected from our present experience.

Also, consider that some animals and species cannot survive by abiding by human social rules, including those of Buddhism and ethics. Judging whether they were ‚Äúgood‚Äù animals becomes impossible. Some animal species don‚Äôt even have brains or consciousness to begin with. How can karma be fairly applied to such beings when they lack the capacity for ethical decision-making?


What do you all think? Can the concepts of samsara and karma be reconciled with modern philosophical understandings of identity and responsibility? How do other belief systems address these issues? And what about non-human animals‚Äîhow do they fit into these frameworks? Looking forward to your thoughts and insights!"

30,2024-06-16,CMV: Poor Things is a bad movie,u/RedDit245610,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dgzrn7/cmv_poor_things_is_a_bad_movie/,changemyview,"I've seen this movie got a ton of critical acclaim and I can sort of see why. If you look at the individual aspects of the film such as the costume design, stage design, cinematography, score (I love the music here, its the best part of the film by far) and acting then you could say it's a great film, that has out-of-the-box elements which makes it a unique experience.

However, the concept of this film is written so poorly and it's so disgusting that the movie just cannot be enjoyed. Not only that I can't personally enjoy it, but in my opinion, the movie is so distasteful to the point where the writing overshadows all of the good individual elements in this film.

This movie was set up so well to the point where I feel like they could've done anything when Bella was discovering this world, but they really just made me watch a child in a woman's body have sex and become a prostitute. I just don't see the point. Not only is it distasteful, but it was rather boring. The plot didn't progress enough for me and I was just watching a child have sex and people talking to each other in an overly portentous manner - the way they just spoke in the film irritated me. It was just so bland overall.

Now when I've discussed this movie with other people, the argument I've seen is that this movie is not meant to be enjoyed. You're meant to be disgusted watching this child being used by adults and becoming a prostitute, which I can appreciate. If that was really the point of the film then the filmmakers did a good job because I didn't enjoy this movie at all, the concept is dark. However, I have some issues with this argument. 

1. I've stated this before but I think the plot is distasteful, while I get it has a dark theme I think it goes too far to the point where it can't be enjoyed. A good example is that you can have a movie with horrific killing that's intended to be disturbing, but there is still a boundary where if you play a 30 minute scene of a man butchering a child with a knife and watching every single body part get butchered for 30 minutes in too much detail then that is distasteful.

2. I can technically make this argument for a lot of movies, a good example would be A Serbian Film. You can say well the plot is intriguing, it has crazy plot twists, does something no other movie has done and it's also meant to display the horrors of pornography and human trafficking. However, I think a lot of us here can agree that just because the purpose of the film is to display the horrors of human trafficking, it doesn't mean it's actually a good film at all. The disturbing nature of this movie means you can't enjoy any aspect of it at all, Poor Things is no different.

3. Some people interpret this movie as a feminist movie and it explores the protagonist's ""sexual liberation"" which is just a sick interpretation of this movie in my opinion. At best, the film is a feminist movie that's done through the male gaze. It doesn't actually explore elements of womanhood such as a period, it just has sex, sex, and more sex. To be honest, it's sad that you can't interpret this movie as feminist because the book does a much better job at actually being feminist (which I won't go further into detail and spoil) the film misses the whole point of the book and just messes it up.  


TLDR: to distasteful for my liking. The plot was dull, despite having a good set up. Boring and not enjoyable on top of that."
1,2024-06-16,CMV: Most existential/catastrophic risks to humankind are downstream consequences of government,u/MobileSquirrel3567,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dh036y/cmv_most_existentialcatastrophic_risks_to/,changemyview,"(I understand governments do many good things, but I'm discussing anarchy with a friend and want to check this part of my views over for errors)

Academic/professional groups that analyze existential/catastrophic risk tend to list some or all of the following: nuclear war, environmental damage, rogue AI, nanotechnology, bioengineered pandemic, natural pandemic, global war, genocide. It's my view that, with the exception of natural pandemics, essentially all of these would be way less probable without governments.

Take nuclear weapons, for instance. We have them because of the Manhattan project, which saw over 100,000 workers build on centuries of state-patronized scientific research to mine uranium in the Congo, refine it, ship it to Nevada for testing, and then fly them to Japan for an international war.

With climate change, there's often a strong public will to stop fossil fuels, but the people who want to stop it are legally prevented from doing so. E.g. in the case of the Dakota Access Pipeline, there were far more people traveling there to protest it than trying to build/defend it, but they had to line up and allow themselves to be arrested. It's not even clear we could have developed a worldwide dependence on oil with the stability/scale afforded by government.

In general, I think government allows/incentivizes operating at scales that lend themselves to catastrophic environmental damage, difficult science, and war."

The motivation behind it is due to fear that artists will be displaced by AI and how would the quality of cinema suffer. My contention is, as the saying goes, 70%+ of everything is mediocre/crap. Most shows on streaming services are not exactly *Braking Bad* or *Dexter*. For every *Cheers/Married with Children*, there will be at least three *Two Broke Girls*/*Family Guy*/*Suite Life of Zack and Cody*. 

Therefore, instead of resisting AI, the best thing for artists to do is to use it as a tool to earn a living. The internet has lowered the barrier of entry to make films. The lower barriers of entry help reduce film budgets; making films less of a business risk. It would be best for artists to become ""indie"" producers, in which they supervise the output of AI. If we cannot beat producers using them, join them in their strategies. Creative people would still be needed to supervise/correct/sample the AI software to gain a competitive edge by outputting more content. Not to mention, artists can have big-shot titles in their LinkedIn profiles.

For those who are not talented, [such as myself](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FBwN75PWNYt-spRUrr3h8AmOO7qFtEZA/view?usp=sharing), AI is probably the greatest thing that could happen to them. Even in this subreddit, I bet that some of you could name people in their personal lives who work in dreadful/mediocre jobs but would do almost anything to pursue an artistic endeavor, such as book author, filmmaker, musician, etc. AI lowers the barrier to entry and helps them compete in an expanding market for viewers to watch niche content.

Some people would do almost anything to spend the rest of their careers to eek on by pumping out AI-generated mediocrity instead of their occupational predicaments of retail, UPS, fast food, healthcare, office work, etc. To reference the linked editorial, people who lack fulfillment in their IRL jobs can gain some by having AI assist their creative work for cheaper production costs and (therefore) some profit. Who cares if it is a ""cheat code"" if people can get a livelihood that is marginally more fulfilling?

This Modis Operandi can ensure a decent living because there was a historical equivalent to this approach. Animation Producer Paul Terry made several minute shorts PER WEEK at Fables Studios. In 1930, he co-founded Terrytoons, sold it to CBS for about $40,000,000 (in 2023 USD) in 1955, and it (led by his associates) lasted until 1971. [Despite being the worst in his competition](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TXsH8aTHfARZILmPaZ7ufZQkslVQm-PN/view?usp=sharing), his company outlasted his competitors in terms of consecutive, uninterrupted production. Seriously, using CHATGPT to write a story outline [is not far off from the crap that his company was content with producing for decades](https://www.youtube.com/@TerryToons/playlists)."

We've created checks and balances to curb the worst tendencies of political actors. 

However, as far as I can tell, there are no such checks and balances on wealth creation into the stratosphere that is a billion dollars. I think that sometimes people don't truly understand the number 1,000,000,000. One million seconds is about 11 days, a billion seconds is 34 years. 

My main premise about billionaires not existing is something like this. We do not, in democratic and non-monarchy socieities, argue about the ins and outs of the benevolence of some king. We don't get caught up in trying to make a king or aristocracy more or less tyrannical, more ehtical towards society, etc. We simply don't allow them to exist in the first place because we know that, while some kings may have been benevolent in the past, we know their worst tendencies will override that benevolence because of the mere fact that they exist. 

I believe the same thing with billionaires. I don't want to get caught up in discussing how they may or may not be good, how some are good and some are bad. The very existence of someone with that amount of wealth, power and influence should just not be allowed to exist at all as they will inevitably, just like a class of noblemen or aristocrats, use that wealth, power and influence at the detriment of most of society.

I often find it hard to digest when people argue that taxation is¬†theft while enjoying the benefit of the taxation. So rather than viewing taxation as something that the government can take from you what is wrong in viewing taxation as membership fee for the club that is your respective citizenship/resident-ship. Let me illustrate with a few point:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If we think of taxation as a membership to a club, then you can view the the benefits of the club like free education, roads, police, army etc. Beyond these observable benefits, there are other unobservable concepts that taxation supports such as taxation supports institution that recognizes that a piece of property (say land) is yours, it supports the judiciary, an important institution that (tries to) delivers justice when you feel that you have been wronged and it supports organization that make sure people with excess resources or knowledge don‚Äôt indulge in activities that is against the common good. (FDA)

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† One argument that I have heard says citizenship is birth right unlike a membership. This argument is not quite valid as the term itself says it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbirth right‚Äù not an obligation. You have the choice to move out of the country (club) that provided you with citizenship (membership) and move to a country with low taxation or no taxation but then you will be giving up some privileges of your first country for some of your new country.

¬†Personally, I am a strong proponent of a progressive tax system therefore I am worried maybe my personal biases could creep into my arguments. I would like you‚Äôll to look at my points and try to find holes in it.

0,2024-06-16,CMV: The best way to solve the US' political issues is to use Sortition to select our officials rather than elections,u/Cheemingwan1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dh3r38/cmv_the_best_way_to_solve_the_us_political_issues/,changemyview,"Okay, we've seen how well elections tend to divide up our country and tends to attract the worst types of people to serve us, particularly in the US with the  two party system.

I suggest that rather than elections which tends to elect people you don't want to power (well connected indivduals) , random selection might be the way to select all officals since the base is quite wide compared to elections and rather than stirring up shit with elections, you just wait your turn until the feds throw you into office once your number is called.  No political parties are allowed.

And the problems that would be raised.

  
What about if I don't want to serve? That's the neat part, you don't have a choice not to serve. If you're selected to be POTUS, your choices are  in the Beast's back seat or in the Beast's trunk. No resignations until you complete your term.

  
How to prevent the randomly chosen officials from turning onto the people that are meant to serve? Easy, no privacy (both public and private) so they have the people breathing down their necks in all parts of their life.

  
What about staffers behind the throne? Everyone in government is selected in that manner, including aides, preventing this from happening. And advisors are banned in government to let people try out ideas that form in their heads and put it in law.

  
How would we pass laws without political parties to compromise? Well, have all laws proposed be passed out and indviduals (including law enforcement) choose which laws to enforce (or follow)  and which laws they don't want to enforce and laws that are enforced are tabulated into a census and implemented.

  
What about the body that is responsible for the lottery? Either infinite regress or make it two or more seperate bodies that do the same thing and compete with one another, preventing it from getting too powerful.

  
It would be better than current democracy which tends to self select for connected individuals who you don't want to be in power and prevents political divisions since there is no demagoues to stir up issues to win elections under this system

Looking at the wars we‚Äôve had recently, they‚Äôre all rampages which don‚Äôt end up doing any good. 

For starters, fighting in the Middle East is pointless. They will always be at war, and they will always kill each other. Nothing we do will ever change that. They are too tied up in extremism, not that we aren‚Äôt though. It‚Äôs just that theirs is far worse. But even if we killed off every terrorist there more would have inevitably showed back up to do the same thing. To add on a bit more to that, we only fought because we were attacked, not because we wanted to do any good. We only really wanted revenge. But that‚Äôs not even my biggest beef with Afghanistan. We killed 70k innocent civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan. I wouldn‚Äôt call the blood of than many honorable in any world.

As far as Iran and Iraq, that too was a shit show. There were at least 500K civilian deaths. And that was over a lie. They posed no danger to us. They had no weapons that would destroy us. We just, as far as I ca. tell, wanted oil.

Third one, Vietnam. Vietnam was yet again another war that we shouldn‚Äôt have touched. It was only done to make the current leaders of the US look good. They wanted to be able to say that we were big and strong and thwarting communism. Which we completely failed to do, at the cost of who knows how many lives. Estimates range from 1-3 million.

The Korean War also wasn‚Äôt any of our business. We did more harm than good. Less would have died if we kept our noses out. ‚ÄúU.S. commanders ordered their troops to shoot civilians.‚Äù That was a little quote from a GI. The civilian deaths totaled some 2-3 million.

WW2 though. History agrees that Hitler needed to be stopped. I agree that Hitler needed to be stopped. With the wars in Asia, they posed limited threats on Western society. They never would have stopped terrorist attacks. The Taliban would have continued no matter what we did. They just would have found a different country. Hell, we killed their leader and they didn‚Äôt stop. But if Hitler wasn‚Äôt stopped all of Europe and likely the West would have toppled. I‚Äôd be dead. Hitler didn‚Äôt like the gays. But the US didn‚Äôt exactly fight in that war to prevent th humanitarian disaster. Once again, we just wanted revenge because Japan attacked us.

It sickens me that we only fight for revenge or profit. Why can‚Äôt we lay off of each other unless millions would die otherwise? Because you can count on the US killing millions in their efforts.

But I want to know if I‚Äôm missing something. I want to hear other views. After all, I‚Äôve only lived through one of these wars."

The concept of 'science vs. philosophy' is a delusion locked in their heads. It‚Äôs really more about science vs anti-science than science vs philosophy.

There was never a war between science and philosophy. Aristotle, Galileo, and Plato were BOTH scientists and philosophers. Anti-science is a philosophy, but philosophy is not anti-science. There is a difference between the two.

I really don't think anyone should be attacking the act of deep thinking and philosophizing. Sure, one can say Science promotes a critical and precise view of the world than any other branches of knowledge, I do agree to that. Science explains why we live in a general sense, but we still have to know how we ought to live.

one of the big ones is making the british look like barbaric war criminals. the film depicts the british as killing prisoners of war and burning down a church with people inside, neither of which actually happened. it's even been said that the british were depicted in a similar fashion to nazis.

as you can imagine, the british government didn't take too kindly to this portrayal. many prominent british officals said that, while atrocities were committed on both sides, the movie portrayed their forefathers as monsters for the sake of drama.

it honestly baffles me that the british government didn't try to sue emmerich and gibson for slander. if i had been the prime minister of england, the minute i saw that scene where the british burn down a church, i would have been on the phone with a lawyer and i would have said ""oh my friend, you are about to get the biggest payday of your life"".

this especially rings true nowadays, now that we know that the american revolution was a mistake and that the colonists were just as bad, if not worse, then the british.

and i know that i'm probably going to get british people in the comments saying ""i don't care what a dumb movie from 24 years ago says about my anscestors"". guys, that's the fucking problem. you SHOULD care!"

0,2024-06-16,CMV: We Must Teach Kids That Some Lives are Worth More/Less than Others,u/NomadicContrarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dh7mlf/cmv_we_must_teach_kids_that_some_lives_are_worth/,changemyview,"I'll (25M) admit, I really didn't want to make this post today, but with recent events in my life, including another betrayal, it basically pushed me over the edge to make this post. I'll keep this one short and sweet, or bitter. Basically, we must teach kids at a young age that some lives will be seen worth more/less than others, with it being tailored to the type of kid they are inherently born as. 

Now let me elaborate with two main points that come to my mind:

\*  We must teach children that they WILL be judged on things they have no control over, like looks and ability. This way, poor/ugly kids/those with disabilities won't expect much out of life and not lose their minds over seeing those around them who are rich/attractive/without disabilities coasting through life easily socially and romantically.

\* Maybe going off the last point, but if we emphasize the idea that, in the animal world, those that aren't seen as desirable (like lions with lighter manes or deer with smaller antlers) are going to fail, then that would prevent a lot of expectations in kids, and thus suffering when they ""know their place"" so to speak. 

\* Another idea is that we don't really live our lives, we live the lives of the rich/famous. This is their world, and we merely exist in it.

Honestly, these lessons would actually not only prevent a lot of incels/femcels from being formed, but would also at the very least spare them a lot of heartache/suffering if they know what their true limitations (at least in the eyes of others) are. 

It certainly would've spared me a lot of pain as well if I had known how worthless I'd inevitably seen as given that I'm short (5'6.5""), out of shape, and, most importantly of all, autistic. 

But yeah, feel free to share your thoughts. And I'm sorry for making another post, but as someone who's gone through a lot of pain in my life and has had to deconstruct many of his thoughts alone, I thought this one would be easier if I didn't have to do it alone. "

This is a problem directly relevant to patient care. If you doubt this, I can go into the association between MCAT and USMLE exams, as well as fail and dropout rates at diversity-focused schools (which may further contribute to the physician shortage).

Of course, there are many benefits of increasing physician diversity. However, I believe in a field where human lives are at stake, we should not trade potential expertise for racial diversity."

Basically, I don‚Äôt get why everyone seems to be talking about superintelligence coming in the future when it seems more reasonable to (when we can) just train a lot of different models to human intelligence. But I‚Äôm curious as to why people think so. Here are my reasons for thinking the way I do:

**1. Humans would maintain their relative value to an AI model.**  
I‚Äôm someone who feels like even if AI could bring us prosperity without going rogue, it would still in a roundabout way be dystopian simply because we would lose a lot of our purpose in life not being able to do something valuable for others. If we did this instead, humans would retain their relative value to an AI model (even if we would become an increasingly small sliver of the population) and still feel like we could do something useful.

Admittedly, AI labour would still be cheaper than humans. But this would be like how in 19th century America a lot of working class white people were angry at slavery because it unfairly competed with their labour. The simple solution would just be to give economic rights to AI (like the right to a wage). And even if maintaining an AI (e.g electricity, repair) were to become may times cheaper than maintaining a human (e.g food, housing), both costs would be negligible if we get all that economic prosperity AI promises.

To be clear, I‚Äôm not saying that all current jobs would remain. There would for instance be fewer jobs for human cooks, because AI doesn‚Äôt need food, but since our value would remain the same we wouldn‚Äôt be redundant and would be able to do all the new jobs that would be created.  
**2. It would still mean immense progress.**

As I think many have said, there are probably more geniuses now compared to 500 years ago in 1524 simply because there are more people. Since this would essentially be like spawning a bunch of people into existence, this would have the same effect. Also, AI could still exponentially grow, not by making smarter and smarter models but by making human level models cheaper and cheaper (thereby also increasing the intelligence pool that would be able to figure out more ways to make them cheaper).

Let‚Äôs say I had 3 AI bots with one (AI1) knowing 100 facts, the other (AI2) knowing a different 100 facts, and the third (AI3) knowing all 200 facts. The AI bots are asked to generate conclusions from these facts. The ones who know 100 facts will generate 1000 conclusions each. AI3, who knows 200 facts, will generate 2000 conclusions (with the same amount of facts per conclusion as AI1 and AI2). Why is it that AI3 would generate any more interesting conclusions? Sure, it has more facts to combine, but assuming that they wouldn‚Äôt reach a limit in the amount of conclusions to be reached (which feels pretty unlikely with a big enough dataset) then that doesn‚Äôt really mean anything because it would have to forego other conclusions that both it and AI1 or 2 would be able to reach. 

What I‚Äôm also saying is that, like, why would it be any more useful to be able to solve Millenium Prize Problems than to solve a bunch of simple arithmetic, or to create the next Mona Lisa than to create a bunch of less impressive artworks that may still hold value to some individuals (which could just as well be done with a lot of medium intelligence bots)?

**3. We would be dividing the problem of rogue AIs into smaller problems.**

If one AI went rogue, that wouldn‚Äôt really be more of a problem than normal human crime under this order, since we know how to catch someone with human level intelligence. If all AI went rogue (much easier when it‚Äôs all part of one or two minds) we would have a problem.

Of course, the AI could band together. But at least it wouldn‚Äôt be all, and if they‚Äôre anything like humans they may still have some respect for minority rights, even though they may have a dark side."

0,2024-06-16,CMV: overly promiscuous people and romantically inexperienced people should not receive the same advice nor try to advise each other,u/Enbie-or-Trans,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dh9svf/cmv_overly_promiscuous_people_and_romantically/,changemyview,"Basically I think the two groups are too different for much of anything to transfer between the two. Overly promiscuous people being people who constantly need to be in a relationship and were likely never single since around 15, and want to be more selective. Inexperienced people being people who due to tending to be more selective and such end up with little dating experience at older ages but want to date more. Both have issues to overcome but I think their issues are pretty different and their personalities are different enough they can‚Äôt learn much from each other. I might call them people who want to be higher sociosexuality and people who want to be lower sociosexuality.

‚ÄúYou have to learn to be single‚Äù is often applied to both, but it only really applies to the overly promiscuous people who always need to be in a romantic relationship. People distressed about the fact they never dated generally do ‚Äúknow how to be single‚Äù.

But I think there are a lot of other things that apply between them generally.

I think the two groups are just fundamentally too different temperamentally for anything to transfer between them. I think cross-sex dating advice is a bit underrated, because I don‚Äôt think men and women are that different after more superficial dating stuff is ignored, but all an overly promiscuous woman can do for a man with the opposite problem is fuck him and maybe in a rather unrealistic scenario his approach to relationships might give her more stability she wants (only thing he could offer her). And if it is two men the only thing they could offer each other would be to have a gay relationship with that exact same dynamic.

Essentially I think the behaviours of each group comes so Naturally to them that they cannot meaningful help the other group aside from the dubious benefits of having sex with each other. Because in the end changing your behaviour is the challenge, being celibate your whole life and having 100 relationships in your life aren‚Äôt fundamentally harder or easier than the other. Such people should focus on finding someone who made the change they wanted to make in their own life and learning from them, instead of in learning from people who are ‚Äúlucky‚Äù from their perspective, keeping in mind the grass is greener on the other side effects."

Contemporary American politics has several striking features beyond just polarization and extremism. The different sides no longer agree on reality - there is no shared set of facts. People are willing to risk fundamental democratic ideals just to hurt ""the other side"". Government is no longer about achieving shared security, justice or prosperity but rather about tribal affiliations and out-competing ""the others"".

My view is that the **primary responsibility** for this state of affairs lies not with any political party, or the media, or Trump, or ""the corporations"", or the Supreme Court but with American people, specifically, voters.

(Btw, although my post is from a mostly-liberal position, I'm sure a principled conservative could create an analogous, valid argument from their position too. The details would be different, but the conclusion the same).

I'll address some common contrary opinions:

> ""It's Trump's fault"": 

The entirety of Trump power comes from the fact that a vast chunk of the American public (roughly 33 percent) supports him with a fanatical devotion. That's it. Take that away and he's just another rich dude that has done some shady dealings.

> ""It's spineless Republicans who won't stand up for what's right"": 

Every Republican who has tried to stand up to Truump has been primaried and lost all power and influence. They have lost the support of their voters, who are firmly in the MAGA camp. Ask yourself why a politician even needs ""courage"", ""bravery"", etc to stand up for what's right. It's because their voters don't want that.

> ""It's the media"": 

Sure, the media is complicit, but the basic reality of journalism today is - you need to give readers what they want. Any media outlet that publishes pieces contrary to their reader's biases will get punished with reduced engagement and loss of audience. Unbiased, nuanced, reality-focussed journalism exists and is easy to find, but their audience is tiny and engagement is superficial at best

> ""It's partisanship caused by New Gingrich etc etc""

It worked, unlike the dozens of political experiments that strategists attempt all the time. The GOP has become a far more effective political party (in terms of electoral outcomes) since they adopted this strategy. Because that's what their voters wanted. 

I could go on, but hopefully my point is clear - while other entities may have played a part, the biggest cause of today's political dysfunction is the American people, who've repeatedly made their opinions clear through multiple means - votes, spending, media consumption, passionate support and loud vilification."

In fact it's a descriptor I gladly accept and don't even consider to be an insult. 

I blame this movement for the current degradation of the cultural and music criticism scene, apart from dying journalism as a whole. Many publications are being sold off, music writers being fired but one thing that I want to focus here on is the absolutely lack of any substantial music criticism from the existing publications in the current landscape. 

Music publications are afraid of popular artists' fanbases. Fandoms have been a key factor in diminishing any substantial music criticism. Now-a-days any music discourse is mostly killed by the fandoms of different artists being extremely aggressive, to the point of doxxing and hurting others. 

Then there's the argument that if something is being consumed by more people it must be good. McDonalds sells the most burgers. They are generally feel good fast food but they still erode your liver. 

Then there's the advent of streaming sites and tik tok. I see these sites as very positive inventions for the music. They have opened up the world like never before. I have personally discovered so many amazing artists from Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America etc. who I wouldn't have been able to without having the access these sites provided to me but on the other hand you've got popular music getting shorter and shorter, and the album becoming obsolete. Most pop music is being made for a moment of virality on social media.

In this case how can we take this commercial, algorithm driven pop music seriously? Is it really art for art's sake or is it a product to be consumed? If that's the case then why should such a cynical product be attributed any kind of respect? Poptimism wants us to treat pop music with the same seriousness as other genres like rock but I feel like now it's being used as an excuse to legitimize algorithm driven low quality spam.

Simply put, these jokes imply that having a small penis is a very bad thing. That it automatically makes you a disgusting, sexist, egocentric loser. The people who make these jokes claim people with small penises must all be insecure, but then deliberately use this humour to cause that insecurity and alienate. It‚Äôs like hitting someone and then making fun of them for being in pain. They want you to be insecure and then use jokes to highlight that insecurity.

This concept must be foreign to a lot of people because it actually is possible to be a decent human being with a small penis, but these jokes imply otherwise and are designed to make people conflate small penises with being a vile, woman-hating, insecure, vain prick. Those who make them clearly do not care if they emotionally hurt normal people with small penises, and when we call out their body shaming, that‚Äôs when they say ‚ÄúSee? You‚Äôre insecure!

They are deterministic when it comes to the black struggle but when it comes to white people they have free will. 

I see no issue in mentioning that poverty causes crime , significantly lower wealth than other races , Red lining etc which are all factors that lead to the outcomes we see .

 When it comes to white people mass shootings are brought up , colonialism , and slavery to say that there's no contingent factor that may lead to those outcomes putting the onus on them to hint at it being their "" nature "" 

How to test it ? 

Just ask any far leftist was slavery the result of peope being born in such an environment OR did they have free will and white people just happen to practice it . Nevermind the slavery that goes on around the world that isn't by white people 

2. They try to re-define racism to excuse black people from ever being racist . We have systemic racism and then we have racism which is executed on an individual level . To say that those in power can't be racist is tantamount to saying that black people can't be homophobic because we lack the power to enact laws to deny the right to marry etc 

Now are white people in majority of power positions?

 Certainly but white people have the potential to be racist or even racist against their own race which weve seem from the white peope from the far left . Who book was popular discussing white privilege? What group cancels you for even critisizing racist ideals from the far left ? 

When you say that white people are the majority it's to say that in virtue of their race they all think the same and can't hold views that negatively impact white people. On one hand we can acknowledge black conservatives which are shamed by far leftist however white people who hold positions of power are racist or can't be racist against their own race. You would think we freed ourselves from slavery. In a nutshell , if black people can't be racist because they lack the power then it's to say you believe white people all think the same or if you are saying they have the potential ?

 Then they have the potential to be racist or even racist against their own race which permits black people to be racist by your own logic because people In power can enact laws against white people potentially. 
 

3. The solutions hyerfixate on race. To even propose such solutions one must believe that the majority of police officers /systems are mostly racist or acting racist by legislation. This is inherent flawed and can be simply explained by human nature . I'm black myself and best believe if a black person is following me I get nervous but why ? 

Because everytime I've been jumped it's been by black people. Now how does that translate to crime ? There's no such thing as over-policing when a group of people are commiting close to 40 percent of the crimes. Those cops are responding to complaints , leads , people literally calling them for help so naturally cops will be in the area. And I know people are going to say what about people who are jailed that are innocent ? 

That does happen but it's not going to dampen the number significantly of those commiting crimes. On one hand far leftist will admit the reason why crime is happening because of poverty etc but then suddenly pretend the numbers are all exaggerated. 



4. Certain propositions would create black only spaces however it doesn't work the other way around.  I had a woman who said she doesn't feel comfortable getting a massage by non-blacks however why can't white people have an experience where they wouldn't be comfortable with someone who is black ? 

Not only are the propositions put forward racist but in its own logic hypocriticaly deny white people the same feelings and course of action "

But in reality, they shouldn't be because much of their values align with them. As a matter of fact, many of the Right-Wing Parties' Platforms align with their views such as Anti-Abortion, Anti-LGBTQ, Pro-Traditional Marriage, higher emphasis on Religion, less Liberalism, etc.

And as we've seen in recent news stories, it's turning out to be true. Here in the US, many of the state's Republican Parties, particularly in the South are passing near-total Abortion Bans, as well as making it mandatory to have religion being preached in school, banning the use of Woke/LGBTQ Materials and Drag Queens in schools, etc. Such policies would be popular among the every Religious demographic, even Muslims. But all they do is demonize them because of their Religion.

So in conclusion, Conservatives and Right-Wingers complaints about Islam and Sharia Law being a bad influence make them nothing more than a bunch of stupid hypocrites because not only are their values in line with them, but they're also the ones implementing it. But hey, what else do you expect from the Party of mostly White Evangelical Asshats?

So a word of advice to them, to any Conservative reading this who finds this post offensive, bigoted, and ignorant, I kindly suggest you shut the fuck up and look at your own house before pointing your fingers at others. I'm being politically incorrect. It's the language you guys speak. The words ""Bigot"" and ""Racist"" have lost their meaning according to you guys.

0,2024-06-16,CMV: It is easier for women to date and it shouldn't be misogynistic to point that out,u/dogickker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dhinj9/cmv_it_is_easier_for_women_to_date_and_it/,changemyview,"So I don't even see why this is a controverisal view point because I thought it was that obvious. I think that when you're comparing dating for men and women in heterosexual romantic encounters, dating is significantly easier for women.

First of all, options. The average woman is much more attractive to the average man than vice versa, which means the number of men willing to date the average woman is much greater than the inverse. A typical rebuttal I see to this point is that it's like looking for water in swamp, which is coupled with saying men are looking for an oasis in the desert. This is strange to me because it implies that any woman is a good woman and the majority of men are bad men. I think it's probably equal numbers of good and bad men and women. Because of this, I would argue that even if the majority of women's options are bad, it's still a plus as a woman can sift through 20 options in a week. Men are waiting for their drip feeder to drop another option which could be bad.

I also think it's a lot easier for women because women typically play the passive role. Women usually aren't asking out because they don't have to. They don't have to risk rejection or humiliation. They're not forced to undergo a constant self examination of ""what's wrong with me"" following every single rejection like men are. And to top it off, women still have the option to approach if they wish. Men, aside from incredibly attractive men, only have the option to approach, so we struggle a lot more.

A point I see made is that women don't have easier access to relationships only sex, which again, makes no sense to me. A woman who has access to sex means a woman that is desirable. The whole reason dating is easier for hot people is because they're desirable and people want to be with them. That desirability doesn't make it harder. Women are just more desirable to men than we are too them."

Giving blood is extremely important, saves lives, and it is always needed. As blood giving as a whole process including the commute could be up to 2 hours and can only be done once every 12 weeks, people able to give blood should not be restrained by work hours and giving blood should be immune to punishment or having to work late to catch up the hours. 

Essentially, what I mean is for those who use Flexi time systems, there should be an option to have time covered by a blood donation option, like some systems have ""volunteer day"" and ""work trip"" options to explain certain changes in day to day work activities.

I like giving blood, it makes me feel good, costs nothing and I make it all back eventually and am a 0neg donor. But it can be tricky to find the time to go and do it, especially when the appointments tend to be within work hours. I feel it is a moral duty to give blood and think it should be more acceptable to do.

Same to those who find them Courageous for doing so.",u/StatisticianGreat514,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dhjd37/cmv_if_you_take_pride_in_being_a_sellout_to_your/,changemyview,"CAUTION: LONG POST AND EXTREMELY POLITICALLY INCORRECT!

I wanna ask you an honest question:

**How would you feel if someone who is supposed to be the leader of the community that you represent constantly denigrates you in order to elevate their status among others?**

You would feel offended, right? Of course, you would. Because they're meant to elevate and inspire you so you could be just as successful as them. But if they're gonna do the exact opposite, they'll end up alienating you. And it also doesn't help if the person who's doing this doesn't even like him/herself in general.

This perfectly describes certain groups of people who tend to vote Right. Their main goals are to help fix problems affecting their community, as well as bring a sense of Individualism, Accountability, Transparency, and Responsibility to them. But in doing so, they constantly tear down their Race, Religion, Gender, Sexuality, etc. by denigrating them with negative stereotypes in order to win approval from others. This way, they can demonstrate that their views aren't as Mainstream as the rest of their Community. In other words, they want to prove how much they don't believe in Identity Politics. And while they're at it, they barely offer any positive aspects of their group. I just can't help but ask them if they fail to realize the hilarious and hypocritical irony when they spread such views. They always accuse the Left of Identity Politics, pandering for votes, and implementing the Soft Bigotry of Low Expectations, yet they are doing the exact same thing but much more worse.

Look at people like Candace Owens. Despite being Black, she barely says anything positive about Black people. She only looks at them through the lens of Poverty and Ghetto Culture. The only time she says anything positive about them is when they become Conservative like her. She even went further by stating that Women are the reason why America is declining because they use Emotion over Logic and that they don't deserve the right to vote as well as being a Destructive Influence at work, despite being a Woman herself.

To make matters worse, there are even Everyday Individuals who share the same mindset as she does. One of them is a Black LGBTQ Christian Army Veteran named **Ashley Evon Moore**. He writes blogs consisting of him explaining how ashamed he is of being Black and the Black community. He even further by stating that he has no Black friends, finds them to be his Enemy, accuses them of bringing Neighborhoods down, believing they belong in a Zoo, and stated that he's proud to be a Sellout (literally) like Candace despite her not liking the LGBTQ Community. Here's a link to it if you want to know about his mindset: [https://medium.com/@ashleymoore72890](https://medium.com/@ashleymoore72890) 

I even had the Misfortune of interacting with such an Individual here on Reddit. A month or two ago, I posted something on a different Subreddit and this person named **HalfBlackPatriot** responded in a lengthy discussion about how White people have built and contributed to society, while Black people did nothing at all but destroy everything. Oh, and he happens to be Black himself, hence the name. It gets even worse. He supports Conservative Radio Host and Pastor Jesse Lee Peterson, one of the biggest self-loathing Blacks in the world. Despite my best attempts to refute his Guilt-Ridden Arguments by offering Credible Examples, he found them to be Pathetic, Stupid, and Embarrassing. He even went further by stating that Blacks are responsible for the Racism they receive, as well as going after significant Black figures such as Martin Luther King, Jr. by calling him a Communist (despite him being named after him), calling the Civil Rights Act as an example of Forced Integration and Marxism, and stated that Blacks supported Apartheid, Nelson Mandela was evil, and that Women supported not having the right to vote. Furthermore, he even had the gall to accuse me of trying to supposedly manipulate Black people thinking that they are weeds meant to be protected. When he tried to privately message me for around a Month to emphasize his views, he kept repeating the same talking points. He even justified it by offering a Religious Angle and stating that he supposedly views everyone equally because he wants people to look beyond Race despite not doing the same thing himself. He even stated that he was being ""Nice"" to me and claimed that he viewed me as a Brother and stated that he's focused on being a Good Father to his Family. But if he really was a true Brother and a Good Father, he would not stoop to that level of Self-Deprecation. If anything, I saw it as nothing more than pure Manipulation and Indoctrination.

All I can say is that these Peoples' attempts to help improve their Community turned out to be nothing more than Humiliating Exercises in Black Guilt and Grievance disguised as Personal Responsibility, Individualism, and Accountability. If anything, this is the reason why they're called Sellouts by their community. And quite honestly, who can blame them. But apparently, some people (obviously on the Right) will find them to be ""Courageous"" and ""Intelligent"" because they're challenging a narrative as well as proving that certain groups of people are not a Monolith. Yet at the same time, they criticize White Liberals for having White Guilt when they denigrate their own race in the name of Social Justice Activism. So what makes the actions by these Black Conservatives any different? Because they're virtually the same. Also, by supporting such actions, you're betraying some of the tenets of Conservatism such as viewing everyone as Equals and judging people by the Content of their Character and not by their Skin Color. In the end, you're only revealing your Concealed Racism and Bigotry.

But seriously speaking, how is putting down your own people in order to get approval from others ""Courageous"" and ""Intelligent""? It's Cowardly, Pathetic, and an example of Shameless Pandering. It doesn't matter if you're White, Black, Straight, Gay, etc. All you're proving to others is how you don't have any Self-Esteem, Confidence, Dignity, and Respect. There's nothing wrong with thinking for yourself. No Group should be considered a Monolith. Likewise, Accountability, Personal Responsibility, Transparency, and Individualism from your Community should always be promoted. But using Collective Guilt on others by stereotyping them, including those who don't fit them doesn't invoke that. It'll only be self-defeating because you're creating new stereotypes for your group as well as building upon current ones. And we've seen what happens when you engage in that practice. After Candace Owens started shitting on the Jewish Community, she faced huge backlash from Conservatives that she got kicked out of the Daily Wire. Now, in her desperate attempt to make a comeback, she's trying to reach out to the Black Community. But they already rejected her because they had enough of her shitting on them after so many years.

So in conclusion, if you take pride in being a Sellout and engaging in any other form of Self-Deprecation to your people, you need Therapy and fast. Seriously, stop embarrassing yourself. It makes you look stupid. I say the same thing to those who find such people engaging in such behavior as ""Courageous"" and ""Intelligent"". You can't claim to see everyone as equals and judge someone by the content of their character yet believe that some groups of people whether it be Race, Gender, Sexuality, Religion, etc. are better than others. It's a huge Contradiction. In the end, it will be self-defeating for all of you."

Conscious experience will stop for you and you will be nothing for eternity. I can buy that what makes up ‚Äúyou‚Äù will cease to exist (i.e. your personality, memories, etc.). However, I haven‚Äôt heard any good arguments for how experience/consciousness can become nothing.

We have no real world examples to suggest what the non-existence of consciousness is like. When you go under anesthesia, you do not experience nothing. Consciousness simply continues, albeit from an observers perspective that consciousness was not there while you were under. But from the person who went under‚Äôs perspective, there was one continuous consciousness. Before you were born we cannot be sure that there was nothing, only that you do not have memories of something. 

I also haven‚Äôt heard a compelling case for what materialists believe it is like after death. Consciousness cannot experience nothing, or else it is not consciousness. Consciousness is experience of a world, and if you strip away everything that makes up consciousness it is no longer consciousness.

I am totally fine with materialists saying that ‚Äúyou‚Äù is gone after death (thoughts, memories, etc). But we have no clear understanding of what (not why) consciousness/experience is from a materialist perspective. The scientific method may not be the right approach to determine the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù of consciousness. Going bottom up and saying ‚Äúthis brain activity happens and we can verify consciousness is there‚Äù is not the same as describing the what of consciousness.

Since we know so little about the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù of consciousness (and even the why), I find it hard to buy that nothing happens after death. Materialists are taking a leap of faith by believing this, and it is not something we can scientifically prove. 

Some people may say the burden of proof is on those who claim there‚Äôs an after life because you don‚Äôt need to prove a negative. However, claiming that ‚Äúnothing happens when you die‚Äù is a positive, and needs to be defended as much as saying there‚Äôs an afterlife. The only statement that doesn‚Äôt need defending is ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù.

I believe this is the reason why all developed countries get their birthrate heavily reduced is this decadence. Many people online bitch and cry about being too poor to afford a house, a child, a normal life. This seems reasonable until you realize why it's unaffordable. It's because we have much more than we need. We over consume litterally and figuratively. But most people simply cannot accept any kind of downgrade or any movement to cheaper areas. They have to stay the same or get more MORE MORE! It's never enough. And this want for more is a driver of progress and a motivation to work hard. But after enough time it causes severe issues. Because you cant keep getting more and more without paying higher prices, without making your entire lives just endless work towards making yourself even more spoiled and decadent. Leaving no time for relationships, family, children and culture. People become distant, dead and deprived of the joys of living chasing what they believe they absolutely need at any cost when what they already have is more than enough. In poorer countries where people are working to just survive they rely on family. On connections, on community. Which is what makes their birthrates so high even though they live life in terrible conditions.

  
If every person lived as the average Developed urban person we would need to multiply our production by several times to keep up with their demand for resources.. And I cant say im not guilty as I myself score a 6 on that.. That if everyone lived like me we would need 6 times more production and resources.

Moreover, many Muslims countries have controversy over serving alcohol and pork to foreigners. Alcohol companies make a lot of money off of sporting events, so these countries usually have to provide awkward exceptions to these for a short amount of time and build, then abandon, infustructure used for alcohol consumption. 

Greece has the historical significance, being named after a town where it was originally held and hosting the first ""modern"" games. 

Also, the summer weather in Greece is comfortable for athletes to perform outside, and the audience to live in. 

Greece is a soft NATO member that can provide sufficient security, but also doesn't really have issues with anyone (except Turks). 

In 1936, Germany used its hosting to show the Nazi-party was benevolent and to promote Aryan supremacy (most medals went to Germans). In the 70s, Germany wanted to do the opposite, and becuase they scaled back on the police/military presence, (ironically), the Jewish athletes were killed in a botched kidnapping by Palestinian terrorists. This is a great example of how stupid it is to let countries try to showcase themselves with hosting these games, which is often used as a justification for rotation."

They despise other Native Americans with victim mindsets and celebrate the beautiful culture of Native Americans You rarely hear African Americans bitch about their ancestors being slaves, raped and worse and black teenagers today being killed for going to the wrong doorstep or black people being shot by a white supremacist at the grocery store. In fact, quite a few Indian tribes owned slaves and sides with the confederacy and fought to the death to keep their slaves. Many other ethnicities were badly shit on but mostly don‚Äôt have victim mindsets. Palestinians don‚Äôt bitch about children being bombed for no reason. Another thing, Native Americans with victim mindsets get offended by the minority white sports team owners who respected their culture. Come on. I am extremely proud of the fighting Irish, (despite worse stereotypes than Indian themed sports teams) Boston  Celtics (also a tribe. Not even acknowledged) but I‚Äôm still proud of it and my great great grandfather was a Viking from Norway (also a tribe). I am proud of the Blackhawks because of my Algonquin blood. However, these bitches with victim mindsets want to erase my history and culture. I no way support kids dressing up as Indians on Halloween. It makes me and other white people feel unwelcome in the US and Canada, despite large amounts of immigrants we take in with open arms in England, Ireland, Germany, France, you name it. This Native American victim mindset takes no responsibility for the genocides they have committed against other tribes as all ethnic groups have before, (hence, we‚Äôre all humans) and villainizes white people who couldn‚Äôt choose their ancestors.

Seems like that's a preresequite for any discussion that criticizes Isreal. 

Lets start from the start. Holocaust happens, Germans attack the Jews, then Arabs attack the Jews in different parts of MENA. Jews don't have their own land so they lack saftey. Britain attempted to make a Jewish land in Uganda in 1903 but it ultimately failed. Similarily, Britain wanted to make a Jewish land in mandatory Palestine. Many Jews successfully refuged. Some were denied refuge and tried to get in illegally. If they were caught they went to dentention camps in Cyprus. The Jews that did get in revolted against the policies that denied the other Jews of refuge. Through the revolution, Britain essentially let go of Palestine and Jews gained power and with the UN created their own state. This resulted in mass displacement of Palestinians (750k were expelled, 15k died). 78% of mandatory Palestine was now controlled by Isreal.

If I was wrong on any account, then change my view but as far as I know, that's essentially a summary of how it started. People on reddit and sometimes people irl that support Isreal often don't know the history which I feel like is the primary reason they defend Isreal. That's why I felt the need to write a mini summary. 

Now, there is no issue with a Jewish state. Zionism calls for it and it is of course fine. The issue is that Zionism has been used to create a state in an already existing state. This is a big issue. If not mandatory Palestine, say if the Uganda plan didn't fail and Jews refuged there, they would have no right to create their own state in there. It's unfortunate that all land is taken and no land to take but it is what it is, you don't have the right to take someone else's home even if you're escaping for your life. If they wanted to create their own home in Antartica or the moon, no Arab state or Palestine would care.

Regardless of what the media or your leaders tell you, Hamas' goal is only to get back the 1967 borders. They have said they would lay down their guns and create an independent party in sovereign and free Palestine. 

Misinformed/brainwashed people believe that Hamas wants a one state solution. Some Hamas members like other civilians do feel this way because of course that's what happens when you kill people and take their land but as a resistant group Hamas officially wants the 1967 borders.

The way the media makes Hamas out to be is as if they want 0 Isreal but forget 0 Isreal, hell forget the 1948 borders where Isreal owned 77% of former mandatory Palestine. They want the 1967 borders (instead of Jordan and Egypt running it, Hamas runs it) where they would own even less than 23%. 

Imagine making a comprise on your own land, giving up more than 77% of it and still not getting the little crumbs that would at least give you freedom. Freedom from dependence on Isreal and freedom from the aparthied. 

Then people wonder why October 7th happened. Who would have thought fucking over a group of people would create a sub group willing to fight for the said larger group and through means that are inhumane because humane means mean nothing to the world."

Do people actually believe that this is always the case when their content isn‚Äòt liked? I  mean lets take me as a viewer for example, on tiktok alone I  follow over 1,900 users and yet im only on tiktok for abt a half hour to an hour a day. No way am I able to watch all the content of all the followers. Sometimes i watch a ton of x user and the next I dont for weeks at end. Now imagine all viewers having this dilemma, its statistically just not possible for x user content to always show up and get the same views each time

Or ets say you do great content, chances are you may still be ‚Äöignored‚Äò bc your viewers will not be putting you solely down as the #1 thing to watch when they wake up, they tend to watch what appears on their follow or fyp, ans thats especially the case if your content is not unique. It may be good but especially for popular challenges, you aint unique

And im betting other platforms like this work similarly, such as instagram

Now lets say we do see your post, im gonna use me as an example again: On Instagram i also follow people who hold my political beliefs among other things, and that also means hearing about the conflicts in various countries. But guess what? Sometimes I ignore or even avoid those posts, bc I dont wanna wake up everyday to find out how many kids died here, how many people are suffering there. Call me ignorant and privileged all you like, its probably true. But emotionally and mentally I just cannot hear about all the bad shit thats going on in out world, I do my best to do good and reading about yet another school shooting won‚Äòt change that, hell it will probably make me feel less optimistic about life tbh

Or another touchy subject are LGBTQ+ rights, in this case im all for them and I surround myself with equally progressive thinkers, but some seem to forget that social media platforms have users from all over the world, and not all think the same. So during Pride month, its no wonder some accounts are actively receiving less attention than usual

Now granted I have no actual proof, i do have many articles discussing this but no definite answer for my side, but as far as I can tell, neither do the other ones, since in the end most don‚Äòt even know how the mysterious (insert *ghost voice*) algorithm works

Also: i dont doubt that some platforms are skewed in certain directions, hence why I said ‚Äöprobably not at fault‚Äò, bc platforms are in the end, behind all the AI, controlled by a human who has their own beliefs and biases, but i see accounts who harmlessly post family things or  dance challenges  and say the algorithms made their content shadow banned, where im like wtf? You really think someone cared so much about your harmless content to shadow ban you specifically?  Meh, discrimination exists sure but on a broader scale than that"

My opinion?

Any race can look attractive. Perhaps under different conditions sometimes but regardless it is narrow minded to only find certain races attractive.

Why is this a problem?
This leads to groups of people (e.g. Black women, Indian men, Filipinos etc.) to face remarks such as ""no black woman can be attractive"" or ""lol Indian guy tech support"" which are rather hurtful remarks.

On top of it the fetishizing of skin colours is also very cringe. A lot of people(nearly everyone) fetishizes Asian women, black men, Latina women etc. To an unhealthy and disgusting degree. Most Asian cultures (not just East Asian) also fetishize white men a lot.

Meanwhile nearly no one gives the same kind of attention to other groups of people like the ones listed above. 

I'm just sick and tired of this nonsense and the normalisation of it.

Are there some excusable exceptions? Yes. Perhaps Chinese and Arab cultures might not mingle well due to ideological differences and so on. Although this is rarely the case.

Because of you 3 people are dead! You should be ashamed of yourself!"". We don't know exact words.

The claim is that Kevin O Sullivan cheated on the ball boy's mother, and the father killed himself and his 2 sons after finding out.

Now, am I going to argue that Kevin O Sullivan is a murderer? No.

Am I going to argue that Kevin O Sullivan is a shit human being and deserves to be heckled for being a homewrecker? Most likely yes.

Do we have definitive 100% proof that Kevin O Sullivan was the other participant in Minde's (the ball boy's mother) affair? No.

But here are the facts.

1. Kevin O Sullivan was a good friend of the Ball boy's family for years before the incident.

2. Paul Reinhart and his wife just separated and were beggining the process of divorce after he found out about the affair

3. Paul Reinhart moved most of his money to his brother Konrad Reinhart and prevented Minde Reinhart from getting the funds from his life insurance policy after finding out about the affair.

4. Minde Reinhart for days leading up to his murder-sucuide repeatedly told him to kill himself because he prevented her from getting his money. Throughout the divorce process the only thing she cared about his getting as much money as possible.

5. The morning of his suicide he emailed his wife an audio of her telling him to kill himself and complaining about her not getting his money. The email read ‚ÄúYou got your wish and you can keep the millions.‚Äù

6. Paul Reinhart burned down his house and killed himself and his two children, a heinous act that should not be defended.

7. Right after the murders, Minde Reinhart started dating Kevin O Sullivan and shortly later married.

8. Barstool Sports implicated Kevin O Sullivan as the homewrecker, but later retracted to avoid fighting a legal battle.

These are the facts. Is this 100% proof that Kevin O Sullivan is a homewrecker? No. But it's pretty fucking suspicious the timing. Based on the facts, it looks like Minde O Sullivan cheated on her husband with Kevin, and tried to collect as much money from him and possible before running off with Kevin.

Let's imagine a situation where Paul the husband didn't commit that heinous act. If Kevin O Sullivan is a homewrecker he still would have destroyed the life of his own ball boy by KNOWINGLY and WILLINGLY destroyed the marriage of his parents (He knew them for years), and 100% deserves to be heckled.

But it has often been the case that people have committed violent acts which at the time have seen necessary or even moral to them, only for later generations to be horrified that a people could ever commit such acts. 

Is there any way for us to tell what is ""justifiable"" or ""moral"" violence while in the thick of the propaganda that usually surrounds it? I feel that the west has employed terms (communism, terrorism etc.) in the last century to justify enormously outsized violence against a people because the way we do violence (from a safe distance with superior technology) is seen to be ""inherently good"" while the way those other people do violence is inherently bad, so much so that even when we kill and maim 50 times the number of people or more, we are still the ""goodies"" and the ""peacekeepers"". International law, likewise, seems to have become a useful cover. Say you're different because you adhere to it, apply it when you want, use expert lawyers to argue that you are upholding it when you aren't, and then if that doesn't work threaten international lawmakers who accuse you of breaking it. For me, as I become more radicalised, all of this seems like a barely evolved version of England going around violently making everyone ""civilised"" for their own good (which, admittedly, many western people still think is ok). As we look back on history, western countries have started to admit that in hindsight that all of that killing that they did in the name of security, or liberation or their personal pursuit of happiness was maybe not super cool and then, when nothing could be done, they usually say ""oopsie, our bad"". But is there any way to tell this while the bloodlust and propaganda machine is in full swing? Is ""these people are doing the most killing"" not a good heuristic?

Just a note, I fully believe that Russia and China and Iran and so on are all fucked up places, so my view won't be changed by an argument that there are other bad actors out there and I think that many wars seem to have no ""goodies"". But has their been a time in history when the people who were in hindsight recognised as the good guys, the ones who caused the most death?"

Now, we've willingly created a technology that can match us intellectually (it knows everything that we know) and that can surpass us (by learning our patterns and, eventually, developing new and improved ones). Our intellect is the only thing that differentiates us, the only thing that has kept us alive. We created ourselves, or rather, our potential, but better. 

I won't get into whether AI will gain consciousness and physically kill us all because we are killing the planet. I doubt that will happen (CMV?). But what will happen is that in the next 10 or so years, AI will take most of our jobs. AI will do everything that we do, but faster and better, and only a couple of humans will be employed per organization to ensure the AI is doing what it needs to do. At first, that is, later on, that job will be done by AI as well. Because AI will make fewer mistakes and do it infinitely faster.

Not working is ideal, it even is the goal of many, but only when one already has enough money. What will happen to people when that status is inevitably never achieved? When people are poor, can't afford to eat what they want (if they can afford to eat at all), to go where they want, to experience all the things we used to easily experience from the 1960s to the 2020s? What will people do to each other? Domestic abuse rises when the husband's football team loses. What about when there are no jobs at all for him and he's frustrated he can't afford a TV anymore?

Are governments prepared to feed and clothe their newly unemployed, non-wealthy population? What will happen to them? To us?

I'm not trying to be a pessimist, I'm trying to actually visualize a future with AI advancing the way it has in the last couple of years. Assuming this technology will develop as quickly and well as everything else has in the last two decades, I don't see another way this can go. [AI is already, today, replacing employees whose job was to be creative.](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/leaked-memo-claims-york-times-154739344.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKjHJNIPgbhJVbUSMGnJ6pZCRo-4qlN7kC0BV7rLXHw21GR4NZQdhkJnKpdjYN5Cnh2rdaUYUviFnRG71s1-7GFYTNXm7wu4czFqheiVE2ZcpcXwV8YQ1GvDreh0m0KN4C3N1h7KLlIcT6sKrkRwEDrX8X6CE9TABmGYTuRjmmEK) Creativity was the one thing we thought AI wouldn't be able to do better than us. I don't know if it will actually be better than us at that, but maybe all that matters is that it's good enough. 

The industrial revolution changed the world. Put a lot of people out of work, but was good for humanity overall, it improved really bad conditions. Plus, eventually other needs were found ‚Äì people were able to get money again, better money, and were able to contribute to society, do what they wanted, keep their families and themselves happy, etc.

I think AI is one of humanity's worst mistakes because it makes us unnecessary in the eyes of corporations which we depend on to survive. It will send those of us from the West back centuries and most of us will be starving while the elites eat cake.

I‚Äôm also frustrated that the Labour Senedd government dropped default speed limits from 30 to 20 and then ignored a petition signed by over 20% of Welsh people demanding its reversal. Labour are predicted to win a landslide and in general I think it‚Äôs bad for democracy for the government to win by such a huge margin that their power effectively goes completely unchallenged.

I‚Äôm sick of the Tories‚Äô culture wars where they pick on immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community, and any other minority group they can blame for Britain‚Äôs problems. Reform is the same but worse.

I think Welsh independence would be economic and political suicide, and also Plaid Cymru backed Labour on the 20mph stuff.

I think I‚Äôd consider voting for the Green Party, but I do object to some of their stuff. While fighting for the environment is a noble goal I think they tend to push for rules which wind up being needlessly authoritarian while also not solving the problem (e.g. banning plastic straws).

My argument is hopefully simple. As of today, our best estimates indicate that 80% of all matter in the universe is dark matter. This matter is used in several places in physics to explain a variety of phenomena, including the very expansion of space itself or how quasars formed in the early universe. Considering that dark matter is something we cannot detect any interaction or reaction it's very likely it's simply something we don't understand. 

Therefore, if one could learn everything that is to learn about our current understanding of physics and said being were quizzed on how the universe really works, they would end up with a 2/10 score, which is by all measures a terrible score. "

Now many Americans cannot afford groceries, gas, utilities, housing, and rent.  Biden claims the economy is doing well due to his policies (Bidenomics), but also thar inflation is not his fault, being a covid worldwide problem.

Men can directly harm women or vote in populists. There are calls to actively silence the alt-rights and toxic manosphere, e.g. [https://www.salon.com/2023/12/30/the-worst-right-wing-influencers-of-2023/](https://www.salon.com/2023/12/30/the-worst-right-wing-influencers-of-2023/) and there are reasons to believe these guys are banned, shadowbanned, demonetized. This won't help. They are not a root-cause. Men who already hate come the dark corners of manosphere or neo-nazi to listen. People don't start their slide there. And when they are fully shaped complete zealots they don't really need particular populist to radicalize, as they are already done.

Ironically slide to extreme misogyny starts with casual internet misandry. I saw a lot of men who make outlandish statements about women. I asked them how did they come to such conclusions and what are their sources ... and it is almost always tiktok. Not some MRA influencers, but women. Women who produce rage-bait content simultaneously boasting luxury life-style and making fun of men, denigrating men, promoting ridiculous double standards. This is not balanced by examples of real-life offline women, because they don't have female friends. The source of their knowledge about women is internet women.

Rage bait is a social media strategy to make some content gain clicks, reactions, reposts - instead of pleasing the audience, infuriate them! They come to comment sections to express their disgust and share the link to make all their friends know what a horrible person you are. And it works. Hate sells even better than sex.

An interesting article about rage-bait:

[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/what-is-rage-bait-influencers-making-people-angry-1234976621/](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/what-is-rage-bait-influencers-making-people-angry-1234976621/)

  
The trick with infuriating the audience is to never insult protected groups (women, PoC, LGBT). If you make these people hate you - you'll get banned. But men are different - their hate is lucrative and safe. When they are infuriated, it is because they have fragile male egos, they are afraid of losing privilege and please bring in more male tears! 

It was told so many times that misogyny kills while misandry merely hurts feelings. I don't want to dispute this claim. Just misandry IS the great supplier of misogyny. "

These men got the idea that it was ok to rape or beat women from boomer women as they would defend their sons no matter what. In any high profile rape cases, the perpetrator's moms & sisters would be protesting against their boy's trial or punishments ( check it for yourself ) even if the victim was a tween.

For example there was a post about a man who did CNC with his girlfriend on¬†¬†and she told him no and stop but because she did not use the safe word they agreed to, the man continued to have sex with her, then he wrote how because she was panicking in the moment she completely forgot her safe word which makes sense because she was in a state of panic. Now, i read this story and found it to be completely disgusting from all sides no matter how i looked at it and then i went to check the comments and honestly i just got super mad. The comments were telling the man that the women should apologize to him because she forgot the safe word and made him feel bad.

Now why am i telling you this story, well it is simple. This is clearly not healthy sexual intimacy, and i know if you are reading this you will disagree that this is unhealthy. But how you asked yourself why is this healthy? because it is sexual? if it was not sexual, and it was for example a man calling a women the b word but because she is ok with being called that way, most comments would call out that she should break up with this man for calling her that because she should be treated with respect and have a bigger self esteem or that he is a bad person. But the moment you add a boner to the equation, it suddenly becomes ok

And the argument usually goes, if both parties consent then it is morally ok

and i simple disagree that if you do something bad like hurt a person, them saying they want you to do it does not make what you are doing morally ok. it is still immoral

Let me take you from the most extreme cases of this to show you it simply does not work

If i was suicidal (just how a lot of people who consent to being hit for example are victims of something or have had some pain) and then there was someone who wanted to kill people or hurt people and that gives him pleasure, would him killing me be ok if i consented?

If you say no, then your premise does not work, because we both get the pleasure because we both get what we want and we both consented to it yet you say it is wrong for him to kill me

so just because all the parties consent does not make it right

Also this has become quite normalized on the internet and on society that to beat up or choke people is completely fine is a sexual way if they asked for it and to verbally humiliate them and it is only ok in a sexual context as well which i find to be contradictory because why is it ok when sex is there but not when sex is not there

Unrelated but i also find it a bit disgusting that it became so normalized to abuse women like chocking and slapping a woman during sex that you will see so many social media posts talking about how they want to do that to woman but you will hardly see posts talking about women chocking man or hitting them because no man wants that to be normalized"

- Just don't really believe, and are doing it for cultural reasons / etc

- Are functionally freemasons. They believe that Christianity is ""their way to pursue goodness and morality and our conception of the Supreme Being"" (grand architect?) but that other people have ""their way,"" and that ""as long as we're all pursuing the same goodness in the end, why not celebrate or at least tolerate our different ideas about how to do so?"" Especially as ""who really can be sure whose religion is correct, anyways?"" After all ""you wouldn't like *them* imposing *their* religion on *you*, so shouldn't *you* abstain from imposing *yours* on *them*?""

These beliefs are extremely common in the US (which I guess shouldn't be surprising as our founding documents were written in large part by freemasons) but I don't see how they're compatible with genuine Christianity.

_____________

I don't really understand someone who says, for instance, ""Well, I *personally* believe abortion is wrong due to my religion, but the laws of my country shouldn't be based on my religion."" Then what *should* the laws be based on? 

As a Christian, you believe (by definition) that your religion contains the only true moral standard in the universe. If you don't want your country's laws to be based on the true moral standard, then you are asking for them to be based on a false moral standard. How could one desire this? Only if what they truly ""worship"" is freemasonic/post-Enlightenment ""religious neutrality""/""indifferentism"" etc. Their actions show that **this** is their highest pursuit, their *summum bonum*. Christianity is secondary.

It would also be like saying ""well, my *religion* condemns murder and rape, but I dunno, I don't think those should be laws because who am I to impose my moral standards on others?"" These ""Christians"" may try to distinguish by appealing to some worldly moral standard to explain why they would cave on abortion but not on murder, but that's the whole issue - as a Christian you believe there *is* no moral standard outside of Christianity. Abortion is wrong because God says so. Murder is wrong because God says so. Not because it ""violates consent"" or ""diminishes human flourishing"" or some sort of rediculous UN-endorsed worldly viewpoint. If you accept this distinction between the two, you are saying that the UN / worldly conception of morality takes precedence over God's. How can such a person call themself a Christian?

There's been much to-do about the ""danger"" of ""Christian Nationalism"" in recent years, and I do hope it is a real ""danger"" to the liberal order, but the shock and horror over it is weird to me. Like...of *course* Christians want the laws of the country to reflect what they believe to be true? Christians should desire Christian laws. Liberals sure desire liberal laws and to impose their worldview on us. 

And this is perhaps what the liberals get right - they *firmly profess and believe* that their worldview is superior to others and worthy to be imposed on others through the law whenever possible. Why are most Christians too spineless to do the same? They might say ""well gee, I wouldn't want to live under liberal laws, or islamic laws, so I shouldn't push Christian laws on those who disagree with me."" This is nonsensical - *some* moral code is going to govern the country, right? Why ought one not fight to ensure that it is the true one? 

Rather, the Christian should say ""right, I wouldn't like to be governed by liberalism or Islam because those belief systems are evil and wrong. Rather, I am going to impose the true and good moral code on you all and make sure that it governs our country.""

I just don't see how the whole ""I'm a christian but the government shouldn't be"" is compatible with Christianity. The traditional Christian view is that we must fight for the Social Reign of Christ the King - not merely in heaven, but right here, right now. Every nation, every law, every institution must be subjected to His will, and it is the duty of every Christian to ensure that it it so.

28,2024-06-17,"CMV: When people say that something is better than something else, they‚Äôre saying ‚ÄúI like this thing more than the other thing‚Äù, and treating it like that might eliminate a lot of unnecessary argument.",u/somnipathmusic,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1di1iax/cmv_when_people_say_that_something_is_better_than/,changemyview,"I took a class once where the professor said that everything anyone says is an opinion. What‚Äôs funny is that of course this statement itself is an opinion. Nonetheless, I liked it and agreed with it, and started applying it. After doing so, I felt like I was able to have better conversations.

He followed up this statement by suggesting that anytime people say ‚ÄúI believe‚Äù, ‚ÄúI think‚Äù, ‚Äúin my experience, or ‚Äúin my opinion‚Äù when saying something, it‚Äôs a waste of words and only serves to soften the statement for people who don‚Äôt understand that everything that everyone says is an opinion.

Following this logic, whenever I hear ‚Äúchicken is better than beef‚Äù (just as a simple example), I don‚Äôt hear ‚Äúif I become president, I‚Äôll outlaw beef.‚Äù Instead I hear ‚ÄúI like chicken more than beef,‚Äù and I respond not as though that person is trying to express an existential truth but rather is just speaking without insulting me with soft words, and I know that I can comfortably reply with ‚Äúno, beef is far superior to chicken‚Äù without having to be concerned about whether or not we both understand that nothing either of us have said is objective. Then we can go down a rabbit hole of how both can be cooked in different ways, or something. However it goes, we‚Äôre on the same page.

I‚Äôve encountered it a lot online where someone says something like ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs better to do {x} than {y}‚Äù and then I feel like I frequently read responses from people saying things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok to have an opinion but it‚Äôs different to say that something is better than something else.‚Äù Or someone will make a statement and then a response to that is ‚Äúin your opinion‚Äù. Yes. In that person‚Äôs opinion. That‚Äôs a given. You did not diminish anything about that person‚Äôs statement by saying that.

Frequently, the response I get is ‚Äúyou do it better, then‚Äù or even better: ‚Äúlet‚Äôs hear your music, then.‚Äù

Sure, you can hear my music, but I play and write what I like, and to me it is better than the highly technical music, but I don‚Äôt expect anyone else to think it‚Äôs better than anything else. Also, I am not a professional. I‚Äôm a passionate hobbyist at best. I like what I like and you like what you like.

If I see a bad weld on a pipe, I can tell that it‚Äôs a bad weld because it looks kind of chunky. If I point that out, it doesn‚Äôt suddenly become my responsibility to learn to weld and eventually do it better.

If I think iPhones have some crappy features, it doesn‚Äôt become my responsibility to make a better iPhone. I am not an iPhone developer.

I think therapy that specifically claims it will get you sex is a scam.

None of these things work. I don‚Äôt think dating is unsolvable or anything but for some reason there‚Äôs no legitimate education industry around it 

I do think it is easier to train someone to operate an excavator and get reliable results than it is to train someone to date, but there‚Äôs much more wide demand for dating, although the fact it tends to be B2C makes it a bit different.

My surname is Hispanic. My dad's family wasn't raised speaking Spanish (raised in single mom household), my siblings and I took Spanish in middle and high school growing up but aren't fluent, and I just visited my grandfather's home town this January. My siblings and I are white passing, but my dad and his siblings have a lot of physical features from my grandfather. I've been told numerous times ""you're not Latino, you're just white"" growing up and while serving in the military. 

My argument: While I recognize my experience growing up is different from someone who is fully Latino/Hispanic, I don't think that culturally celebrated traditions necessary define your heritage and your identity. I identify as an American first, but I'm an American who is of Latino/Puerto Rican descent. One of my best friends, who is half Afro-Panamanian and half Nicaraguan, has been told by other Latinos growing up in Florida that he is ""not really Latino"" because he is black. His experiences and the experiences of my siblings and I despite having Latino roots shows how much Hispanic and Latino identity is being gatekeeped in this country.  

Anyone from any racial or ethnic background can be Hispanic or Latino. El Salvador's president is of Palestinian descent, Shakira is part Lebanese, Mexico's new president is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, Peru has had a few presidents from Japanese immigrant roots, and Argentina's president is of Italian and Croatian descent and he is a practicing Jew. The media has created these narrow-minded perceptions of what a ""real Hispanic or Latino"" is and it is exclusive for people from mixed diverse backgrounds, especially BIPOC Latinos. When the media says ""Latino"", we are supposed to imagine Sofia Vergara or Marc Anthony. Hispanic and Latino people are by their very history and culture diverse and mixed. 

I've also known other Hispanics and Latinos that tell me they have been told they are not really XXXX because they don't speak Spanish. As far as I know from history, there are hundreds of indigenous and creole languages and dialects across Latin America."
0,2024-06-17,"CMV: If you are someone who believes the bible is to be interpreted as ""Literal events that happened"" than there is no logical reason for Adam and Eve to be Ashamed that they were naked",u/silversymbiote219,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1di3b0c/cmv_if_you_are_someone_who_believes_the_bible_is/,changemyview,"First thing i want to make sure i clarify before we get into anything is that the first half of the title is integrel to the argument im making. I have postured this question in a few subreddits and all of the comments procceed to complety ignore the frame work ive established by saying thins like ""why are you reading the bible anyway?"" or ""the adam and eve story is an alagory, not history"". So its pretty clear that the only way i was gonna get any meaningful disscusion on this is to bring it to a place where people acctually understand how to properly debate a topic. and thats why im here because this subreddit has always been full of some of the best good faith debating ive ever seen. I also want to point out that i will alude to several beliefs of the baptist teachings that in mainsteam culture are often as seen as problmatic. So i just want to let you know if i am ever making it sound like these are my beliefs, its simply because i am regurgitating the viewpoint of what those who would believe the bible would normally think. My views on sexuality as a whole are very much not in line with what the average church teaches. Anyway on to the topic at hand.

As someone who was raised in a baptist church, The Adam and Eve story was a pretty well known tale. for those who are not familar, a breif summary of the important details that pretain to my topic: Adam and Eve(who according to the story were for all intents and purposes, romantic partners/Husband and wife, etc) were the first humans ever created by God and did not wear clothing because they were without the sin nature that cause us to desire to do evil things. No one was ever compelled in their mind to murder, steal, etc. So without verbally saying it outright, their lack of clothes seems to be implied to be a byproduct of the fact that without sin nature, we will never be compelled to do any sexual sin and/or have lustful thoughts. so the need to cover ones body is unnecessary because it will never compel anyone to act or think one way or the other.

Close to the end of the story Adam and Eve break the one rule that God gave them and that involved eating a Fruit that gave them knowledge of Good and Evil. As a result, they now had sin nature, and as the story recounts, they now felt compelled to cover themselves up with clothing. Now if you look at this through the lens of our modern day attitudes towards nudity that we exercise in our everyday life, this does not seem crazy at first. But a gentle reminder that according to the story, at this point in history, Adam and Eve were quite literally the only humans on the entire planet. So even from that simple secular stance, the sudden frantic need to put on clothes when the only person who could see you naked was your significant other does not make a whole lot of sense.

Now allow me to address a few of the angles i may expect people to come at this from. Some people may think that the sudden need to be clothed may come from an awareness of the impracticallity of being naked out in the wilderness. Clothes are after all not just for modesty but protection from the elements. However the bible specifically uses the word ""ashamed"" to describe how they felt in this situation. So unless you want to imply that they felt ashamed for how stupid it was to not have a pair of pants between their bare ass and a ridged rocky surface, i dont think this theory holds much water. The verse defintly reads like that shame comes from a place of realizing that the world can potentially see more of them than they are meant to see. not to mention that under this logic, there would have been no reason for them to not wear clothes before they aquired their sin nature

i will also double address anyone who may be tempted to say ""well maybe the story is lost in translation"" or ""maybe its alegorical"". again this breaks a debate sin of exiting the established framework that i set up in the title. I am fully aware that many different people are gonna have different beliefs about how the bible should be interpreted, but i am specifically interested in hearing the arguments from either the Bible literalists or those who are debate fanataics who can play devils adovcate for them and see if there is any logical way to rectify this view of the bible with the seeming inconsistencies of this story.

The only way i personally could see my view being changed on this is if anyone can dircet me to other verses in the bible or other common thological view points that christians have been know to have that show evidence that their belife system sees nudity as something inheritally bad beyond the realm of ""who can see you""

In the church i grew up in, i was never given any reason to believe that being naked had any sinful connotations unless there was another person who could see your nudity. They believed in perserving yourself for marriage so they thought it was sinful for someone of the opposite gender to see you naked if they were not your spouse. but married couples were obviously fair game. seeing each other naked was    not sinful if you were married. When it came to things like seeing family nude or seeing friends of the same gender nude. I never heard anything from the pulpit that addressed these directly but based on the actions i saw in various circumstances, i got the impression that the general rule was ""since in most cases we dont expect you to sexually lust after these demographics, its not a big deal if it happens. but if you begin activaly trying to make it happen, then we need to talk""(again put aside the obvious problematic views on homosexualtiy here. I just want to make sure that i make the framework that they, and by extentions, those of us who are gonna talk about this topic, are operating within clear.)

So as you can see, in my experience growing up in a baptist church, there were plenty of loaded rules about who is allowed to see who naked. But long story short, their philosphy does not seem to give any direct logical grounds for believeing there to be anything sinful about being naked if there is quite literally no one who can see you naked.

1. **Suspicion of Authority**: Skepticism towards medical professionals and institutions, with some advocates arguing that the medical community should avoid discussions of weight.

2. **Centralized Evil**: The diet industry is often depicted as a powerful and malicious entity that profits from people's insecurities and promotes unhealthy standards.

3. **Self-Sealing Logic**: Criticisms of fat acceptance are sometimes dismissed as fatphobic or as attempts to uphold societal beauty standards, which can make the movement resistant to outside critique.

4. **Unverified Claims**: Some claims within the fat acceptance movement, such as the notion that weight has no significant impact on health, are not supported by scientific evidence.

5. **Echo Chambers**: Social media and online communities serve as echo chambers, where like-minded individuals reinforce each other's beliefs without external validation.

6. **Emotional Appeal**: The movement appeals to emotions by advocating for body positivity, self-acceptance, and resistance to societal pressures, which can be powerful motivators."
0,2024-06-17,"CMV: Phrases like ""If you believe men and women should be equal, you're a feminist"" are incorrect. ",u/LEMO2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1di5xhf/cmv_phrases_like_if_you_believe_men_and_women/,changemyview,"To get one thing out of the way first, immutable characteristics don't mean anything about who someone is as a person, nobody should be judged or put down for things that are truly outside of their control, and I have no issues with any group of people as a whole that stem from those immutable characteristics. Please just don't take this to a place of bigotry or hatred on my part, that's not what this is. 

Anyway, I find phrases like the one in my title to be annoying and incorrect. The simple rebuttal is something along the lines of ""no, I'm not a feminist, I'm an egalitarian"" but that's often met with strong criticism for some reason. It's objectively true that men and women being equal is inherent to egalitarianism, so I don't see how believing that men and women are equal automatically makes you a feminist and not an egalitarian. 

The reason I push back against the classification is that I don't agree with the idea of focusing on one group over another to the extent that you name your movement after them. If women are being disadvantaged as a whole, an egalitarian should the exact same level of motivation to fix that problem as a feminist. However, if a different group is being disadvantaged, that's not necessarily true. I think this realization is partly why phrases like ""intersectional feminism"" came about, but I just don't get why that's a preferable label to the one that outright states everyone should be equal. I'm aware that there more to intersectional feminism than just broadening the scope of the movement to include subgroups other than women, but the point still stands. If you believe it's strictly necessary to include all facets of someone's identity in your analysis of how well society treats them, there's no reason you can't do that under the banner of egalitarianism. I'm not saying that to say they \*have\* to do so under that banner, I'm saying it to demonstrate that the ideology is still perfectly compatible with egalitarianism, so even if the ""intersectional"" part is implicit in the phrase ""if you believe men and women should be equal you're a\[n intersectional\] feminist"" that still falls under the banner of egalitarianism. 

And finally, it's undeniable that men have problems as well as women. I'm not claiming they're on the same level, that's a separate topic, but men's issues absolutely do exist. If you are trying to convince someone to join your movement, it's a lot more productive to include them in the definition. If someone disagrees with the idea that immutable characteristics are irrelevant to who someone is as a person, they're irrelevant to this discussion IMO since they're not going to be joining either movement I'm discussing. But if you have someone who does agree with that idea, they might disagree with the label of a feminist since they don't believe it's fair to exclude their subgroup from the ideology. If you want your movement to grow your focus should be on making that happen, not ensuring that everyone agrees with what you call it, and the way to make that happen is to call your movement by the name that makes everyone equal, if that's truly the objective.

Yes, I know we need them in a capitalist society to have a functioning economy.  Just like we need lawyers to have a functioning legal system.  But everyone realizes lawyers are the scum of the earth and therefore we impose upon them a very strict set of guidelines as to how they must operate.  They don't get the benefit of the doubt.  And we do this because we realize that lawyers need to serve a higher cause (the administration of justice) and can't just be in it entirely for themselves.  That's why we allow them to exist at all.  And we do not accept any appeals by them to ""legal freedom"".  Break the rules and you get disbarred.

Yet being completely self-serving is not only accepted, but even lauded in the case of businesspeople.  It's dogma in the corporate world that their ONLY mission is to increase shareholder value, as measured by what shares are trading for on the NYSE or NASDAQ, or what the company might sell for or IPO for in the case of a privately-held company.  All other stakeholders, whether employees, communities where companies exist or do business, or customers can just go f\*\*\* themselves apparently.  Any and all attempts to force companies to recognize the interests of other stakeholders are attacked as ""socialism"" and a threat to ""economic freedom"".

But why do we accept these arguments?  Why don't we insist that businesses need to serve a higher cause (the provision of more and better goods and services at lower and lower cost, and creating more and better opportunities for gainful employment, e.g. bettering the economic circumstances of everyone) and not just be in it entirely for themselves? Why don't we insist that that's why we allow them (e.g. C-corporations, S-corporations, LLCs, etc.) to exist at all?  I mean we have no qualms at all about insisting other institutions need to serve a higher cause (e.g. universities need to educate students, hospitals need to take care of sick patients, etc.) so why not businesses?

Now I know of course quite well about supply-side doctrine and the ""invisible hand"" and all that.  But it is empirically false.  Wealth hasn't trickled down, and a rising tide hasn't lifted all boats.  And quite obviously logically so, because when you let one segment of society run rampant without any concern for the greater good the greater good will suffer.  It is utterly magical thinking to believe otherwise. Yes, of course there's a certain minimum you must meet in order to have employees or customers in the first place.  That proves nothing.

And as I mentioned we see lawyers as ""scummy"" somehow.  Why is that?  Well a lawyer's job is to advocate for his client, and that means twisting the truth as much as possible.  That's why we have to have rules.  We should see businesspeople as ""scummy"" too, because their job is to extract as much wealth as possible from the excess value provided by labor.  Again, we need them in a capitalist society just like we need lawyers, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't think of what they do as kind of ""scummy"", at least in terms of the need for strict regulation.

I could go on and on and on about the horrid consequences of the acceptance of neo-liberal economic dogma in Western society for the average Joe.  We have:

Outright scandals (Enron, Theranos, Bernie Madoff etc.)

Financial crises (2008)

Stock buybacks (illegal until 1983 since we rightly realized this provided a perverse incentive for CEOs to torpedo the company's long-term prospects in return for a short-term bump in stock price)

Private equity shenanigans (which is asset stripping not wealth creation)

Wage gains not at all keeping with productivity gains

Continual mergers/acquisitions etc. so that there more of an appearance of competition than actual competition between brands

""Startups"" whose only goal is to be bought out by a behemoth

Out-of-sight housing prices that make homeownership simply unobtainable for large proportion of the working population

Don't get me wrong. But I found season 4 to still be better. Seasons 3 and 2 are still better than season 4, but if I had to rank the seasons, I'd put season 4 in 3rd place and 1 in 4th place. Season 1 could be way too mundane at times. Even the great episodes suffered from a somewhat slow pace. But I won't be too harsh on it since it is the first season. The writers were still establishing the main characters and first seasons usually start off slowly, and the season didn't pick up as it went on. But I've talked about what made season 1 the weaker season. Let me talk about what made 4 the better season. Season 4 had gems like fear of a krabby patty, shell of a man, krabs vs plankton, have you seen this snail (the best spongebob episode), new leaf, skill crane and so on. Most of the epsidoes in Season 1 just don't compare to most of the episodes in Season 4. Season 4 did have some bad episodes though. There are more bad episodes in season 4 than season 1 actually, but I think the good episodes in season 4 just did so much better than the good episodes in season 1. I also think this is the first season, if not the only season, to make a good episode out of patrick being a complete dick. ¬†That episode is ""Rule Of Dumb"". Unlike, ""I'm With Stupid"", Spongebob isn't the only one to acknowledge that patrick is being an asshole and later on, Patrick realizes how much of an asshole he was being. I hated this episode as a little kid because ""Patrick was being a big meanie"", but now realize how well it was done. It also portrays perfectly how corrupt some people can be when they're given power. I could say more, but I just want to see what you guys think about this."

Obviously he cannot *succeed* in dictating reality, because he is in fact not God--but he behaves as though he were, and is therefore the Antichrist.

Now, Jesus tells us that the only unpardonable sin is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.  In other words, anything else is forgivable through genuine repentance, but there is no coming back from denying God's unique omnipotence.  By teaming up with the Antichrist, however, Trump voters are doing exactly that--thus they are committing the one unpardonable sin and therefore irrevocably excluding themselves from God's kingdom."

CMV: Most people who I see complain about tiktok on reddit, will primarily have the same few reasons: either it is all videos of people dancing, the content is all brainrot (such as skibidi toilet and the other jargon), or a lot of misinformation. 

I spend too much time on both reddit and tiktok, and can tell you that none of these reasons are really valid.

Sure you see this kind of content when you first open the app, but thats the case with every social media site, even true of youtube, ( seriously the default youtube recommendations are complete trash) but you just have to give the algorithm time to dial in on your taste. Which brings us to the real reason that tiktok is terrible: it is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù and most addictive streaming platform. 

There is something for everyone. Like history? Your feed will be full of stories and perspectives you‚Äôve never seen before. Plenty of sports content, a lot of really funny comedy, podcast clips, makeup tutorials, anime edits, SO MANY MEMES, theres a ton of fishing/hunting videos, nature documentaries, gardening tips. 

Whatever your interests are, there are thousands of good tiktoks about it.

The only real problem i have with tiktok is how much time I waste on the app. 

There is a lot of irony in how many clips I see on reddit that were on tiktok a week ago.

Sidenote: tiktok commenters are useless, if somebody asks a question on reddit, it is pretty common to see somebody respond with a high effort comment that has a lot of relevant facts/summaries of the situation, this is nowhere on tiktok.

0,2024-06-17,"CMV: ""Hating another country's government, not their people"" deprives foreigners of agency and fuels prejudice and xenophobia.",u/imaginer8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dichws/cmv_hating_another_countrys_government_not_their/,changemyview,"I often hear the phrase ""I hate their government, not their people"" (particularly in criticisms of nominal geopolitical foes of the US or West). For example, ‚ÄúI hate the CCP, but not the Chinese people‚Äù. The phrasing makes it seem like the speaker is being nuanced and avoiding bigotry (and this is probably why it‚Äôs repeated so often). However, this view 1) deprives foreign people of agency over their own government and affairs, 2) perpetuates suspicion, fear, and hostility towards foreigners that come from such countries, 3) worsens discourse about world issues and makes us worse at defending our own values.

My argument is essentially that we view the actions of¬†*our*¬†own governments and our responsibility for said actions in a nuanced way, but we don‚Äôt extend the same level of empathy to people that live in other countries.

**Before I start I want to say:**

* This is NOT ‚Äúwhataboutism‚Äù or an attempt to deflect criticism from the actions of foreign governments. I am trying to compare ‚Äúbad things‚Äù the US government has done to ‚Äúbad things‚Äù foreign governments have done and show how we often have a double standard. Not to say that either of those bad things are good.
* This is NOT moral relativism or a defense or condonement of human rights abuses. I will not engage with any comments that justify crimes against humanity. Moral relativism is a lens by which we can examine our own values. It does not denigrate our values to step into the shoes of another, and we cannot productively engage with others or have good faith diplomacy if we refuse to view our values in a relativistic way.
* I don‚Äôt strongly blame the ‚Äúaverage individual‚Äù for the actions of the nation they live. For example, no average American is ‚Äúevil‚Äù because of the carpet bombing of Laos. No average German is ‚Äúevil‚Äù because of the Holocaust. I do believe that we bare responsibility for what our nations do. Even if we are not ‚Äúevil‚Äù ourselves, we are responsible for critically examining those values.
* For the purpose of this argument, a past government of your own country could fill in for ‚Äúforeign government‚Äù.

These are my main points with some high level examples we can use to frame our discussion:

1. **A government and the people it governs are inseparable; A government‚Äôs actions are a proxy for the values of its people.**All governments are a subset groups of human beings that represent the population of said state. The values of a government are direct reflections of¬†*some*¬†subset of that groups values. There is only so much a government can diverge from the values of the people it governs before it is seen as illegitimate, and this means that government policy is a good proxy for the collective values of a state‚Äôs people.For example, when the US conducted 20 years of war in Vietnam, that was because widely held beliefs by the US population led to a large number of people in government that did nothing to stop it or actively pursued it. (ex. domino theory, anti-communism, racial alliance with French who colonized it prior). Hating the US government for Vietnam and not hating the ideologies that the population accepted and perpetuated denies our people of agency and the fact that they were consciously acting within a frame of reference entire time. We are collectively culpable for the things we do (or choose to not do).
2. **By**¬†**painting the government as a singular villain, distinct from the people, we create a narrative where the citizens are a homogeneous mass of brainwashed victims.**I understand my previous point sits on a spectrum, and we tend to attribute less blame to citizens in non-democratic states for the actions of their governments. But there is never¬†*no*¬†blame, unless we decide that such citizens are 100% brainwashed and completely incapable of moral or ethical reflection. Even in the PRC, where the Great Firewall guards citizens from what they are ‚Äúnot supposed to see‚Äù, people are still conscious and critical of the information they receive, and the actions they take or see their government take as a result.People often use this same moral copout for bad things that happened in the West, ex. the holocaust or the tragedies associated with Manifest Destiny in the US and Canada. The idea is that the government ‚Äúat the time‚Äù was bad, but the people that did such crimes or were complicit in its doing were just ‚Äúvictims of a system‚Äù. I think it cheapens the lessons we can learn from horrors, because we deny that the American Settler who set up a homestead in rural Kansas, or the chemical plant operations manager that perfected the war-time production of Zyklon-B were conscious moral agents capable of ethical reflection. We either frame them as completely inert (they were just doing their job) or so actively constrained they could not have done¬†*anything else*. Of course there are exceptions, but in general this is not true.
3. **When we profess to hate a foreign government, that sentiment can easily bleed into our perceptions of the country's people and culture more broadly.**With the above in mind, I think that ‚Äúhating‚Äù a foreign government often leads to us perpetuating simplistic beliefs on other people in a way that degrades their humanity.If we (implicitly, sometimes explicitly) believe that the average mainland Chinese is weak willed, meek, or prone to brainwashing because of how we ‚Äúhate the CCP‚Äù ‚Äì¬†we may treat someone that is (or looks) Chinese badly.If we (implicitly, sometimes explicitly) believe that the average devout Muslim hates LGBT people because we ‚Äúhate‚Äù the Qatari government for criminalizing homosexuality or transsexuality ‚Äì we may be less willing to extend sympathy when a population of Muslims is suffering.If we (implicitly, sometimes explicitly) believe that the average American is selfish, and doesn‚Äôt care about other countries because of (well, a lot of our country‚Äôs actions lol) ‚Äì we may treat an American as simple minded or ignorant.There are certainly ‚Äúfollow the party line‚Äù Chinese folks, ‚Äúqueerness is a disease‚Äù Qataris, and fat, ignorant Americans that couldn‚Äôt point out Puerto Rico on a map. But these are largely stereotypes, and giving into them makes it harder to actually make policy or have conversations that would increase understanding between people.

Truthfully, I never recalled exactly registering (maybe when I got my license), but do have a draft number. It seems completely inappropriate that the U.S. government could impose such a duty upon men exclusively. Women are able to vote as well as hold office. That means that women are able to vote towards representatives who are able to vote for declarations of wars and vote to enforce conscription. There is no reason that women should be exempt from this process, for at least not one that doesn‚Äôt remove women‚Äôs rights. If women, as a whole, should be considered unable to fulfill the duties required of a drafted person, then they should not be entrusted with the duty of voting and holding office. If you can enlist in the military, you can smoke  cigarette (reference to enlistment age being 18 and smoking age being 21). Similarly, if you can vote for us to go die in war, you can come die alongside us. 

It is clearly discrimination and arguably the most significant issue of discrimination between the sexes. 

Thus, my argument boils down to:

If women are able to vote and hold office, as men are able to vote and hold office, then women must be registered for the draft, as men are obligated to register for the draft.

For brevity I'll say GoT throughout my post, but I'm referring to both the TV series and the written novels. I'd be open to evidence from either to change my view. 

**Thesis:** The fact that John Snow is revealed to be a ""true"" Targaryen undermines central themes of GoT; moreover it is a boring and lazy clich√©. 

**Argument:** JRRM's has a good quote ""What was Aragorn's tax policy?"" as both a criticism of JRR Tolkien's work and one of the thoughts that inspired his writing of the novels which would become GoT

Overall GoT is a brilliant deconstruction of the fantasy genre. The characters act like real people instead of archetypes and tropes. Morality is complex. Violence is horrific. Elites play powerful games and the common people suffer. People are horny and have sex. The deconstruction of fantasy genre tropes is central to what makes the novels and TV show great. 

And then in the middle of all of this you have a lowborn guy with mysterious parentage, who finds out he is actually the chosen one with noble linage whose mission is to save the realm and defeat the big bad guy. This is an incredible boring trope. We've already heard this story...it's very similar to Aragorn. Yawn. 

The story would be much more powerful if John were just a lowly bastard, and all his success was achieved by himself. Not because he had Targaryn parents and was destined by prophecy to save the realm. Instead this choice reinforces the worst clich√©s of the fantasy genre. 

 More than being boring, these kind of tropes are reactionary politics. I deeply love Tolkien's fiction, but the politics of his story are not something I agree with. The idea that some people deserve to rule just because of who their parents are, and that their are superior and inferior races with black and white morality is a dark road to go down. Of course I can enjoy fiction from an author whose politics I don't like - I have a Yukio Mishima book on my desk right now and that guy had real bad politics. But the rest of GRRM's writing is so complex and good...I just wish he hadn't made this lazy and boring choice. "

so Tl;DR, mentioning the group should be allowed if the mention is in passing or a part of discussing a seperate topic that is related."

As we can see many parts make ladies more complicated socially in making friendships. For example while you can afford to only contact occasionally and still be friends with guys, if girls did that then it's not even a friendship. While shared activities are enough to maintain male friendships most of the time, this is not enough for women. Ladies also tend to be more indirect and subtle which makes communication even more difficult. I have personally been fooled multiple times myself because their communication is so indirect and subtle. I have usually not seen this with men.

The entire point of this argument is to mitigate the amount of children born into unavoidable genetic conditions - resulting in increased mortality, as well as promoting responsible parenting. I strongly believe that parents who are incapable of raising children should not be given the right to bare them. There are heaps of people out there that are incapable of caring for pets let alone children, and unfortunately - kids are born into abuse and neglect every single day - these tests are intended to help mitigate these scenarios.

Medical tests should NOT determine whether or not the aspiring parents retain the right to have children, but rather inform the parents of the risks involved if any genetic conditions may have an increased likelihood of being passed on to their children. The parents then have time to make a greater informed decision - and potentially even seek medical help to mitigate these risks. Yes I understand this is leaning into eugenics - but I believe as long as the right to have children still lays in the parents hands, it is still relatively moral and ethical.

Controversially, Parental preparedness tests should dictate who retains the right to have children. I believe for this to work, tests should evaluate only the bare minimums necessary to be a responsible parent. The main topics to these are physical and mental health checks, financial stability in raising a child, and basic questions pertaining to the responsibilities in raising a child. It is important that preparedness tests should not ask anything that pertains to race, culture or sexual orientation etc. - only towards qualifiers that directly affect the safety / quality of their child's upbringing. The tests could be retaken after a minimum period if failed. 

I've definitely acted as my own devils advocate, but am extremely curious into hearing why such an idea can be terrible in practise. Of course any type of argument is valued here, but I ask to refrain from using whataboutisms is possible (unless you feel its really compelling!). CMV

",u/ill_choose,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dimje3/cmv_its_stupid_to_assume_that_everyone_cares/,changemyview,"I'd like to say first that there are good arguments to be used in favour of veganism which to me are mainly the carbon emissions and general inefficiency of meat as a source of food. But to me that would entail that we should be looking for more efficient ways of raising animals that doesn't have that large of a carbon footprint or not eating beef since that's the worst of the bunch as far as I know.

But to the other argument of animal cruelty or suffering, I just don't give a shit.

Allow me to explain, it's not that I don't feel bad when I see a cat being harassed in fact It makes my blood boil. But it's exactly the word ""feel"" that makes me not give a shit. Decisions shouldn't be made on feelings that aren't backed by conscious moral values. Now your moral values could be that animals shouldn't suffer and that's respectable, but that doesn't mean it's universal nor is it imposable on others.

Now I can see the arguments about slavery and women's right from a mile away (and by the way I'm african myself) and to those I say that most white people genuinely did not care about black people's well being, and it's not that the few that did care changed the others' opinions it's that black people and women and other minorities fought for their own rights and slowly integrated themselves into society and therefore people learned to accept them and include them as fellow humans (as they should).

And therein lies the critical difference between the rights of humans and animals, I don't see animals fighting for their rights any time soon or at least arguing or doing anything. It's simply because they happened to be genetically close and thus trigger the same feelings that had to evolve for other humans in order to learn to coexist and calling me a sociopath or someting is only proof that you have no self awareness of your emotions and that your decisions are irrational.

The problem with these kind of discussions is that there is no basis to discuss moral values and usually you just have to sort of force yours on others by some means or another so this debate is sort of futile but at least I'd like to raise awareness of the non-universality (if thats a word) of your values and that any argument built on them is automatically null and void."

If someone is helping other they might do it for social acceptance or making themselves to feel good about It 

If someone is helping other out of empathy it's because they empathize with them and feel that, meaning they are feeling bad they have that bad feeling in chest so to get rid of that feeling they help that person so it'll make them feel better. 

Other might do it just for social acceptance or if they are gaining something from it whether it's a relation friendship or reputation

Some might do it because it's what a person suppose to do because it's ""morally"" right if someone is helping their friend in hardship, they are helping because as friends it's their duty and by helping they'll feel good for themselves.

Just like this those ""evil"" people hurt others because they feel good, they feel stimulation from this or maybe they will do it due to their own trauma.

My point is why is that so? It's a way of looking different than ur supposed to look like. 

If make-up (something that enhances your look or make you look a lot different than you originally look) is considered normal why isn't plastic surgery?

I agree make-up is significantly less harmful than plastic surgery, it's not like people force others to do it. And yes make-up does get made fun of sometimes, but its ""dislike"" by others is negligible compared to plastic surgery. And a lot and by that I mean a lot of women use make-up so it isn't as stigmatised as plastic surgery is.

These combined mean that the sight and sound of someone chewing with their mouth open is completely unbearable, causing anxiety, nausea, and distress. Unpleasant eating behaviours of other people (mainly my family) have caused me to be physically repulsed by eating and the idea of eating around other people, to the point that I have developed eating disorders and a terrible relationship with food.

It is the same with people slurping their food, loudly blowing on their food in an attempt to cool it down (which by the way just spreads bacteria all over the table), taking bites so large that the food doesn‚Äôt fit in their mouth and hangs outside of it, talking with their mouth full, and other blatantly obnoxious and abhorrent eating behaviours. This is not an exhaustive list. The most common one I come across is chewing with one‚Äôs mouth open, so that is what I will refer to for the most part but pretty much everything I have said applies to all of these examples. 

If I am near someone who is eating with their mouth open, and it is affecting me, I will ask them, ‚ÄúAre you able to stop chewing with your mouth open?‚Äù. I choose this particular wording so that they then have an opportunity to answer the question. Therefore if they cannot stop, they have a chance to tell me and I possibly can find some other way of coping if there is one. The most common argument against this that I have faced is that by asking them to stop, there is a high risk of making them uncomfortable/ashamed. Of that, I have no concern. After all, their action is making me uncomfortable, and so if my reaction is making them uncomfortable it is hardly my fault nor something that needs to be avoided. It is the person doing an action that should be asked to stop, not the person reacting to that action. 

If X person is chewing with their mouth open (doing an action, whether consciously or not) and they are making Y person feel uncomfortable, then Y should have a right to ask them to stop. If it turns out that X is able to stop, then they should do so and apologise to Y for making them uncomfortable. If, by asking (an action), Y has made X uncomfortable, then they should apologise. The situation in this scenario is one that decreases overall distress.

It would look something like this:
Y: Are you able to stop chewing with your mouth open? 
X: Yes, sorry. I didn't notice I was doing it.
Y: Okay, that's fine. Thank you for stopping.

However, if it turns out that X has a breathing problem or the like, and so has to chew with their mouth open and they have become uncomfortable by Y‚Äôs action of asking them to stop, then Y can stop making them uncomfortable by stopping asking about it and apologising for making them uncomfortable. The situation in the second scenario is one that only X can win, and one or both will have to leave to prevent Y from remaining uncomfortable. In this situation, the overall distress remains as it was before, or perhaps increases.

Another important thing to recognise is the difference between a need and a want. It is not simply desirable for me to not be around those chewing with their mouth open. It is not simply something I would prefer. It is instead something necessary and required for me to remain functional. It is a need. Chewing with your mouth open is not a need unless there is a medical reason for it (for example, malocclusion or you cannot breathe through your nose). In those cases it simply cannot be helped, and I will have to leave the situation entirely (if I am able to) or remain distressed potentially to the point of a panic attack or meltdown. 

However, the reason why the majority of people (that I have asked and observed) do it is that it is just a bad habit. From my observations, people take far too large bites and so do not have enough space in their mouth not to have it open. This is easily remedied by simply taking smaller bites, which not only improves my wellbeing but also your own as taking smaller bites and therefore eating more slowly has a benefit of improved gut health.

I cannot think of a single reason why someone who doesn‚Äôt have a related medical condition would refuse to stop chewing with their mouth open that isn‚Äôt them just being inconsiderate. 

I can understand and sympathise with the potential confusion or irritation of having to start or stop doing something that you don‚Äôt imagine makes a difference either way. Perhaps it causes an inconvenience to you, and because you don‚Äôt see why it matters it seems like much more of an ask than it actually is. But at the end of the day, just because what you‚Äôre being asked not to do doesn‚Äôt impact you doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not impacting anyone else. 

As an autistic person, I have had to learn that there are certain social rules that I need to follow in order to be polite, no matter how pointless or difficult-to-remember I might find them to be. If I do not follow them, I am being rude and so must be held accountable for my actions. It is not rude of others to hold me accountable for said actions, nor for them to ask me to stop said actions, and I have no place to claim otherwise."

Obviously there's situations like assault, then sure, if removing the fetus through abortion bears a risk of harming the mother. But for most other situations, if you're choosing to have a child with conditions, it just seems really selfish.

FRC found that the evidence presented in a March IPC report was not consistent with the ""famine"" classification.

The previous IPC reports excluded all commercial and privately contracted food deliveries, as well as the contribution of World Food Programme (WFP) deliveries to bakeries in northern Gaza, which the new analysis suggests undermines the famine classification.

When private, commercial¬†and WFP deliveries are considered, the FRC analysis proves the daily kilocalories requirements for Gaza have been surpassed in April, even if the most conservative estimates are used. The report also found that the food supply in Gaza is increasing each month.

The report concludes that ‚Äúthe FRC is unable to make a determination as to whether or not famine thresholds have been passed"" during April or May, due to the ‚Äúuncertainty and lack of convergence of the supporting evidence.‚Äù Projecting to the end of July, it states: ‚Äúthe FRC is unable to endorse the IPC Phase 5 (Famine) classification for the projection period.‚Äù

These findings should not undermine the fact that ‚Äúextreme human suffering is without a doubt currently ongoing in the Gaza Strip,‚Äù the report goes on.

The FRC states that there is an ‚Äúimmediate humanitarian imperative to address this civilian suffering by enabling complete, safe, unhindered, and sustained humanitarian access into and throughout the Gaza Strip, including through ceasing hostilities.

‚ÄúAll actors should not wait until a famine classification for the current period is made to act accordingly.‚Äù

Much of the report‚Äôs findings stem from the fact that the committee could not examine evidence due to ‚Äúthe lack of essential up to date data on human well-being in Northern Gaza, and Gaza at large.‚Äù

The FEWS NET report relied on ‚Äúmultiple layers of assumptions and inference, beginning with food availability and access in northern Gaza and continuing through nutritional status and mortality,‚Äù according to FRC.

While the use of assumptions and inference is standard practice in IPC reporting, the FRC notes that there are limitations to this evidence, which ‚Äúleads to a very high level of uncertainty regarding the current food security and nutritional status of the population [in northern Gaza].‚Äù

1) Property is a social construct and does not objectively exist
2) Good involves balance and the furtherance of life. Nature exhibits this teleologically, and therefore what is natural is good. 

This is background on my beliefs. I know many would consider the latter his the natural fallacy, from a virtue ethics perspective, I disagree. I'd have to reference Aristotle and Phillipa Foot to defend this. I'm glad to but it may be a strawman somewhat. 

Ultimately the argument is that although suffering can be more common than not in colonialism, it doesn't have to be, and to resist it always is to resist change itself and the natural human desire to influence things. This can be a flawed influence, or a beneficial influence. Humans have flawed judgement often, but the act of taking over a territory is not inherently evil. If it can be conceived of as done ethically, then it is not intrinsically evil. 

Here is an example of a new species in nature improving the area:

Gray Wolves (Canis lupus): Reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in the 1990s, gray wolves have played a crucial role in restoring ecological balance. By controlling the population of large herbivores like elk, they prevent overgrazing, allowing vegetation to recover. This, in turn, benefits other species and helps maintain diverse plant and animal communities. The presence of wolves has also led to behavioral changes in prey species, promoting healthier ecosystems overall [‚ùû]

Beavers (Castor canadensis): Beavers are ecosystem engineers whose dam-building activities create wetlands. These wetlands support diverse plant and animal life and help improve water quality by filtering pollutants. In areas where beavers have been reintroduced or populations have increased, their activity has often led to the creation of valuable habitats that support a wide range of species without causing significant harm [‚ùû].

African Elephants (Loxodonta africana): In some parts of Africa, elephants play a vital role in shaping their habitats. By knocking down trees and creating clearings, they help maintain savanna ecosystems, which support diverse species of plants and animals. Their seed dispersal activities also contribute to the regeneration of forests and savannas. While their impact can be destructive on a small scale, it often leads to increased biodiversity and healthier ecosystems in the long term

Here are some examples of human situations:

Singapore under British Rule: When the British established a trading post in Singapore in 1819, it was a sparsely populated island with limited resources. Under British administration, Singapore developed into a major global trading hub, with significant improvements in infrastructure, education, and governance. While not entirely free of conflict or exploitation, the colonial period is often credited with laying the foundation for Singapore's modern prosperity.

Botswana: Botswana, formerly Bechuanaland, was a British protectorate rather than a colony. The British provided a degree of protection from neighboring aggressive powers, and when Botswana gained independence in 1966, it did so relatively peacefully. The country has since experienced stable governance and economic growth, partly due to the foundations laid during the protectorate period.

Hong Kong: Under British rule from 1842 to 1997, Hong Kong developed into a major financial center and one of the world's most prosperous cities. The British established a legal and administrative framework that contributed to economic growth and stability. While there were certainly aspects of exploitation and control, the colonial period also saw substantial development and modernization.

French Polynesia: Some parts of French Polynesia experienced relatively peaceful integration into the French colonial empire. Today, French Polynesia enjoys a degree of autonomy and benefits from French economic support, infrastructure development, and social services. While not without issues, the relationship has been more collaborative than in many other colonial contexts.

The initial part of colonization can seem tragic, however, I find this analogous to wild fires:

Germination of Fire-Dependent Species: Some plant species require fire to germinate. For instance, the seeds of many pine species, such as the lodgepole pine, are encased in cones that only open to release seeds in response to the heat of a fire. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released in an environment where competition is reduced and nutrients are abundant [‚ùû].

Nutrient Recycling: Fires help return nutrients to the soil by burning dead and decaying matter. This process releases nutrients that were locked in the biomass, making them available for new plant growth. For example, in coniferous forests, fire can release nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus, which are essential for plant growth [‚ùû] [‚ùû].

Also consider the counterfactual if we wanted humans to never colonize since the dawn of civilization. This would mean wherever you happened to be (from the 2 million years of evolution to the rise of ancient Mesopotamia), is the only location you can exert extreme influence over. Imagine you traveled to a location with a sizable group, applied for citizenship, moved the people with your words, and then caused a revolution because the system was corrupt. In what way is a technically internal change and acts of violence morally superior to externally taking by force. If humans never colonized people would be stuck at arbitrary starting points, both morally virtuous people and morally corrupt people would be locked into their location since ancient Mesopotamia. 

In summary, colonization is a natural evolution in humans, resources, and leadership. It is not an excuse to be inhumane, but similar to how an ecosystem evolves over time, it is morally good insofar as it promotes change as opposed to staticness and is an important way humans change and influence the world, for better sometimes, and for worse more often. But to hate it, is to restrict the human's ability to change the world. I'm open to changing my mind but this is my current thoughts. "

My view is that if I marry you or am in a relationship with you, and the relationship operates under the expectation of monogamy, if you aren‚Äôt fucking me and maintaining our sexual connection, you‚Äôre actually breaking your commitment to ME. If I am supposed to be monogamous to you, but you don‚Äôt want to have sex (and won‚Äôt consult with a professional to get to the root of the issue or at least TRY anything to be able to fulfill the sexual relationship), you‚Äôre essentially holding me sexually hostage because you won‚Äôt fuck me, but apparently no one else can. 

I am not trying to justify cheating at all. I just am baffled by people posting on relationship subreddits being like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe he cheated when I was never having sex with him!‚Äù Because to me, as a young woman, it makes total sense to me.

I think i am starting to be convinced that men and women can't fully get along and a successful  romantic relationship between them is an impossible task for them.

The misogyny that women experience is just plain horrific. From frustrating sterotypes to discriminating obstacles to straight up violence. Plus it seems like women are just tolerating men and aren't actually attractive men. Just look at porn stats about what women like, most of it is lesbian related and they seem more excited, interested and hyped with W/W relationships than straight shippings. BTW this is all leaving out the obvious threat of sexual violence from men.

From the men side due the misogyny women experience, you have a lot of women being very fearful and cautious around you, some may be more harsh to you than how they are to women. You also have women who are really lack sexual interest in men either due to the misogyny or because men are simply not attractive or bad at pleasing women. Then you have women who are able of doing the same things men do to women but escape accountability much easier.

But i think the biggest reason why men and women can't work it is the power imbalance and inability to relate to each other. Simply put the physical strength difference between men and women are completely different, putting the weaker gender in potential danger of abuse by the hands of the one who has more power. 

Also men and women simply don't understand each other that's why you will find many bisexual people say it's easier to date the same gender because of the relatability and better understanding they get from each other. 

With how messy hetero relationships are, i think it's high time men and women simply stop being romantically involved with each other and find other ways to be happy and other ways to satisfy desires. 

But yeah i know this is very idiotic view to have but with the ongoing gender war going on, the idiotic view is starting to look reasonable. Care to change my mind?"

Although this stems from personal observation, social issues that stem from ""Generational Trauma"", or any sentiment that involves certain races, groups of people, socioeconomic statuses, and immigration statuses all make a point about how these people dont have the same opportunities as other people in society to succeed. 

So why don't we make it easier for them to have the same opportunities? I volunteered and donate to my local homeless shelter, and I believe they deserve a second chance. I advocate and represent groups of Neurodivergent students at my school for awareness and their safety. I am in no means saying these groups do not deserve assistance. 

However, if you believe that it is not always the choices of the individual, but rather tha circumstances, upbringings, environment, etc, would it not be logically sound to donate to these children who ARE stifled due to their circumstances, their upbringings, their environment? Why are we not focusing on lifting children up so that we can disrupt the consistent generational turbulence? That would play a much larger role in ensuring that children have a more level playing field than donating to adults who have already suffered through substance abuse, sexual abuse, systemic abuse, etc.

0,2024-06-18,"CMV: the root of many failed romantic relationships is immaturity, insecurity, and toxic masculinity culture",u/seriousgentleman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dixd6b/cmv_the_root_of_many_failed_romantic/,changemyview,"
Not directly, obviously, but my view is that far too many people have far too many problems with immaturity or insecurity or toxic masculinity or a combination thereof, and this leads to unrealistic expectations of the relationship/partner which together form untenable relationships doomed from the start to fail.

Let me juxtapose this with my current relationship. I‚Äôm more emotionally expressive with her and trust her more than anyone else ever. For over a year we‚Äôve been bound at the waist unable to get our hands off eachother every second we‚Äôre together. Despite this relationship being a ludicrous joyride, we have excellent communication and set realistic expectations this joyride can‚Äôt last forever but we will ensure our emotional bond and trust does.

Specifically, we differ on many key issues such as children and money and most of our shared interests are new this past year we developed to spend time together; she‚Äôs the Cady of mean girls and I‚Äôm like a Damien. We just can‚Äôt work out together. 

So, instead of expecting our joyride to last forever, we respect eachother going separate ways eventually; she plans to work as a geriatric nurse in rural Ohio whereas I plan to find someone to raise a family with and be the best father ever.

It‚Äôs because of this open communication we work so well. We‚Äôre so secure in our relationship and trust we‚Äôre both fine with hook ups and polygamy; our main talk there was updating and perhaps escorting eachother if we do so we can keep eachother safe. (I don‚Äôt foresee myself having any hookups as sex to me is all about the emotions and the connection.) I actively work to avoid toxic masculinity and am extremely emotionally expressive and open and never shy away from holding hands in public. (Sometimes both her hands and we have to walk funny ha ha)

I recognize many relationships fail due to one of the people turning out to simply be an asshole but my view is that less people would be assholes in relationships if they had  more maturity and personal responsible and had the critical thinking to defeat society-programmed toxic masculinity.

Please change my view and help me grow as a person via constructive criticism."
0,2024-06-18,CMV: Tipping at Restaurants is illogical,u/Juuggyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dixdet/cmv_tipping_at_restaurants_is_illogical/,changemyview,"The arguments that tip supporters make for tipping are either untrue, half true, or bias toward certain workers. Let me explain:

Argument 1: Waiters/waitresses make $2 p/hr

This is half true. If a waiter works a day and receives barely any tips, their employer is legally obligated to increase their pay to standard minimum wage, which can be up to $17 p/hr depending on the city you live in. On top of that, this $2 p/hr rule only applies to certain states. If you live in states like California, Oregon, or Nevada, waiters there make STANDARD minimum wage + tips. I personally know waiters in California who (after including tips) make $60 p/hr.

Argument 2: You can't live on minimum wage, so waiters/waitresses deserve some extra money

Now I get this logic; I really do. But the problem I have is that many people who say this only give extra money to waiters. What about cashiers? What about retail workers, amusement park employees, librarians-- there are literally hundreds of other minimum wage jobs that you come into contact with every day. Why do you tip none of them, but tip waiters? If you truely believe minimum wage workers deserve extra money, you should be tipping all of them. Not just waiters and waitresses. I hear a lot of people talk smack to people who don't tip. Regardless of how you feel about them, at least their logic is consistent. They treat all minimum waged employees equally. Unlike tippers who tip restaurant workers but ignore all other minimum wage workers.

Now I'm not saying all of this to encourage people to stop tipping. I just want to shed some light on the problem of tipping in America. Take this information and do what you want with it. Cheers.

Argument 3: Tips are to show appreciation for their work.

Humans show appreciation to other humans by saying "" Thank you "". If you want to go above and beyond by giving them extra money, you definitely can-- but that is a personal decision. You cannot make that decision mandatory, or ridicule someone for choosing not to. 

Servers are already being paid for their work. Nearly everything they do for you is apart of their job description. The only exceptions are when servers do things for customers that are typically against rules, or are extremely uncommon-- for example: giving you a free meal, or giving you a discount of some sort. In cases like that, then yes it would make sense to give them a tip-- because you are then returning the favor in equal proportions. But in 90% of other cases, tipping is illogical."

Assumption(s)/Given(s) (I'm open to evidence-based challenges to these): Equity's focus results in resources being allocated to help low students and explicitly does not focus on helping high students accelerate further beyond their peers/grade-level. Thus, equity stymies high students. It holds them back from achieving as much as they otherwise might be capable of. Also, there's clear research showing that in student grouping two things are true: low students do better when put with higher students, and higher students do worse when put with lower students.


Point 1: Because equity stymies high students, parents of these 'high' students seek to remove them from equity-based environments that would detract from them realizing their potential to pursue alternatives - mainly private school and homeschool. This negatively impacts public ed as a system in multiple ways - notably by creating brain drain and lowering enrollment.

Point 2: low students benefit from the presence of high students. The brain-drain that equity-focused public education creates negatively impacts low students who benefit from being around high students. More extreme... I'm now aware of some manifestations of equity-based ed that are so focused on 'grade-level only' content that it fails to serve low students. It's as though 'stepping down' a low 6th grade student to work on 4th grade level concepts is frowned upon because it 'places' them 'lower' or something. TBH - (as is perhaps clear) I don't even really understand the reasoning behind this focus on 'grade-level-only' - and perhaps it's less prevalent than I'm currently believing it to be.

""talented"" Often seems usually used as when a person perceives another as more skilled. Or saying it when someone is surprisingly skilled. Such as at a very young age. I suppose singing would be one exception, as that is heavily dependent on a capabibility that isn't really required elsewhere, other than maybe voice acting or speeches.

Also I've noticed with my own experience that even if you gain a basic level of skill in an area, particularly art. As long as you're fairly capable at creating something that looks somewhat ""good"" No matter how much effort you put in to get there, it's ""talent"" Maybe that impression comes from family and friends/aquaintances being positive, though still.

To me the term gives the impression of the belief that someone didn't put effort in, it was just natural for them to get to that point. It also creates pressure on people good at that area. Just because someone was exposed to, say painting as the first thing they were perceived as really good at doesn't mean they have to be a painter for the rest of their life. I think other options should generally be encouraged as considerations. Of course, on the opposite side, pressure shouldn't be applied to discourage either.

I don't believe such a thing as natural inclination to art in particular exists. I think it's capabilities such as memory, sight, observation, ability to focus and keep a steady hand, etc. Though all of that can be applied to many areas and those should be left as open possibilities. Other people's biased perception that a particular area is where someone is best in one's upbringing would restrict them long term. They themself might start assuming they'd not have any transferable skills to many other areas when they actually might or at least have the capability to learn.


Personally I think my aspiration is result of some degree of natural capability, though also to a degree natural incapability in other ways, even in my area. Then inspiration, influence and being ‚Äúuse‚Äù To the idea of it. Then sometimes I get obsessed with an area and people think it's passion or determination. When it's just lack of time management on the workaholic end. Sometimes the opposite too, or it declines to the opposite. Then people say I'm lazy. 

It's so circumstantial. Though I don't think words like talent, determination, passion, lazy etc should describe a person in particular circumstances or in the worst/best of their mental states. Yet people use them as if that'll always be how they are. Though that's so strange to me, why not describe people by their overall ability."

Prenups serve the same purpose, to outline terms in the event that your spouse wrongs you. Either by divorcing you, including infidelity clauses, etc. When it's brought up how these can make women feel men are quick to defend them ""Its just practicality!"" ""If she's not planning on leaving then it doesn't matter what's in the prenup."" ""Prenups can protect both people, not just men."" 


At their core, both exist and function as practical protections against abuse (physical, financial, emotional, etc) in an intimate relationship. If you're okay with one you should be okay with the other. "

7,2024-06-18,CMV: Capitalist Realism is an Inane Concept,u/KipchakVibeCheck,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dj24e9/cmv_capitalist_realism_is_an_inane_concept/,changemyview,"\[Capitalist Realism in this context refers to the idea coined by the late British Philospher Mark Fisher, which he outlined in a book of the same name.\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist\_Realism). To surmise, Fisher's theis \[is that it is impossible or at least incredibly difficult for people to imagine a coherent alternative to neoliberal capitalism due to its hegemony.\](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1cx593j/how\_does\_one\_conceive\_of\_a\_noncapitalist\_society/). The problems with this thesis are to me, rather obvious.

1. People can and do come up with all kinds of alternative social and economic philosophies. They might not be popular or immediately workable, but it is obvious that people can conceptualize such a thing. Otherwise Mark Fisher himself could not do so himself. Off the top of my head I can think of several extreme left wing and extreme right wing alternatives to neoliberal capitalism, all while being very much embeded in such a society.

2. Alternative ideas being unpopular is to be expected, there is nothing special about neoliberal capitalism that would require a book length explanation to understand this concept.

3. Fisher's critque of capitalism as being an amorphous shapeshifter that can just co-opt protest movements against it is not particularly interesting or profound. Any system that rewards popularity and that is comprised of humans would have tendencies of assimilation and coption. To use an example, a hypothetical communist society would very likely contain people who would spin any attempt at market reform into ""spontaneous democratic resource redistribution."" People are creative, and they steal ideas or neutralize their threat in all kinds of weird and syncretic ways.

5. Fisher's praise of the Soviet Union as the succesful alternative reigning in neoliberalism seems deeply suspect. If anything, the existence of the USSR made communism less popular in the western world and its reach into the third world was mostly due to its realpolitik in supporting nationalist movements rather than any kind of genuine, organic inspiration.

6. Fisher's claims that the welfare state was dismantled due to fears of a socialist uprising abating also seems deeply suspect. Many western, highly neoliberal countries have increased social spending over the past thirty years, and there are plausible alternative hypotheisis that explain various changes in social spending.

To me, it seems like Mark Fisher was frustrated with the unpopularity of his 19th century views and had to concot a grand narrative as to why he was in the minority.

My first reason for why I don‚Äôt like that sub is because the subreddits users are genuine assholes.

Some of the people there also have posts talking about how their going to go apeshit on religious people, saying that they will call you  gullible for believing in a ‚ÄúMaGiC sKy FaIrY‚Äù and won‚Äôt want to talk to you any longer. And the comments will all try to justify their toxic behavior by saying they have religious trauma.

The second reason why is because the sub users are genuine hypocrites. They always like to complain about religious people being unaccepting but also look down on religious people and see them as all being young earth creationists. They also have some double standard for atheists and religious people (which I‚Äôll explain in my next point right now)

The third and final point is that the mods are manbabies. You know how I said there‚Äôs a double standard? Yeah if you‚Äôre religious and go into that subreddit, you practically are walking on eggshells and if you do the slightest thing wrong, you‚Äôll get banned. If you criticize the sub, you‚Äôre banned. Call someone out for acting toxic? Banned. Even if you try answering someone‚Äôs questions about religion, you‚Äôre banned. This one person made a post on there recently called ‚Äú10 challenges for religious people‚Äù and all of the questions were either just condescending or generalizing us. I answered their question, but also said that I feel like they didn‚Äôt want an actual discussion because otherwise he wouldn‚Äôt be so rude about it and ask it in a religion sub. I then got banned for that comment and they didn‚Äôt say how I broke any rules, just muted me after calling me a troll and silently told to fuck off.

Just venting how tired I am of my friends all being into anime and insisting over and over that I try again or try this show or that show.

First off I want to commend the art and the labor that goes into it. Anime set designs and some character designs can be absolutely beautiful and creative. I will not fault anime for its art. 

I WILL fault EVERYTHING else: 
The dialogue is always stilted and unnatural, even in the native language. The grunts are a whole issue many people have pointed out that I can‚Äôt fucking stand. Someone telling you something surprising, doesn‚Äôt ever in real life have you go ‚Äúunhhh‚Äù in response. That‚Äôs beyond cringy and stupid. 

The plotlines are absurd, which isn‚Äôt a problem by itself, but they never take full advantage of the absurdity of it. 99% of these shows play it dead straight- and expect you to take it seriously. 

Hearing character‚Äôs thoughts directly should be saved for montages and fucking books. Let me think and make educated guesses about what the characters might do next, or how they feel about events that have transpired. Don‚Äôt have a weird pan shot with a reverb effect over the character‚Äôs voice so we can ‚Äúhear‚Äù their thoughts. It‚Äôs insulting to the viewer‚Äôs intelligence. Let the show surprise us. 

The culture around anime is the WORST. Sexualizing every woman under the sun, men with ridiculous designs that would be stupid looking even on Halloween, the morons who watch anime and have a superiority complex, like I ‚Äújust don‚Äôt get it‚Äù. We could be sitting on the couch smoking weed and having beers watching funny shit, and the next thing you know some asshole in the group is putting on V-Tuber crap or some weird out of context moment from Jojo‚Äôs Bizarre Adventure and expecting it to be the funniest shit ever. Like, dude, it‚Äôs stilted, there‚Äôs zero context for what‚Äôs happening, seeing big animated boobs isn‚Äôt exactly comedy gold, and the voices, holy shit. V-Tubers. If you speak English speak it in your natural fucking voice. Girls overly high pitched, men with comically low and heavy voices. 

God damn, anime culture is the cringiest shit ever and I‚Äôm tired of all my friends being into it. Your first answer is gonna be ‚Äújust find new friends‚Äù, and that‚Äôs a fair answer, but I live somewhere where there isn‚Äôt a lot of familiar faces anymore so we stick together.

Most American pickup trucks have a gasoline engine as standard. Sure, there's enough horsepower to get to highway speed easily, but not much torque to haul things around, which is what these were designed to do. There's also bad fuel consumption due to the weight, and gasoline is very expensive.

On the other hand, small hatchbacks and sedans have diesel engines, specifically TDI and CDI. These vehicles are used for daily commuting from home to work, school, or shopping, not hard work. They are slow and most importantly, terribly uncomfortable. The engine shakes and because the car is small, it's worse than big trucks and SUVs.

This is just my opinion, by the way."

There‚Äôs different accounts of what it does in motion. Sometimes it enters chimneys and leaves through the fireplace, sometimes it goes through the glass of windows, and sometimes it even chases people down. However after looking into it for a while I think it‚Äôs probably not real.

 Now I should specify that I‚Äôm referring to ball lightning in nature. The only evidence/footage I can find of the phenomenon is that [scientists were able to recreate something similar to what is commonly described in a lab.](https://medium.com/looking-up/ball-lightning-b594b6ffea37) This is better than nothing but I would need some actual confirmed footage of ball lightning in nature for me to be convinced of its existence. Just because it‚Äôs possible to get a similar result in a lab doesn‚Äôt mean it can exist outside of it. Besides that all I‚Äôve seen is some low quality youtube videos that have questionable authenticity.

Yes ball lightning if it‚Äôs real is supposedly rare but just think about how many cameras are all around us all the time. People carry smart phones with them constantly and frequently take them out to record thunderstorms so you‚Äôd think that at least somebody would have recorded it by now. Even if for some reason people just keep getting unlucky with their phone recordings and miss it shouldn‚Äôt there have been some security camera footage or something by now, but still nothing? To me it‚Äôs starting to sound like a lot like Bigfoot, a supposedly rare ape that lives in the Pacific Northwest that strangely nobody has ever gotten footage of.

I already know there‚Äôs going to be a lot of people in this comment section with stories like ""when I was 8 ball lightning chased me down a road"" or ""my mom who‚Äôs a huge skeptic 100% knows she saw ball lightning in 1993."" It‚Äôs cool that you think you saw it, but plenty of people have also claimed they‚Äôve seen ghosts or the Loch Ness Monster and I don‚Äôt think any of those things are real so anecdotal evidence means nothing to me.

I would like to be shown some concrete evidence that ball lightning in nature exists or if not that a reasonable explanation for why nobody has documented the existence of the weather phenomenon yet. Thanks."

*  School obviously took up \~1/3 of my day on weekdays
* Add another \~1 hour a day for marching band/general practice
* \~1-2 hours for homework
* Another extracurricular (in my case this was esports which I practiced for 2-6 hours a day depending on scheduling, when tournaments were happening, ETC)

  
Let's break this down into just one day, as an example.

* midnight to \~6:45 is sleeping
* 6:45-7:30 is spent in a morning routine/breakfast, this could easily take longer. 
* 7:30-8:00 is spent transmitting to school
* 8:00-3:00 is at school
* 3:30-5:00 is spent doing sports/band/other physical activity
* 5:00-5:30 is spent going back home + dinner
* 5:30-7:30 is spent doing schoolwork, chores, ETC
* 7:30-8:00 is spent showering
* This leaves \~3 hours of free time

  
To think that I would ADDITIONALLY work 4 hour weekday shifts \~3 days a week, and 5 hour shifts on one weekend... I seriously don't know where I had time in the day to do basically anything. I was breaking into the time I should've been sleeping basically every day. 

  
My schedule was pretty relaxed compared to some of the people I knew. 2-3 AP classes was pretty standard (and where most homework comes from) but it wasn't uncommon for people to have 5+. Those people often were also in clubs and working... I genuinely don't understand when they slept. 



Academic standards have risen significantly in the past \~20 years, at this point GPA is practically meaningless (in my graduating class a weighted GPA of 4.0 was below average). I think expecting students to work in the year 1990 might have been okay because you didn't genuinely need a 6+ GPA to even have a shot at a good college (and the scholarships that make is feasible), but in the modern day where it's basically expected that most teenagers are spending 10+ hours a day on academics makes working in addition to that mostly infeasible.

I will use starting a YouTube channel as an example. In my opinion, there‚Äôs not much difference in starting a YouTube channel and say starting a lawn care company in the idea that you‚Äôre starting a business with both and a good businessman will have a higher likelihood of growing both.

One will argue ‚Äúwell YouTube has a very low success rate‚Äù, you wanna know what else has a low success rate? Every business in every field ever. BUSINESSES in general have a very low success rate.

I don‚Äôt believe it takes someone who‚Äôs ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù to create a successful business, I think it DOES take a unique personality type, but you can have an entrepreneurial spirit or you can have no entrepreneurial spirit regardless of whether you‚Äôre a wealthy white kid or a poor black kid.

And if the poor black kid can be successful at selling crack for example, then he could absolutely be successful on making a YouTube channel that describes his craziest moments when he used to sell drugs, for example.

A policy based on socio-economics would largely still result in blacks being hired more often but it would also stop the hiring of privileged blacks over economically non-privileged whites. 

Basing hiring on race is bad because it results in more racism. Whites with less privilege, but superior credentials, resent being overlooked for more economically privileged blacks. I know because this has happened to me a few times. I grew up poor. Several times, blacks who grew up wealthy and had worse credentials than I were promoted, hired, or given stuff over me because they were black. I recently spoke to my mom about it. She was a valedictorian at her teaching university and told me that she was overlooked in the same way. She never mentioned it to me until I complained that it happened to me.

Another negative result of the racist policy (i.e., affirmative action/DEI) is that it place blacks in positions  they are not qualified to handle. I have seen this at universities (e.g., Harvard) where blacks are hired as high-paid administrators and need their hands held to do the job. I have also witnessed them promoting racist policies that favor black students over whites students. One black student mentioned internships that were ""black only."" How can this type of policy not promote racism?

I recognize that whites might not hire blacks if there is no policy to force them to do so. But a policy that bases hiring on socio-economic background would largely overcome such prejudices. And it would do so without promoting racism. That is, blacks represent a larger proportion of the poor, so basing hiring on socio-economics would result in more blacks being hired. 

Please, let's debate this. If I'm wrong, I want to know."

And like any other emerging and promising tech it will run different phases. Currently we're in the hype phase where there's no shortage investment capital and imagined capabilities. But sooner or later the hype will die down and we will find out what it really can do. Are there valid use cases? Yes. Will it replace certain jobs? Yes. Can it do things humans can't do? Yes. Will it change everything? Probably no.

The first hurdle it will encounter is simply the lack of useful training data. There's only so much data available. Text, in form of books or internet comments, is probably already pretty much exhausted. The same will soon probably be true for image, video, genetic, behavioral and other data. Most of this data is also redundant, even the most advanced models can't squeeze out many more patterns from a limited pool of entropy. There's also the AI Ouroboros problem. As AI is adopted more and more data will end up in the training data that was generated by other AI. And as the old saying goes: Garbage in, garbage out.

The second problem is money. Or more precisely, the law of diminishing returns. Currently AI is improving at a very fast pace, but so is also the costs of training those models. GPT-4 needed 100 million, while GPT-5 needed over 1.0 billion USD. Maybe the costs are justified and GPT-5 is really 10 times better than it's predecessor. But I doubt this trend will continue forever. If GPT-6 costs 10 billion but it only improves by a factor of 2x then it might not be the worth the investment.

This leads us in problem numoro 3: The costs is the result of limited resources. There's only a limited amount of electricity and processors in the world. Digital currency went through the same problems. And we are also approaching hard physical limitations when it comes to improvements in semi-conductor fabrication. If you include R&D costs, the cost per transistor has stopped falling to the same degree it did over the last 50 years. Moore's law is coming to an end, if it isn't already dead. New digital integrated circuit technologies, which none is production ready btw, could push this only for a few years into the future, because even the most advanced switch can't be smaller than an atom. Unless there's some breakthrough that lowers the energy costs per computation or is significantly faster I don't see how AI can improve much more. Human brains are still several orders more energy efficient than even the best chip, and in the end AI must also be cost competitive on that scale.

So, in the end I don't think AI will take over the world. We will see AI used on a wide range of applications, but those application will fill in particular niches. I don't think its adoption will have the impact on the scale of the steam engine, the printing press or even the internet. It will make warfare a little more dangerous, surveillance will increase and few people will make a lot of money. But it won't restructure societies significantly.

160,2024-06-18,CMV: Social democracy is better than communism,u/Rtan-Appreciator,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dj8h5y/cmv_social_democracy_is_better_than_communism/,changemyview,"Social democracy in this case refers to the system in which a democratic government aims to provide a safety net for those at risk of falling into poverty as well as universally accessible and free or affordable public services as well as equal opportunity for all its citizens while reducing income inequality and ensuring favourable working conditions through strong labour unions and strict labour laws. 

Examples of very succesful social democracies are the nordic countries with all other western democracies practicing social democracy to varying levels of success. 

Additionally, it is a factual statement that social democracies have always had better of standards in all quartiles than communist countries even when given roughly the same starting conditions like Finland and Russia.

Communism in this case refers to the attempts at practicing it with the goal of labour control of all the factors of production with an absence of private property and a currency.

In theory communism sounds great however in practice it has always resulted in an authoritarian dictatorships of some form in countries like the USSR and the PRC. People often blame this authoritarian aspect of attempts at communism on an alleged attack by capitalist nations on any countries attempting communism and then pointing towards the civil wars in the afforementioned PRC and USSR at the time of their founding and CIA coups in latin america. For the USSR and the PRC specifically this does not make sense as an argument as most new governments are founded at the end of a period of strife or undergo a large crisis at or slightly after their founding. Examples of this are the Israeli independance war, the revolutionary war in the US and the Finnish civil war. In all these cases a new government was embroiled in a war immediately before or after their founding with the resulting government not being authoritarian regimes even under the pressure of far larger governments. The ability of an ideology or government to withstand such a crisis without succumbing to authoritarianism is central to the long term wellbeing of the populace and any good ideology.

When talking about social democracy in particular many supporters of communism often simply state that it doesnt work and is based on the backs of colonialism and imperialism before dismissing it entirely. This however also makes no sense as there are many examples of countries which have never practiced imperialism or colonialism still being thriving social democracies like for example Finland. Even then, the benefit of colonialism has never been that great with most colonies being entirely unprofitable and economic bursens on their overlords. That the exploitation of other countries is the only eay social democracy can exist is further contradicted by the fact that social democracies with colonial empires did not collapse after their colonial empires fell apart. 

This is why I think social democracy is better than communism. It is much less likely to fall to authoritarianism in times of crisis, provides better results economically and yields better standards of living for its populace."

His legacy is half a century of anti-intellectualism, and apologetics for dictators.

In the 1970s, he was a denier of the Cambodian genocide and Pol Pot.

Naturally, because US politics is a clown show, this devolved into everyone pointing fingers.

Of course, the American right wing collectively went after Joe Biden, and the Democrats (of which I am a member) all collectively decided on ""corporate greed"" as the scapegoat in response. This kind of makes sense practically, because who wants to defend nameless rich business execs? Realistically, though, my own party baffles me with this take. Here's [John Stewart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU3rGFyN5uQ) in one of many instances where he's talking on the topic. Many other commentators can be found making the same argument. Hell, you can find it all over Reddit.

The way I see it, saying corporate greed caused inflation is like saying gravity caused a plane crash. Like, sure, technically I guess that's correct, but you are using a constant to explain a variable. The plane crashed because the engine exploded, not because gravity suddenly showed up. Similarly, corporations have always been greedy, and they have always been setting prices to maximize profits. That's what corporations do. Did you think McDonald's made the dollar menu out of the goodness of their heart? Of course not. 

Any Econ 101 class on earth literally the FIRST thing they teach you is the supply and demand graph. Corporations realized the market value of goods was higher, they could maximize revenue by adjusting prices, and they did so. *There's a reason you'll never hear about ""corporate greed"" in an Econ class‚Äî corporations exist to make money!*

Furthermore, I keep hearing about ""record profits"" and how corporations are ""bragging about them on their earnings calls."" Has anyone ever worked a corporate job? I obviously don't blame you if you haven't, but that's literally what always happens on earnings calls. Everyone is hired to a company to help sell more X, Y, and Z. When you do a lot of that‚Äî so you have good profits‚Äî people are going to be happy on the calls. "

The influx of center-left voters into the Green Party shifts their party platform to the right, aligning more with traditional Democratic values. Meanwhile, Republicans have spent eight or more years with the Presidency and undreamed of majorities in the House and Senate, enacting restrictive election legislation which cements right-wing dominance for decades to come.

Of all the days I've spent online(over a decade) the amount of hatred for blacks seems different. It doesn't seem like a few fucked up people who are ill. But it seems like normal people who have bad experiences with blacks. Even casually bringing up how africa as a whole is behind because of our IQ. 

I feel like the average non black person would look at their ancestors achievements and think why haven't any sub Sahara African contributed to anything? They would think that blacks are simply dumber because evolution didn't have the same selective pressure. 

 For example, can you name one thing a black person has invented that changed the world? No. But your average non black person would probably think about it and think to themselves there something wrong with blacks. They must not be the same as us since they haven't given the world anything. What Nobel prizes have any blacks won? What contributions other than entertainment have they brought? Why is it always whites and Asians doing impactful stuff?  

Here is my thought process. 

Imagine a person who isn't sub Sahara African. They probably have a country with some history. They're probably proud of it. They probably seen ads of starving African kids that could be saved for a dollar a day. 

They probably learned about IQ differences
 They probably believe in evolution and think sub Sahara African evolved differently and that's why there struggling. So now they sub consciously avoid blacks. 

This is how I view every non white person. That they secretly judge me for being a low iq monkey.

This is not intended as an affront to the LGBTQ+ community but rather as an acknowledgment of diversity in sexual orientation and a celebration of individual identities. The LGBTQ+ community rightly displays their pride through flags that represent their identities and struggles. These flags have become symbols of acceptance, visibility, and unity. However, there seems to be a hesitancy or even resistance when it comes to the idea of a pride flag for straight people. Being straight is a natural orientation, just like being gay, bisexual, or any other sexual orientation. It‚Äôs not about superiority or trying to overshadow LGBTQ+ pride. It‚Äôs about affirming one‚Äôs own identity without guilt or stigma. Having a straight pride flag would provide a platform for heterosexual individuals to celebrate who they are without feeling marginalized or excluded from the pride movement. It would promote inclusivity and understanding among all orientations, fostering a culture where diversity is embraced across the spectrum of sexual identities. Moreover, the existence of a straight pride flag does not negate or diminish the significance of LGBTQ+ pride flags. Rather, it recognizes that pride is a universal human experience, transcending sexual orientation. What do you all think though?"

0,2024-06-19,CMV: The autonomy argument for abortion is weak,u/Powerful-Garage6316,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1djeo1d/cmv_the_autonomy_argument_for_abortion_is_weak/,changemyview,"I‚Äôm pro-choice but for a different reason. I think the moral permissibility of killing a fetus hinges entirely on whether the fetus has been granted personhood and that the autonomy of the woman is secondary to this. 

There are different subjective criteria we can use to establish personhood. I think mine is fairly consistent which is: personhood should be granted when the conscious experience has formed. Of course we could never exactly pin this down, but the most conservative estimate I‚Äôve seen based on the data is that it‚Äôs around 20 weeks. 

I think this is a reasonable standard for personhood because the conscious experience is what we seem to value most about human beings. It‚Äôs why we think it‚Äôs fair to pull the plug on someone whose conscious experience has been indefinitely terminated. If Tim is essentially brain dead but his body is being artificially kept alive, we wouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúit‚Äôs still tim, he‚Äôs right there‚Äù. We would say it‚Äôs Tim‚Äôs body. However, if we could hypothetically keep Tim‚Äôs brain alive in a different body, we‚Äôd say it IS tim still. I don‚Äôt believe that moral rules apply to permanently unconscious or not-yet conscious bodies.

All of this being said, abortion is fair game prior to 20 weeks for any reason in my view. 


Now, the autonomy argument allows abortion in virtue of a woman‚Äôs inherent ownership of her own body. They would say that it‚Äôs not the prerogative of a governmental body, or any other human for that matter, to decide which surgeries she‚Äôs allowed to have or to force her to remain pregnant. I often hear proponents use language about fetuses like ‚Äúthey‚Äôre aggressors‚Äù or ‚Äúthey‚Äôre violating autonomy‚Äù which is odd to me. 

I think if we‚Äôre talking about ethics here, then what actually matters is whether or not it‚Äôs *merely* a woman‚Äôs body or if there are two that need to be considered. 

To keep this relatively concise, I‚Äôm going to jump into 2 cases to illustrate my thoughts on consent. 

Case 1: consensual sex

In this scenario, a man and a woman engage in consensual sex and I will even grant that they take full precautions. Nevertheless, when you have sex with someone, there is an implicit understanding that you might end up pregnant. It‚Äôs like signing a contract; you should understand the risk of what you‚Äôre about to do. In this regard, the woman is tacitly consenting to the potential creation of a fetus. 

If she inadvertently gets pregnant, then there‚Äôs a 20 week grace period to terminate the pregnancy. This seems like a pretty fair deal to me. 


Case 2: nonconsensual sex

I‚Äôm aware this is a difficult position to defend, but I think we can perform a reductio for any stance on abortion that one ought to just own if they want to be consistent. 

If a rape occurs causing a pregnancy, then I believe that both the woman and the fetus have been aggressed on. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to characterize the fetus itself as some type of violator of autonomy when it didn‚Äôt consent to being formed in the womb. The man is the aggressor in this case. 

Similarly in this case, the mother has the right to terminate the fetus by 20 weeks. Otherwise I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs morally permissible to kill it if it IS indeed a person. We wouldn‚Äôt say in other circumstances that because one is victimized, they are allowed to kill an innocent party. 

It also seems entirely inconsistent when people say abortion is wrong, except in cases of rape. Is it a person or not? That‚Äôs what matters.

And I have noticed something about the training. Based on the training some peoples discomfort is considered more important than others. This creates a sort of higherachy of outrage or discomfort of you will. 

So within the training there was a modul. Where in the example given Tim was not comfortable working with James because James was gay. Tim was talking to a coworker about the fact that because of his religious beliefs he was uncomfortable working with a homosexual. James overhears this and it makes him uncomfortable working with Tim. This was fallowed up with, what should Tim do? And the correct answer was, according to the training, that even though the sentiment was not expressed directly to James that he was being harassed for being gay by Tim and should go to HR. Considering that sexual orientation and religion are both protected classes, the idea that James being uncomfortable with Tim's religious beliefs was more important than Tim's being uncomfortable with James sexual orientation. Means that they are saying sexual orientation is more protected than religion. There where more examples similar to this within the training. Including one where some girl was of a specific religion that could not eat  meat. And the team was going out to dinner, after hours where they would be discussing business. In this case the training said her religious belief trumped other people's dietary preferences and that the team should only socialize outside of work if they go to a vegetarian restaurant to avoid offending her. And that not including her was possible discrimination. The question this raised to me was apparently religion is important enough to force people into a dietary pattern not to offend some one but not important enough to force people to accommodate comfort versus sexual orientations. 

Ultimately this lead me to the conclusion that what the real answer should be if the training actually aimed to create a work environment where people where not uncomfortable that is fully impossible on a realistic level. But the real answer should be sexuality should not be in the workplace and unless it is assumed based on something Tim should not be made aware that James is gay. And she can either go to a restaurant that meets everyone's dietary needs and simply choose to eat vegetarian for herself or they should not socialize over a meal. But more likely, stop doing business planning outside of business hours off the clock. 

Anyways. CMV: this training based on the information above is not clear in its message, and actively encouraged discriminating agents a persons religious beliefs in the name of making some one comfortable about there sexuality, in the workplace."
6,2024-06-19,"CMV: The public [opinion] holds the State of Israel to a higher standard than its neighboring nations, and in my opinion this double standard is a form of racism",u/iamBETTO,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1djg2pl/cmv_the_public_opinion_holds_the_state_of_israel/,changemyview,"I've noticed that Israel is often held to a much higher standard than its neighboring countries in the Middle East (Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, etc.).   
The lack of condemnation for what's going on in places like Syria, Yemen, etc. compared to the demonization that Israel is going through and the disparity in expectations seems unfair and, in my view, can be considered a form of racism. Why is it that Israel and the Jews are held to a higher standard than the Arabs and Muslims? It is a genuine intellectual confusing that I am facing.

Here are a few points to help you understand my perspective:

1. Israel's actions, particularly in conflicts, receive intense international scrutiny and media coverage compared to those of neighboring countries. For example, human rights violations or military actions by other countries in the region often receive little to no attention and criticism by the public opinion around the world, especially the Western society.
2. The United Nations and other international bodies frequently criticize Israel. While holding any nation accountable for human rights is essential, the massively disproportionate focus on Israel compared to countries with actual abysmal human rights records seems extremely biased.
3. Israel is a small country surrounded by many adversarial states. The unique security challenges it faces often lead to measures that, while controversial, are deemed necessary by its government for national security. However, these measures are often judged without considering the historical and geopolitical context. For example, it took the USA 9 months to take out 5,000 ISIS members in Mosul, Iraq. Nobody bats an eye. Meanwhile, the Israeli Defense Force took out up to 15,000 Hamas members, within far more intense Urban Warfare conditions than Mosul, in a span of around 7 months, with less civilian to combatant ratio, yet faces severe scrutiny from the public.
4. Israel is often compared to Western democracies and expected to uphold similar standards. While it's reasonable to expect democracies to adhere to high standards, it seems unfair not to consider that Israel operates in a significantly different and more hostile environment.
5. Some of the criticism against Israel appears to blur the lines with anti-Semitic sentiments, where the Jewish state is held to standards that are not equally applied to others, potentially fueling prejudice against Jews worldwide.

I believe that holding any country to a standard is important for international accountability. However, the disproportionate expectations placed on Israel, while overlooking the actions of its neighbors, reflect a biased and unfair approach that can be seen as a form of racism."

Somebody needs to tell me why we celebrate obesity instead of pointing people in a better healthier direction

138,2024-06-19,CMV: You should assume any online social media content to be fake if it can be easily staged. ,u/yoolers_number,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1djn70q/cmv_you_should_assume_any_online_social_media/,changemyview,"Often the authenticity of social media content is difficult to discern. As internet users and content consumers, I believe that it should be a rule of thumb to automatically assume that the content is staged if it takes little to no effort to replicate. In short- if it can be easily faked, it probably is. 

Here‚Äôs is an example of a [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/JustGuysBeingDudes/comments/1djibr0/they_had_to_ask_for_an_assist_to_help_their_friend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I saw today. This video claims that the male friend rescued a female friend from a group of guys that would not leave her alone. Knowing absolutely nothing about the video or situation, we do know that it would take minimal planning to stage this video. This could have been filmed in the spur of a moment with friends at a bar and uploaded online with virtually no effort. Starting with the assumption that this video is staged, we would need to find strong evidence to increase the probability that the video is authentic. 

This is another [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unexpected/comments/1djdea9/money_loves_silence/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) I saw today. A woman sitting in her car flashes money in front of the camera. A thief off camera then quickly grabs the money from her hands and disappears. 

Before analyzing any details of the video, the first question we should ask ourselves is ‚Äúcan this be easily replicated?‚Äù While it may take more effort than the first example, this video also can be easily staged. From here, we assume the video is fake and either dismiss the video or begin to search for details that would be difficult or unlikely to stage. An example would be if the thief smashed the window and the victim received cuts on her face from the glass. It is still possible to stage smashed glass and cuts, but it is far less likely to be fake. 

This rule of thumb is certainly not foolproof. There are plenty of Internet hoaxes that were deliberately and carefully crafted. Also, there is plenty of authentic content that could be easily replicated, but is in fact true. However, I believe it will increase media literacy to be more scrutinizing and dismissive of content.  If it can be easily faked, our starting point should be to assume it is inauthentic and to find disconfirming evidence from there.

Finally, whether or not something is fake should not take away from your enjoyment of the video. There is plenty of situational comedy content that presents as being real but is in fact a sketch or skit. That does not take away from the humor of the content, and you can still be entertained by staged videos. You can choose to suspend your disbelief if the content is enjoyable to you, but I believe it is important to be discerning about the content you consume overall."

0,2024-06-19,CMV: psychiatrists should be more open (and have less stigma) to the idea of diagnosing personality disorders in under 18s. Significant maladaptive personality traits in adolescents should be noted in their files.,u/WaterOk9249,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1djni7z/cmv_psychiatrists_should_be_more_open_and_have/,changemyview,"

I'm not a psychology expert, as a disclaimer.

But the DSM-V criteria does not have an age minimum of diagnosis of all personality disorders except ASPD where you need to be 18+ by definition.

All the DSM-V needs is to meet the criteria, for symptoms to be outside the norm and to be persistent (1+ year, I've heard, although not sure where). 

If all the criteria is met, the symptoms are outside the norm and they are persistent, and they ain't explained by other disorders, then it should be clear to diagnose a PD, imo. Many shame others for diagnosing as young as 12-13 but we look deeper at the cases and we can see a very clear tendency pointing to BPD. Yes, perhaps there are other comorbidities. But this allows doctors and psychiatrists and therapists to know what is the disorder causing the issues, allowing better treatment. 



I know people will oppose me.

***But WaterOk9249, this will give minors stigmatising labels!***

I argue that hiding away from it only increases the stigma. You don't defeat the stigma of autism in the 1990s by hiding away from it. You don't defeat the stigma of mental illness by hiding from it and being reluctant to diagnose it in teens. Then why not for PDs? 

I know people will oppose me.

***But WaterOk9249, being narcissistic is normal in teens!*** 

First, stop generalising teenagers, that is rude. Many teens are meek, deferential, not moody, hyperempathetic, not narcissistic. Of course, a significant minority of teens are quite narcissistic. A small minority of teens are extremely narcissistic.

Are you telling me that you can't distinguish a 14yo teen who appraises himself extremely highly, his friendships/romantic relationships all superficial and merely exist to regulate his self esteem, who seeks attention very excessively and very often by doing wild things (even socially very unacceptable things)? These are all compared to other teens, and these things have been there for multiple years, in multiple situations. Not due to medical conditions or substances. And these traits cause impairments in the social sphere and some impairment in other areas of life (like family life, academics)

Okay, teens tend to be more narcissistic on average. But there is still a curve, and this merely means shift the threshold to the right (as in even more narcissistic). If the threshold for high narcissism for young adults on the NPI-40 is 22/40, then for teens, for example 14yo, it might be 30/40 or 35/40 (as an analogy).

0,2024-06-19,CMV: Antizionism can be abused by antisemetes. But most antizionists are not antisemites.,u/SadHead1203,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1djnktc/cmv_antizionism_can_be_abused_by_antisemetes_but/,changemyview,"First of all, let me make it clear that there are definitely people who are genuinely antisemetic who mask their antisemetism through antizionism. Some examples of famous ""pro Palestinians' on social media who do this are Nick Fuentes, Jackson Hinkle, Lucas Gage, Jake Shields and Sneako. These guys do get denounced by other pro-palestinian accounts but maybe not enough. 

Some antisemites like Nick Fuentes will exploit what's going in Gaza by pretending to care about Palestinians to gain followers so that they can then expose them to antisemetic ideas (discreetly but not so discreetly). This does happen. Antisemites will draw people in with antizinoism and then expose them to antisemetic (and other racist) ideas. 

This exists but it does not represent a majority of the movement. And it does not take much effort to find these guys saying antisemetic things completely unrelated to Israel (pretty much all the names mentioned are holocaust deniers). So when people use antizionism as a mask for antisemetism, it's pretty obvious. 

But I consider myself to be an anti zionist and I am definitely not an antisemite. **When I say I'm an antizionist, I don't beleive that all Israelis should be expelled or killed (maybe some people would still consider this zionism IDK) but the status quo in Israel/Palestine cannot remain (blockade, occupation, settlements etc.)** and Israeli society needs to be reformed. I could go into a lot more detail but I don't really want to debate this as there's a lot of nuance involved and I want to stick to the title of the post:

**In most cases, Anti-zionism is not antisemitism**

**And it's really simple why. Most people who oppose zionism do not oppose Israel because it is a Jewish state but because (they believe) the state of Israel was created by expelling the majority of Palestinians living there and Israel has persecuted the Palestinians ever since.** 

Now you may disagree with the way I have framed that. You may think the nakba was unavoidalbe or the fault of the Palestinians. You may think that it is all justified and necessary because Israel only persecutes Palestinians for their own security and nothing else. Fine. But I disagree with you and many other anti-zionists do too. Just because you think certain context makes Israel's actions justified, it doesn't mean that everyone is going to agree with you even if they have the same context/information. This is true with anything in history or politics. Take almost any event or policy. You will find people who believe it is justified and you will find people who believe it is unjustified even if they're exposed to the same facts. 

For example, you might believe that the Jews had a right to create a state in Palestine because Jews had a flourishing civilisation in that land over 2,000 years ago. But not everyone agrees with that justification including many Jewish people. And a much larger proportion of Jews disagreed with this justification in the early 20th century (especially the haredi community). This 'right to a land' is a manmade idea so people are naturally going to agree/disagree with it and they're not necessarily antisemetic for picking one side or the other.  



**Now you might be thinking ""Israel may have done some wrongdoings but no country is perfect. People only choose to pick on Israel because it's the jewish state.""**

Firstly, before the 'war', Antizionists became antizionists because they viewed Israel as a colonial project, an apartheid state and beleived that people in Gaza lived in an open air prison. You may disagree with that characterisation but you have to admit that zionsism at least resembles a colonial project, the west bank resembles apartheid and gaza resembles an open air prison. It may not actually be any of those things but it is pretty obvious why some people characterise it this way. Even if you disagree with the framing, you have to see why some people might see it that way.

Furthermore, Israel is not being held to a standard other countries are not held too. I can't think of another country where two sets of people live on the same land but one group lives under martial law (the west bank) and has essentially different freedoms of movements and laws applied to them. I mean this obviously occurred in South Africa and Jim Crow but these were rightfully denounced and abolished by the western world (eventually). 

I can't think of another example of an area where an entire population (who are native to the land) are put into (what could be considered) an open-air prison like Gaza. Maybe north korea but not like they're very popular in the west. 

There are other countries that started as colonial projects (Australia, South Africa and many north/south American countries) but they do not still persecute the native people as much as the Palestinians are persecuted today. The countries mentioned don't have anything that resembles an open air prison, the indigenous people's movements are not restricted in the same way and the natives don't live under martial law. Is there discrimination in these countries against the native people? Of course. But these native people have far more freedom than Palestinians. The native people in these countries are also not still being forcefully displaced (at least in countries like the US and Australia but maybe you could make this argument for Brazil when the fascist cunt Bolsanaro was in power).

Now most people who are showing support for the Palestinians today are doing so because of this 'war'. In comparison, Palestinians protests were much much smaller before the 'war' and most people weren't any more invested in the Palestinians than any other persecuted people. So why suddenly is everyone so passionate about Palestinians now?

**It's simple, most people who are against this current 'war' are not against it because they 'support terrorism' or are antisemetic. They are against it because they beleive 2% of the population has been killed, 15,000 children have been killed (more than all wars in the last 5 years combined) and Israel is preventing food and water from reaching Gaza. You may not beleive the Gaza Health Ministry numbers, you may believe that the civilian deaths are from human shields, you may think that collateral damage is an unfortunate necessity and that Israel does everything it can to prevent civilian deaths. That's fine but you can't say everyone who doesn't agree with that is anti semetic or a terrorist supporters. I could literally give evidence to justify both arguments and you can't just call everyone who disagrees with you a racist/terrorist. You may think they are wrong but that doesn't mean they are wrong because they are antisemitic.**

  
Now why is this important? Because I think the accusation of antisemitism has been weaponised to stop legitimate criticism of Israel and its history. Just because you think Israel's actions and creation is justified doesn't mean that everyone else does. The same arguments that appeal to you don't appeal to everyone. Yes, some people's views may be because of ignorance and a lack of knowledge but there are countless political thinkers, historians, academic and scholars that are anti zionist (including many jews) and claiming that everyone of them is an anti-semite or a self hating jew is a malicious and lazy attempt to discredit them. 

  
**For a TLDR, just read the bits in bold.**"
0,2024-06-19,"CMV: Mother/Father‚Äôs Day, aka Fake Hallmark Holidays, Shouldn‚Äôt Be Celebrated",u/notmepleaseokay,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1djnv1y/cmv_motherfathers_day_aka_fake_hallmark_holidays/,changemyview,"Not too controversial, I know, but after another round of fake Hallmark holidays I feel compelled to air my grievances bc it‚Äôs 6 months to Festivus and I can‚Äôt wait that long.

I define fake Hallmark holidays that have no religious or social history other than being invented in the last 100 years and have been over taken by capitalism and corporations to sell us shit we don‚Äôt need (exception V-day which has been commercialized for centuries).

Fake Hallmark holidays are the root cause for so many relationship (romantic/otherwise) issues bc someone didn‚Äôt t live up to the other person‚Äôs expectations. Sometimes people totally forget bc of x, y, and z and then get a gale force storm of reconning from the person who was supposed to be ‚Äúcelebrated‚Äù. If someone doesn‚Äôt receives a gift that they hinted at, they feel slighted and like their partner/child doesn‚Äôt care/listen to them.

And the funny thing is the gift buying is the exact opposite of what you should be doing on these fake Hallmark holidays - especially Mother‚Äôs and Father‚Äôs Days!

When Mother‚Äôs Day was established in 1907 by the works of Anna Jarvis, who did so in the spirit of spending quality time with your mother and not about showering her with gifts. When Hallmark/corporate America took it over the year following, Jarvis was appalled. She spent the rest of her life trying to get it repealed bc she was disgusted at what it became.

Father‚Äôs Day was in response to Mother‚Äôs Day and was first celebrated in 1910 in Washington state. Retailers thought it was a great idea as Mother‚Äôs Day was very profitable for them.

During the 1920s and 30s there was a big push for the decommercialization of the holidays and for the creation of ‚ÄúParents Day‚Äù so that both parents could be celebrated and loved together. This effort was derailed by the Great Depression and WWII.

Retailers during WWII doubled down on Father‚Äôs Day as a second Christmas for fathers and advertised as a way to support the American Troops and war efforts. Another money grabbing scheme in the name of love and country.

From inception both Mother‚Äôs and Father‚Äôs Day were intended to be about truly supporting and celebrating parents by spending time with them versus shoving a gift their way and calling it done. Getting gifts was a corporate invention for profit and grains - so much that the woman who campaigned for Mother‚Äôs Day tried to get it repealed.

Real Talk: not getting ‚Äúwhat you want‚Äù or ‚Äúexpected‚Äù on your ‚Äúspecial‚Äù day is a YOU problem for having unrealistic expectations in the first place. You are the one who‚Äôs been turned into a sheep of corporate America thinking that you‚Äôre ‚Äúowed‚Äù something bc they say you‚Äôre ‚Äúworth it‚Äù. You‚Äôre the anthesis of why Anna Jarvis tried to get Mother‚Äôs Day repealed. You‚Äôre apart of the problem.

The thing is that you should be celebrating your mother/father/spouse throughout the year and not just on fake Hallmark holidays. If your family only celebrates you on these fake holidays/your birthday, and no where else, I think that‚Äôs a bigger issue than then them not meeting expectations on these fake Hallmark holidays.

I personally think that being treated on a regular ass day to something special is more thoughtful than a day that‚Äôs been carved out for millions of people to do the same thing.

And of course the argument above applies to Valentine‚Äôs Day/Boss day/Teacher Day/Secretary Day etc etc etc

I'm also a keen rally racing enthusiast who likes to go see our local WRC event every year plus some national events every now and then. I think following the competition and situations on stages is intense, exciting and gets my adrenaline pumping as well.

All this is great fun but sometimes I just wonder if this is playing all too much on nature's experience. Climate change is happening all around us and we can feel the impact as extreme weather conditions all around the world. I can't help thinking that I'm one to blame for it, since I sometimes tend to visit the special stages by car and drive them through, thus adding to using car and fuel for fun. I sometimes even think that I don't have the right to complain about heavy thunderstorms, heat waves etc.

But on the other hand there have been many technological innovations brought from the world of motorsports to everyday cars, and thanks to motor racing our cars are safer and eco-friendlier than ever. Teams gather research data from competitive racing to use it to produce cars from more sustainable components and materials, and to get more power from them by using a smaller amount of natural resources. That's why I can't say we should ban motorsports as horrible waste of finite resources. When those racing car drivers bring their potential to the max, it's all beneficial for us regular car owners also.

When there are some races held around my area I'd be delighted to go see them. But should it be the other way around, considering environmental aspects are close to my heart as well. What do you think?"

- Stan Lee

The idea is that power comes with strings attached: the wielder is morally obligated to do *good*. By simply having the ability to do something, one is required to do so. 

The proverb has been popularized in *Spider-Man*. There the consequence was clear: by having superhuman power the individual is compelled to take on the role of a hero.

I believe this to be false. There is no obligation to act in a certain way. The power inherently does not come with moral obligations.

Specifically:

- Having superhuman powers doesn't force you to become a hero. You can be anything you want to be. Of course, you are subject to usual morals. If you become something dubious, that's on you regardless of your power. Using your powers for evil is bad because of the way you used your powers. You don't have to actively pursue good just because you're able to.

- More practically, just because you're extremely intelligent doesn't mean you should become a doctor. If you're very athletic you don't have to represent your country in sports. If you're very fit you don't have to enlist to the special forces.

Clarifications:

Power can still come with responsibility depending on how it was obtained. If you are elected by your peers for a position - you definitely have a role that needs to be fulfilled. This includes things such as being a politician, doing jury duty, leading others, etc..  
In this case the responsibility is not inherent to the power, but to the job that comes with it and to those who bestowed it.

Good Samaritan and duty to rescue laws:   
It's possible to come across someone in danger by chance. In this case normal considerations of morality and legality apply. You have to offer reasonable help, if that doesn't put you in danger or makes things worse. At the minimum you should call the appropriate authorities. If while attempting rescue the person dies, you are not legally (and morally) liable.  
This case naturally extends to a person with special abilities - they are required to aid within the reason and limits of their abilities. This entirely stems from the fact that every person is bound by this morality, and not from having powers.

I don't think it's a debate that a woman can find a boyfriend much more easily than a man can find a girlfriend. Now the common response to this issue is ""Most men are jerks and only want sex so it's still hard to find a good one!!!"" and that is at least partially true, but I actually think that someone wanting you only for your body is a lot better than nobody wanting you at all. 

The male loneliness epidemic is not something that should be taken lightly. Most guys feel totally worthless and there is nobody that wants to help them unlike girls. If a girl is upset about something and is suffering, there are gonna be tons of guys that are gonna want to be there for her(if she isn't incredibly ugly), if a guy starts crying it is not in the best interest of a girl to comfort him or help him. Even if she is there to help him this makes the guy appear as weak to the girl which will in turn make most girls less attracted to him. So it is in the best interest to not speak about your emotions as a man, because it will just make your life worse

A man looks for the physical and mental attributes in a girl when looking for a girlfriend, a girl looks for money, status, height and generally just values that he can provide for her. This makes relationships as a guy feel like a transaction.

In(most) healthy polarized relationships it is much tougher being the guy. You are probably going to be the one that takes care of the girl instead of it being the other way around. You are expected to be masculine as a man, otherwise you really have no value. On the other hand, you are not expected to be masculine at all as a girl.

This is not the first time something like this has happened, and it keeps escalating.

I believe that their organization is a significant net negative for the climate cause. They are so counterproductive that it seems like they must be paid actors installed by the oil industry.

I personally support climate action. However, many people around me, especially the older ones, are quite undecided. Every time Just Stop Oil commits an act of vandalism, they become more opposed to the cause because they dislike the activists advocating for it.

I also believe that gatherings and demonstrations are a great way to show discontent to the government. However, I would feel really uncomfortable attending a climate march with groups like Just Stop Oil or Extinction Rebellion, as they escalate the protests and create conflicts with the police. I once experienced this firsthand and felt quite uncomfortable. As a result, I am less likely to participate again. I am sure many others feel the same way.

In my opinion, they also greatly harm the climate movement by pushing other causes under the guise of climate action. For example, by protesting against Israel as an organization, they strongly reinforce the narrative that climate activists do not actually care about the climate but are merely leftists promoting their political goals. This again turns away potential supporters of the cause.

But think about it: in both cases, the objective is identical‚Äîto convey a similarity between two different entities in a way that enhances meaning. The difference is purely in the phrasing. They are both figurative and mean the same.

Why complicate things with unnecessary labels when their function is to serve the same expressive and illustrative purpose? Let's ditch the pedantic jargon and just be practical for once."
0,2024-06-19,"CMV: Men are General Better than Women at Math and Engineering, but it‚Äôs not genetic",u/aligatormilk,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1djsrd9/cmv_men_are_general_better_than_women_at_math_and/,changemyview,"The reason is cultural and not genetic.

I will use chess as an example.

Why do men dominate the upper levels of chess, a game that is a measure of raw spatial intelligence, calculation, and memory? (This is also true for the fields of math and physics). It‚Äôs because society actively encourages men to dedicate their lives to hard-science-based pursuits, while they implicitly (or explicitly) tell women to aim lower. Because of this disparity, it is easier for men to practice these disciplines, so they do them more often and with more psychological safety than their women counterparts. For women, not only do they have to go through the same training to get to the same level (again, on average), they have to deal with the mental stress of society looking at them as if they are pursuing the wrong track in life.

Because of this lower barrier to practice, men generally feel more encouraged and motivated to practice in these fields more consistently, hence they become stronger on average. It is not that women do not have the same genetic aptitude, it is that society prevents them from having the same psychological safety as men when practicing to become the best in these pursuits.

I don‚Äôt think, when trying to make a highly performant team of elites, that men need to feel bad for picking other men for that team, because it has nothing to do with a woman candidate‚Äôs gender. It is simply because they want the person who is more skilled, but I see a lot of women complaining that it is because men are bigots.

Daniil Dubov helps Magnus prepare for the Candidates because he is better than Aleksandra Goryachkina, not because he is a man. If Judit Polgar were in her prime, Magnus would likely choose her to be on his team, and it‚Äôs because she was an absolute monster, and it would have nothing to do with her gender.

I think the only way to improve this disparity is for men to let their daughters feel safe to practice math and science and not actively encourage them to be wives and mothers (fuck you Harrison Buttlicker), but I don‚Äôt think that will happen because the government wants women to give birth as much as possible for late stage capitalism.

So short story long, it is true that once women enter child bearing age especially, men in hard sciences become generally more skilled than women their same age. I‚Äôm not saying this is ideal, but to say that it‚Äôs not true is living in a fantasy land imo.

I would love to hear any rebuttals, and I‚Äôm willing to change my view if I‚Äôm wrong. I also use this same logic to claim that women are generally better at raising kids than men."

He said it in the context of deconstructions, but it got me thinking; Is it bad for a writer to be primarly motivated by anger and similar emotions.

I don't think so. Of all the writing projects I've done, those motivated by spite and hatred were more likely to be finished, since I had a powerful drive stronger than something like ""love"" or ""enjoyment"" and stuff like that. Moreover, the parts of my writing most directly influenced by my hatred‚Äîeverything from my stupidly dark original setting to me making fun of characters in fanfics‚Äîwere generally the parts my readers enjoyed most.

But that's just my subjective experience. Maybe I'm actually missing out on the power of joy and friendship, or some other creative guide that puts spite and hate to shame, in which case I'd like to know that. You can come at me with anything; Statements from successful authors, examples of stories ruined by the writer's hate, simple reasoning I haven't considered, whatever. I just want to know whether I should stay on the Dark Side or not."

To this end companies should be forced to sell enough shares in the company to cover the cost of any court imposed penalties or fines. The money can come from nowhere else until a company has released 100% more stock than had been originally in the market. Example, 10,000 shares originally held by shareholders. Up to 10,000 new shares sold to cover fines and penalties. Next is upper management compensation packages then company profits. Bottom 3/4 of worker salaries and jobs are legally protected.

Companies are also prohibited from stock buy backs for 5 years after every judgement.

Selling shares in a company to cover fines will decrease shareholder value by dropping share prices and reducing dividends per share. The company being unable to perform stock buy backs maintains this dilution. Shareholders do not like to lose value. So even if the company was still profitable commiting criminal acts the shareholders would hold the company accountable and put a stop to them.

Not all businesses have stock or structured in a way that this makes sense but large fortune 500 companies and conglomerates can be held accountable this way."

I was telling my mom about my intention to vote for Jill Stein, and every time it's come up, she tells me what a huge mistake voting third party is this election and that ""a vote not for Biden is a vote for Trump"". My refrain is that, in our electoral college system, it doesn't matter. I live in Ohio. While I want it to become a swing state again, and I think in 8 years it might be again, it's just not. If Biden loses Ohio by 9% instead of 9.0000001% and the third party votes amount to 5% (which, at most, they will), it makes no difference.

Polling requirement: My main issue with the polling requirement is that the strict cut off is 15% and there is no acknowledgement of margin of error. For example, say a candidate gets 14% and the MOE is +\- 3.5%. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that that poll doesn‚Äôt count, but somehow a poll at 15% with the exact same margin of error would count. If you adjust the weighting in these polls even slightly within the margin of error it would get that candidate over that threshold. It makes the polls feel like a random number generator and you just have to hope you get lucky with marginal weighting. Polls have also been infamously horrendous since 2016 and I don‚Äôt know how much stock we should still be putting in them to be reliable/trustworthy.

270 Electoral Vote requirement: This is really my main gripe with the requirements. It, to me, seems absolutely nonsensical to have a EC vote ballot requirement in June, before many states have even begun their certification process, and before some states have even begun to allow petitioning. Kennedy had submitted enough signatures to qualify for 310 electoral college votes, but many of these states haven‚Äôt even begun the certification process yet, because they have never had to. The debates are typically held in September/October. Also, the DNC and RNC have not officially held their conventions yet, thus Biden and Trump are not yet officially on any state ballot, so they don‚Äôt technically meet the requirements. CNN has put out a statement that since they are the presumptive nominees, they can bypass this requirement. If that is the case, why can‚Äôt you reasonably assume that Kennedy will be on the ballot in enough states ballots to reach 270 since he has submitted the necessary signatures (often 2-3x the required amount) to be on the ballot? This seems like a direct violation of the FEC requirement for ‚Äúfair and objective‚Äù criteria for presidential debates. I am honestly fine with a 270 EC requirement for September/October debates because almost all states would have their ballots certified by then, it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense in June. 


I am open to hearing why these debate criteria make sense for a June debate and changing my opinion.

First: you need to be on 270 electoral votes worth of ballots. Kennedy had ~130 or so officially, but has submitted signatures for ~180 more. He will be on the ballot in all those states in all likelihood. However, the requirement is objective, so CNN says he is not on 270, so this does not count. But, by making it objective, then no candidate, even the front runners for democrats and republicans, is on 270 electoral votes worth of ballots. They are not the official nominees (convention hasnt happened) so they do not ‚Äúobjectively‚Äù meet this qualification. CNN skirts this and says they meet it, but Kennedy doesn‚Äôt. This is wrong.


As for polling requirements (4 15% polls) Kennedy has 3 (marquette, quinnipaic, and CNN). However, he has the Monmouth poll at 18 percent would probably or definitely vote for him, yet cnn says this poll does not count. This is wrong. CNN listed Monmouth as an eligible pollster, Monmouth has been doing polls this way, and by listing them, that shows that CNN approves of their methodology. That poll should count.

And voila, Kennedy has met the requirements, yet CNN is jumping through hoops to make sure he cannot participate in the debates. This doesn‚Äôt even take into account how 71% of americans think he should be in the debate and that the main candidates are the least popular in recent history.

I want to see a good argument and change my mind, but to me this just looks corrupt, give it a shot!

It‚Äôs either for some stupid ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù purpose or for political motif.

We can see this with people such as Andrew Tate converting to Islam, but only doing it because it suits his redpill/incel followers while still running a porn business and doing everything else he did prior. Or pundits like Tucker Carlson claiming to be a devout christian but he left his catholic faith as soon as he married his wife becoming an Episcopalian (weakness in faith). Another example is a lot of these social media influencers who are preaching Jesus but then are doing everything opposite of their faith. Or the most basic example, you have girls that put bible verses in their bios and then right below that their bio has an onlyfans link (this would apply to men it‚Äôs just a more common example).

We obviously also have people using it to do it for political reasons such as having boogiemen to point out or enforce state power. But this only emphasizes my point.

This makes religion more appealing to a secular society, but that doesn‚Äôt somehow rehabilitate the religion when they have clear obligations nor does it negate the punishments you will receive in the faith you falsely claim to follow. In my opinion, if you‚Äôre not going to follow your faith, why even preach it? After all, falsely claiming to follow a faith is a sin in and of itself. I really feel most of these people are one breath from becoming an atheist. Most are just scared of the potential consequences of death in the scenario of there being no God, likely succumbing to the most un-optimistic and miserable form of nihilism.

Believe and follow your faith or don‚Äôt follow it. Obviously no person is immune from sin some might reply. But there is a clear difference from this false faith and an active effort to be a person of god.

I really am only applying this to religions that require serious faith.

I tend to think of competitions where the results are determined by judges as ""performances"" rather than sports, whereas sports are competitions where the results are definitively measured. 

It is of course possible to cheat at all of these disciplines, but the biases, experiences, cognitive differences and huge opportunities for nefarious acts are removed from the results when judging isn't involved.

Yes, this means dropping a bunch of competitions that are popular. Gymnastics is the big one I would think. Whilst there's incredible athleticism involved in gymnastics, it's still an athletic performance that is judged by people. Boxing, diving, dressage, these would all be gone.

A gaming streamer appeals to a predominantly male audience, and a part of what will keep your audience engaged is positive emotion. There are few emotions one can feel that are better than feeling a sense of power over another, especially if the person in question is someone they're attracted to, especially if the person in question is a high-pitched cute girl with lots of feminine qualities.  


If you're a girl wanting to get an audience in the gaming streaming market, you really want to make sure that you reinforce the status quo and be so hilariously bad at every game you play that you make your male audience go ""Aw, look at her!

3. A fat person. Not only does this person benefit from losing weight, its also something he can change by putting in work. Bullying is GOOD in this situation.


And this is coming from a person that got bullied a lot for his weight. That bullying ultimately led me to joining the gym and starting my calorie tracking journey.

0,2024-06-20,"CMV: democracy is bad, we should restrict voting rights to only Ivy League PhD students (Stanford,Princeton) and only let tenured professors run for office ",u/Huge_Animator8728,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dk97ff/cmv_democracy_is_bad_we_should_restrict_voting/,changemyview,"Democracy, often celebrated as a model of fairness and equality, can be critiqued for its inherent susceptibility to sophism‚Äîthe use of deceptive arguments to sway public opinion. Sophists, skilled in rhetoric, can manipulate the democratic process by appealing more to emotions and biases than to rational thought. In a system where leaders are chosen through popular vote, the ability to persuade often trumps the ability to govern effectively. This vulnerability emerges because sophists are adept at crafting emotionally charged messages that resonate with the public, overshadowing the need for critical analysis of policies and their long-term impacts.

Emotional appeals are a primary tool for sophists in democratic societies. They exploit feelings such as fear, anger, and hope to gain support, diverting attention from the substantive discussion of issues. For instance, a politician might use fear-mongering to create a sense of urgency or crisis, thereby garnering support for their agenda, even if it lacks practicality or ethical grounding. This emotional manipulation can lead voters to make decisions based on immediate emotional responses rather than on a careful consideration of facts and potential outcomes. Consequently, the democratic process can be skewed towards choices that are emotionally satisfying but strategically flawed.

Simplistic solutions further illustrate how sophists can undermine democracy. Complex societal issues are often reduced to catchy, easy-to-understand slogans that promise quick fixes. These oversimplified solutions are appealing because they provide clear, straightforward answers to complicated problems. However, such solutions are typically impractical and may have unintended negative consequences. Voters, swayed by these appealing narratives, may support policies that are not in their long-term best interest. This tendency to favor simplicity over complexity in political discourse can result in governance that is reactive and short-sighted, lacking in depth and sustainability.

The influence of media in modern democracies amplifies the power of sophists. Media platforms, driven by the need for ratings and engagement, often prioritize sensationalist and emotionally charged content. Skilled rhetoricians exploit this by dominating media narratives, using sound bites and slogans to create an appealing public image. This focus on media-friendly messages means that leaders can shape public perception more effectively than those who rely on detailed policy discussions. As a result, the public may be more informed about a leader‚Äôs persona than their actual policy positions or competencies, leading to elections based on image rather than substance.

Leaders who consistently win in democratic settings are often those who excel in rhetoric. This mastery of persuasion can lead to surface-level politics, where maintaining a positive public image becomes more important than enacting effective policies. Politicians may prioritize short-term popularity over long-term solutions, focusing on actions that enhance their re-election prospects rather than addressing deeper issues. This dynamic can create a cycle where governance is driven by public relations strategies rather than by a genuine commitment to solving societal problems, undermining the very foundations of effective democracy.

Public misinformation is another significant consequence of rhetoric-dominated politics. Master rhetoricians can spread misinformation, shaping public opinion through distorted facts and misleading narratives. This manipulation can prevent the electorate from making well-informed decisions, as they are swayed by false or incomplete information. An ill-informed public is less capable of holding leaders accountable or engaging in meaningful democratic deliberation. Over time, this erosion of informed public discourse can weaken democratic institutions and norms, making it easier for demagogues to gain and maintain power.


A potential improvement over current democratic systems is restricting voting rights exclusively to Ivy League PhD students and allowing only tenured professors to run for office. This proposal stems from the belief that individuals with advanced academic training and scholarly achievements are better equipped to make informed, rational decisions. These individuals, having undergone rigorous intellectual challenges, possess a deep understanding of complex issues and are more likely to base their decisions on evidence and critical analysis rather than emotions and populist rhetoric.

PhD students and tenured professors from prestigious institutions like Stanford and Princeton represent a highly educated and intellectually elite segment of the population. Their extensive training in research and critical thinking makes them well-suited to evaluate policies and political candidates from a perspective grounded in knowledge and rationality. By restricting the voting populace to this group, the electoral process could theoretically focus more on substantive policy debates rather than on emotional appeals or simplistic solutions. This would likely result in more informed and effective governance, as decisions would be made by those who have a deep understanding of societal issues.

Moreover, limiting candidacy to tenured professors ensures that only individuals with proven expertise and experience in their fields can hold public office. Tenured professors have demonstrated their intellectual prowess and commitment to academic integrity through years of research, teaching, and service. They are less likely to be swayed by populist sentiments and more likely to prioritize long-term societal benefits over short-term gains. Their involvement in governance could bring a level of expertise and stability that is often lacking in the current political landscape, where charisma and rhetoric often outweigh qualifications and competence.

Despite the theoretical advantages of this system, it has not been implemented, primarily due to the lack of sophism among the academic elite. Sophism, the ability to persuade and manipulate public opinion, is a critical skill in contemporary politics. Ivy League PhD students and tenured professors, while highly knowledgeable, often lack the rhetorical skills necessary to appeal to the broader population. Their communication tends to be more technical and nuanced, which may not resonate with the general public, who are often influenced by simpler, emotionally charged messages.

The absence of sophistic abilities among the academic elite creates a significant barrier to their political influence. In a democratic system that relies on mass appeal and voter engagement, those who can effectively communicate and persuade are more likely to succeed. Academics, focused on rigorous analysis and evidence-based arguments, may struggle to simplify their messages in a way that captures the public's attention and support. This disconnect between academic communication and public perception prevents the implementation of a system that privileges highly educated voters and candidates.

Furthermore, the existing democratic framework is deeply entrenched in the principle of equal representation, where every citizen has an equal right to participate in the electoral process. Proposing a system that restricts voting rights and candidacy to a small, elite group contradicts this fundamental democratic value. Such a system could be perceived as elitist and undemocratic, potentially leading to widespread public resistance and a legitimacy crisis. The societal commitment to egalitarian principles and the right of every individual to have a say in their governance remains a strong counterforce to any attempt to limit political participation to a select few.

In conclusion, while restricting voting rights to Ivy League PhD students and limiting candidacy to tenured professors could theoretically result in more informed and effective governance, practical and ethical challenges prevent its adoption. The academic elite's lack of sophistic skills to persuade the broader population and the strong societal commitment to democratic egalitarianism are significant barriers. As such, the proposal remains an interesting theoretical concept rather than a viable alternative to the current democratic system.

Furthermore, if you focus only on the positive possibilities, they won‚Äôt happen just because you focused on them. If they happen and you did nothing to make them happen, other than your ritual of manifesting positive outcomes, then that was always going to happen and it‚Äôs just a coincidence that it did. There are probably thousands of other people that tried to manifest something positive and it didn‚Äôt happen for them, at exactly the same time.

Also, it can be really helpful to be willing to consider the negative instead of denying the possibility of negative things. This is simple preparation. I tend to do better than my coworkers that have the ‚Äúmanifest the positive‚Äù mentality because I‚Äôm prepared with backup plans in the event that something negative does occur, while they seemingly have an existential crisis (which often has no impact on how they handle the next situation).

405,2024-06-20,CMV: Most of the hype surrounding AI massively misunderstands how it works and its resulting limitations,u/ravagekitteh26,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dkd43z/cmv_most_of_the_hype_surrounding_ai_massively/,changemyview,"We are currently living in what seems to be an AI hype bubble, with much of the current stock market being devoted to frenzied hype around ‚ÄòAI‚Äô. However, I believe that none of the people throwing money after this have any idea how AI actually works, and are going to be in for a rude awakening once they realise they are not going to get anywhere near the expected returns on their investments. Furthermore, even those that acknowledge the existence of a bubble seem to do so in ways that have no relation to the fundamental mechanisms of ‚ÄòAI‚Äô (defined here as the sorts of generative AI popularised by ChatGPT and hyped up by the current tech industry). This is an attempt to change that.

As far as I can see, there are three main problems with how AI works. Firstly, the ‚Äòouroboros‚Äô problem, whereby AI ends up consuming a load of its own content and the quality of outputs decrease - this seems to be one of the most popularly states arguments against AI, and won‚Äôt be the focus of my argument. Secondly, there‚Äôs the problem of small datasets - a lot of problems concern rather niche areas in which there is comparatively little data and literature on - thus will dramatically undermine AI‚Äôs ability to deal with these problems and the quality of its inferences will be significantly worse. This I believe is a more significant argument, and definitely plays into my belief that AI is about to plateau.

However, the main one is as follows: to my knowledge, most of the current innovation in AI is in processes that are essentially just super fancy ways of smashing the middle button of predictive text, albeit on more of a sentence and paragraph level. AI models are fed extremely large amounts of data, and essentially spit out the ‚Äòstatistical average‚Äô of said dataset based on a given prompt. Because of the way human language works, so long as your dataset is large enough and the statistical models are good enough, this can approximate human speech and knowledge pretty well. However, at no point during this process does the AI ever ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô any of what it writes. It is able to approximate understanding by using contextual statistical models, but it isn‚Äôt able to translate any of it into actual actions that interact with the real world (or at least, no additional progress has been made).

To use an analogy based on the famous Chinese room thought experiment, imagine an English-speaking man in an enclosed room, who does not speak a word of Chinese. While in that room, he is able to find an enormous library of books written entirely in Chinese, with no English translations. He does not understand a word of it, but as he reads through, he begins to notice patterns, where in certain contexts certain characters are more likely to occur after certain other characters and symbols. He reads more and more through the books, and is eventually able to put together a rough model for the continuous patterns he finds. Now, if someone were to post a conversational message in Chinese, he would be able to ‚Äòrespond‚Äô in a roughly accurate way (being more accurate the more books he has on the subject and the better his pattern identifying skills). However, if they were to post him an instruction (eg pass me one of your books), he would be no more capable of being able to carry it out than before he read through the pile of books, as he has no way of being able to relate the characters he sees to actual meaning. To use the more traditional Chinese Room set up, there are instructions on the wall for drawing symbols, but none for performing actions. 

This is essentially my understanding of where AI is at - there have been significant advances in providing the pile of books, and in being able to spot patterns within them, however AI is no better at being able to relate its outputs to reality than it was before the ‚Äòexplosion‚Äô (and quite often, there are very few books on the subject they are being asked about). That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it can‚Äôt, but it means that this aspect has to be done ‚Äòmanually‚Äô by humans in a way that has not benefited from recent advances. The problem is, this bit is both the useful bit and the difficult bit. Attempting to translate human language into consistent actionable inputs is exceptionally difficult outside of certain environments - there are arguably entire disciplines such as philosophy and cognitive language theory devoted to it (part of the reason why ChatGPT is so successful is that it deliberately avoids doing it, instead focusing on pure statistics). 

However, if you can‚Äôt do this, then you essentially end up with an AI almost entirely incapable of interacting with its environment, and it is precisely this form of interaction that most people expect when it comes to AI. To use another example, customer service is an area many people consider to be obsolete following AI. Certainly I can see that an AI can replicate the advice side of things (‚ÄúHave you tried switching it off and on again etc‚Äù), but as soon as you arrive at a situation in which action needs to be taken (eg something‚Äôs gone wrong with a purchase), an AI will be either almost entirely useless at solving it, or be stuck with incredibly simplistic responses such as providing refunds. This may change in future, but there is nothing in the current ‚ÄòAI revolution‚Äô that has brought us any a closer to this. 

As it stands then, we have a large group of people hurling money at AI hoping it will change the world, without realising that it is barely even capable of interacting with it and certainly not with any niche, difficult areas. This seems a perfect recipe for a dot com style bust. 

This isn‚Äôt exactly the most heartening conclusion, and I‚Äôm no computer scientist, so it‚Äôs entirely possible my understanding of the mechanisms of AI is incorrect. With that in mind, please CMV!"

comment under that video - ""As a girl who loves animals, I think this is so awesome!""

**The Instagram video is about how LGBTQ+ people should have rights**

comment under that video - ""As a trans man who has faced a lot of prejudice, I totally agree.""

comment under that video - ""As a woman who is from the south, I can tell you that this is the best way to do it!""

Your identity is not integral to your opinions. If you think this is the best way to make sweet tea, then just comment that you think that. If you agree that LGBTQ+ people should have rights, then just comment that you agree.  

If you think that including key parts of your identity in every comment you make somehow validates your opinion, it doesn't. If I don't agree with the opinion, your identity isn't going to change my mind. For instance,  what if I don't like that recipe for sweet tea? Am I somehow convinced to like it now because a Southern person said it is legit? If I don't believe in trans rights, is a trans person saying that I should, going to convince me? If I don't like fostering puppies, then why does it matter if this girl likes animals? (just to be clear I am very in support of the LGBTQ population, puppies, and sweet tea don't get it twisted) 

Allies exist, non-southern sweet tea drinkers are real, and someone who doesn't like animals can still see the beauty and sacrifice in fostering pets. Your identity doesn't equal your opinion and vice-versa. Just say what you think. You don't have to prove yourself to the internet."
0,2024-06-20,CMV: Fahrenheit is a better temperature scale then Celsius. ,u/YeeBeforeYouHaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dkdljr/cmv_fahrenheit_is_a_better_temperature_scale_then/,changemyview,"I'm a very pro metric system in general.  The only thing I don't like about the metric system is using Celsius for temperature. My main problem with it is the smaller range of numbers.  To me a good temperature scale would reflect the highest and lowest temperature a human is likely to experience in their everyday day life. No human will ever experience 100¬∞c weather. The Highest temperature ever recorded on earth was 134¬∞F/56.7¬∞C and the lowest was - 128.6¬∞F/-89.2¬∞C. That puts 0¬∞F almost exactly in the middle between those two extremes. 

The main argument in favor of ¬∞C is that 0 is the freezing point and 100 the boiling point of water at sea level. While I'll grant you the 0 being the freezing point is a point in ¬∞C favor. 100 being the boiling point at sea level is NOT helpful at all. Since the boiling point changes depending on altitude. The average elevation of the US is 760m, the boiling point of water at that altitude is about 98¬∞C. In Denver,CO the boiling point is 94¬∞C and in EL Alto, Bolivia the highest city in the world with a population over 1 million. The boiling point is about 86¬∞C 

While it's nice to know the freezing point because that doesn't change as much on earth and it's the main factor in weather you get rain or snow. Everyone who uses (and probably a lot of people who don't use) ¬∞F know that 32¬∞F is freezing. So using ¬∞C doesn't provide any more information. 

I'm not trying to say that the world should change to ¬∞F. It's much easier for the US to change to ¬∞C then for the world to change to ¬∞F. My point is only that from a human and practical standpoint ¬∞F is better then ¬∞C."

They didn't know. It wasn't an issue and we are close to this day. But it was a confusing situation.

In my opinion, if it wasn't for modern stigma of homosexuality, men would be having sex with men over women outside of baby-making like they did in ancient times. So many times men only be-friend women if they think they have a shot at sleeping with her and will ignore all women he seems unattractive. So many men have such misogynistic views of women it seems they secretly hate them but just keep them around for status. Men do all in the stated above quote and just really see women for service, sex, and devotion.  "

As if it's unpopular; it risks losing the party's power in their respective parties. This usually translates to half measures that do not fix the problem or steering of the populace to focus on other problems. We can notice this in the housing crisis as if the parties do fix it, it risks losing the support of older generations who have investments in real estate.

This leaves people economically trapped in cities for career development; in addition with the homelessness crisis leaves the cities heavily dangerous. (You might point to statistics regarding lower crime but I believe that simply because they're not being prosecuted). Most of the developed world has seen their quality of life slip. As free trade enabled our current level of growth; it ruins developing countries by stealing their best and brightest people leaving them in debt traps. 

From this I can predict that cities will eventually become dystopias; similar to various cyberpunk stories. Drugs and crime rampant; coupled with urban decay."

*‚ÄúThe Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses of the First Amendment protect an individual engaging in a personal religious observance from government reprisal; the Constitution neither mandates nor permits the government to suppress such religious expression.‚Äù*

The background to this case is that a high school football coach would pray after games by himself initially in the middle of the field, where others, including players, would join him. His contract was not renewed by his district, and he promptly sued. 

Many people quote the Establishment Clause as grounds for a strict separation of church and state, although in American history, the phrase separation of church and state was first used by Thomas Jefferson in 1802, not in the Constitution or Declaration of Independence. The Establishment Clause in the 1st Amendment that most militant atheists and agnostics support states *‚ÄúCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion‚Äù*

The conservative justices of the Supreme Court might try to uphold this law on a technicality; they might argue that the Establishment clause only applies to the US Congress and not to any other local, state or federal government entity. However, if the Supreme Court rules that only Congress is prohibited from respecting an establishment of religion, then it could open up a dangerous precedent of every other government entity being allowed to respect certain establishments of religion. 


TL;DR I think the most likely outcome is that the Supreme Court rules that the restricting power of the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment applies to all government entities in the US, not just to Congress.

Yet, men collectively are labeled 'privileged.' They face open mockery and belittlement from women online and in the real world, excused as 'punching up,' while any critique of women as a group is swiftly condemned as sexist and misogynistic.

Though sympathy for men's societal expectations exists, the will for action to be taken on the issue is nonexistent. Both men and women overwhelmingly expect men to embody physical strength, emotional stability, and financial prowess to deserve respect and love. Despite efforts to deny or virtue-signal above these subconscious biases, evolutionary biology has hardwired these expectations into our psyches.

Men's lives are etched with experiences searing this harsh reality into their minds‚Äîaccept and overcome or suffer a lonely death as a depressed failure. In contrast, women are often told by both sexes that they're inherently worthy, and any hardship or disrespect is blamed on societal misogyny. Our culture perpetuates the narrative that women's hardships stem from systemic injustice, while men's derive from personal failings and inadequacies.

The founders didn't draft the constitution to make it one, and they certainly didn't want it to be one. By democracy I mean, as did they, somewhat abstractly that the majority of power lies in the hands of the majority of the population, and that policy therefore more or less follows the popular passions of the day. Many of our institutions, from the senate to the electoral college to the supreme court all reflect a reluctance to let the common people have much of a say at all.¬†

More to the point though, the US was constituted in opposition to the idea of democracy. Many of those founders that are responsible for the consolidated federation thought that there was too much democracy under the articles of confederation within the individual states, and that this put their property rights at risk. After all, Rhode Island had just been the first state to elect a populist government (which pointedly declined to attend the constitutional convention and later only ratified the constitution after the other states threatened to embargo them), and the Shaysites of Massachusetts wanted their state to follow suit, instituting policies such as debt relief and the printing of paper money that could lift thousands of farmers out of poverty.

Now I'm sure that many of you have seen conservatives argue about how the US is 'a republic, not a democracy', but that doesn't really contribute to the conversation what they think it does. When they quote Federalist 10, and talk about how Madison didn't want majority factions calling all the shots, and use that to back up things such as the Senate and the Electoral College, they are entirely missing the context of that argument. Madison and the framers didn't care all that much about protecting the people and the autonomy of the individual states. In fact, Federalist 10 explicitly mentions what factions Madison is primarily concerned with, and they are debtors and creditors; the people who have property and those who do not. He says that property is ""the most common and durable source of factions "", and those reforms from earlier? He calls those ""wicked projects"". He was not worried about the states losing autonomy‚Äî in fact, the Federalists thought that giving less power to the states was a good thing; this was literally what the transition from a confederation to a federation was all about, after all.

Rather, Madison was worried that without a federal government, it would be too easy for the poor within each individual state to come together and demand change, which would come at the expense of the upper classes that the founders all belonged to. In his words, ""Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other."" More people, separated by thousands of miles, vast forests, and the Appalachian mountains, could not act in unison against their oppressors, so by federalising the power making bodies in the US would become too large and remote for the people to matter. This is intrinsically undemocratic.

For further evidence, we can look at one Federalist who has become quite popular in recent years, Alexander Hamilton. The final letter he ever wrote before his duel with Aaron Burr was to a New England separatist named Theodore Sedgewick. Sedgwick, like many at the time, was convinced that it would be better for the United States to split into multiple parts, so that the concerns of the citizens of each of the smaller federations would be better represented in the backdrop of intense sectional differences between the Northern, Southern, and Western states. Hamilton's letter chastises him for trying to break up the union, saying that ""I will here express but one sentiment, which is, that Dismembrement of our Empire will be a clear sacrifice of great positive advantages, without any counterballancing good; administering no relief to our real Disease; which is Democracy, the poison of which by a subdivision will only be the more concentered in each part, and consequently the more virulent"". In other words, breaking up the federal government would be good for democracy, and that is a bad thing in Hamilton's eyes.

And as it happens, there were some people of the founding generation that did care for democracy. They just happened to often be those same people who opposed the constitution. One of my favorite sources from the ratification debates is Patrick Henry's ""shall liberty or empire be sought"" speech (which is a great thing all Americans to read), in which he says, in part, that ""This, sir, is the language of democracy‚Äîthat a majority of the community have a right to alter government when found to be oppressive. But how different is the genius of your new Constitution from this! How different from the sentiments of freemen, that a contemptible minority can prevent the good of the majority! If, then, gentlemen, standing on this ground, are come to that point, that they are willing to bind themselves and their posterity to be oppressed, I am amazed and inexpressibly astonished. If this be the opinion of the majority, I must submit; but to me, sir, it appears perilous and destructive.""

Once again, don't we have a number of institutions in the federal government that are anti democratic on purpose? Why are we still pretending the framers had our interests at heart when there is little reason to believe this? We can still yearn for democracy, but that doesn't mean that the founders intended for democracy to be the premise of our federal government.

Now, this isn't to say that the United States was founded on oppression somehow. Strictly speaking, it was founded as a military and economic alliance when we had a war to win. The colonies had existed separately for over a hundred years, and they each had their own customs and people recognized that. However, after seeing that a loose confederation allowed the people to have a lot of influence within their state governments, the Founders held a coup, rushed their changes through the states with little understanding by many of the commoners what the constitution entailed, and resolved to place certain parts of the government so far out of reach that only the wealthy could meaningfully contribute. We still see the effects of this today.

As such, to think the US is some exceptional bastion of democracy crafted by our benevolent founders is precisely opposed to the historical record, many of which were freaked out about populist fervor and deeply attached to their vast amounts of property. To fail to acknowledge this is, in my opinion, a failure to properly educate the citizenry on the nature of our country, and to simply take it as a given rather than question whether a continent spanning, billionaire-dominated federation is the best we can come up with.

73,2024-06-20,CMV: iPads Are Not Supposed to Be Laptop Replacements ,u/thehillfigger,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dkpd80/cmv_ipads_are_not_supposed_to_be_laptop/,changemyview,"I've noticed a common argument in tech circles that the iPad should be considered a laptop replacement. However, I believe that iPads are not intended to replace laptops, particularly when looking at Apple's product lineup and strategic decisions.

First, let's consider Apple's history of product discontinuation and evolution. Apple and other tech companies have a consistent track record of phasing out products that have been rendered obsolete by new technology. Here are a few key examples:

1. **Floppy Disk (1970s - 2000s)**:
   - **Reason**: Replaced by CD-ROMs, USB flash drives, and cloud storage.
   - **Industry Impact**: Led to the decline of physical, low-capacity storage media in favor of more efficient digital storage solutions.

2. **Physical Keyboards on Smartphones (2000s - 2010s)**:
   - **Reason**: Replaced by capacitive touchscreens with virtual keyboards.
   - **Industry Impact**: Standardized the touchscreen interface, paving the way for more interactive and user-friendly mobile devices.

3. **iPod Classic (2001 - 2014)**:
   - **Reason**: The iPhone and iPod Touch offered better features like touchscreens, apps, and internet connectivity.
   - **Industry Impact**: Shifted the focus from dedicated media players to multifunctional smartphones.

4. **Headphone Jack (2016 - present)**:
   - **Reason**: Removed starting with the iPhone 7 to make room for new technologies and improved water resistance.
   - **Industry Impact**: Accelerated the adoption of wireless headphones and earbuds, influencing other manufacturers to eliminate the headphone jack in favor of wireless solutions.

Given these examples, if Apple truly believed the iPad could replace a fully-featured laptop, why do they still sell the MacBook Pro? Apple's willingness to discontinue products like the iPod when they become redundant suggests that their continued production of laptops indicates a distinct and necessary role for these devices.

Additionally, the iPad is fundamentally different from devices like the Microsoft Surface. The Surface is designed to be a direct competitor to traditional laptops, with detachable keyboards and a full desktop operating system. In contrast, the iPad excels in areas more aligned with traditional notebooks, e-readers, and Android tablets. Its strengths lie in its portability, touch interface, and the tailored experiences provided by iPadOS.

Furthermore, the call for macOS on the iPad overlooks the unique value of iPadOS. iPadOS is optimized for touch, offers a streamlined user experience, and supports a different workflow than macOS. Expecting Apple to merge these operating systems ignores the distinct advantages each one brings to their respective devices. People who are holding out hope for Apple to bring macOS to the iPad are likely to be disappointed.

In summary:
- Apple still sells MacBooks because they recognize that iPads and MacBooks serve different purposes and markets.
- The iPad is more of a competitor to notebooks, e-readers, and Android tablets, not to devices like the Surface which are aimed at replacing traditional laptops.
- iPadOS and macOS are designed for different use cases, and merging them would undermine the strengths of each platform.

CMV: The iPad is not supposed to be a laptop replacement, and expecting it to fulfill this role disregards Apple's product strategy and the unique strengths of the iPad."
0,2024-06-20,"CMV: Many black communities in America are suffering under self-inflicted wounds driven by a victimhood mentality, which was recently confirmed via a Pew research poll showing that a majority or more of Black Americans believe in racial conspiracy theories.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dkpji0/cmv_many_black_communities_in_america_are/,changemyview,"Pew released a really shocking [study](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/06/15/most-black-americans-believe-u-s-institutions-were-designed-to-hold-black-people-back/):

>A new analysis suggests that many Black Americans believe the racial bias in U.S. institutions is not merely a matter of passive negligence; it is the result of intentional design. Specifically, large majorities describe the prison (74%), political (67%) and economic (65%) systems in the U.S., among others, as having been designed to hold Black people back, either a great deal or a fair amount.

It's important to recognize that these respondents are not saying that they think there are disparities in the system which suggest bias, they believe that these systems were *intentionally designed from conception* to systematically and perpetually oppress Black Americans onward into the future indefinitely.

Obviously this is a deeply troubling and, in my view, quite deranged thing to believe which is antithetical to reality in the modern age.

The study goes on:

>Black Americans‚Äô mistrust of U.S. institutions is informed by history, from slavery to the implementation of Jim Crow laws in the South, to the rise of mass incarceration and more.

Nevermind that ""mass incarceration"" isn't a thing - if someone is arrested, it's almost always because they were committing a crime. So really we have a ""mass crime"" problem in that case. But this is beside the point.

I understand that Black Americans faced discrimination and oppression historically in the United States, but so have other groups, such as Jewish-Americans and Asian-Americans (especially Japanese-Americans), and these groups are doing quite well in the modern age.

This study sheds light on a deeply troubling reality: that a majority to super-majority of Black Americans *genuinely believe* that the *entire system* of governance in America is *specifically designed* to oppress them and prevent them from succeeding in life and receiving basic services in the form of health care, policing, criminal justice, and economics (?).

If that's not a racial conspiracy, I don't know what is.

Pew actually originally used the headline, **""Most Black Americans Believe Racial Conspiracy Theories""** which is, in my opinion, an accurate and truthful description of the data, but due to public backlash they changed the wording to be more politically correct which is a deep black mark on Pew's credibility which will never be erased but, again, this is beside the point.

I've thought about this topic some and it seems to me that many modern Black Americans have adopted a problematic culture which could be called ""gang culture"" - *which may have formed as a result of historical oppression -* that they have unfortunately decided to solidify as a core aspect of their ethnic identity in the United States, which is really unfortunate because the culture has many harmful and damaging aspects that hurt the community as a whole including promotion of crime and especially drug use and drug dealing, gang activity resulting in widespread violence and death, treating sexual relationships lightly resulting in fatherless homes and single motherhood being commonplace, and other problems.

However I didn't realize that so many Black Americans genuinely believe that almost all basic systems in America are specifically designed to oppress them as part of their core function. I think this is very damaging to the Black community because - and this is the crux of my view - **in order for these beliefs to be maintained, the conditions of Black America cannot improve, and Black Americans take measures, subconsciously or otherwise, to sabotage themselves and their communities to this end.**

And so, I believe that collectively, Black Americans act and behave in a way that sort of fulfills the self-fulfilling prophecy that they're oppressed and cannot succeed, and the problem is that racists in the distant past set up these systems specifically to oppress them, and modern racists who operate within the system maintain and protect these systems in order to stop Black people from being successful (for some reason).

I think this Pew study is deeply troubling, but more importantly it shows the primary problem with many Black communities in America, at long last. This is the answer. This is why Black Americans continue to struggle to improve themselves and their communities: they have deeply held beliefs which must be maintained, and the only way to maintain that is self-sabotage.

So that's what I think this data shows. But I'm sure many of you disagree, so...change my view.

Who you are attracted to matters much less than forming a family and experiencing the joy of raising your own children. Life is far more than sexual attraction, which maybe lasts only about 20 years of your life. In contrast, a family can create something beautiful that lasts well beyond your lifetime.  
  
I don't like when people just focus on sex for some period of their life while forgetting the purpose of the sex. Building a family and raising kids can bring a deep sense of purpose and fulfillment that goes way beyond the temporary buzz of romantic attraction.

Your parents gave birth to you, that is the literal reason you exist and one of your role is to help create the next generation. By prioritizing family, you‚Äôre not just enriching your own life but also creating a legacy and contributing to the community.¬†"

Some of you may think this is satire. meant to be a joke or AI generated, No. its not. i worked hard on writing this and i believe that i deserve your respect for the hard work i put into this topic. Be respectful.

Ok guys, i know you might be shocked as you read the title, but you have to listen to me. No judgement here. Roblox avatars are beautiful, and may even be better than real women. Roblox avatars as of late have started looking excessively attractive, so its not my fault i think like this. in the expansive realm of virtual worlds, Roblox stands as a vibrant testament to human creativity and expression. Within this digital universe, avatars reign as the embodiment of personal identity, each one a unique masterpiece meticulously crafted to reflect individual tastes and desires. These avatars, far from mere pixelated figures, exude an undeniable charm and captivating allure that has enthralled millions of users worldwide. If i could post images of what avatars im talking about precisely, i would show you/

In the expansive online universe of Roblox, avatars aren't mere digital figures they're the embodiment of personal style and creativity. These virtual beings have captured the hearts of millions worldwide with their unique allure and endless potential for personalization. Unlike real-world appearances, Roblox avatars transcend the limitations of genetics and societal norms. They're blank canvases where users can let their imaginations run wild. With a vast array of clothing, accessories, and body modifications, each avatar becomes a carefully curated masterpiece. From gravity-defying hairstyles to clothing ensembles that would turn heads on any runway, the possibilities for self-expression are truly limitless. The sheer variety of customization options in Roblox is mind-boggling. Users can mix and match items from different genres, creating avatars that are eclectic, edgy, or simply breathtakingly elegant. This leads to a stunning tapestry of visual diversity, celebrating individuality and fostering a sense of belonging within the vibrant Roblox community. But Roblox avatars are more than just digital fashion statements. They're powerful tools for self-expression and identity exploration. For many users, their avatars represent an idealized version of themselves, embodying qualities they aspire to or traits they wish to emphasize. Avatars become extensions of the self, allowing users to experiment with different personas and discover new facets of their personalities. The social aspect of Roblox further amplifies the appeal of avatars. Users interact with one another through their virtual representations, forging friendships, joining groups, and participating in virtual events. Avatars become more than just digital figures; they become social avatars, facilitating communication and fostering a sense of community. The ability to express oneself through a carefully crafted avatar adds a layer of depth and richness to social interactions, making them more engaging and meaningful. Roblox avatars have evolved over time, and with each update, new features and customization options are introduced, pushing the boundaries of creativity and expanding the possibilities for self-expression. From dynamic facial expressions to lifelike body movements, avatars have become increasingly expressive and captivating. This has sparked a surge in user-generated content, with countless videos, images, and even virtual fashion shows dedicated to showcasing the latest avatar trends and styles. In the end, Roblox avatars are much more than just pixels on a screen. They're captivating expressions of human creativity, personal identity, and the desire for social connection. Their appeal lies in their ability to transcend the limitations of the physical world, empowering users to craft unique identities and explore new facets of their personalities. In a world where appearances often matter, Roblox avatars offer a refreshing alternative, allowing users to embrace their individuality and express themselves freely. It's this freedom, coupled with the boundless opportunities for creativity and social connection, that makes Roblox avatars truly captivating and alluring.

Changing it should at most require clicking a hamburger button, then a little gear button, and then it should be one of the top level options. The reason for this is that a program being in the wrong language, especially if it tries to guess the language of the used by ip or system language instead of having the user choose the language from a list, is the most likely reason for a program being unusable for an end user. 

You should not need to know what the word ""language"" looks like in the current language to switch it. You should not need to know what the name of the language looks like in that language. 

Language dependent ui changes like flipping the ui for displaying Arabic are acceptable, they help the end user and I think someone will be able to figure them out if they suddenly are using the Arabic version instead of the English version.

This view obviously only applies to multilingual software. Some software are only made for one language community and that's fine."

in my observation, i find that a young boy/ man, especially a white man/boy( they dominate the countries we refer to as the west) have absolutely no incentive to join the left because the groups that constitute the left are completely antagonistic towards them.

I mean look, if I am villified as a young man for my gender and skin color by members that pertains to an ideology, then I am not joining that ideology.

a generation or 12-18 year old men are on the internet, especially on apps like tik tok and Instagram. A 12 year old boy isn't the cause of oppression to anyone, be it feminists, trans people,  disabled people or anyone else. He's been on the planet for only 12 years and if you're telling him that he's a part of the problem because of his gender and his skin color when he did no wrong, you're creating an enemy. simple as that.

I also see a lot of incredible bait and switch amongst the left, especially when it comes to young men. A lot of them will proceed with nonsense like ""misandry doesn't exist because men can't have feel oppression"". If you point out to instances where men are harassed or attacked or outright bullied by women, then they switch to ""oh, we meant that the prejudice isn't systematic"".

I sit there and wonder how exactly does that change anything. The boy/ man who was prejudiced against still got prejudiced against. What's with this denial that prejudice can only be prejudiced, hate can only be hate if it's systematic and only then we'll call it out.

and finally comes the biggest bullshit - men should open about their emotions. i mean when they do, you try to tone police them, mock them, villify them and tell them that they can express their emotions but only under these parameters and only if they don't blame X groups( I've seen this a lot on subs that are supposed to be progressive like r/menslib).

I agree that the right wing also doesn't offer any solutions but men are drawn to it because it doesn't actively villify, berate, belittle and antagonise men. 

It's that simple."

NVIDIA is the center of AI innovation and SMCI is only complementary. Without NVIDIA's AI role, SMCI wouldn't have been going up. I believe most of the stock's upside is due to NVIDIA's business contract with SMCI.

I understand that a lot of respected philosophers support moral realist positions (atheistic ones, that is) and I‚Äôve never found the arguments convincing. Perhaps I should read more, but I‚Äôd like to list my objections and maybe hear some compelling arguments from you all 


The way I see it is that there‚Äôs an ontological gap between descriptive and normative concepts. What *is* the case about the universe cannot seem to directly entail what *ought* to be the case without presupposing some normative value statement to begin with. 

I think moral realists need to do the following to make their position work:

-claim that values are independent objects that we ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù and whose truth values persist regardless of our mental states and preferences. Unless these values are empirically discoverable, this seems to just be unfalsifiable  

-use a proprietary version of moral truth that is contingent on a subjective value. For instance, if I arbitrarily decide that whatever improves wellbeing is what‚Äôs morally good, then I can figure out which actions objectively fulfill that virtue. But the virtue itself seems subjective to me 

I think anti-realism, or specifically some kind of emotivism, makes the most sense and requires the fewest assumptions. It would explain why morals seem to change with time and place and seems consistent with an evolutionary model. That is, if moral statements are merely our way of uttering our visceral feelings about things, then there‚Äôs presumably some evolutionary reason as to why we do that. I‚Äôm aware this would be post-hoc, but it at least has some explanatory virtue.

Currently the ruling president is Bong Bong Marcos, the son of one of the most corrupt and evil politicians the Philippines has ever seen. He has administered several policies that have as to date not been far too effective such as preventing the import of refined sugar causing a shortage. This shortage is caused primarily by the lacking land and industry in farming. This is the very same guy who did not graduate college.

On the other hand there was the former president Rodrigo Road Duterte who led his term with the death of tens of thousands of both enemies, journalists, drug addicts, and drug lords. All these deaths are a violation of multiple internation human rights because it has avoided and did not use the due process by the time of death.

There has been some controversy about whether or not exams are a good way to track the results of students. I believe that while exams aren't perfect, they're much better than other systems.

However, those who criticize exams argue that students are stressed, and I believe that this is because of the time limit.

Moreover, time limits punish students who write more descriptively, and favors those who write lazier and less detailed answers.

In my country, they've been experimenting with giving extra time to students who have learning disabilities, and while it sounds good, it has resulted in every parent should claiming their kid has a learning disability and getting extra time, especially those who can afford a psychological diagnosis. While it of course would be bad to abolish extra time for students who do need it, since there's no reliable way to distinguish between those who need and those who don't need it, we might as well just give unlimited time to anyone.

I believe that exams should **only measure knowledge**, and thus, at least in theory, time limits should be abolished. It's unfair when a student that knows the subject very well fails because he didn't hand in the test before a certain time.

In practice though, it would be hard to implement. So it can be impractical to implement this in a smaller, elementary school exam. But, in a bigger, standardized exam, it should be implemented, perhaps by changing the overseers every couple hours into the test, for as much time as needed.

EDIT: Most of the arguments here come down to the fundamental question of:

Is the purpose of exams to **measure a student's knowledge of the subject**, or is it to **prepare the student for real life**?

I believe the former, because students need an indication of how are they doing academically. **Therefore, I *will not* reply to any comments that don't challenge that belief.**

EDIT 2: After having read the comments, I think I changed my view because I understood that completing the exam in a certain time is part of what the exam wants to measure. Thank you all."
145,2024-06-21,CMV: The UK's Rwanda Immigration plan was always stupid and self contradictory,u/VertigoOne,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dl5pwv/cmv_the_uks_rwanda_immigration_plan_was_always/,changemyview,"TL;DR - the way that the UK passed the laws to make the Rwanda plan work undermines sending people to Rwanda as a deterrent against seeking asylum in the UK  
  
For those not in the know, the UK's Rwanda plan was as follows:

""On 14 April 2022, the UK government announced that it was going to send certain people seeking asylum in the UK to the Republic of Rwanda, where the Rwandan government would decide their asylum claims. If their claims were successful, they would be granted asylum in Rwanda, not the UK.""

[The Migration Observatory](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/commentaries/qa-the-uks-policy-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda/#:~:text=On%2014%20April%202022%2C%20the,in%20Rwanda%2C%20not%20the%20UK)

Read the link for a more detailed overview

The reason the policy is stupid is because it obviously is the UK shirking its responsibility when it comes to asylum. International human rights law is very clear on this point. Everyone has right to claim asylum wherever they like. It does not specify that you have to get to the nearest ""safe"" country or anything like that.

[This is true in the UK as it is elsewhere](https://fullfact.org/immigration/can-refugees-enter-uk-illegally/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=advert&utm_campaign=immigration&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwydSzBhBOEiwAj0XN4ESq2_G0gADLf7T4JqAdesBOfkTmW9BOy0V6b-pyj6Ie-PYjXm2eqRoCqP8QAvD_BwE)

However it is more than just stupid, it's self contradictory.

The logic behind the plan was a deterrence. The idea being that people would not want to seek asylum in the UK because they would end up getting sent to Rwanda instead. This only works as a deterrent if Rwanda is somehow a ""Bad"" place, somewhere that it would be bad to go to etc.

When the UK's Supreme Court ruled on the initial Rwanda plan, they concluded that it would breach the UK's human rights obligations because Rwanda was not safe enough to have people effectively processed there (the Migration observatory link explains this in more depth).

The UK government's response to this was to then pass a law saying that for all official intents and purposes Rwanda was to be classified as ""Safe"". This was the government's way of circumventing the supreme court.

Leaving aside the asinine nature of going about things this way, surely the fact that the UK Government has in fact specifically legislated that Rwanda is indeed ""safe"" now undermines the deterrence factor of the entire plan in the first place. After all, Rwanda is safe - so says the house of commons itself! So... how is that a deterrent. If you claim asylum in the UK, you will be sent somewhere else that's just as safe?

So... can someone explain how this policy ever made sense?

In my opinion, Rachael should not have ended up with Ross in the end. She should have moved to France and left Ross.

Rachaels personal arc of the show is starting out as a spoilt woman-child who relies on daddies money and her future-husbands money to live a shallow, sheltered life. She comes to Monica to try and experience more of life.

She single-handedly builds her independence, career and life, earning the admiration of her friends and family. In my opinion, the ultimate cherry on top would be to take her career to the fashion capital of the world for an amazing salary and solid independence. 

Of course, to aid the ""will they-won't they"" narrative of the show, her decision to stay is ultimately played as the perfect ending of the romantic arc of her and Ross' relationship, but not looking at it from the perspective as a viewer and taking a critical look at the ending, surely her achieving her ultimate dream separate from the dependency of a man is the best outcome for her.

This isn't even starting on how her and Ross' relationship plays out throughout the show. His continued need to try and sabotage her friendships with men, sabotage her career and his borderline-obsessive need to control her and her life is kind of weird.

I know people like to dunk on Ross because of he acts kind of psycho throughout the show, but if this was a real life situation, why would Rachael pass up the opportunity of a lifetime to stay with a guy who she's had such a rocky relationship with?

This isn't meant to be some heated debate and I understand that if they hadn't gotten together in the end, it would have hurt the ending narratively, I'm just looking at the show from the critical lens of real life. Let me know what you think!"

I don‚Äôt buy it at all.

A semi auto pistol can fire much faster than someone can punch. Which means it can also kill faster. You could not beat that even if you tried to. Nobody will just hold their gun out for you to grab. If you try to grab the gun, they will pull it back and shoot you. 

Let‚Äôs say you do manage to grab the gun and now you both are fighting over it. Now its up to whoever is stronger to win. Otherwise they will just pull back enough to aim the muzzle at you and start shooting. If you aren‚Äôt stronger than the person you are taking the weapon from, prepare to die. Beware that other people around you may get shot during the ordeal.

I also want to mention that in 99% of cases. If someone is pointing a gun at you, just give them your valuables. Don‚Äôt carry too much cash on you, cancel your credit cards if they steal them, and put a tracker on your vehicle. You‚Äôll survive and maybe even get your stuff back with help from the cops. But even if you lose your stuff, it‚Äôs never worth your life or someone else‚Äôs. 

The only way I could see it happening is if you are significantly stronger than the person with the gun, AND you are EXTREMELY quick. Otherwise I think it‚Äôs more trouble than it‚Äôs worth.

They are commonly stated to have 3 aspects: sovereignty, non-intervention, and the legal equality of states, and I‚Äôll address each in turn.  

Sovereignty has already been derogated from in the form of human rights conventions and supernational organizations. There are some things which we all accept that a state cannot do in its own territories‚Äîit can‚Äôt engage in genocide, it cannot torture, it cannot kill indiscriminately. Further, there is no good reason that a state should even have exclusive jurisdiction on some territory, why should it be that people on one patch of soil this side of the border should follow entirely different laws from people on a patch of soil on the opposite side?  

Non-intervention is one of the reasons that we can‚Äôt actually have universal human rights‚Äîif states cannot generally intervene in another state, then there‚Äôs nothing stopping states from simply not fulfilling its obligations under human rights treaties.  Further, why is a group of people allowed to exclusively make laws in some area of land but not others?  

Legal equality of states is extremely problematic because it makes the creation of a world parliament either impossible or only an utterly powerless one to exist. Why should a tiny microstate have the same legal rights as a world superpower?  

To preempt some comments, I said ‚Äòone of the worst‚Äô, so presenting me with a ‚Äòworse‚Äô development won‚Äôt cut it. Also, I‚Äôm using Westphalian sovereignty as a shorthand for the system of modern international relations based on the three principles I‚Äôve stated, so comments explaining how the Westphalian treaties of 1648 didn‚Äôt actually establish any sovereignty is neither here nor there.

West Eurasia and East Eurasia are immense areas with mixed populations. When you assign haplogroups to such large categories, it can mask the finer genetic differences present in each area. For instance, Europe, the Middle East, and some parts of Central Asia have a separate genetic makeup that falls under West Eurasia. Also, the partition between Eurasia's west and east is not always so clear-cut geographically and genetically speaking. Regions where genetics changes not abruptly but bit by bit over the transitional levels exist."

I am very fascinated in what makes people tick and I pay close attention to everyone including those I dislike. I am a firm believer that you can learn something from everyone. One thing I believe to be true is that growing up, at one point, I knew I was sexually attracted to women. This started when I was around seven years old and I noticed my sisters naked barbie dolls and thought 'This is is really interesting to me, but I don't want to play with it?' That's how it started.
 
Fast forward a few years later at around ten years old I attended a local church's youth group. I can remember a slightly older girl sitting across from me on the bus who was leaning back and I could see up her shirt, I'm a kid so I stare as kids do, she notices me and immediately puts her shirt down. Fast forward another two years and I start noticing changes as we all do during puberty. I knew what I was attracted to instantly. Women. 

Many years later I have even asked myself 'Are men sexually attractive?' and, nope, does nothing for me at all. Now, this is just my experience, for the most part I had a normal upbringing, but there was some abuse, both physical and sexual all happening before puberty. They were brief but they had their effect on me, from what I know one is I am aggressive towards other men especially if they are creepy and I used to objectify women and I have since worked on those things in therapy. 

With all of the book banning and teachers being threatened and fired over unsubstantiated claims of mass grooming, what is the root? Fear. It's fear. It's a projected fear that kids are all going to reach a point where they are pansexual and the words of others are going to influence the outcome of their future sexuality? This tells me that the people who are afraid of this DO have sexual attraction that are not hetero or of societal norms.

So, with all of that said I have come to the conclusion that you can only believe this if you are closeted and self hating of it.

This is my view, how I've reached this view, and I am open to anyone else's experience or view that can challenge it. Perhaps there are other elements to the hate that I am missing and I am oversimplifying it? "

0,2024-06-22,CMV: Veganism is a horrible and pointless lifestyle choice,u/Logical_Newspaper981,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dlv81t/cmv_veganism_is_a_horrible_and_pointless/,changemyview,"Our bodies need more nutrients than can be obtained from a strictly vegan diet if we want to function properly. Every vegan I have ever spoken to seems to have a very short temper when questioned about their lifestyle and I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs because they are aware their diet is not as good for them as they want people to think. There are loads of digestive issues many vegans have due to their diet.

It‚Äôs also an impractical lifestyle that would be difficult to maintain long term. It would make it difficult to go to any social gatherings if the entire group of people are not also vegan. It would be difficult to go out to eat and find a restaurant that serves a purely vegan dish.

Veganism is not as good for the environment as vegans want you to think either. If no human intervened with animals and killed them for food, there would be a massive overpopulation of animals which would lead to less food for the animals, eventually causing starvation for certain animal groups in the wild. Arguably, this would be a more cruel death for the animal than the way humans are doing it now.

Vegans will always ask ‚Äúwhat is the ethical and moral difference between killing an animal and murdering a person‚Äù and use that as their argument for veganism because they know everyone believes murdering a person is wrong. But killing an animal that is going to be eaten by humans is not comparable to murdering a person. If someone was killing an animal without the intention to eat it or use its products in some way then yes, that is horrible, to just kill an animal for the sake of killing it. 

Veganism also includes not eating animal products such as eggs or milk. There is no harm done to an animal by eating an egg or milk it produces.

Vegans will say a part of the reason they chose the lifestyle is because eating another animal or using animal products indicates you think you are more important than that animals life.

I was once told by a vegan that there is an exception to veganism during a survival situation. Meaning, if a vegan was in a situation where they were either going to die from starvation or eat meat or animal product to survive, it would be okay for them to eat the meat or animal product. However, this exception that apparently exists debunks their entire stance that humans are not more important than animals because choosing to kill and eat an animal just so you can survive means you definitely value your life more than that animal‚Äôs life. If you didn‚Äôt, then you would allow yourself to starve just so the animal could live."

0,2024-06-22,CMV: Closet psychopaths pretend to be anti-racist/anti-fascist/anti-Nazi in order to give themselves a socially acceptable target to act upon.,u/irespectwomenlol,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dlvnie/cmv_closet_psychopaths_pretend_to_be/,changemyview,"While I emphasize that mind-reading isn't a thing and there's no way to objectively ""prove this"" about any particular person, my overall view is that a non-trivial portion of people who like to outwardly label themselves in the general category of anti-racists, anti-fascists, Antifa, or Nazi punchers don't genuinely give much more than a token shit about that cause.

I think a non-trivial portion of them are really just psychopaths who have identified a group in society that it's socially acceptable to make fun of, lash out on, try and dox and get fired from jobs, stalk online and do mean things to, or even literally just punch in the street.

Would people really adopt some political view just to further some closet personality disorder? IMO, yes. Look at how abusive men in Hollywood or Media outwardly pretend to be ""allies"" to women in order to get close enough to sexually abuse them. Some of the creepiest fucks are those that outwardly say stuff like ""Believe all Women!"" the hardest. 

If you're a closet psychopath who wants a license to fuck with somebody in a way that doesn't have negative consequences for you, going after people who are labeled as ""Nazis"" is about the safest course you have to live your best life. 

This is partially why the label of Nazi or Fascist started getting thrown around so easily in American political discourse in the last few years. This is very convenient because if you label your opponent as a Nazi or Fascist, then any behavior against them becomes morally ""justifiable enough"".

As an aside, I think it's probable that throughout American history, when the current villain de jure and moral panic changed, psychopaths probably adopted whatever public viewpoint was most stringently against them. I wouldn't be surprised if quite a few psychopaths joined the KKK back in the day, not because they necessarily hated Black people, but because they wanted to join in whenever they heard some lynching was going to happen. I wouldn't be surprised if during the Communist scare, some people became virulently anti-Communist not because they really gave much of a shit, but because it allowed them somewhat of a reign to act abusive towards somebody. 

IMO, a non-trivial portion of people loosely organized as ""Antifa"" largely because it was a chance for these closet psychopaths to engage in real life violence in a way that most likely wouldn't get them in too much trouble. I don't want to be cruel towards anybody's looks or immutable characteristics, but if you do an image search for ""Antifa mugshots"" you can identify some particularly odd looking folx in that bunch. Now, maybe they're coincidentally just really big Nazi haters, but I'd speculate on many of them feeling dejected and withdrawn from society because they have trouble fitting in and decided to loosely organize as ""Antifa"" because they finally had a target that they could physically take out anti-social frustrations on without great risk of getting in really big trouble.

So my view is this. I think a non-trivial portion of these people are just closet psychopaths who want a free target for their intrusive thoughts. If it suddenly became socially acceptable to punch Gingers, you'd see some of these same people start labeling themselves as anti-Reddists or something, hell, even if they were actually gingers themselves as long as they could hide it.

Here's a few anticipated counterpoints to get you started:

* **Oh no, let's all cry for how badly the Nazis are treated!** Not really, my main point here is to make a comment on performative anti-fascism from people who use it to justify unnecessary violence and anti-social behavior.
* **Does that mean if I hate Nazis I'm a psychopath?** Not necessarily of course, but I think it's possible.
* **Actually, Antifa isn't an organization!** I never said it was. Whether or not you signed an official membership form at an Antifa website or just showed up dressed in black based on some Facebook messages to try and hit people with a baseball bat is irrelevant to the point.
* **You're a Nazi!** By modern political standards, probably, but everybody to the right of Bernie Sanders has probably earned that label in some online debate or another.
* **Actually, it's always ok to punch Nazis!** No it's not. You may be a psychopath.
* **Psychopath isn't the right term to use!** I'm not a clinical psychologist and may be using that term somewhat incorrectly, but just assume I'm using the connotation and not the denotation of the word. If there's a better term, please provide it."

I frankly think this is kind of fucked.

It shows the parent doesn't trust the child or respect their autonomy. Kids can be stupid sometimes, I'm perfectly willing to acknowledge that, but they're also still humans. They need to learn how to behave in a public space, as well as how to stay safe and not get lost, and putting them on a leash and not giving them the chance to explore their surroundings seems like it would stifle that learning.

When I see a parent walking their child on a leash it just makes me think that they see their child as a pet or an accessory, whom they can't be bothered to teach how to stick by their side without the use of a physical restraint. And if a physical restraint is necessary, why not just have the kid hold your hand? That way there's a level of physical contact and the kid can feel more like the parent is a trustworthy protector than a restraint from exploring the fun things around them.

I'd be willing to have my mind changed on this, because I don't like being so judgmental of parents when I don't have kids of my own. I'll consider my view changed if someone can give me a valid reason why this practice is best for both the parent *and* the child. There are plenty of reasons it's easier for the parent, but that I feel comes at the expense of the child."

As I said before, they weren‚Äôt without flaws and while patriarchal and sexist in their own ways, they still offered a comparatively more egalitarian environment for women then Confucianism did. There‚Äôs a reason catholicism, while late to take root in Korea when compared to Japan and China, proved so popular with women in a neo Confucian society. Do you have any idea how sexist you have to be for 18th century Catholicism do be seen as a liberating ideology? Beyond that here are 3 main reasons. 

1. Women could have roles in the Christian church. Not as priests, rabbis or imams but there was space in all three organizations for women in a way there wasn‚Äôt in Confucian scholar bureaucracy. 

2. They offered ways for women to divorce and still retain her dowry or brideprice. While there was considerable variation over both time and society, in general women had more leeway in filing for divorce in Christianity, Islam and Judaism than they did in Confucian society. Who reserved women‚Äôs right to divorce mainly on the grounds for physical mutilation ‚Äî regular beatings didn‚Äôt count, cutting your wife‚Äôs nose off *might* be grounds for her to divorce you ‚Äî while men could leave their wives with nothing if they didn‚Äôt show suitable submission or didn‚Äôt look hot anymore. 

3. All 3 religions valued female infants in ways Confucian doctrine ‚Äî at least in its execution on the ground ‚Äî didn‚Äôt. In theory, as all children were equals in gods eyes and the Virgin Mary proved you could be ostensibly a woman, pregnant and still be seen as something of worth outside of your attractiveness and ability to birth a son. In muslim Spain there were guides published in Arabic on how to please your wife. There‚Äôs no equivalent interest in women‚Äôs opinions in any of the Confucian texts. 

Duty to father, duty to husband and duty son were the creed and code of women in Confucian societies like Korea and China and the Big 3 gave women more flexibility to develop and identity and personality outside the crushing weight of patriarchal norms. "
0,2024-06-22,CMV: Members of the military should be forced to donate blood when there are severe shortages,u/lichenousinfanthog,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dm01rp/cmv_members_of_the_military_should_be_forced_to/,changemyview,"I'm writing this with the United States in mind, but I can't think of any reasons why it wouldn't apply to any country that has an all-volunteer military. I don't think this should be done when there are volunteer donors available, or until a shortage is severe enough that people are dying as a result. Admittedly I don't know enough (after my minimal research) about the current state of the blood supply to know if this is the case today, but that doesn't affect the substance of my argument, although I would like to know if anyone wants to comment with that information.

Anyway, my argument is rather simple. Giving blood has no serious negative effects on most people but can save lives. The only reason I can see for it not to be required as a ""tax"" is that this infringement of bodily autonomy is alarming to most people. I agree with that sentiment for civilians. 

However, we do things to the military that would be unacceptable to do to civilians all the time. They joined willing to sacrifice some of their rights for the greater good, and we don't allow them to renege on that promise even if they want out of a dangerous situation. Of course we engage in wars knowing people will die, but there are many other things the military does to its members that would cause an outcry if applied to civilians, such as:

* imprisoning them if they quit their job too early
* moving them around the world whether or not they want to live there
* banning beards, long hair, colorful hair, etc. 
* banning political activism (for generals and for anyone in uniform)
* subjecting them to an entirely different justice system where they do not have all the same rights as civilians (not saying it is kangaroo court, but there are still some things like non-unanimous jury verdicts, which the Supreme Court recently ruled unconstitutional for civilians)

So if we are okay with these things because they are only imposed on people who voluntarily joined, I don't see why we can't extend this to blood donations. Anyone who is totally uncomfortable with the idea could simply abstain from joining the military. We could also allow members who joined before the change to opt out. However I get the feeling that many people will think this is abuse or exploitation and I would like to know why so I am posting here. Change my view. "
0,2024-06-22,"CMV: Actions like murder or abortion are morally wrong, but personal reasons can outweigh moral judgment.",u/wildfleursoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dm03uu/cmv_actions_like_murder_or_abortion_are_morally/,changemyview,"Here‚Äôs my perspective:

I believe certain actions, like murder or abortion, are inherently morally wrong. However, I also believe that there are situations where personal motivations and circumstances can compel someone to commit these actions, and those reasons might feel more important than the moral implications.

For instance, if someone were to murder a loved one,  I probably wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to seek revenge and kill that person. I wouldn‚Äôt regret it either, and I‚Äôd probably do it again if I had to. But I wouldn‚Äôt try to justify it by saying that my act of murder was morally right. I know it‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôd simply feel that my personal reasons for doing it outweigh the morality of the situation.

Similarly, with abortion, if I were to get pregnant and wasn‚Äôt ready to have the child for whatever reason, I might choose to have an abortion. I wouldn‚Äôt try to rationalize it by denying the moral implications but rather acknowledge the complexity of the decision and the personal factors involved.

I find it more honest to confront these moral dilemmas head-on rather than seeking to rationalize or excuse them. Admitting that an action is morally wrong but necessary under certain circumstances might help us deal with conflicting feelings and move forward.

Additionally, I want to clarify that I don't believe individuals who commit morally wrong actions are inherently bad people. I don't subscribe to the notion of categorizing people as strictly good or bad. Instead, I believe in the complexity of human nature and the capacity for individuals to do both good and bad things.

I think it's important not to label someone's entire character based on a single action or decision. A person can be kind-hearted and well-intentioned yet find themselves in circumstances where they make a morally questionable choice. This doesn't define their entire identity or make them inherently evil.

Human behavior is influenced by a multitude of factors including upbringing, environment, personal experiences, and emotional state. I feel like acknowledging this complexity allows us to see individuals more holistically, beyond the dichotomy of good versus bad.

I‚Äôm curious to hear what you guys think and am very open to different perspectives that challenge my view. :)

If you stumbled upon two people having a disagreement about the morality of murder I think most people might be surprised when they can't resolve the argument in a way where they objectively prove that one person is incorrect. There is no universal law or rule that says that murder is wrong or even if there is we have no way of proving that it exists. The most you can do is say ""well murder is wrong because most people agree that it is"", which at most is enough to prove that morality is subjective in a way that we can kind of treat it as if it were objective even though its not.

While the program has requirements that H1-Bs must be paid the prevailing wage, when I ask other managers about it, they all say that H1-B's ""work harder,"" meaning, basically, they never go home -- which in essence means the company pays them less.

The will to rule exists. The will to rule the world similarly exists. This ‚Äúwill‚Äù may not exist in your own heart but you know it exists in the hearts of others. Look no further than Ghengis Khan, Alexander the Great, Hitler and so many others as proof of this. But this will to rule all has historically been confounded by geography, financing, distance, weather, oceans, logistics, and communications. The result is that this will to rule all has necessarily been reduced to the rule of all within a certain geographical area. Tribes, feudal states, nation states are examples.

In Darwinian terms as expanded upon by subsequent evolutionary theorists and economists, the world of say 20 years ago did not have an environmental niche capable of occupation by a would be emperor of all. It did not have Aristotle‚Äôs incipient void because it lacked that permeability allowing for its occupancy let alone existence. That permeability now exists. The internet is here and transcends geographical barriers and has permeated all aspects of society, culture, government, finances, down to the individual. The result, a niche or opportunity has been created for one world rule. Where a niche exists and a will and means to occupy that niche exist, it will be filled. Such is the incipient void.

Juxtapose yesterdays world of nation states and feudal kingdoms with today‚Äôs world. The boundaries and obstacles to world rule by historical figures of past are no longer. For all intents and purposes, today, the oceans are gone; the mountains are gone; communication and logistical hurdles no longer exist; and, weather is whatever. The path to global rule is indeed open.

The logic and lessons of Darwin and Aristotle tell us that this currently existing niche where met by the will or ambition to rule will be filled. Who didn‚Äôt play Risk? Who didn‚Äôt play monopoly? Who didn‚Äôt desire to win all? Yes, the will to rule all is a real thing which exists outside of a board game. But as much as many would like to rule the world, not all can. That title will go to the fittest.

The fittest is not the strongest. The fittest is not the biggest army. The fittest is not the most righteous. The fittest is he, she, they, having the greatest concentration of wealth. Wealth translates to the ability to exert control over the internet, informational outlets, governments, their weapon systems, intelligence services, and yes, inevitably, individuals. Who doesn‚Äôt have an internet profile, a browser search history, a logged and saved record of veritably everything ever emailed, texted, posted, shopped for, all centralized and subject to algorithmic analysis and nefarious use? The question naturally occurs. Who, what, is the most fit to assume, or has assumed, the title of World Emperor?

I can only speculate. Having no problem whatsoever with that.

The deepest pocket is not the U.S. It‚Äôs wealth is too diffuse and its governance too fragmented. The deepest pocket, is instead, a cabal having control over financial institutions whose wealth or control over wealth is measured in the 100s, perhaps 1000s, of trillions. With such concentrated wealth, weaponized to conquer, almost every nation can be, and has likely been, or is in the process of being, bought off and thus subverted (bribed, blackmailed, infiltrated, etc.. ) by such cabal. I would note exceptions to such subversion. China which, because of its particular political structure, its status as a nuclear power, as well as its top down control over its wealth and people, has necessarily been made a part of this Cabal. Subverting China to the will of the Cabal is therefore not possible. Russia also may be somewhat resistant to subversion, hence, the war with Ukraine which is best understood as a negotiation by Russia for inclusion and a greater peace of the world pie. In fact, all current conflicts throughout the world may be considered as negotiations by entities, who have not been completely subverted, for a greater piece of the world pie. This would extend as well to other financial institutions, and entities, not currently part of the Cabal but having some modicum of leverage.

The reader can give context to my exposition above and fill in the names of the Cabal members as well as those competing with it on the world stage. That is beyond me. My purpose here, is to make clear, not by reference to the specific, but by reference to logic and the principles of evolution as applied to institutions of governance that one world government is an absolute certainty. Let‚Äôs hope humanity ends up with a world led by those who are not horrific. Look around. Do you think we are led by a Cabal that cares about you?

I was going to end here, but, it‚Äôs never over till its over.

I speak of inevitability. I am not wrong. However, there are fractions in the Cabal or competing Cabals or other unknown competitors for the title of World Emperor. Who knows where compromises and competition among them will find the world. And, an aside but relevant one, the Cabal and competitors, have no interest in all out nuclear war, though limited nuclear war or its equivalent where its consequence is radioactive release, might be attractive so as to hide or distract from much of what has already been done. Biological and other such weapons are horrendous things. Who are the possible competitors or players at the table for global rule? While I mentioned wealth as the measure of fitness it is constrained and checked by other variables, traits, of import.

Control of substantial nuclear weapon stockpiles is always something at play in this competition. The ability to destroy something is the ability to control something, Entities having control over the internet‚Äôs infrastructure wield influence in the same way. The fact that individuals can act, sometimes unpredictably and in a manner most would call good, is always a wild card. Entities having control or influence over monetary systems are certainly players. Competing aggregations of wealth are more than a possibility. If the Cabal, the competitors for one world rule, are exposed and evil deeds identified the playing board can radically change, enter, Populism. Finally, one might envision a jihad, as it is more broadly understood (e.g. not confined to any particular religion or religion at all but taking upon itself a religious fervor) against technology. My list here is not exhaustive.

I hope a good Emperor wins the day. Because, the day is coming.

Instead, by you not sharing their viewpoints, someone gets offended that you think differently, and they use Reddit's system to ban or give you a penalty instead of having a real conversation.

You need good karma points, and the privilege to interact on here, so the only way to do that is to join communities that already think like you, bring up talking points that we all agree with, which people like what you have to say so you get good Karma points and privileges.

The result is, you now stay within your echo chamber, never understanding other communities because to try to understand is to get a penalty. 

This seems quite strange to me. It's like social media is a hate creating machine that's rotting the world by rotting the minds of people by making it impossible to understand each other.

Do you agree or disagree and would like to change my view? And...

How does one use social media to learn from others without getting penalized for it? It seems no matter how nice you bring up disagreements, people are going to hate and use the system to hurt you.

0,2024-06-22,CMV: Islam Is the Reason Why the Palestinians Will Never Accept Peace,u/AMGEmperorMundatus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dm6t9d/cmv_islam_is_the_reason_why_the_palestinians_will/,changemyview,"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict could've ended before it truly began in 1948 had the Arabs accepted the UN Partition Plan. Under the plan, there would've been an independent Arab state alongside a Jewish state, and Jerusalem would've been a UN city. The Jews accepted the plan, but the Arabs rejected it and attacked Israel. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War was the first of many failed attempts by the Arabs to wipe Israel off the map and ""push the Jews into the sea."" The 1967 Six-Day War, the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and, most recently, the 2023 Israel-Hamas War were no different. In every case, the Arabs attacked. In every case, the Arabs lost.

Israel's wars with its neighbors, however, only tell part of the story, as to fully understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one must also understand the long history of Palestinian terrorism against both Jews and Arabs. In addition to numerous rocket attacks, countless suicide bombings, two intifadas, one massacre at the 1972 Olympics, and one recent genocidal massacre against Israel, the Palestinians have committed numerous acts of terrorism against other Arab states, including assassinating the King of Jordan and triggering the Lebanese Civil War. This has, unsurprisingly, not helped the Palestinians in any way; nowadays, most of the Arab world wants nothing to do with them.

You would think that the Palestinians would've learned the error of their ways and accepted peace with Israel by now, but the exact opposite has happened. Not only did the people of Gaza elect a terrorist organization (Hamas) to lead them in 2006, but they celebrated the Oct. 7 massacre. To this day, the majority of Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank still support the massacre. For this reason, I and many others have reasoned that the Palestinians want one outcome and one outcome only: the complete destruction of Israel and the extermination of the Jewish people. Thus, they continue to attack Israel, only to lose every single time. Why haven't they given up at this point? There are a few reasons I can think of, but the most likely reason is Islam.

**Islam: The Religion of Death**

Islamic apologists often call Islam the ""religion of peace,"" something that it clearly is not. Of course, bogus claims cannot survive without bogus evidence, and the apologists often provide the most bogus evidence out there. Some people say that the word¬†*Islam*¬†shares a root word with¬†*salam*, the Arabic word for ""peace,"" in order to prove that the word¬†*Islam*¬†means ""peace."" The issue is, this is completely false. Arabic words only have one root, first of all, and the words¬†*Islam*¬†and¬†*salam*¬†descend from entirely different roots. The root word for¬†*Islam*¬†means ""submission."" Thus,¬†*Islam*¬†means submission, and it more than lives up to its name.

When a terrorist blows himself up, flies a plane into the World Trade Center, or guns down more than 300 innocent civilians at a music festival, he is following the Qur'an word for word. The Qur'an contains entire¬†*suwar*¬†calling on Muslims to kill non-Muslims. The Qur'an also states that raping and enslaving non-Muslims is perfectly halal. Here are just a few¬†*suwar*¬†that advocate for violence against non-Muslims:

Surah 3:151:

>

Surah 2:191:

>

Surah 9:5:

>

The Hadith convey similar sentiments, even saying the Judgment Day will not arrive until Muslims exterminate the Jews:

>

Not only that, but the Qur'an and the Hadith both call non-Muslims subhuman multiple times. I don't have exact quotes because I couldn't find any, but the Qur'an and Hadith frequently use dehumanizing language to refer to¬†*kuffƒÅr*¬†(non-Muslims).

Now, apologists will inevitably tell me that the Qur'an also contains several peaceful¬†*suwar*. Namely, one¬†*surah*¬†apparently says that killing one person is equivalent to killing everyone. However, when I look at these peaceful-sounding¬†*suwar*¬†and compare them to the violent¬†*suwar*, it isn't hard to figure out what they mean in conjunction. Clearly, when the Qur'an says ""human,"" it means ""Muslim."" After all, why else would it repeatedly call non-Muslims subhuman? So, killing other¬†*Muslims*¬†is haram, but killing non-Muslims is not only legal, but encouraged. In other words, to be a good Muslim, you must behead every non-Muslim in sight. You must cut out and their hearts and eat them. You must rape to death every non-Muslim woman and girl, cut open their abdomens, and eat their intestines directly out of them. You must drown the non-Muslims in their own blood. You must convert them, murder them, rape them, enslave them, mutilate them, sacrifice them, and cannibalize them until there are no non-Muslims left. That is what Islam is really about. Considering the religion was founded by a pedophilic, murderous psychopath and cannibal, it makes sense that the most devoted followers of the religion are pedophilic, murderous psychopaths and cannibals.

Apologists also often claim that other religions - usually Christianity - are just as bad. This simply is not true. Christianity doesn't have detailed rules for genocidal war against nonbelievers, unlike Islam. Christianity doesn't reduce (the vast majority of) its followers to hateful sociopaths who drink the blood of non-Christians. Christianity and Islam could not be more different on the subject of violence.

Now, am I saying that all Muslims are violent savages? Of course not. In much the same way that most Christians don't do every thing the Bible tells them to, plenty of Muslims don't do every thing the Qur'an tells them to. The issue is, the overwhelming majority of Christians don't execute gays. Meanwhile, the punishment for homosexuality in several Muslim countries is death. And yes, I am aware that homosexuality is punishable by death in the majority-Christian nation of Uganda. The thing is, it is the only Christian-majority country in which that is the case. Additionally, while some primitive and fundamentalist Christian sects that want to execute gays like the Westboro Baptist Church do exist, the overwhelming majority of Christians condemn them. Significantly fewer Muslims do the same; in fact, many mainstream imams openly preach homophobia, antisemitism, misogyny, and religious hatred. Additionally, I've noticed that while many Muslims do condemn terrorist attacks in the name of their religion, they are far more likely to do so when Muslims are victims. Sometimes, such as when Hamas commits the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, Muslims rejoice. So, while there are plenty of Muslims that are nice and peaceful, there are still hundreds of millions of Muslims that will cut off your head and devour your heart.

The Qur'an's encouragement of violence is one reason why the Palestinians have not given up, as they believe that, as Muslims, they must use violence to achieve their goals. The Qur'an and Hadith teach them that all non-Muslims are less valuable than dirt. This erases any reservations about murder that they may still have. The antisemitism in the Qur'an and Hadith teach them to hate Jews especially and be fully willing to slaughter them. This explains why they keep attacking, as they¬†*want*¬†to kill non-believers; their religion tells them to.

**The Goal of Islam**

Now that we have established that Islam is a disgustingly violent religion, we need to go over what the goal of Islam really is. The goal of Islam is to turn the entire world Muslim through voluntary conversion, forced conversion, and murder. Thus, Islam is naturally opposed to freedom of religion. This is important for understanding the Islamic concept of religious persecution.

Muslims have faced legitimate persecution at several points throughout history. I am not denying that. However, I will say that the Islamic definition of religious persecution is different from that of other religions. ""Persecution"" is defined as ""ill-treatment, especially on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, political beliefs, sexual orientation, etc."" Religious persecution, therefore, is ill-treatment on the basis of religion. Most religions define persecution this way. However, Muslims seem to have a different definition.

Islam is inherently a political ideology as well as a religion. The neologism ""political Islam"" is redundant, as the goal of Islam is its implementation as a political ideology. Islam has a whole system of jurisprudence as a result. Thus, anything that impedes the goal of political domination is considered a restriction on a Muslims' freedom to practice his/her religion. Thus, secularism and freedom of religion are considered persecution. Muslims believe that if they are not in control, then they are persecuted.

This explains a lot about why the Palestinians haven't given up. Palestinian victory would be not just a victory for the Palestinians, but a victory for Islam. Islam is a religion that really hates to lose; thus, Muslims are told to not give up until the entire world surrenders to Islam. Thus, even coexistence with Israel would be a ""defeat"" for Islam and thus mean ""persecution."" Palestinians, of course, will not accept anything but a complete victory for Islam, and that's why they have rejected every peace deal with Israel. The only thing they'll agree to is the complete destruction of Israel, as that is the only option that means victory for Islam.

**Suicidal Islam**

Islam does not only wish death upon those who do not practice it; it arguably wishes death upon its most devout followers as well. More specifically, one of the most honorable acts in Islam is martyrdom. Martyrdom is a concept in many religions, and in Islam, martyrs, or¬†*shuhada*, are promised a place in Paradise. Considering Paradise is far from a guarantee for all Muslims, many Muslims aspire to be martyrs. Martyrdom in Islam is very similar to martyrdom in other religions, as being a martyr requires one to sacrifice their life to bear witness to their faith. In fact, the Arabic word for martyr,¬†*shahid*¬†(also romanized¬†*shaheed*), literally means ""witness"" and, in a general sense, means ""witness."" The English word ""martyr"" similarly comes from the Greek word for ""witness.""

In the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, however, the word ""martyr"" usually refers to Palestinians killed by Israelis. ""Martyr"" seems to be one of the Palestinians' favorite words, as both Hamas and the PA overuse it. Namely, whenever Hamas¬†~~fabricates~~¬†counts the number of dead Palestinians, they describe the dead as ""martyrs."" Similarly, the PA runs the ""Martyrs' Fund,"" which pays Palestinians in the West Bank to kill Israeli civilians and hopefully die in the process. In other words, the Palestinians are so obsessed with martyrdom that it makes them suicidal. There's a reason why Palestinian women have sent their teenage sons off to become suicide bombers. They care so much about their religion that they believe that life on Earth has no meaning, as all they have to do to go to Paradise is die in the name of their religion. As many Palestinians themselves have put it, ""the Jews celebrate life, while we celebrate death.""

Ironically, suicide is a grave sin in Islam. It's also a sin in Judaism, Christianity, and most other Abrahamic religions. Apparently, offing yourself to become a martyr is halal for some reason. Either that, or they don't know the details of their religion. You decide.

**The Al-Aqsa Issue**

Located in Jerusalem, Al-Aqsa is the third-holiest site in Islam. It includes many mosques, as well as the Dome of the Rock, the place where Muhammad ascended into Heaven. The issue is, Muhammad never spent a day in Jerusalem, according to historians. The Muslims also didn't conquer Jerusalem until after Muhammad's death.

Indeed, many Jewish critics of Islam accuse Islam of appropriating many beliefs from Judaism, namely the importance of Jerusalem. As Elie Wiesel put it:

>

Indeed, Al-Aqsa is situated on the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. Many Israeli Jews especially view it as a symbol of Islamic colonialism and persecution as a result. Some have outright called for its demolition, partially so Israel can build the Third Temple, an idea that doesn't seem all that popular. Namely, many fear that the demolition of Al-Aqsa would piss off the Palestinians, a fear that is probably well-founded.

In fact, Al-Aqsa is very important to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Most Palestinians believe that the liberation of Al-Aqsa was the cause of Hamas' recent attack on Israel, for instance. Hamas even called the attack plan ""Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,"" proving that terrorists don't do subtlety. Going back to my section on victory and persecution in Islam, Al-Aqsa being under the control of non-Muslims is considered an embarrassment; its demolition would be considered defeat. As I mentioned, Muslims can never know defeat, and therefore, they must fight until Al-Aqsa is theirs. More accurately, they must fight until all lands that were formerly Muslim are theirs, which includes the entire borders of Israel. That's why they still insist on war.

**Conclusion**

My goal here was to criticize both the Palestinian side and Islam as a religion. In no way do I intend to say that all Muslims hold the beliefs I discussed. In fact, the Palestinians are fundamentalist by fundamentalists' standards, which is one reason why even other Middle Eastern countries don't like them that much. I'm sure that most Muslims have never killed someone and that plenty of Muslims do not intend to take a life. I'm sure that there are Muslims who are fine with religious freedom and secularism. I've known a few Muslims, and I can't remember a single negative experience with one. Granted, I mostly talked about topics unrelated to religion, such as¬†*Pok√©mon.*¬†I also know that plenty of people on Reddit have only had negative experiences with Muslims. Thus, as an atheist and a supporter of secular democracy, I am obligated to criticize Islam and all other religions.

Whether it be leaders with major links with weapons manufacturing companies (or they hold massive shares in it), or to appeal to certain audiences for political reasons. Sometimes it may be for ties with oil or construction industries. Other times it may be for terrorist or narcissistic reasons (e.g., Putin).

Often, wars are fought by poor people. These soldiers are far removed from the people who send them to war. As such, there's not much concern from decision makers for those who die in the wars they promote. So if a policy was in place that a first degree relative of every decision maker who decides on their country going to war must serve on the frontlines, then this means that they truly believe the war is worth dying for it. It doesn't mean it's the right decision, but at least they truly believe it's the right thing to do.

The reasoning being that because it went mainstream, more idiotic ideas within the space began to pollute it.

Think about it. The issues that red pill men have with women is that a lot of women are too sexually active, too arrogant, too greedy, and weaponize the government and the laws that benefit them against men, ON PURPOSE. Much like toxic feminists, these men have grouped women in a box, and like they were back to being at the age of five, act like women got the cooties. They don‚Äôt trust them. They‚Äôll go as far as fleeing the country to find women to marry(nothing wrong with that). These men would also date 18 years to pretty much mold them into the woman they want to marry(and as someone with a younger sister, it‚Äôll be crash out time).

Men in that space have all these problems with women, yet they teach other men, that are vulnerable, and angry, to get their money up(not a bad thing), get their health right( not a bad thing), become more attractive, change their wardrobe, essentially level up and become a higher value man JUST TO CHEAT ON THE WOMAN THEY DID ALL THAT WORK FOR IN THE HOPES OF MEETING.

A high value man doesn‚Äôt cheat, he‚Äôs exercising options.

If he‚Äôs not high value, he‚Äôs cheating.

A woman that landed that high value man would lose that man if she was disloyal to him, if she cheated on him.
 
That doesn‚Äôt apply to these men. These men who found their way to that space knows what that pain feels like, but believe that because they achieved a sense of status, they shouldn‚Äôt have to remain loyal to a woman they chose to marry.

That isn‚Äôt high value to me, and it‚Äôs unethical, unkind, and highly lacking in morality."

I personally believe (and dare to say this) stocks of a non profitable company is nothing more than a fonzi scam where hot potatoes get passed around at an increasing value. I mean what else can it be when a company is unable to achieve healthy ways of raising its stock price via stock buyback, dividend payouts, earning surprises etc...

Last but not least, companies that fail to turn profitable and show negative trend of growth for a certain period of time needs to be delisted even before hitting the price of $1 per share to prevent any further damages to the share holders. The delisting shall be done in a fashion that minimizes the lose for the shareholders even if that means liquidating and closing a company."

2. Flat-out scrap USA/South Korea alliance, causing North Korea, China, and Russia to invade and take over South Korea in less than an hour.

The only reason I went back to school is because as a Vet, I don‚Äôt have to pay. 

What do I mean by incentivize? I mean that there is no reason why students pay for these courses and degrees, and still end up in debt, and in entry level employment.

My view is that the education system, or the job market, doesn‚Äôt reward students for putting in the effort to further their education at the promise of a high paying job in the field that they have chosen. The effort that students undertake to reach that coveted degree a lot of the time doesn‚Äôt equate to the harsh reality they see once they attain that degree.

If you graduate from college with a degree of your choice, a job should be guaranteed. Instead of rewarding mediocrity, and outright scummy tactics to get to the top, one should be rewarded for the grind it took to complete their bachelors, their masters, etc. 

By doing so, it would encourage others to see college as a viable and worthwhile effort in the pursuit of a better life."

Specifically California. Recently LA times did an article stating legal cannabis companies have been exposed for having pesticides in their weed when they claim it‚Äôs ‚Äúclean‚Äù here‚Äôs the issue, Cali is super relaxed on regulating cannabis therefore there are certain pesticides that aren‚Äôt required by law to be checked for so they‚Äôre weed comes up as ‚Äúclean‚Äù when tested from labs. The reality is you are likely smoking weed with pesticides in it that aren‚Äôt required to be checked. States like Nevada are better at this where they require ALL pesticides to be screened. Cali specifically doesn‚Äôt require this so there‚Äôs been dangerous levels of pesticides in legal cannabis. This should concern everyone.

In Vancouver BC for example, preserving view cones is crucial for maintaining the city's scenic beauty and distinctive skyline. Given that Vancouver is geographically constrained by the ocean and mountains, the available land for development is limited. So why are we trying so hard to transform the city, risking the loss of its inherent beauty, just to accommodate more people? Why can't we accept that there might be a limit to how much the city can grow?

They make ok arguments against each other but they sugar coat the issue on their own side.

 When I take the stance of Pro-Choice I realize the issue with Pro-Life people are they are forcing people to have a baby against there will and are controlling a women's body and even some pro-life people are so extreme that they condone keeping a baby of R*pe.


  I look at the issue of myself as pro- choice and I think and know that women feel pain and hurt when ""A fetus"" dies as I know full well that ""Fetus"" will become a baby and basically is one I know there's no turning back for them and it's a very traumatizing pain.


I take the stance of Pro-Life the issue with Pro-Choice is that a fetus will become a baby it will have a life etc. 

I take the stance of Pro-Life and think about Pro-Life I am forcing a women to have a baby I am controlling their body because of my own moral stand point.



  Everyone wants to attack their opposing view but never consider the truth.

 It's delusional to not act like your controlling and forcing a women to have a baby as someone who is pro life. It's also delusional to act like it's nothing more than a fetus because deep down people go through so much pain when it comes to abortion because we are human we understand even as a fetus it is a baby to many of us and even the people who have to do it.


  I'm obviously pro-choice because I know the pain is a lot but it's a choice that is needed to be made as a man I know it's not my place to control someones body."
49,2024-06-22,CMV: the vast majority of people would save a human over their pet,u/Individual-Ideal-610,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dmc7yu/cmv_the_vast_majority_of_people_would_save_a/,changemyview,"I've seen this on social media/""rebbit"" a number of times and the solid/vast majority of people say they would choose their pet, dog or cat, over another person.

People like myself who say they would save a person over their pet are most often downvoted despite any explanation-sorry I would choose someone who down voted me over my dog, youre welcome lol.

If the circumstance actually came, I don't believe very many people would choose their pet over another human.

My wife works in a vet ER, it doesn't take much money for your ""best boy ever"" life to come into question when a couple thousand dollar bill is on the line...or even a couple hundred no matter if an almost guaranteed save or a 20% chance. Not very often people pay more than 10k.

So how much is a close friend or family member worth, a human? No, don't say your terrible dad who can rot wherever. The closest friend or fsmily member you have or ever had. Would you let them die for upwards of 10-15k? Even if you had to take out a loan or something?

How about an average human? Say you're at the grocery store and see a normal looking family and suddenly the moms life is on the line, only salvation is your money. Would you let this mom die so you didn't spend 5-20k?

Lot of people start to question saving their pet after a few thousand. Few past 10k. Extremely few past 20k.

Would you save your best human friend, closest family member if it cost more than 10-20k?

Would you let a normal mom or dad of 3 kids, or a random average 17 year old die for 10-20k? And Dodd rhe situation, it's not like paying into a go fund me or something. The fate of this person is totally on you and you alone.

Let's assume, like your pet, they'll never pay you back. For their reasons, they know they got saved but will never know who it was and so simply have no way to repay you.

I just don't actually believe many people actually value their pet over another human if the situation actually played out. 

Also, close attachments to pets like in western culture is a foreign concept to the vast majority of people in developing countries. Anyone that's ever spent time or currently lives in a developing country outside of a developed major city can attest (and even then...) no matter the country or region. Doesn't necessarily mean it's right or wrong. But food for thought. "

Pre-internet, the USSR engaged in this kind of cultural warfare against the USA. The stupid and often political extreme opinions in public forums are systematic attacks to weaken western democracies.

0,2024-06-22,CMV: The Constitution of the United States is not the best Supreme Law,u/IXMCMXCII,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dmdc6s/cmv_the_constitution_of_the_united_states_is_not/,changemyview,"^(I've been working on this for a while so forgive any errors. I have done my best to ensure everything is true i.e. working links, accurate citations, etc,. At the time of posting everything was working.)

### Introduction

While the Constitution of the United States of America, enacted in 1787 and ratified in 1788, is undoubtedly a landmark document in the history of governance, it is not without its flaws. This thesis will argue against the notion that the U.S. Constitution is the best supreme law ever written. By examining its historical limitations, its rigidity in the amendment process, the challenges in its interpretation, and the existence of more contemporary and inclusive constitutions, this thesis will demonstrate the shortcomings of the U.S. Constitution as a supreme law.

### Historical Limitations

The Constitution, while revolutionary for its time, reflects the social and political norms of the late 18th century, many of which are outdated by modern standards. The original document for instance, did not address the issue of slavery directly, implicitly allowing it to continue and leading to significant conflicts that resulted in the Civil War. This failure to address fundamental human rights issues from the outset is a significant flaw in its claim to being the best supreme law ([History](https://www.history.com/topics/united-states-constitution/amendments-us-constitution), 2023).

Furthermore, the original Constitution did not grant suffrage to women, African Americans, or Native Americans, nor did it provide equal protection under the law for all citizens. These oversights necessitated later amendments and legal battles to rectify, highlighting the document's initial exclusionary nature and its alignment with the prejudices of its time ([National Constitution Center](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/amendment-xiv/clauses/702), 2023).

### Rigidity in the Amendment Process

One of the most criticised aspects of the U.S. Constitution is its rigidity in the amendment process. Article V requires a supermajority in both houses of Congress and ratification by three quarters of the state legislatures, making amendments extremely difficult to pass. This high threshold has resulted in a relatively small number of amendments over more than two centuries, many of which have been hard won through extensive political struggle ([National Archives](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution/how-did-it-happen), 2023).

This rigidity has impeded timely and necessary reforms. For example, despite widespread calls for changes in areas such as electoral reform, campaign finance, and gun control, the difficulty of amending the Constitution has often stymied significant progress. This inflexibility can result in a stagnant legal framework that struggles to keep pace with evolving societal needs and values ([Constitution Center](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/interpretation/article-v/clauses/45), 2023).

### Challenges in Interpretation

The Constitution‚Äôs brevity and vagueness on many issues have led to significant challenges in interpretation, often requiring the judiciary to fill in gaps with broad discretion. This has resulted in landmark but contentious Supreme Court decisions that have shaped American law in profound ways, such as Roe v. Wade and Citizens United v. FEC. While judicial interpretation is necessary, the broad leeway given to judges can lead to inconsistent and polarized rulings that reflect the ideological leanings of the Court rather than a clear, unified legal principle ([Supreme Court of the United States](https://www.fec.gov/resources/legal-resources/litigation/cu_sc08_opinion.pdf), 2023).

Furthermore, the reliance on judicial interpretation means that significant legal and social issues are often decided by a small group of justices rather than through democratic processes. This can undermine the principle of democratic governance and lead to public dissatisfaction with the judiciary, as seen in the contentious battles over Supreme Court nominations and decisions ([Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/07/21/favorable-views-of-supreme-court-fall-to-historic-low/), 2023).

### More Contemporary and Inclusive Constitutions

In comparison to the U.S. Constitution, many contemporary constitutions incorporate more comprehensive and explicit protections for human rights and democratic principles. For example, the Constitution of South Africa, adopted in 1996, includes extensive protections for civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights, reflecting a modern understanding of human dignity and equality ([ConstitutionNet](https://constitutionnet.org/vl/item/constitution-republic-south-africa-1996-english), 2023).

Similarly, the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz), established in 1949, provides robust protections for human rights and establishes a social market economy, combining democratic governance with social welfare principles. These modern constitutions often reflect lessons learned from historical injustices and are designed to prevent such occurrences in the future, thus offering more comprehensive frameworks for governance and justice ([Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide/nations/germany.php), 2023).

### Conclusion

While the United States Constitution is a foundational document in the history of democratic governance, it is not the best supreme law. Its historical limitations, rigidity in the amendment process, challenges in interpretation, and the existence of more contemporary and inclusive constitutions highlight its shortcomings. Acknowledging these flaws does not diminish the Constitution's significance but rather encourages ongoing efforts to improve and adapt our legal frameworks to better serve the principles of justice, equality, and democracy.

But hear me out. I‚Äôm specifically speaking of biologically conceiving, not adoption or surrogacy. For context, I‚Äôm from the US so I‚Äôm speaking from the POV of standard practices/culture in my country. I‚Äôm aware laws are different elsewhere and many cultures may differ in opinion. I‚Äôd like to preface this also by saying there are situations in which innocent people may be  negatively affected, so please limit the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù. 

1. First and foremost, those that have m√≥lested and/or unalived children should not be allowed to procreate. This should be obvious. I‚Äôd like to extend this to any violent felonies, but would be content with just crimes against children. 

2. Anyone under the age of 18. Honestly, I‚Äôd like to put the age 25 here, as it is scientifically proven than the human brain‚Äôs frontal cortex does not fully finish development until then, but majority of countries recognize 18 as legal adulthood. But seriously, minors/children should not be having kids. 

3. People that already have 4 children or more. I don‚Äôt care what your religion says or how much you truly love children. There comes a point where you cannot physically handle giving all children the amount of individualized attention they need. Even stay-at-home parents cannot perfectly split time enough. 

4. Anyone living below state poverty line. I don‚Äôt care what the reasoning is. I know not everyone can afford college or further education. But plenty of jobs can allow you to work enough to make this financial line. If you can‚Äôt make that number, that clearly indicates you struggle to care for yourself. So why would you want to force an innocent baby into that situation? 

5. Those with more than 1 DV case on file, whether it was pursued or not. 1 call can be accidental. I grew up in a violent home, so I know more than 1 is not. With multiple calls, there is a trend of (at least) minor issues there that no child should be a part of. 

6. Anyone older than 50. I know many outdated studies say issues with pregnancy can arise after age 35 for women. I don‚Äôt entirely believe that, but many medical issues arise in the 50s and it is unfair for a child to lose a parent so young. Obviously not everyone dies in their 50s, but the chance rises drastically at this age. 

7. Any non-married person who works more than 50 hours a week, OR a couple (married or not) that collectively works more than 80. I say 50 since overtime can and will happen, for a number of reasons, but if you and your partner both work full time (even 9-5‚Äôs), then work is clearly more important than a young child. Getting a nanny for a few days a week is one thing, but there comes a time where the nanny sees the kid more than you. 

8. Those that are not entirely 100% confident and excited about having children, regardless of difficulty. If 1 partner is ready and the other is scared, that‚Äôs too much coercion for me. It is better to regret not having a child than to regret having one. 

9. Deciding that any defect/condition is ‚Äútoo much to handle‚Äù should disqualify you as well. I hope this is clear enough. And I‚Äôm not talking about those genetic issues where a baby will only live for a short time before d3ath, but something like autism or Down Syndrome, or even something like dyslexia. 

10. Anyone the slightest bit racist, sexist, or homophobic. Even if it‚Äôs a religious belief.

74,2024-06-23,CMV: The Humanities are way devalued and overlooked ,u/Brassmonkey700,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dmfr4w/cmv_the_humanities_are_way_devalued_and_overlooked/,changemyview,"The value of the Humanities is completely overlooked 

I think most people will understand what I‚Äôm getting at on this one even if you don‚Äôt agree, the humanities and even parts of social sciences are not only overlooked but are often aggressively ostracised, both by administrations looking to cut them as well as people in general who perpetuate the alienation through cultural antagonism toward the fields. Pressure seems (personal anecdote) higher on men than women. Women have to deal with different pressures if they try and become ‚Äòproductive‚Äô workers through stem, but men face alienation if they choose an ‚Äòunproductive,‚Äô field. Likely a holdover of tradition and still everlasting patriarchy. 

I understand where the sentiment comes from. Scientific progress has relocated our faith away from ourselves and into the instruments which bring us seemingly closer to empirical objectivity, so we rely on the stats that these instruments provide. This also got wrapped up in industrial capitalism, where production became a capitalist concern to push material consumption, and universities/companies can‚Äôt make a buck off of mass producing your subjective insights as they would be able to from your data collection/analysis/labor materials etc.  

Obviously, there are a myriad of reasons why the humanities are devalued, more than capitalism via stem‚Äôs productive capabilities validating more funding. I genuinely think though that we have entered a time where we no longer care about narratives, we no longer care about experts analysing abstract domains of human behaviour (maybe it died with freud?). I think this is a problem, I don‚Äôt personally believe that we can fully understand ourselves, society, or reality through a purely ‚Äòhard‚Äô scientific neopositivist analysis. 

I wish the humanities/social sciences would be valued and given the time to see the products of their labor flourish as they interact with society. We are so afraid of intellectuals motivating us with their narratives and subjectivities, but we fail to worry about how so much of what academics work on today may seem innocent/unbiased but fuels crony capitalism by performing neopositivist research on an industrial capitalist foundation. Famous sociologist Arjun Appadurai talks about our need to combat the corrupt politics/economy by reopening a voice and value in the humanities and social sciences without fearing subjectivities."

0,2024-06-23,CMV: We must behave as if alien life is an existential threat to humanity.,u/ProKidney,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dmie31/cmv_we_must_behave_as_if_alien_life_is_an/,changemyview,"A few days ago there was a post on CMV about aliens and extraterrestrials being an inevitable threat to humanity- it's a position I hold but for very different reasons than that poster.

My position is based on the 'Dark Forest' concept popularised by Lui Cixin in the Three-Body Problem.

Without getting into the metaphor presenting reality as a dark forest filled with hunters, the hypothesis relies on the Drake Equation to suppose that life almost certainly exists elsewhere in the universe and likely our galaxy, and that all of that life is an existential threat to us, and each other.

But if the Drake Equation suggests that life should be abundant, and some civilisations could potentially have had millions of years to develop ahead of us... where are all the aliens? This paradox is called the Fermi Paradox, and the Dark Forest is one potential answer, and an answer that I believe, even if it is wrong, we must behave as if it is correct.

So the hypothesis supposes that life could potentially exist elsewhere- but my conclusion doesn't require that they do exist, only that they might... which is unfalsifiable... and I'm already running into trouble where someone could try and convince me to change my view.  
But the hypothesis states that the reason that space is not swarming with aliens is because all aliens have either:

1. concluded that they must hide from other alien life

2. been destroyed by other alien life when they were detected

So my position rests on two points that combine into what I think is an unavoidable conclusion.

1. Any civilisation that develops to the point of space-faring must have become the dominant species of their planet, indicating that they are likely to be expansionist and competitive- like us.

2. Planet-sterilising weapons are within reach of a relatively young space-faring civilisation. We have theories of how to develop such weapons that should be achievable within centuries for modern-day humanity. Concepts like the Nicoll-Dyson Beam are the kinds of things I'm talking about.

Conclusion: Any intelligent race, young or old, must treat any other intelligent race, young or old, as an existential threat. At that point, it's a matter of whoever shoots first wins, and the stakes are not just the intelligent species but every living species on the planet.

My opinion is that the stakes are too high and we cannot risk announcing ourselves to a potentially hostile galaxy. Humanity's only choice is to hide. Even if aliens do not exist- we cannot know for sure and must behave as if they do.

I don't want to think this way, but I cannot escape the logic. Does anyone have any pushback on these ideas?"

During the stone age before lights were invented, humans rise up from the sun and use the day to hunt animals and sleep at night due to how dark it is without lights. The night owl cave mans sacrifice their body to watch over the sleeping hunters to prevent being mauled.

The sudden flux of night owl began when the industrial age begin where lights were created when human beings can stay up a lot longer either for work or for leisure time which begin the trend of early birds and night owls.

Human have a very consistent circadian rhythm that is designed to wake up at the day and sleep at night since the dawn of cave mans. To stay up late is to compromise and push your body to an unhealthy degree.

Night owls have a tendency to have heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, lack of vitamin D, lack of fresh air for the brains, kidney problems and possibly cancer.

Another factor is that your body heals and repair at night efficiently when humans sleep but when you are awake, the body delay the healing process and disrupt the recovery time.

so Cmv on why Night Owls is a fairly good alternative to early birds when Science back heavily for early birds. I def will not accept a cmv when you are force to stay up late for night shift cause yes we have too like doctors and security guards.       "

I‚Äôm referring to the vast majority of overweight people who come up with excuse after excuse to avoid taking accountability for their weight. 

Being overweight is unhealthy and unattractive, and I have a very hard time believing that anybody feels different about that, so it confuses me that there are so many overweight people who refuse to do anything to solve the problem. 

Body positivity is great and all, if we‚Äôre talking about short people or tall people or people with stretch marks, amputated limbs, birth marks, scars, burns, or anything else that somebody can‚Äôt control. Being overweight is not something that should be celebrated. 

Losing weight, in theory, is extremely straight forward. Eat less calories than you burn. There are no hidden secrets, and the only reason that people remain overweight is because they eat too much and move too little. 

It also doesn‚Äôt have to be expensive so the excuse of not having enough money to make healthy meals doesn‚Äôt fly with me. Even if you‚Äôre eating terrible food, just eating *less* terrible food will still lead to weight loss. 

I also believe that overweight parents of overweight children are essentially abusing/neglecting their kids. The health risks, social problems, mental issues and bullying that overweight children face is a direct result of their parents actions/inactions, and parents should be held accountable. "

While I do believe dogs should have the freedom to experience beaches since it is a unique area with lots of smells, they should be on leashes the whole time. Owners seem to feel like they have a ‚Äúfree pass‚Äù to let their dogs off leashes just because beaches are wide open areas. I personally get approached by off leash dogs on beaches specifically more than any other place. I love dogs, but I know many people don‚Äôt, and the beach is no exception to let your dog approach strangers who you have no idea if they are ok with dogs or not. You don‚Äôt know what a dog is capable of until it‚Äôs too late. Yes, I know they make for a great place for dogs to run around, but there are also cool places called dog parks that allow for that, too.

Aside from people, nature is another HUGE reason to not let dogs off leashes on beaches. So many species of birds nest right along the shores and it is very important to not let dogs near their nests. While many beaches post signs to keep off dunes, people (and their dogs) frequently ignore them. Many species, like the Least Tern, are experiencing dramatic declines due to nest endangerment that can be completely avoided simply by keeping a dog on a leash. There is literally no good reason to let a pet dog disrupt nature under ANY circumstance (except for when using them to LEGALLY hunt), especially in areas where people are more likely to let them off leashes.

Overall I just think all dog owners should have their dogs leashed 100% of the time, ESPECIALLY on beaches."

But, for example, even within the LGBT community there are genuine frictions and disagreements, there are different ways to approach gender equality and women right issues, people have long discussions regarding best way to tackle housing crisis, etc. 

Therefore, in true democracy people should be voting for all issues separately. Making them choose some guy who also has a random combination of opinions on all these topics is somewhat manipulative and give more of an illusion of choice than actual choice. 

There are, of course, different ways to approach it. 

How I imagine it, either you have normal elections, but you are choosing a leader for every field rather than someone who would be in charge of all of them. Alternatively, and I think that might be even better, the system should be completely changed, and the government should literally just consist of people whose job is to operationalise common opinions and first create policies for the voters, and then implement them. People should still be voting for leaders, but the only criteria should be ""can we trust this person to actually implement the policies we vote for?"".

But what I mean here is if you think that life ceases to exist and there is nothingness but a void once you die, then you should be indifferent with dying.

One of the most common argument to life is living it to your fullest else you will be filled with regret.  Also, one of the common ways to uplift someone who has ""given up on life"" is to reiterate the ups and the joys of the life they will miss upon if they take that drastic step. However the point I'm trying to make is that once you die, there's nothing left to regret since you cease to exist. No matter how great life you think you have, once you're out, there's nothing left to miss.

Now coming to the scenario.
I'm considering about a specific scenario where you're living your life only for yourself and there's no one else who will be majorly impacted by your death. 
Consider a person who does not have someone they deeply care about and also no one is financially or emotionally dependent on them. Maybe their family passed away and their friends are cut-off. A hypothetical scenario of-course. Now one would argue that such a person can still spin their life around and maybe give it another shot at life and might one day get a chance to be very happy. But even if they were to quit today, it wouldn't really matter as they would still not miss on those things once they pass away.

I'm certainly not saying that a cup of coffee a day is going to ruin your energy, just that it is an overall net negative for your energy level in the long-term. 

Caffeine works by binding to adenosine receptors, which in turn block the binding of adenosine to its receptors. Basically, caffeine blocks a chemical that makes you sleepy from getting to the spots in your brain where it can have an effect. Your body's natural reaction to this is to create even more of that chemical that makes you sleepy in order to overcome the blocking of the adenosine receptors.

This is what causes you to build a tolerance. You have to then take in more caffeine in order to overcome your body building up a tolerance, and then your body gives you even more of that chemical that makes you sleepy, and the vicious cycle continues, with your body making you more and more sleepy, and needing more and more caffeine to overcome this.

You then may either stop increasing the dose, leading you to being more sleepy than if you never started drinking caffeine in the first place, or you keep increasing the dose until you have serious health consequences like insomnia, and your energy level with eventually take a dive anyway.

Other than separate illnesses, the reason why heavy daily users feel like shit before ingesting caffeine each day is because they've trained their body to produce so much adenosine, not because they would naturally feel that way if they never started with caffeine in the first place. Caffeine is bringing them back to their natural energy level or worse unless they keep increasing their dose, and even that will eventually fail.

My view is only that caffeine is not a net positive in the long term when it comes to your energy level, though caffeine may be a net positive overall. Factors like the experience of drinking coffee and certain health benefits of caffeine may make it worth ingesting daily for you.

There could also be situations that may make sense to temporarily take advantage of caffeine. For example, you may have to work 12 hours a day for a week, but then you will take a week long vacation where you can detox."

This makes perfect sense, because, by inv3esting into something different, a new idea, a better opportunity you will recover them and then gain some more. So, strictly when talking bout money alone, they are a fallacy and should not constitute a reason for keeping on a bad investment. In my opinion this holds true only because they can be recovered witha better investment. In the general sense though they are not necessarily a fallacy, especially whn the resource spent cannot be recovered, for example time. Time cannot be given back, so changing investment will not give you your time back in any way. Other concepts, like happiness are debatable. Happiness can be lost and be gained and while it is difficult to quantify we can have an idea of a quantification. For example leaving a toxic relationship will not give you your time back, but can give youyour happiness back so we could see that ""the happiness lost"" is fallacious reason to stick to the toxic relationship, but the time lost in pursuing it isn't inherently fallacious (it could still be unwise and sicne the time won't come back anyway it would be better to end it anyway to spend the remaining time somewhere else, but again, it isn't fallacious).

I would specify that i am not certain happiness is valid, since specific happiness types may never come back and therefore may not hold up to a more cautious scrutiny. Furthermore another thing that can't be given back is effort. When one puts effort into something they can't have it back. At maximum there could be the effort someone else puts into you (which may not even apply, if you are putting effort into making a car work, there is no direct exchange for it). So ""all the effort put into something"" would not constitute a sunk cost fallacy, just a sunk cost whose value is to be considered and pondered.

In general the point of my post is that ""sunk cost fallacy"" is not applicable to all sunk costs in the same way. But here i am, seeking others' opinion on the matter."

I am not vegan myself. I choose ""vegan"" for this argument because I am aware that the dairy and egg industry directly contribute to the meat industry and therefore consuming those products is indirect support of the meat industry.

Here is my argument:

I believe it is hypocritical to be pro-life, but also eat meat. All pro-lifers will have different reasoning behind their views, but the basic principle is that a fetus is a separate body and separate life and therefore should be protected and abortion, aka ending that life, is wrong.

However, many pro-lifers have no problem consuming meat, and therefore financially contributing to the slaughter of animals by purchasing meat. Supply and demand.

Why is it that the life of a fetus is valued and deserves protection (in their views), but an animal, which is arguably far more conscious, alive, and capable of feeling pain, is not? 

Upon asking pro-lifers this question, I am met with a muddled argument about how humans are inherently worth more just because they're human. However, I have yet to see a genuine reason for this separation. Again, an animal is fully conscious and capable of feeling pain, and a fetus is obviously not, yet the life of the latter is valued but the former is not.

Obviously all the pro-life arguments here are NOT my own view, to reiterate I am pro choice. I am using them for the sake of explaining my view.

So, change my view I guess."

I believe that a woman should have the right to choose to end a pregnancy through at least the end of the first trimester. I believe that abortions in the second trimester should only be permitted for issues such as birth defects that become apparent no earlier than that stage of pregnancy. And I believe third trimester abortions should be reserved for urgent health reasons only. 

What bothers me, however, is that so many people on the pro choice side cannot simply say that it‚Äôs a matter of choice, bodily autonomy, privacy, etc, and instead hide behind victims of rape/medical emergencies. People bring up cases in Texas where women had to travel out of state for medically necessary abortions, or the 11 year old girl in Ohio who had to travel out of state to get an abortion after being raped. 

These cases SHOULD NOT be part of the debate. I think Americans are nearly unanimous in agreeing abortions were justified in these cases. So why aren‚Äôt the laws changed to give doctors the benefit of the doubt? The answer is that the debate has become so polarized. The pro choice side insists that the remedy in these cases is restoring legal abortion. This is dishonest. Elective abortion across the board need not be restored to remedy situations like this. And refusing to even discuss the possibility of carving out exceptions within abortion bans really just makes the debate so much more polarized and reduces the chance of meaningful fix. The reason, of course, is that the pro choice movement doesn‚Äôt actually care about these particular cases, they just weaponize them. 

If you‚Äôre pro choice, be unapologetic about it like I am. If a woman does not want to be pregnant, she should not have to provide a reason why she wants an abortion. People really shouldn‚Äôt hide behind these cases to justify their broadly pro choice beliefs. And legalizing abortion across the board is not the sole remedy for cases like this. "
0,2024-06-23,CMV: The 4B Movement is not a threat to humanity because most women in it are Non Hetero.,u/Former_Range_1730,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dmuaae/cmv_the_4b_movement_is_not_a_threat_to_humanity/,changemyview,"**What the 4B Movement is:**

Long story short, a growing number of women have decided to go through life without men. No more sexual relationships, marriage, having children, etc with men, and have decided to remain celibate. This supposedly started in South Korea, now various women of other countries are joining in because they believe men are a huge problem for women and the world at large.

**What people are concerned with:**

Many people believe that this will result in the fall of humanity if more women over time join this movement.



**The reason for my thought on this:**

After speaking with a large number of 4B women, watching their videos, reading their comments and opinions, it's seems to me that most of these women are non hetero. Meaning they tend to be:

- Bisexual (in the closet) or (out of the closet) or (sexually confused but identify as hetero)

- Pansexual

- Heteroflexible

- Queer

- Lesbian but identifies as bisexual due to not being 100% sure

It seems to me that out of all the sexualities, Hetero women desire and enjoy men the most, and non hetero women are into men the least. Meaning, the more non hetero a woman is, the less she is into men, and the more she dislikes and/or has hatred of men.

  
**Percentage of non hetero women:**

From all the studies I've seen, at least 40% of women are non hetero. Recent studies show that 30% of Gen Z identify as Non Hetero, the largest portion being bisexual women. And the numbers grow with each generation, and this is not counting those who are in the closet or confused.

Most of these women have always had a low enthusiasm to men, and these women tend to be the kind that men aren't usually enthusiastically into. 

**Compatibility:**

So really, men need to stick with dating and interacting romantically with hetero women, and the few bisexual women who are more into men, and avoid the majority of non hetero women. And non hetero women need to focus on women, as hetero men and non hetero women are largely incompatible. 

If you disagree, please attempt change my mind. 

**It just seems that people are pushing the idea that almost all 4B women are hetero, but that's not what I'm seeing.** And if they are largely Hetero, it seems strange that even some bisexual women who enjoy women, choose men over women, and have great times with men. So it's strange to me that a hetero woman can't find a great guy when even some bisexual women can. And Bisexual women have more reason to not like men than straight women, given they can just choose women.

135,2024-06-23,CMV: Higher corporate taxes would benefit the middle and lower classes much more than it would harm the upper class.,u/Seyon,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dmufok/cmv_higher_corporate_taxes_would_benefit_the/,changemyview,"*Disclaimer: I am not an economist, nor have I studied economics besides a few classes during university.*

A thought process I've had in my mind for a while now is this: Reducing the corporate tax rate only enriches the upper class. It has no meaningful effect on a corporations ability to grow or expand, and in fact, may hinder a corporations growth.

A long time argument has been made that lower taxes can create jobs. This refrain is common amongst the republican party and even some democrats. However, working through how a companies revenue, expenses, and profit and how each bucket pays out, this seems untrue.

Revenue is a catch-all term here for the ways a business generates a positive cash flow. 

* Sales, including physical products or services.

* By selling shares to investors.

* Licensing and Royalties (We will include patents here.)

* Advertisements and Sponsorships

* Subscriptions

* Commissions

* Grants and Public Funding

Expenses is a catch-all term for the ways a business spends it's cash flow.

* Cost to Produce (Blanket coverage for the raw materials, machinery, labor, etc...)

* Operating Expenses

    * Salaries and Wages (Including Pensions)
    * Rent (Including utilities)
    * Marketing and Advertising
    * Professional Services
    * Depreciation and Amortization
    * Legal Expenses

* Debt Repayment (Including Interest)

* Research and Development (R&D)

* Taxes associated with expenses

* Charitable Contributions

The Profits a company generates is what is left after all the expenses are subtracted from all the revenue, or simply put:

**‚àëRevenue - ‚àëExpenses = Profit**

The profit is what is taxed from the general corporate tax rate. So what does a company lose out on when there is a higher corporate tax rate?

* Shareholder Returns:

    * Dividends
    * Stock Buybacks

* Reserves and Contingencies:

    * Cash Reserves
    * Contingency Funds

---

Now onto the meat of the matter. We are currently seeing an aggressive stock market climb. The NASDAQ is up 25% from last year to today. S&P500 is up 20% from last year to today.

This is significant because all internal Return on Investment (ROI) calculations need to beat this growth.  How does the tax rate play into this though?

Assuming that these stock investments happen after the corporate tax rate is applied to the profits. (We are not looking at Strategic Acquisitions at this time.) Then a higher corporate tax rate requires a higher return on investment to be considered.

Here is an example:

Company A has a plan to open 5 new branches in 5 cities. They expect a return on investment of around 8%. The cost to invest is $10M and after 1 year they will see a return of $10.8M.

However, there is another option. They allow that 10M to be taxed at 20% and instead invest 8M into the stock market. After 1 year they see a return of 9.6M, while this is a lower investment, it has a much safer Cost Risk Analysis (CRA). There is much less likelihood of unexpected issues or cost overruns.

So the company decides to invest in the stock market instead.

However, if the tax rate was 35%, the math changes a bit:

10M is taxed at 35% and they can only invest 6.5M into the stock market. They see a return of 7.8M now.

Suddenly the Cost Risk Analysis favors investing in expansion a bit more than before. Is it enough to tip the scales? Not always, but it's one example. There is a reason why most cost risk analysis tends towards Stock Market investments right now over expansion.

Knowing that shareholder obligation means corporations are doing more stock buybacks now further unbalances the Cost Risk Analysis in favor of stock market investment. The entire process is cyclical and is beginning to snowball out of control. The one thing keeping it all in check is taxes. Taxes are anti-inflation, the money goes back to the dealer and out of the economy. For all intents and purposes, you may as well consider all US government expenditures to be newly printed money and all US government taxes to be destroyed currency. The US government doesn't need to have the money to spend it, it prints what it needs.

---

So how does this harm the middle and lower income classes? Simply put, they have a lot less investment in the stock market. Most of their cash comes from their jobs. The middle class may be investing into their 401Ks for retirement, but even that can be somewhat construed as a stock market inflation tactic (an outdated one compared to today though.)

When corporations are trying their hardest to maximize profits, they do it in the simplest manners first: 

* Increases the prices of goods and services they offer.

    * Currently we see this quite a lot.  Aptly named ***Greedflation*** by some.

* Decrease their operating expenses.

    * Stagnant wages against a burgeoning economy.

    * Layoffs

    * Exploitative work culture

Salaries and wages constitute the primary income source for many in the lower and middle classes. They are also a significant area where corporations seek cost savings by attempting to achieve more with fewer employees. Consumers often face pressures from both sides, as they are asked to spend more while their incomes remain stagnant.

---

How can a higher corporate income tax help then?

By putting more pressure on corporations to spend their revenue as expenses, we incentivize:

* Expansion
* Better Wages and Salaries
* Research and Development
* Consumer Goodwill
* Charitable Contributions

There is less reason to price gouge consumers if they are forced to spend that money in other areas. If they continue to, then the excessive taxes the government brings in can be used to subsidize consumers.

I do encourage debate on this matter. The one thing I would like most clarification about is whether an expense is pre-tax or post-tax when we discuss it. Anything pre-tax should not be considered in my opinion as it is a cost that a company incurs regardless of a higher corporate tax rate.

Also, I am not advocating for an 80% or higher tax rate. I simply aim to balance the scales of Cost Risk Analysis decisions."

Some people say ""you can't disprove the existence of god"" As I say ""you can't prove it either"" I bring up fiction and question how it's different. I really don't understand why people think lack of evidence for or agaisnt it will change my perspective. The exact same can be said about a story that's made up on the spot.

When some Christians act like I don't respect their belief I question if they respect the belief in what they call ""false gods"" Often I, as a non-believer have felt disrespected long before I debate anything and all I do initially is convey my belief as much as the the other person does. Sometimes it's tempting to think ""why should show respect for people that show me and others disrespect?"" Though I acknowledge that's just vengeful and unhealthy

I acknowledge emotional reasons. Such as being afraid of death or hoping there's something ""more"" At play which we don't know about and assuming what that is. Though it doesn't help me and there are people that think the belief in god would benefit me when I don't. There are people that think they can convert others, subtly and over time.

I can hold my beliefs without acting like I know mine would benefit others or trying to convert others to mine. Yet some think they're justified in doing that with me or others. Aren't those people a little selfish?"

We should be trying to improve life for the people who are already here, and to minimize our negative ecological effects. 

Right now, there is so much human life, in fact, that our society gives it no value; it allows children born in Africa‚Äîwho might have the talents of Shakespeare or Einstein, but we'll never know‚Äîto die of preventable diseases because, contrary to this ruling-class gaslighting narrative of a ""labor shortage"", there is a global labor *overage*, which is why conditions for ordinary people are so atrocious. If we weren't grossly overpopulated, capital would have so little power, relative to labor, that we wouldn't even need a ""revolution"" against capitalism, because jobs would be competing for workers rather than the reverse.

At the same time, we exist under an economic system and at a primitive-enough technological level (still reliant on fossil fuels, for example) that we damage the planet irreparably for every year we exist in this state. If the birthrate drops precipitously and the population declines, we slow down capitalism's damage, giving us a chance of still having some semblance of a livable planet when we move beyond it.

The fertility collapse of educated people is one of workers using the one vote they have to speak out on the system, the prospects it has given then, and the opportunities their children would have if they existed. This movement toward voluntary childlessness isn't some epidemic of antisocial behavior; it is an outbreak of rationality and compassion. If we keep populating, we persist in a state of congestion wherein human life is assigned such a low value, our societies become terrible places to live. If we stop, on the other hand, we give the species a fighting chance. Voluntary depopulation might also be the only nonviolent way to overthrow capitalism and set us up to create something better when it finally collapses.

Don't get me wrong. Some of the reasons why birthrates are dropping are horrendous. Korean work culture and European stagnation and American inopportunity are not good things. Social isolation and involuntary celibacy (which, I suspect, afflicts many women as much as men) are signs of severe rot in our culture, and we should try to fix those problems. Not all contributors to the declining birthrates are good; some of these are serious issues that deserve address. Still, the fact itself of a negative net birth rate is something that all of us should be celebrating."

Most of the letters aren't spelled phonetically like how they are pronounced. That's why countries like Cuba or North Korea have pretty much 100% literacy rate while Americas only left with a literacy rate of 79%. Our spelling and writing are remnants of a forgone time when England was under Norman control so that's why our words are spelled weird due to French words preserving their original spelling and despite the pronunciation changing. 

This issue was well known ever since the U.S. was established since Benjamin Franklin proposed a phonetic alphabet for English and it was pointed out how the Cherokee tribe used a syllabary with 80 letters that was easier to learn while English speakers took at least 2 years to learn how to read and write English well. That's why Noah Webster created his dictionary since our spelling was in need of a reform but it only went half way as most English words still aren't spelled the way they sound. That's why we have spelling bees and words like ghoti which is a creative way to respell fish.

English needs a spelling reform badly in order to make up for its shortcomings. A spelling reform would decrease the money, time and resources needed to teach children how to read and write English and make English more accessible to foreigners wishing to learn fluent English and assimilate.

Now let's start by making clear that I am speaking generally, so this is about *most* men compared to *most* women. I'm sure there are many men who cry as frequently or more often than most women. But they are a minority of men. 

Let's also make clear that *of course men are often under social pressures not to cry when they feel like they want to.* Yes this certainly is a thing. You don't need to tell me that this happens. I am a guy, I get it. So my viewpoint is inclusive of the fact that there are times when men do want to cry and would were it not for the social expectation that they don't, so they make an effort not to. 

Nevertheless, I believe that the main reasons - the most frequent reason, the most common reason - that men don't cry in situations that women don't is that they just don't get that welling-up feeling to the same extent, and the desire to let go with tears.

When we're little kids most of us cry a lot, and as we get older we grow out of it. I probably felt the need to cry with some normal frequency throughout my teenage years, but once I turned 22, 23 or so I noticed I just wasn't feeling that reaction as often as I would with similar situations in the past. It seems like this process goes further with men than women. That doesn't mean men are more ""mature"" or have things more ""under control"", it just means that in general their responses to such situations begins to merit a different type of outward response, on average."

Many of these studies show that some people can have experiences they deem to be spiritual, that does not make it an accurate depiction of reality, however. An accurate depiction of reality is the measurable consistencies between many subjective experiences, which psychedelic experiences do not allow in terms of anything demonstrably spiritual.¬†

If psychedelics do happen to allow some people to access a spiritual reality there is no good reason to believe that is the case. This is because of the overwhelming lack of measurable, repeatable, and verifiable evidence supporting any claims of spiritual phenomena, making it unreasonable for a rational person to conclude that anything spiritual exists. The theory with the most substantial evidence should be regarded as true. When it comes to psychedelics, chemical interactions most sufficiently explain spiritual experiences and should be deemed the most accurate explanation until proven otherwise."

It's simply and I love it's Tetris coloring and blockyness. However, in general Rainbow Roads suck as a track. They all look great, and are inherently esthetically pleasing, but they are also infamous as being the more difficult and frustrating tracks to play. And why wouldn't they be? There typically isn't guard railing of any kind, the roads are slicker, falling off is easier, and maybe it's just me, but Mushrooms are more common on Rainbow Road compared to other tracks. Rarely does another track give me 2-3 Golden Mushrooms in one race if above 7th place.

Not to mention that while visually iconography, I rarely see a player declare any of Rainbow Road's variations as their top tracks.

I used to believe socialism was the effect solution but recently I‚Äôve started leaning towards capitalism. Socialism implies the idea of spreading wealth through society equally. Socialism sounds like the perfect solution until you start to dig a bit deeper. Socialism decreases the drive to want to work hard to achieve high paying roles. Many fields such as medicine, law, and business would likely collapse due to decreased motivation to actually accumulate wealth. 

The main argument against capitalism is that all the money accumulates within the rich and upper classes while the poor are left with nothing. However, now with capitalism the world is becoming a better place, less people are living in poverty. I agree that it is happening slower than it should but it is getting better. The money accumulated by the rich is trickling down to the poor, for example growing pressure on billionaires to do more philanthropy have been seen which allows for the poorer classes to live better. With socialism instead of all the wealth being passed down from the wealthy to the poorer classes all the money is spread equally essentially giving everyone close to the same amount of money. This sounds good in theory but spreading money equally will lead to a decline in total money due to decreasing motivation while capitalism allows for an increase in money from the billionaires which provides an increasing improvement rate for the development of poorer regions through philanthropy. What I‚Äôm trying to say is I feel like socialism is good in theory but in practice capitalism is a much more sustainable and long term solution to poverty. Sorry if this doesn‚Äôt make sense lol.

0,2024-06-23,CMV: Banning members of congress from buying stocks is unnecessary,u/villa1919,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dn30cg/cmv_banning_members_of_congress_from_buying/,changemyview,"There is a lot of talk in the US about banning members of Congress and their family members from trading individual stocks, primarily based on the view that they have an unfair advantage. I disagree with this for a few reasons.

Firstly, much of the information they have access to isn't really inside information. One example of controversial trading was the sale of stocks following a COVID briefing in January 2020. This wasn't truly inside information, as other investors also had the ability to consult with epidemiologists about the threat of a pandemic. Many investors have access to experts on various topics, and sometimes the experts can be incorrect, or the investors might fail to heed their advice.

The more problematic trades are those where a member of Congress knows, for example, that the military is planning a large purchase of Boeing fighter jets and decides to buy the stock. While this is indeed an issue, it can be addressed by requiring members of Congress and their families to disclose trades a week in advance of their execution.

For instance, if Congressman X on the defense committee files to buy $500,000 of Boeing stock, investors will monitor these filings. Once they see a member of that committee showing interest in the stock, they will also buy, pushing the stock up before the member's trade executes. This will negate much of the advantage the congressman had. It can be argued that there is still a slight advantage because the congressman knows 'for sure' the planes will be bought, whereas the market might only price an 80% chance of a large order. However, this is offset by the fact that stocks can often overreact to good news, so members of Congress will likely be more cautious about making investments with a perceived conflict of interest. The stock could spike by the time the trade is executed, forcing them to buy at an inflated valuation. As a result this rule would wipe out many suspicious trades and any remaining ones would become way less profitable. This is a better solution than full bans which excessively punish the family members of congress members which could reduce the quality of the people who run for office. "

 Right now we‚Äôre experiencing climate change, humanitarian crises, income inequality, social inequality, genocide, warfare, animal extinction, and so much more. If/ When AI become smarter than humans it‚Äôs not unreasonable to think they could reconstruct government and society in a way FAR better the our current society.

I know: illegal migration is bad for countries and it should be stopped or limited. A country without a border is not a country. 

But hear me out. Illegal migratiom in America is different from illegal migration in Europe. Illegal migrants in Europe are mostly muslims: people come illegally from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, North Afrika, Iran and so on. Those are the illegal migrants of Europe. And guess what? they come only to enjoy our generous welfare state at cost of taxpayer, and not to enjoy freedom. For example, according to polls, most muslims still want sharia laws to apply in the country they immigrated. Most of the crimes are committed by them and they are generally unemployed because they dont want to learn the language. 

Illegal migration in the USA is different. Most of the immigrants come from South America (yes they seek new opportunities, but they will work and integrate). South Americans are more religious then Americans themselves, plus they are Christians so there wont be any religious conflicts like in Europe (where you can get killed for drawing Mohamed). If you look at the history, latin america was colonized by Spain and Portugal, so the immigrants that come have likely European origins, they are just browner. It is not true that they will vote for the Democrats: there are many people who flee from comunist countries like Cuba and Venezuela; those people will likely be more conservative. Those immigrants will get State benefits at the beginning, if they get something. Once citizens they will be live like an American, either you work hard or you will be homeless.

In Europe immigrants get a special treatment. They get free apartment, free healthcare, free education, free food, and still not need to work. They will eventually have 3-5 children that the taxpayers have to mantain."

She claimed this cat was her baby and how it was the sweetest cat and everyone loved the cat. 

The cat liked me and was sweet, but was a terrible pet. The cat ripped up all my curtains, constantly peed all over the floor, left the entire house smelling like cat piss and covered in cat hair, knocked over 2 of my $500 LEGO sets, broke a lamp. Every night he would hop on my nightstand and kick over my metal water bottle on the floor to the point i had to get a cooler to put on the floor and then he would sit on top of that instead. We had to rehome the cat to her mom‚Äôs place because she wasn‚Äôt taking care of the cat and I was doing all the work and he was tormenting me.

I fed him always on time! Made sure he had plenty of food, toys, water, space! But it wasn‚Äôt enough! He just wanted to terrorize me, and wasn‚Äôt appreciative of anything I did for him! He thought he could just be sweet after everything and that would make up for it. No matter what I did, it was like he was trying to show me that I was never in control of him and he was trying to show ownership over me. 

Cats just feel like pets for lazy people who don‚Äôt want to or can‚Äôt handle taking care of a dog. They‚Äôre rude, disobedient, and they try to make up for everything bad they do by trying to be sweet and cuddle with you. They are too wild to be house pets and are only semi-domesticated but everyone loves to keep them indoors and let them ruin all their stuff.

Please change my view because I love all animals but I‚Äôm starting to really dislike cats after this experience. "

0,2024-06-24,CMV: Free Will Does Not Exist,u/MagicPsyche,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dnbt10/cmv_free_will_does_not_exist/,changemyview,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9588931/ 

Training to be a clinical psychologist, did a minor in neuroscience in my undergrad. I used to believe we have agency over our actions, and I've always had a temperament of reflecting on my own contributions to a situation; thinking about how I may have worsened/bettered a situation even when I had minimal/no contribution because I was always irked when people bent over backwards to avoid taking responsibility.

However, the more I researched (particularly the article I linked above, Robert Sapolsky, Cosmicskeptic, Sabine Hoffstedder etc.) the more I've come to believe free will is an evolutionary illusion.

It makes sense to believe we are consequential beings that can control our surroundings, others, and our situation, as believing we are inconsequential and lacking any control leaves us thinking there is no point etc. There is no evolutionary advantage for an organism to think this way (at least none I can think of). Most scientists and academics seem to agree that the more we discover about the human brain, the more we realize there isn't room for a free will. 

I'll summarize the paper as best I can but I will definitely not be able to cover all the important parts so I highly recommend flicking through it yourself before replying.

Basically, inhibition is a function of the brain to prevent prepotent impulses from occurring. Our brains passively generate millions of impulses at a time, and the inhibitory function is the energy consumptive part - filtering out millions of unnecessary/disadvantageous/unoptimal impulses and selecting the optimal ones. This selection process occurs via Bayesian-like statistical computations that are fine tuned over a lifetime via conditioning, genes/epigenetics, environment, observational learning, and other factors. 

Humans have evolved complex inhibitory feedback loops, namely sensorimotor loops, executive/cognitive loops, and limbic/emotional loops that overlap and work in tandem to filter through impulses and generate complex behaviours, thoughts, and emotions. Most, if not all psychiatric conditions display elements of inhibitory dysfunction, ADHD being one that most would understand. 

Now it makes sense that with our complex brains essentially being supercomputers that they do the work of filtering through millions of options, rather than us actively 'choosing' which one makes the most sense to us. When we carry out our lives day to day, we are usually just going through the motions - when we have conversation, the words usually just come to us, we aren't carefully crafting the sentence we are about to say. 

There is a shift in the literature to discuss inhibition as distinguished between 'voluntary' and 'involuntary' - such as the difference between a knee-jerk reaction vs. making ourselves touch something hot and ignoring the pain and inhibiting our impulse to jerk away from it. But there are caveats to this too, where over time practicing voluntary inhibition can lead to it becoming involuntary e.g. opening a door the first few times takes some conscious thought when we are young, but over time this overlaps into involuntary and we open doors without even having to think about it (hence why the different loops overlap and work in tandem).

I also feel as if it's difficult for society to take on this view because civilization may collapse into nihilism if everyone felt they had no control over their actions (maybe exaggeration idk). But judicial and religious systems are founded upon principles of free will, and these systems are essentially the basis in which society formed, so to denounce free will is somewhat paramount to denouncing judicial systems, religion, and societal principles as a whole.

Are humans some special species that has managed to evolve a free will along with our unique intellect and capacity for reason? Or are we no better than the other creatures of the Earth that seem to behave based on sensory inputs, reacting to the oncoming world and building up optimal responses through repeated trial and error and conditioning themselves to find responses that will lead to the most rewarding outcomes? 

If we really could choose, wouldn't we all just choose to be the best, kindest, most well rounded people? 

I've heard the argument that in ordinary day to day situations we act on autopilot, but in out of the ordinary situations we may use free will, but even then there are associative network models and heuristics that can explain how our responses are based on using mental shortcuts to relate novel situations to the nearest thing we have experienced/seen before. 

I've also seen that the lack of free will explains why a sentient AI that takes over the world is a near impossible scenario, because AI are reflections of neuroscientific understandings of the human brain - the computations/models we discover in neuroscience are usually what we use to create AI.

Anyway this post is getting plenty long and complex enough and I'm generally just rambling now so fire away. I would prefer scientific explanations but philosophical ones are also welcome."
0,2024-06-24,CMV: octopuses are overrated and in fact they are similar to so many other animals,u/TubularBrainRevolt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dnbyxw/cmv_octopuses_are_overrated_and_in_fact_they_are/,changemyview,"Octopuses, and other cephalopods sometimes, are a big sensation in contemporary western culture, and even more on the Internet and especially on Reddit. They are a case of something being famous for being famous. People treat them more like fantasy characters, aliens or maybe a better version of ourselves, and not as true animals that have evolved to specific ecosystems, participate in food webs and so on. Of course, octopuses have unique characteristics, but so does every animal group. All animals have unique characteristics, as well as commonalities with everything else.

Where should I start? Intelligence? Octopuses are quite intelligent for invertebrates, but this doesn‚Äôt mean anything because there is no major competition there anyway. Still, many arthropods are surprisingly intelligent, including honeybees, ants, cockroaches, some spiders and so on. They aren‚Äôt alone in invertebrates. Also vertebrates don‚Äôt mean only birds and mammals, as people conceptualize them. Fish, sharks and reptiles have at least some species with surprising shows of intelligence, similar to average bird and mammal. Tool use? If they have it, it is quite limited and similar to what spiders can do with incorporating items into their web or rearranging items to hide better. Spiders also have multiple limbs to manipulate things, so this isn‚Äôt a coincidence. Why nobody is impressed by them though? Nimicry and color change? They may have the most advanced color chains of any animal, but still, it is comparable to other animals. A few fish also have some species with quite advanced colour change. For some reason, it is not as prevalent on land, but some reptiles including chameleons can have surprisingly elaborate color displays. They impress nobody though. Ability to escape from tanks? Snakes are also good escape artist, yet a snake escaping would be material for a horror movie, not a show of genius, even if the snake is harmless. Also octopuses are considered unique for their ability to move on land, yet crabs, eels and so many aquatic animals have adaptations for the same thing. Ability to taste with their arms? Spiders can taste with their feet and many insects as well. Some fish like catfish can taste with their whole bodies. Not all animals are dogs, livestock or monkeys and anatomy is widely different, especially in the various invertebrates. Parental care and short lifespan? The silliest stuff is when people claim that if octopuses lived longer, they would take over the world. Animals evolved however they wouevolved. Evolution doesn‚Äôt mean that something necessarily becomes similar to a human. Also, a few social speces do exist, but no tendency to take over the world yet. The notion of taking over the world doesn‚Äôt even exist in all human cultures. Also, plenty of spiders, centipedes and some other animals do care for their young and die after the young are independent, yet nobody cries for them.

All this new mythology about the octopus does a disservice to it, because it doesn‚Äôt describe it as a normal animal. It would be much more fascinating if it was examined as the real thing. I don‚Äôt know how this started. Octopuses have participated in many science-fiction works, so people may have had an need to make sci-fi come to life. But I don‚Äôt know. My growing suspicion is that there is an agenda behind it. For example, to downgrade other animals such as fish, reptiles, sharks or spiders or to start a new culture war against cultures that eat octopus."

>No player shall intentionally discolor or damage the ball by rubbing it with soil, rosin, paraffin, licorice, sand-paper, emery- paper or other foreign substance.

>PENALTY: The umpire shall demand the ball and remove the offender from the game. In addition, the offender shall be suspended automatically for 10 games. For rules in regard to a pitcher defacing the ball, see Rules 6.02(c)(2) through (6)

Rule 6.02(c)(2) through (6)

>The pitcher shall not:

>(2) expectorate on the ball, either hand or his glove;
>(3) rub the ball on his glove, person or clothing;
>(4) apply a foreign substance of any kind to the ball;
>(5) deface the ball in any manner; or
>(6) deliver a ball altered in a manner prescribed by Rule 6.02(c)(2) through (5) or what is called the ‚Äúshine‚Äù ball, ‚Äúspit‚Äù ball, ‚Äúmud‚Äù ball or ‚Äúemery‚Äù ball. The pitcher is allowed to rub the ball between his bare hands.

Rule 6.02(c)(7) states:

>(7)‚ÄÇHave on his person, or in his possession, any foreign substance.

The issue I have is that pitchers are allowed to use rosin to enhance grip. Rosin is provided by the MLB as per rule 4.02(f). 

Rosin when combined with sweat and sunscreen can become incredibly sticky. There are not tests or protocols in place to determine if a pitcher was using a foreign substance or if it was a combination of legal substances besides: ""it feels too sticky"". It's entirely up to an umpire's subjective opinion. No samples are taken and no quantitative tests, like using a force meter, are performed. 

The consequence for getting it wrong are a 10 game suspension and the suspended player's team is not allowed to replace them on that roster. 

With the stakes that high it is incredibly important that umpires get the call right. Yet players and fans can have no confidence that the will because the MLB allows for certain grip enhancing products (resin) but not others and are unable to distinguish between the two on the field. 

The changes I am proposing are as follows. 

When a pitcher is checked for a foreign substance and something is found a sample is to be taken for lab analysis to determine if the foreign substance is indeed actually foreign and not some combination of legal substances that are sticky. If the lab analysis comes back and substances other than legal are found only then can a player be suspended and the team penalized.

When an umpire suspects that a pitcher has a foreign substance or too much rosin on their hands the pitcher should be allowed to wash their hands and scrape off the offending substance to get into compliance. The benefit of the doubt should be given to the player because MLB allows for rosin to be used to enhance grip.

When making a determination if a foreign substance was in fact foreign and not just some combination legal substances pitch data like spin rate should be used. Pitchers use grip enhancing substances to improve their control of the ball and to increase spin rate. If the spin rate of a pitcher jumps unexpectedly in an inning or a game compared to their historical data that is strong evidence a foreign substance was being used. 

OR

Ban any grip enhancing substances entirely. Uses the system in the NPB. Balls in Japan come already coated in a tacky substance to enhance grip. No need for rosin bags and all of these subjective tests."

Even if that‚Äôs true, and I‚Äôm not saying it is, but if it is then we still have the ‚Äúcoded‚Äù emotions, so we might as well at least find some things that make us happy, right?

Even if nothing matters objectively, plenty of things matter subjectively, and no amount of free will can change that, even if it‚Äôs some line of code in my lack of free will that‚Äôs causing me to see it that way.

So I say it doesn‚Äôt matter if we have it or not. Even if the choice is an illusion, it‚Äôs an illusion we‚Äôre all in, and we can still actively make the choices that lead to us having the best possible life we can.

If being 30% of Warsaw didn‚Äôt ‚Äúsave‚Äù them, where is the guarantee that being 25% of Brooklyn, 10% of Miami, or 6% of Los Angeles will? 

I imagine one of the counter comments here will be, *‚Äúthe Holocaust was a systemic effort, and individually carried out hate crimes in NYC are not systemic.‚Äù* Here‚Äôs my response to that: 

- Yes, it was systemic, but where did it start? It started in the classrooms on college campuses(sound familiar?), then it moved onto general prejudices among the community about how the Jews owned and ruined everything in Germany(Also familiar), then it became systemic with laws being passed, then Jewish businesses started getting vandalized and destroyed, and so on. You get the point. 

- Also worth mentioning: Per FBI statistics, [Jews are the #1 most targeted religious group in the US.](https://www.justice.gov/crs/highlights/2022-hate-crime-statistics) In 2022, there were 2042 reported incidents, and 1122 of those were anti-Jewish. 2023 statistics will come out later this year. 

In conclusion, given historical context, population means nothing. Jews are not truly safe in the US no matter how ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù an American city is, and the current rise in antisemitism is a very real and serious concern.

I thought about mainly 3 reasons why revenge could be useful:

- Taking back what was stolen (or something of the same value in case it's not possible).  
- It servers a deterrent purpose. In other words, discourages further harm. Of course depends on how the message is received, could also incentivize further harm.  
- Equal chances by inflicting the same kind of harm. Think about of ""**An eye for an eye**"". Let's say someone stab you in the eye and that you forgive him, you don't even seek any kind of legal compensation because you don't have the money to pay the lawyers.  
Now you both compete for a job that requires eyesight, you have obviously less chances than him. Causing him the same kind of harm would kinda balance the scales since you would have the same chances of getting that job.

What do you think?"

However, you need to have a reference point so you can evaluate where you are. After all, how are you supposed to better yourself if you don't know what ""better"" looks like. Now, I do understand that this could easily be taken too far, but I don't see the harm in doing this- of course, as long as your doing it in a constrictive manner. Looking up to someone and trying to be more like them is how you grow as a person, and you'll never know where you stand unless you can evaluate yourself and find out what you're good at, and what your not. And once again, I can see cases where using someone else as a reference point may not be the best course of action. One example may be if you are in a drastically different situation to another person, or you are severely disadvantaged at a certain skill or ability. But even in those cases, you still need to know what you're aiming for."

The lack of collaboration between nations and the unrealistic targets given our current level of scientific knowledge means it is not possible to revert or halt climate change. The best we can do now is delay its impacts. But even that will only buys us a bit more time.

Despite decades of warnings and agreements such as the Paris Accord we still see minimal actions. Most nations prioritise their economic and political interests over meeting their targets. Also, the science required to reverse or significantly curb climate change while maintaining our standards of living are just not ready yet. 

Instead of fixating onto the illusion that we can prevent climate change we should shift our focus on the infrastructure and how the next generation will have to live. We need to make infrastructure and societies in general more resilient to the inevitable impact of climate change e.g. we should build dams where we anticipate increased rainfall and prevent the further expansion of cities into areas that will not be able to sustain agriculture. We also need to invest in training our disaster response forces. 

I am not arguing the need to stop with our effort in prevention. But I believe we need to ditch the narrative that we can revert or even halt climate change as this is making us lose precious time and it is snoozing the alarm that humanity (societies and governments) need to hear of the things to come. Only by accepting the reality we can prepare. "

As a person who suffers from OCD, I can't help but loath for others that suffer from the same illness I have when this is how OCD is seen and how it's overly downplayed. You don't people say ""Oh I forgot, I'm so Alzheimer's"" or consider schizophrenia as a quirky aesthetic (I know there are those weirdos who use mental illness as a quirk but that's not the point).

The point is that OCD is underestimated by anyone, even psychiatrist in some cases. There are OCD sufferers that literally have every joy they have sucked out of them because of this illness, experience guilt of what they did or will do even if it's mostly harmless, waste their time doing useless things in hopes of avoiding doom even though they know damn well that it's nonesensical to believe in such.it's so bad the people even resort to ending it all because of it. 

So saying that OCD is about being quirky or just wanting to clean everyday is foolish at best and utterly insulting at worse."
0,2024-06-24,CMV: If Obama could win re-election in 2012 with 7% unemployment then a Biden loss in November can and should be largely attributed his age,u/nowlan101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dnuur4/cmv_if_obama_could_win_reelection_in_2012_with_7/,changemyview,"On November 8th, 2012 Americans voted for president when [the national unemployment rate was 7.7%](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2012/ted_20121231.htm#:~:text=In%20November%202012%2C%20twenty%2Dfive,from%20that%20of%20the%20nation) just .03 percent away from a solid 8. 

A rate no presidential incumbent has survived. Below 8? It was possible to win, but even then it was a hard sell. Nonetheless Obama won but I remember  frantically checking the unemployment rate during the lead up to the election because I read somewhere in a political column that anything above 8% was a campaign ender.

in retrospect as a very liberal teenager, who was worried that Romney would be the next apocalypse it was a silly exercise in stress. because no American, at least not the ones that mattered in the election and in most elections, was checking the unemployment rate and then thinking to themselves ‚Äúis this an acceptable rate for my totallyunbiased and objective in the upcoming election for president?‚Äù

They supported him because they had a connection with him. Obama, even though he was sometimes stereotyped is being too cool for school, was a figure people from Ohio to New York to California, were willing to rally behind even with an unemployment rate approaching 8%. I don‚Äôt think it was any more complicated than that.

Which leads me to why I am so pessimistic right now about Joe Biden‚Äòs chances in November. Many on the left, myself included, took a gamble last year. The gamble was, in spite of his age, that people would rally behind Joe Biden once they took stock of the great economy, realized Donald Trump would be on the ballot and Biden‚Äôs team started spending their enormous war chest ads. 

As it stands it today it looks as though the Left got both that and the salience of inflation desperately wrong. No matter how much well meaning, progressive, center, or conservative anti-Trump strategists yell, people aren‚Äôt checking the annual inflation rates to see and appreciate how they‚Äôve dropped by .06 percentage points.  What they are checking is their memories and their memories tell them in 2019 a big Mac was way cheaper than the price they paid today on the way into work.

And we shouldn‚Äôt downplay this, the price jumps we‚Äôve seen in the last three years is unprecedented for anybody that wasn‚Äôt alive during the inflation crisis of the 70s. But as bad as it is, it‚Äôs not insurmountable. Especially with an economy humming along this well. The problem is Biden. 

He‚Äôs not Ronald Reagan projecting a grandfatherly warmth, he‚Äôs a desiccated corpse from the neolithic age they stuffed into a suit and put behind a podium. And maybe during early, *early* 2021 he had a chance to keep the public on his side but nobody really liked him then and the minute the emperor had no clothes, when Afghanistans messy withdrawal, inflation and covid delta surge happened one on top of the other, he‚Äôs never recovered.

0,2024-06-24,CMV: Eco-terrorism is morally just.,u/Vlamingg,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dnuwkc/cmv_ecoterrorism_is_morally_just/,changemyview,"X. Preamble

Climate Change itself needs pretty much no explanation. The destruction caused by it (such as the physical destruction of 5 entire nations, the flooding of low lying regions across the globe that are home to tens of millions which disproportionately live in poor nations, a large rise in global temperatures that have caused widespread injuries to both humans and animals in temperate countries such as Mexico and Thailand, among many other side impacts) by the start of the 22nd century will be unprecedented in its destruction, no matter how much we can soften its blow.

53 corporations and state owned enterprises have been linked to over 80% of all emissions since 2016, ranging from private corporations such as ExxonMobil to state owned corporations such as Saudi Aramco.

‚Äú80% of these global emissions from 2016 through 2022 can be traced to just 57 corporate and state producing entities. During this period, nation-state producers account for 38% of emissions in the database, while state-owned entities account for 37% and investor-owned companies for 25%.‚Äù

Thus, with the lack of change proven by these companies, how much they pollute which will cause suffering to millions, how they have outgrown human need and will only exist to cause further economic recession through overproduction of oil and overexploitation of the environment, it is morally just to act in violence against the property of these corporations and state owned enterprises.

  
I. The damages of eco-terrorism.

Ecological terrorism, as of now, has caused no attributable deaths. The only one remotely close to this would have had been the Unabomber, however according to his own writings, the Unabomber's motivations were anti-technological rather than ecologically motivated, thus his actions do not fall under the umbrella of ecological terrorism.

Ecological terrorism, however, is very good at causing financial damages. The FBI attributed eco-terrorists to have had caused $200 million in property damage between 2003 and 2008, with these primarily being done through arson, bombings, sabotage, and occasionally tree spiking (however not even this has caused any deaths since its implementation as a tactic 40 years ago, with the worst harm caused by the tactic being non-fatal) and an example of this would be the Bunbury woodchip bombing for instance, where planted bombs were used to destroy $1.8 million worth of woodchips loaders with the stated goal for the attack being to preserve old forests in West Australia from wood chipping activity by shutting down the facilities used to industrially produce wood chips, which caused no deaths.

  
II. The optics of eco-terrorism.

In such a dire situation as the destruction of global ecosystems and the prevention of large scale floodings of nations across the world which would cause among the most (if not the single most) destructive humanitarian crisis in all of human history, the optics caused by eco-terrorism not only are mostly irrelevant but have not caused much damage to the wider peaceful ecological movement. In the United States for instance, since the widespread usage of eco-terrorism by citizens against corporations and companies, tens of millions in damages have been caused to the perpetrators of global climate change, yet the only negative policy changes that have come out of this have been an expanded definition of eco-terrorism and stated fine for partaking in it, and if anything, the actions of US institutions such as the FBI against eco-terrorists is more optically damaging to them than the eco-terrorism is to the ecological movement, as many of the rulings have been found to be faulty and against the exercise of American First Amendment Rights

III. The ethics of eco-terrorism.

Most of the ethics of eco-terrorism have been laid out in the preamble, but I have given the following as a basic fundamental principle that holds up my belief:

Eco-terrorism is morally righteous as the damage caused by the act of eco-terrorism is an evil (if you believe in respect towards private property rights) done at a small scale to prevent or slow down evils done at a far larger scale, most of which is the destruction of the natural ecosystem which thus does harm unto other humans and forms of life.

Ecological action has not been shown to be harmed by majority of eco-terrorism, only by massive and notable events which fade with time and are not very monumental in the grand scheme of the movement, as most eco-terrorism is small scale sabotage and passive destruction of property used by companies.

Thus, partaking in eco-terrorism prevents as much evil as possible without doing any actual evils to any person nor the movement at large, and only does an evil against an abstract idea: that of private property."

https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/why-do-women-choose-to-be-stuck-with-a-bear-over-a-man-in-the-woods-debate-over-hypothetical-question-explained

The implication is that a random man is more dangerous to a woman alone in the woods than a bear.  The question is sexist in the first place, and to answer bear rather than man is a sexist answer to it.

If I asked who you would rather meet in the woods, a chimpanzee, or a black person, that's clearly a pretty racist comparison.  If I asked you if you'd rather meet a pig or a gay person, that's clearly homophobic.  Much in the same way, comparing everyone of one gender to a dangerous wild animal is sexist.

Moreover, picking the bear is extremely sexist.  It's ridiculous to say that random man is more dangerous to woman alone in the woods than a bear.  I'd hope that doesn't need to be supported, but if someone really wants me to, I guess I'll have to.

Some common arguments I've seen:

*  A man could do worse stuff to you than a bear, because a man might rape and torture you.

A woman you meet in the woods *might* rape and torture you.  Does that mean you pick a bear over a woman?  Also a bear might eat your intestines while you're alive for hours.  Also rape is not worse than murder.  Stop being ridiculous.

* Men attacking women happens far more than bears attacking women.

Yeah, we don't live with bears.   Also there are orders of magnitude more men than bears.  Every encounter with a bear should be treated like a dangerous emergency.

* Women *feel* more threatened by the bear.

Yeah, and racists might *feel* more threatened by a black person.  They're still irrational racists.

* It's just a joke.

I get that *some* people are joking, but they're not all joking.  It's also a prejudiced joke.  If you made similar jokes about other groups, you'd lose your job."

Now if we take the example of drawing, there are people who love drawing so much they make careers out of it. It doesn't typically lead to health concerns.





The problem we solved with the washing machine helped improve the human experience.





The problem we solve with automating creative pursuits such as writing, drawing is that we take away things that are actually pleasurable and enjoyable about the human experience."

The loudest men are the most visible unfortunately. I am only addressing them, NOT men as a whole. 

I've been seeing it more and more often that during discussions on women's issues, men feel the need to jump in and say they have it worse. This happens both in Reddit (more so) and outside of Reddit, both on other social media platforms and in real life.

During discussions on female issues, I've seen men claim that misogyny/discrimimation no longer exists (or even never existed). I've seen men outright make it a competition and say that men are discriminated against *more* than women. I've seen men claim that men are a marginalised/oppressed group and women are privileged. I've seen men outright dismiss that women's issues - like the gender pay gap, attack on reproductive rights, sexual harassment - don't exist, and instead push men's issues, like the mental health crisis.

Don't get me wrong at all - I care deeply about men's issues and societal injustices in general. I wrote my dissertation on misogyny in healthcare and care deeply about sexism whether it is directed towards women OR men. *All* issues that women OR men face exclusively needs to be addressed and change needs to happen.

But this is not the way to do it. *Everyone* needs to be on board if social change is going to happen, men and women included, people from all races and backgrounds. When discussing women's issues, having them talked over and belittled by men is NOT helping the cause and as long as this continues, men's issues will not be taken as seriously as they need to be and social change won't happen."

""Fear is the path to the dark side, fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.""

-Yoda

How do you overcome fear, if media is confusing?  
How do you overcome anger, if it's so emotional?  
How do you overcome hate, if the arguments are so circular?  
How do you overcome human suffering, when we live in an illogical world that allows such suffering.

If we reject all negativity, if we become positivity and love, we show everyone who good people are.

When two people get into an argument, a third party can't tell who the good guy is. That's because they need 100% context, and we NEVER have 100% context, 100% of the time. If you react to negative emotions, to negative emotions, you create endless feedback loops, as third parties think you're the bad guy.

  
If you only speak and only talk with love and compassion in your heart, the bad guys, the bad actors in media/narratives, will reveal themselves.

Bad guys only know bad moves, they only make bad mistakes, bad patterns. They cannot unwrite themselves into love and compassion, and that is how we tell who is right and who is wrong.

We cannot stoop to the weapons of our enemies to defeat them, or we become them. We can turn our attention away from hate and ignore it."

Huge tracts of land/ecological zones are razed to the ground to make freeways, (which needs constant maintenance), and city streets and public spaces are unsafe to walk through. People who can't afford cars become isolated, creating privileged access to certain jobs and services. The cars themselves are marketed as status symbols stuffed with high tech features, which in reality, don't matter much in value due to diminishing returns on utility.

To build, use and dispose of these machines requires an incredibly large energy footprint, further adding strain to global resource pools. Moreover, cars are not human friendly to operate, demanding constant cognitive attention at all times of operation, which, under fatigue, can become deadly. Its statistically proven that a person is more likely to die driving a car than swimming in a sea with sharks. 

The car has also disrupted the flow from urban public life to building interiors. Pre-Modern cities, like Rome, Sienna, Florence, were designed and scaled for people, not cars. They have ""positive solid-void"" spaces, linking building interiors to public spaces and enabling a sense of social community. They were easily navigable by using clearly defined landmarks for ease of way-finding on foot, and had mixed uses, rather than separate zones of use stitched together with freeways and stroads. All of these elements lent these ancient cities with a character that Modernist car-centric cities lack. 

The root cause of this is largely due to poor zoning that separates residential areas from commercial and job centers forcing people to travel long distances for daily needs. This makes walking, cycling, and public transportation inconvenient and time-consuming, essentially forcing people towards relying on cars. This creates a negative feedback loop, where planners now have to design for car-centric infrastructure, since everyone around is already them. 

A huge mobility transition is required to take place to undo this dependency, but this ought be a goal to work toward, for planners, economists and policymakers. Implementing mixed-use zoning, narrower & walkable streets, open plazas, MRT systems like buses, trams and trains, remote working and pedestrian-only sections of the city, are just some of the ways to alleviate this dependency.

Ultimately, cars may have allowed freedom of individual movement (to a selective few) but the trade-offs have not been worth it in the end. Their dependency has destroyed our cities, our environments and possibly, our financial futures. A mobility transition needs to happen to foster healthier urban environments for all."

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that online dating is more enjoyable than meeting people IRL, I personally have many problems with online dating and I agree with many popular complaints about them. However, it's undeniable that online dating is becoming an overwhelmingly popular way for couples to meet. 

Many studies are starting to show (look up the Stanford study on ""How Couples Meet and Stay Together"") that the vast majority of young singles use dating apps and that online dating is the most popular way to meet people. I personally think it's just really bad advice to tell people to ""ditch the apps"" when it's very clear that they work, and that you're missing out on a LOT of potential options by doing so. A lot of this is just also due to the fact that many people don't hang out IRL like they used to, and that third spaces are dying fast.

And honestly, if it wasn't for the apps, I don't know how would I ever find dates. I'm in university as a STEM major at a huge party school and I consider myself fairly socially active, but I've never been on a date with someone I met first through IRL. When I started seriously using dating apps, I went on dates with 3 girls over the span of about 4 months (and I probably could've done more if I wasn't so busy with schoolwork and other things in my life). With how horrible the gender ratio is in my career post-college (software engineering), I kinda accepted the fact that I will probably never meet someone through work and that any future partner I find will be through online. While I admit that online dating can be depressing at times (and that it's disgusting that corporations are profiting off of this), I think it's certainly a lot better than what most people I hear are making it out to be lol "

Unions have done a lot to improve wages and working conditions on the whole. I am not anti-union.

But I am anti-picketing. If a union and an employer can't agree on a contract, the union should have the right to go on strike. But picketing is more than that. Not only is the union refusing to work, they are also actively harassing other people from working there or shopping there if they choose. If an employer can find people willing to do the job that the union refuses to do, by what moral justification does the union have the right to bully and threaten those people?

It forces me as a neutral third party to choose a side. I don't know if the business is negotiating in bad faith. I don't know if the union is asking for too much. But I have to either choose to not go to a business that I want to, or get harassed and made to feel like I'm a bad person.

Even when people are doing something they hate, such as working 8+ hours a day at an unfulfilling job, they are still doing it to make money, and making money releases good feelings. People do all kinds of things that they hate, but not a single action is done if the person doing dose not believe it will lead to feeling good or at least feeling better in the future.

Even acts that are completely unselfish are done because they make people feel good. In not saying that people don't have empathy for people who are struggling, they absolutely do. But if helping that person released absolutely no type of satisfying feeling in you, such as the feeling of helping someone, they would not do it. 

People do not do anything that they do not believe will ultimately lead to some type of rewarding, satisfying, or pleasurable feeling. CMV"

That's a lot of money and we are probably unable to pay this off without raising taxes, which will slow our economy, or cutting services, which will piss off voters.

My solution: Privateering. 

The global GDP is something like $100 Trillion. The US only makes up about 75% of that. That means there's up to $75 trillion out there up for the taking! The solution lies abroad.

We spend almost $1 trillion per year on our military, more than 3 times what the next country (China) spends and we have by far the strongest navy in the world.

The United States should send our navy out into the world charging protection money for ships transporting goods on the global oceans. Any country that refuses to pay up will have their cargo confiscated and their coasts raided for loot. Global trade stands at about $32 trillion, meaning that we only have to charge a minor 6% Freedom of Commerce tax to balance our budget. Considering the stablity and prosperity our control of the global oceans offers the tiny, irrelevant countries of the world like Germany or India, this seems like a minor headache for these other countries and they should happily pay up. Isn't it time Uncle Sam got some thanks for everything he does?

If we get some frustratingly stubborn countries, we should just pick a small, irrelevant country like Italy and just blow up all their ports and bridges as an example to other countries. That should make them feel more secure knowing that their donations to the #1 country in the world are securing their trade, commerce, and prosperity. 

Let's imagine we give our soldiers and sailors a 10% cut of the booty collected through this program (and we raise our tax collected on the other countries by the same amount). This foolproof plan would have the great side effect of encouraging young people to sign up for the military, solving our enlistment shortage. A majority of our soldiers come from the working class and from minority ethnic populations so we would be reducing income inequality and racial inequality as well.


I unironically believe that we should do this. I await your responses to my great proposal and I am open to your critiques and suggestions to make it better."

However, the same is true of parody. 

For example, this [Family Guy parody of Citizen Kane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILSbYH9pvjQ). This clip took elements from an existing work, but transformed it to create something new. It altered the original work significantly to provide new meaning. Despite directly using Citizen Kane, the parody is not considered stealing.

Similarly, AI art is trained using a large body of existing works. It creates things that are completely different from the images that it's trained on. Just like parody, AI art builds upon existing works, but the result is something transformative.

To elaborate on the ""transformative"" point, the AI uses the training data to fine-tune parameters for a mathematical function that turns prompts into images. There are so many parameters, and so much training data (millions of images) that the impact of a single image is negligible. If you look at the parameters, they'll look like random numbers. Can you tell me how a bunch of random numbers is copyright infringement or stealing? I can go on DeviantArt, download the first 100 (copyrighted!) images, put them into a .zip file, and then compute the sha256 of that file. I get 9D63E3EFFB9B8ED942D059829B3E77ACBA7DA1BBACC95CF18FCC09E491E1F2D6. Is this string of bits stealing or copyright infringement? Keep in mind that to generate this string of bits, I had to use copyrighted work from artists without their consent. 

You might argue lack of consent as an issue. However, [consent isn't required for parody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_v._Acuff-Rose_Music,_Inc). In the same way, I don't think that using images to train an AI requires consent either. The AI is not reproducing these images, instead, it's generating new, original content. 

So, if we accept that parody, which uses existing elements in a transformative way, isn‚Äôt stealing, why should AI art be viewed differently? "

* men are stronger and dominant so are percieved as more predatory, the dynamic IS FAR worse than an older woman dating a younger man, so thats why men are bashed more because lets face it hes most likely taking advantage of her and he also has power over the woman whether its money or strength 
* women are more naive when it comes to dating - okay im a young girl myself but even i know that there are some girls that are absolutely clueless about the intentions of their partners, some women dont clock it and think they're ""different"" 
* women mostly regret dating these older guys compared to men dating older women, i have yet to see a man complaining or regretting dater an older woman, i see sooo many girls say they regret going out with that ""one older guy"" and say they'll never do it again which again shows that those relationships aren't very nice lol "

By using machine learning and powerful GPUs, I should be allowed to legally copy the Windows 11 OS, have my LLM ingest it, and produce an exact replica with slight modifications. Then, I should be allowed to offer the Windows 11 OS and compete with Microsoft by providing both free and paid versions.


If Microsoft can simply evade copyright laws by calling their theft ""AI"" or ""LLM,"" I should also be able to do the same. OpenAI and Copilot took millions of copyrighted works without permission, and then competed with the same people they stole the content from. OpenAI even admitted that ChatGPT wouldn't be possible without copyrighted content.

It's like me opening a Netflix clone and offering free streaming for all Disney movies as a subscription, and when Disney sues me, my defense would be, 'It is impossible to have a business without copyrighted movies.

These wont change my mind:



1. Whether me copying Windows 11 OS or Office Suite can produce a viable replica is irrelevant. My point is about being allowed to use copyrighted Microsoft products, modify them with AI, and then legally compete with them


.
2. Comparing AI to a human reading a book, getting inspired, and writing a similar book is flawed. LLMs (Large Language Models) lack the originality and creativity found in humans. Additionally, LLMs are trained on massive amounts of copyrighted content, which a single human could not replicate organically.



3. Technological advancement shouldn't be a reason to abandon laws. The argument that other countries won't follow suit if the US bans AI development is weak. Major corporations like Apple and Google will likely create even more sophisticated AI regardless. Just because technology is ""advancing"" doesn't justify breaking laws, just like eliminating child labor laws, minimum wage, or environmental regulations wouldn't be a good idea.



4. AI is a public good. This is only convincing if these AIs were developed by non-profit organizations and remain so. But now, it's like a shady individual who has infringed on people's copyrights trying to evade accountability through semantics."

There is an argument to be made that the mere presence of the TSA promotes more caution and better behavior from potential bad actors but what about the other side of that coin? For the Americans reading this, have you traveled by Amtrak? If so, did you notice the remarkable lack of security? You sit and wait in the station for your train and then you board the train with your belongings. There has never been a terror attack on an Amtrak train.

What about those of you that travel via metra trains in Seattle, NYC, Chicago, or Boston? You simply pay your fair, pass through the gates, and get on the train. When you're on your daily commute, do you ever worry about bombs on these trains?

I'm not saying security doesn't matter. But at what cost and inconvenience is it worth it? Could we not be spending a bunch of our money allocated to the TSA on better public services and programs?"

I only want and have been dating guys who have an above average financial situation.

I find this puzzling because men especially Rich men are allowed to have specific standards regarding the physical appearance of the women they want to date, and society doesn't view this as superficial.
  I‚Äôve noticed in various conversations in real life and subreddits that when a woman expresses a desire to date a wealthy man, men often respond with comments like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a gold digger!‚Äù or ‚Äúno rich guy will look at you if your not hot‚Äù

So if it‚Äôs socially acceptable for a rich guy to only want to date hot girls and girls that look like models why is it not socially acceptable for a hot woman to only want to date a wealthy guy? Without being labeled as a ‚Äúgold digger‚Äù

   Another reason I choose to only date men with a certain level of financial security is that I refuse to struggle and support a man through school, only for him to achieve his career goals (like becoming a doctor or lawyer) and then leave to build his dream life with a younger woman. I‚Äôve seen this happen so  many times, and ofc I know not every guy does this but I don‚Äôt even want to take that chance because I‚Äôve seen it happen more then I can count.
      

I also believe in life you can choose who you want to love, I decided early on that I want to fall in love and build a family with a wealthy man.

Nowadays I CANNOT walk into town without seeing multiple children with headphones and helmets, or they're overstimulated and shrieking. These aren't just mild instances - which I'm sure are far greater in number, but the ones which have the parents essentially act as carers. 


The classic explanation on reddit is that this is due to increased ""awareness"". I simply cannot buy this explanation at the levels I'm seeing. These children are clearly not capable of masking away their symptoms.  


Is this because parents used to hide away their autistic children from the world and only now is it okay for them to be seen? Would those children not also be getting diagnosed in the past if there was such a problem? Regardless of whether or not they were getting diagnosed, I'll be frank.. we didn't even HAVE children with this brand of mental disability around to diagnose. There's always been children who didn't fit in and had to be treated differently, so is autism just our era's version of adhd or mutism?

Rent/home prices are outpacing wages, so it is becoming harder and harder to afford a house/apartment. As a result, more and more young people are forced to stay at home because they can't afford to buy a house or rent an apartment. Similarly, the rates of homelessness and poverty are increasing. These are going to have devastating consequences because when people don't have enough money, the economy gets worse as people don't have any money to spend. Generation Z has an unemployment rate over twice that of the national average at 9.2%.

Millennials and Generation Z are having less kids than previous generations, so the US population growth is not nearly as strong as it used to be. Immigration is the only reason why the population is remaining somewhat steady. Immigration is vital to the US, but the trend of Americans having less children is concerning as that means the population may begin to decline.

The country is also becoming more politically polarized than it has been since the Civil War. As a result, fewer things are getting done politically because politicians are fighting with each other as opposed to actually trying to get things done. 

Health complications are on the rise as drug usage and obesity increase. Our healthcare system is struggling as healthcare workers are becoming burnt out and turning to different fields. Similarly, affording healthcare is difficult as a lot of people don't have insurance through their work to cover it. Mental illness used be a taboo topic, which meant many suffered from undiagnosed mental illnesses, so it's tough to tell if mental illness is on the rise or not, but it is noted that more and more young people are diagnosed with mental illness.

Before people start calling me a boomer who just wants to hate on the new generation, I am a member of Generation Z. As far as I am concerned, the writing is on the wall. Generation Z is overweight, suffering from more health complications and mental illness than any other generation before them, and unwilling to work while still living at home."

However, the current state of media ownership undermines this fundamental principle.

1. **Concentration of Power**: When media is privately owned, it tends to become concentrated in the hands of a few large corporations or individuals. These owners have the power to shape public opinion by controlling what information is disseminated and how it is presented. This concentration of power can lead to biased reporting that serves the interests of the few rather than the many.
2. **Profit Motives**: Private media companies operate on a for-profit basis. This means their primary goal is to generate revenue, often prioritising sensationalism and entertainment over in-depth, unbiased reporting. The pursuit of profit can lead to a focus on clickbait, divisive content, and the sidelining of important issues that do not attract immediate attention or advertising dollars.
3. **Political Influence**: Media owners can use their platforms to advance their political agendas (or the agenda of their donors), subtly or overtly influencing public perception and electoral outcomes. This can result in a media landscape that is more of a propaganda tool than a source of unbiased information, skewing democratic processes.

To clarify, I am not arguing that the media should be state-controlled; I am just arguing that media ownership and the bias it produces fundamentally flaws our current democracy."

They do not watch you. They do not even care if you never pull the trigger to kill civilians in the mission. PFC Joseph Allen could have easily shot and killed them all. He had an LMG with plenty of ammo, and was obviously trained in the military to where he could have handled it well. Makarov is even the one closest to you!!

The in universe reason given by Shepherd to Allen as to why Allen is going in to even do this is, and I quote directly from the game, ""It will cost you a piece of yourself. It will cost nothing compared to everything you'll save.""

In no world was any of the potential info that could have possibly been gained by staying in Makarov's circle been worth more than just killing Makarov on the spot. There was a prime opportunity to do what they've always wanted to do and bad/ignorant writing is the only thing that stopped it. 

I cannot think of any valid in universe reasons as to why Allen could not have shot at least just Makarov. In what world does a common-man military member (who is literally one step above private, which means he basically just completed boot camp) not stop the killing of literally hundreds, if not thousands of innocent people, let alone he actively participates in it???

I would have no issue with this if literally ANY coherent reason was given as to why it could not be done. Here's a few things that weren't written into the game, but if they were written in, it wouldn't be a plothole:

1. Makarov and gang is in full bulletproof outfits, obviously not allowing them to be fragged. This is just a character design change. Wouldn't have even needed to record dialog. 

2. Allen is forced to be in front as they don't trust the new guy, so he has to prove himself. You would be shot if you attempt to look at them with your gun, for example. 

3. The airport massacre and kill numbers weren't supposed to be anywhere close to this bad, in the eyes of Shepherd/America anyway. Whether this be because the target was unknown, or something else. 

4. There was someone above Makarov who they wanted, that successfully doing this would have lead them to.

5. Any piece of anything that would have been more valuable than Makarov and the stopping of his future atrocities if it existed. More valuable to everyone, by the way, not just more valuable to Shepherd. 

Please do what you can to change my mind because this bothers me so much. I'm open to hearing all potential points. I want my mind changed because other than this specific issue, I can suspend my disbelief for everything else wacky that happens."

I looked for a what ""non toxic masculinity"" looks like according to them and in all honesty, all i found was ""every non toxic masculinity"" trait can be expressed by anyone and hence it isn't particularly relevant to masculinity.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/s/oFLQfWZRPH

which simply begs the question - if all ""non toxic masculinity"" is just good behaviour that can be expressed by anyone, aren't you essentially just saying that only ""toxic masculinity"" is masculinity.

at this point I am half convinced that the whole debate around toxic masculinity is perpetrated by feminists to basically just demean anything they don't like about men and they want to get rid of. They believe it's bad for them than it definitely must be bad for men and hence men should drop their behaviour. 

I recently came across the Gillette ad( sorry, late to the party again) and the first thought that came to my head was ""this ad has to be the work of a woman"" because it read a lot like an idea of a man in a woman's head and i was correct in making that assumption.

having lived on this planet for 30 years and after moving in circles full of men for most of my life, i am yet to come across the caricaturish view of men and masculinity that the ad provides.

throughout my life I've seen men open up about their emotions but only when they're with other men whom they can trust.

countless men, including me have stated that we don't open up to women because we've only experienced negative interactions and at best apathy and at worst outright mockery from women when they tried to open up.

The most popular way to split expenses that's seen as the most fair is splitting by income ratios. For example,

Person 1: makes $50k
Person 2: makes $200k
1 bd apartment rent: $1250

Then they each split the rent in a 1:4 ratio. Person one pays 20% = $250, person 2 pays $1000.

I fail to see how this is most fair if each person uses half of the space ($625 in value) and person 1 only pays $250 for it. The other $375 ($625-250) is subsidized by person 2. 

If person 2 also made exactly $50k, then the split would have been $625 each. So by virtue of person 1 being with someone making more money, that somehow makes them entitled to $375/mo in subsidies?

Another argument is that this is fair because both people would be spending the same % of their income on rent (0.5% per month). 

By person 2 subsidizing some of person 1's rent, person 1 gets to spend less % of their income on rent and save more. If person 1 gets to save more, where does the extra money they save come from? Person 1. Basically, person 2 pays person 1 $375/mo so they could save/spend it. How is that fair?   


The last argument, which I agree with, is when person 2 inflates the expense because they want something nicer. For example, imagine person 2 wants a penthouse that's $5k/month instead. In this case, it would be ridiculous for them to expect person 1 to pay $2.5k/mo. Person 1 would not be comfortable with that big of a % of income spent on rent, and shouldn't have to.   

What I propose as the most fair, is that person 1 sets the budget for what they're comfortable spending half of, and person 2 just matches the same amount. In my example, $1250, split by half is $625, which person 1 is comfortable with, then that should be their budget. This way, no one is subsidizing someone else's life."

Why would anyone be against National healthcare that‚Äôs not tied to employment? Nearly everyone of us will need it at some point.

The west wants Russia to completely pull out of Ukraine and Crimea at least. Many in the west also would like Russia to pay reparations and prosecute Putin and his pro war ministers and generals. 

Russia obviously wants to take all of Ukraine at least if not Ukraine and a few other former Soviet satellites. And I agree that if his terms for peace are given unconditionally i.e. he keeps what he's taken so far, then he'll just take more later, especially if Trump is elected.

If these are the only options for peace, then this war will last years. As much as the media might tell us otherwise, Russia can outlast Ukraine, even if the west continues to supply arms. The longer this war lasts the more it swings in Russias favor. 

The only way for the west to avoid this is to either declare war on Russia with western armies(WW3 likely involving China as well), or broker some sort of peace deal that gives and takes from both parties. It may seem unfair to grant concessions to the agressor, but to avoid WW3 is that not something that should be at least on the table?

This CMV is solely regarding Trump, and whether he is likely to have performed actions that warrant criminal investigation. I don't want to hear about the other guy. 

Things that might change my mind: Compelling evidence that the charges do not merit investigation. Evidence that other prominent New Yorkers were charged with numerous crimes when they were not actively testing the boundaries of the law. Maybe something else that I have not thought of.

If they support forcing them to fight against their will I believe they would support forcing me to do the same. 

To the gun part I will happily die before I'm made to be a slave( or whatever you wanna call it). So Im going to shoot whoever tries. 

I'm sure one of the common responses I will get is that

I find this unconvincing. I'm sure people would oppose individuals they care about being conscripted but I don't think there is enough social cohesion for people to care about strangers.

Please note that these opinions stem from my personal experience from interacting with such communities as a teen myself:

Individuals (primarily adults) actively interacting/participating communities originally intended for a much younger audience raises safety concerns. Adults may inadvertently or deliberately introduce content or discussions that are not aimed for younger audiences, exposing them to inappropriate material. for example, The older audience can at times ""forget"" they're participating in a community dedicated to a show catered to the ages 13-17 and let slip mature topics/discussions which may be found disturbing by its targeted audience. From my personal experience, this manifests in forms of Theories, headcanons, discussions and most importantly, Fanart. There have been many times where I've felt uncomfortable seeing suggestive/hyper sexualized art of characters I've related to so much. Sometimes I feel scared to even strike up a discussion in such communities because I could be interacting with an adult in their 30s/40s. the stereotyping doesn't help much either. I personally find it incredibly weird/ somewhat creepy how adults in their later stages of live find a show meant for 13-17 ages to be ""relatable"". I've strayed clear of Anime exactly for this reason.

  
Communities designed for specific demographics, like teenagers, function better when participants share similar experiences. if you're an adult, you wouldn't want a kid messing with your weekend BBQ. Is it unreasonable to assume that audiences made of primarily teenagers would prefer the same? If we focus on the logistics here. it ensures discussions remain relevant and appropriate for the targeted ages. Ever since animated shows/movies got popular with the older folk, companies have included ideologies/struggles experienced by the adults to ""resonate"" more with them. It just doesn't work. 

  
I know there are some flaws in my reasoning behind all this, But Please, Should I really be this weirded out by the supposed people I'm sharing my ideas with being not around my age, but beinf twice or maybe even thrice my age? "

Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but from my understanding this censorship stems from an incident in 2017 called the Adpocalypse, where advertisers boycotted YouTube after the ""ElsaGate"" trend, and as a result of a few bad actors pushing extreme content, YouTube inconsistently banned swearing in videos, references to violence etc. Imo finding advertisers for the company shouldn't be too hard anyway as Reddit has way worse content but still manages to run ads.

As a collective, IMO the user base of YouTube should take all measures possible to limit viewing ads. This could include using mirror sites, adblockers or any other means.

I've observed brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) like Neuralink being used to assist individuals with disabilities, such as enabling a paralyzed man to control electronic devices without physical input devices, aside from the implant. This raises the question of why this specific implementation is chosen. Humans can already interface with devices and send information out. A potentially more effective approach could be feeding information directly to the user. For instance, visualizing a math problem and instantly seeing the solution or querying historical facts and receiving immediate answers.

Bluetooth is not the current industry standard and being phased out for good reason:

There are notable concerns with utilizing Bluetooth for BCIs, particularly regarding security. Bluetooth connections are susceptible to interception and manipulation. Statistics indicate that over 16 million Bluetooth devices are at risk of hacking due to security vulnerabilities, making Bluetooth an impractical choice for transmitting sensitive neural data.

It is difficult to interface with the brain and current devices have much more tools to do so than BCIs: 

Humans predominantly learn through tactile, auditory, or visual inputs. Thus, implementing BCIs for information reception must consider these modalities. The limited success of cochlear implants for many DEAF individuals (capital Deaf, not just deaf or hard of hearing) underscores the challenge of directly interfacing with the brain. Current devices like smartphones, equipped with cameras, storage, microphones, speakers, displays, touchscreens, gesture recognition, and extensive connectivity, still offer significant room for improvement. The use of implants seems primarily beneficial for individuals who cannot utilize these existing devices.

The future of tech is in the cloud:

With the advancement of cloud-based and quantum computing, future devices could be virtually any size or form and remain highly affordable. Statistics predict that the number of IoT devices will reach 30.9 billion by 2025, indicating a strong trend towards interconnected devices. Additionally, Wi-Fi and IP technology advancements are surpassing Bluetooth capabilities. For instance, Wi-Fi 6 offers speeds up to 9.6 Gbps compared to Bluetooth 5.0‚Äôs maximum of 2 Mbps, demonstrating a clear advantage in data transfer rates. It is likely that basic devices such as chairs and cars will possess IP addresses and join networks long before BCIs achieve mainstream adoption.

This was just another publicity stunt by someone known to overpromise and under deliver/ never deliver:

In conclusion, while BCIs hold potential, the current form presents challenges in security, practicality, and integration with human learning modalities. These issues make widespread adoption of BCIs unlikely in the near future. This project may encounter similar hurdles to ambitious endeavors like the trip to Mars that have yet to materialize.

For starters, if the woman gets pregnant from cheating she can unknowingly trick her husband into raising another man's child. Much more difficult to pull off the other way around. 

Women are also nearly twice as likely to contract STDs than men meaning they are more likely to pass them onto their partner.

Study after study also demonstrate that women cheat more for emotional reasons and men cheat more for sexual need. Cheating for emotional reasons is far more toxic to the relationship than for pure sexual reasons.

Being owned privately allows the distribution of power to stay primarily in those who were already powerful. Resources primarily stay in the top 0.000001%. However, it disguises itself under the guise of prosperity because this kind of economic system allows a country to steal more effectively from other countries. We have more resources over time but the divide between rich and poor essentially becomes further and further. This is because the resources always shifts hand from the poor to the rich. This was shown in America as the working American had to and continues to pay for inflation. Houses previously 150k are now double and cars being sky high.

I saw a video today on Twitter, a couple of dudes with ""Dads Against Predators"" shirts going after this guy, who clearly looks mentally disabled, and they were going after him with a lot of aggressiveness, punching, kicking and to finish, one of them kicked him in the face making him drop to the floor unconscious. I am in no way, shape or form defending the alleged predator, if he's guilty, he has to pay for it, but isn't a better way to solve this? Like actually handing it over to the authorities so they can do it professionally and not like a couple of frat boys cussing picking up fights and doing it clearly for clout and money? 

Not to mention, the vast majority of these catches ends up in nothing, because in a court of law, you can't prosecute a grown man for being messaging another grown man pretending to be a minor, which brings to my point of creating a problem of making the alleged criminals walking free thanks to their terrible handling of evidence and approach.

Other problem, we've seen multiple cases of some of those vigilantes going after the wrong guy, which is why vigilantism is so wrong, you can damage and even hurt innocent people because you are not a professional, you don't know how to do it properly.

Am I wrong to think like that, or what they do is 100% justified and solves the issue?  "
0,2024-06-26,CMV: Australia has the best and most democratic electoral system,u/Mighty_Crow_Eater,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dpdxyi/cmv_australia_has_the_best_and_most_democratic/,changemyview,"To preface this, I don‚Äôt mean for this to be disparaging or dunking on any other country or the systems that they use, and not just cringey Americabad USA bashing.

**A quick explainer on the Australian parliament:**

Australia has a federal parliament with two houses ‚Äì the House of Representatives, and the Senate.

The house of representatives has 151 members each representing an electoral district of about 120,000 voters. The senate is comprised of 76 senators ‚Äì 12 senators from each of the six states, and two representing each territory. Whichever party or coalition has the support of the majority of members of the House of Representatives gets to form the government. The Senate acts as a house of review and a check on the power of the government.

**Now for the voting system that‚Äôs used.**

Members of the House of Representatives are elected using an instant runoff **ranked choice voting** system, in which voters rank the candidates on the ballot in order of their preference. When the ballots are counted, voters‚Äô first preference will be counted. If no candidate has a majority, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and the votes for the second preference on those ballots are counted. This process is repeated until a candidate has a majority.

The Senate uses the single transferable vote system of **proportional representation**. The STV system is slightly more complex, but essentially a voter will rank their choices of candidates on their ballot. A candidate requires a certain quota of votes to be elected. If a candidate reaches this quota, any surplus votes will be transferred to the voters‚Äô second preference and this process repeats. The result of this is that the number of candidates elected for each party is, as closely as possible, directly proportional to the support that party‚Äôs candidates receive after preferences,

Importantly, filling out your ballot is mandatory and failure to appear at the polling place is punishable by a fine. Importantly, its only mandatory to have your name checked off the roll, but you can draw a fat cock on the ballot with no punishment if you really hate voting that much.

I believe that these three factors means that Australia has arguably the best democratic electoral system in the world.

**1:** The upper house is fully elected. An unelected upper house such as in the UK and Canada is completely undemocratic.

**2:** Elections for both houses allow for a form of ranked choice voting, meaning that tactical voting is unnecessary as it is impossible to waste your vote. This means that minor parties and independent candidates actually have the possibility to be elected. This also forces major parties to appeal to the center, and not to extreme positions.

**3:** Mandatory voting means that there is essentially a full voter turnout, meaning that elections results will more genuinely reflect the view of the electorate as a whole.

So that‚Äôs why I have this view. Do any other places have a more democratic system?"

But what if you have more choices in your taxes. Rather than having to pay a fixe amount as your taxes out of your form, you as an individual are given a form and you choose which money to allocate to your taxes to in the form of infrastructure and social programs,, ranging from a lot to just 1 cent. So, basically you are given a choice in how much money you would allocate for your taxes for  government projects rather than having to pay mostly fixed sums for taxes to fund them 

I think this would give individuals more control in how taxes are paid and allows for more accountability in the government in how taxpayers money are spent since citizens get to see government programs and make the choice to fund them or not to fund them

Every moral stance I argue seems to boil down to objective morals. Objective morals cannot be 'argued', for example if i say societal stability is the ultimate good and you say individual power is the ultimate good, there is nothing more to be said between these things except try to point out internal contradictions, the way you might prove a syllogism wrong.

All our moral statements are based on irrefutable assumptions, and thus are not logical is what im trying to get at. Of course you could get more into it with genealogy of morals and all that but the historical context of a moral statement is hardly something that can be used to argue for its correctness as a logical statement. (ex. The proof for this math problem was created by nazis so its wrong! hardly.)

So what im confused about is if I make my own moral system of philosophy saying that the end goal of life is to eat as many bananas as possible, nobody could say that it is below other philosophies or ethical systems besides based on the fact that it is impractical.

Of course, this leads to pragmatism. I admit im not super well read on pragmatism but the fundamental idea that ethical theories should be evaluated based on their real life consequences is less than ideal to me. For starters, this is just throwing away any precedence that ethical statements are logical. (eg. Godels incompleteness thm doesnt contribute anything to modern technology and is doing nothing but causing confusion in the mathematical world! its bad! scrap it!)

There might be some readily admitting that ethics is illogical and saying so what? To be honest, I dont know. I for some reason think that its incredibly sad that philosophy is no more than a tool for utility and holds no credibility as a logical system at all. On what grounds are people saying that certain societal taboos are bad then? i dont even know anymore and my personal ethical outlook is looking very grim rn.

Hopefully somebody can point out the holes in my logic (there are probably very many) and help me. "

My View: I am not just talking about wanting a person with a few past partners also because you have only a few past partners but also that there is nothing wrong with a guy with a high number of past partners wanting a woman who is a virgin and vice versa. I haven‚Äôt heard a single argument against this being a valid preference.

Example: let‚Äôs say a man or a woman has a significant past and meets two potential identical partners. One of the partners a virgin and the other has a significant amount of past partners. It is completely valid for the man or woman to choose/prefer either partner based on their past. "

We have personal boundaries and enforce them. We demand kind treatment. Not princess treatment, but dignified human treatment.

...

- If animals being killed or living in poor conditions matter intrinsically, then we should want more animals to live in good conditions for its own sake (rather than say, because it makes their meat more delicious)
- Therefore, animals living long, fulfilling lives has moral worth.

...

- A simulated human consciousness has as much moral worth as an actual human mind
- We generalize this that any simulated consciousness has as much moral worth as an actual mind
- Therefore, a simulated animal consciousness has as much moral worth as an actual animal

...

- Some day, it'll be possible to run simulations of animal minds
- The cost of simulating a simpler mind is cheaper than simulating a complex mind
- Therefore, we should find the smallest mind that has ""moral worth"", which we'll arbitrarily decide is a chicken in this case, but can be some fish or mice or insect, and run as many simulations of that as possible to create the most ""net good"". This is a moral imperative as strong or stronger as that of stopping animal suffering.
- We should also run the simulation as slow as possible, to prolong the life of the simulated animal

More controversially, needs not immediately follows:

- We can offset factory farming with simulating happy chicken lives. If the result of factory farming is that 1 in a million ""chicken: suffers horribly, is it still all that bad?
- We can offset factory farming with *future* simulations of happy chicken lives. Chicken lives are fungible across space and time. Therefore, as long as we commit to *eventually* simulating billions of chickens, current factory farming practices are perfectly justifiable."

but i cant help but see this in most modern triple A titles... modern triple A titles have always generally been a little more demanding than other games, because well... deadlines are stricter devs are given less control or freedom and so generally more corners are cut than in other games even if they are of the same visual quality.

however it feels like this has become extreme over the last few years, modern triple A titles are running worse and worse compared to none triple A titles to the point of absurdity, you can have a game like baldurs gate 3 run on pretty old hardware pretty comfortably even without upscaling tech (for instance my 1080 runs the game high settings 60fps 1080p) and then you turn around and try to play games like starfield, or jedi survivor and they run notoriously bad on even budget hardware of this generation.

settings feel like they've almost been entirely abandoned. i mean there are still texture options and such but it feels like both performance wise and just visually very little actually changes, as if the large gaming companies are worried about allowing people to make their games look too bad because of the PR... perhaps thinking people will go ""look how good this game looks even on low settings"" with people not realising that thats just because their low settings arent... very low.

games in general dont feel like they've visually improved that much in recent years, i mean sure there's some benefit in some places but i still think you can look at a game like red dead redemption 2 and compare it to modern games and see that they look strikingly similar in terms of visual fidelity, and yet modern games are just running worse.

ive noticed this trend ever since DLSS started getting more popular, more and more ill play a game which will just enable DLSS by default, hell they've even started just straight up putting it under Anti-Aliasing (not talking about DLAA) 

meanwhile none triple A titles run better than ever as they should as in general even budget hardware nowadays is incredibly impressive hardware, especially comparative to the marginal increase in visual fidelity. Gpus are getting better and better whilst visual quality barely changes.

gaming performance feels so incredibly turbulent comparative to the last decade, i have truly no idea whether my 3060ti will be able to run a game at 1440p max without many issues, or if it will run inexplicably poorly and barely be able to handle the game at 1080p max, despite not looking any different.

its seriously depressing considering DLSS was marketed as a method to boost the longevity of cards but instead its just become a necessity for even mid range gpus on certain games to get comfortable performance and i can only summise that its because these larger companies have people at the top who see this tech as a way to shave down development time, why bother optimising when you can just slap on DLSS and call it a day? 

am i missing something? is something else going on or have large gaming studios really just given up on trying to make their  games actually stable in favour of just upscaling tech. Its gotten truly insane in my eyes."

Like whenever you watch any fantasy based story and see the main characters, they can always get so powerful and can even 1vs100 low level characters.  Even in stories like Naruto where Madara soloed 5 kages +10 000 ninjas. Meanwhile in reality even if you are Mike Tyson or Brucee Lee you can only take on max 3-4 people at the same time. ( if they attack the same time, and not likes in movies where they wait for their turns).
Like in real life feels like 99% (the average person) of the people are like lvl 2-3, meanwhile the 1%(people who are professional fighters) are like lvl 4-8.  But then if you suddenly buy a gun, now you are lvl 100. Everything ia just boring. It feels useless to have work hard and be powerful in the real word, because a random Joe can just shoot you with a gun from 15 yards, and there you go.

1,2024-06-27,CMV: I am Anti-Islam ,u/Otherwise-Fix-7653,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dppcyx/cmv_i_am_antiislam/,changemyview,"First of all, I want to say, I'm not generally Anti-Muslim. I know a lot of muslims - and I mean, A LOT. They are truly the most humble, kind hearted and compassionate individuals that I know. I am aware, that most muslims in the west, are peaceful. Also, I think it's important to respect every person equally. BUT... I am still Anti-Islam and quite frankly I also kind of fear the ideology of certain muslims. Here's are just a few points that drive me towards this view: 

Entitlement of certain muslims: 

I see a lot of muslim influencers in the west that want Sharia law and the general islamic ideology implemented. A lot of them even openly admit that homosexuals, non-believers and apostates should be killed. Oh so yeah, just because you are unable to let go of your completely outdated, human rights violating ideology, everyone, who just really appreciates their freedom, should now comply with this absolutely atrocious ideology, that, if interpreted in the traditional way, like the Afghan government and Saudi Arabia do, for example, orders the killing of homosexuals, apostates and non-believers. Why don't these influencers move to these countries and see for themselves.  I can guarantee you, that most of them would be back within a day. Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan are evidence, that islamic extremist ideologies, if politicised, just absolutely destroy all harmony and balance within a society. Now you could say: Well, these countries don't live Islam the right way. But I can tell you, considering the Quran, Hadith, Sharia law, Tafsir and all the other fundamental texts to understand the religion, their interpretation is just as valid, if not more valid than the interpretation of muslims of the religion in the west.

Homosexuality: 

I hear a lot of muslims say, that homosexuality is a choice. So, you want to tell me, that people in Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia put their life on the line, just for the sake of being homosexual, when they could just be straight? If you think that, then my question would be: What the fuck is wrong with you?Homosexuals don't choose to be homosexual and prohibiting them from freely acting out on their sexuality is just plain wrong. No discussion. 

Human rights/Women's rights: 

I don't want to elaborate too much, because it would just take to long. Just to give you a few examples on what human rights are violated, when we take the Quran as the inherent and unchanged word of god Muhammad as his Messenger and the exemplary muslim: Gender Equality, Freedom of Religion, Freedom of expression, freedom of discrimination, right to education etc., etc. In Afghanistan, women who show clear evidence that their husband is abusive towards them, are literally told that domestic violence doesn't exist and that those are only accusations. Oh, and don't let me start with the public whipping, the stoning, the pushing homosexuals of buildings, the decapitating and what not. 

Considering all this, extremist muslim clowns still wonder why they are being put on watch lists in the US and many European countries. 

I could go on and on and on, but I will leave it at this. The problem with Islam is that according to the Religion itself, it should be taken as the inherent word of God. Even though there is still a lot of room for interpretation, the religion, interpreted in the most accurate way(s), very clearly violates basic human rights and is absolutely destructive to a functioning society. Also, the later revelations are much more violent then the earlier ones (the Quran is not in chronological order) and are to be taken as the correct ones, as far as I know. I feel so sorry for all the men and women who have to live under this oppressive ideology. Also, don't tell me that Islam is the fastest growing religion. The only reason this is true, is because of the astronomically high birth rates in muslim countries. 

To finish this off, I just want to remind you again that I'm not anti-muslim, well at least not anti the majority of them. "

Those two people have nothing in common and trying to group them together in this mega group of the 99% is just ridiculous. They are going to have completely different positions on basically every issue because they are so culturally different they might as well be from different countries.

I constantly see people across Reddit promoting this conspiracy theory that the elite is using the media to try to divide and conquer different demographics, completely ignoring the cultural and historical differences between religions, genders, racial and ethnic groups, and geographical areas. This conspiracy is constantly stated without any evidence, I'd be very interested if anyone could actually give me a real example of this happening in the real world. and basically tries to wave away hundreds of years of ethnic tensions.

This leads to an issue where many people never consider the very real differences between different groups in society, and instead of trying to compromise on issues to help everyone instead, we try to ignore it and pretend it doesn't exist at all.

At the end of the day men and women, rural and urban, working class and middle class, north and south, religious vs non religous ect. They are all different and have different wants and needs, we can't deny that"

All you have to do on the dates is just ask a lot of fundamental questions about the other person, to get a sense of their personality and values.
This includes questions deep and philosophical questions too that not only give you information about their current values , but future ones too. Eg.:  for example if you want to gather information about the person on how they judge people, how they form their thoughts, how they react to unpredictable questions, how they react to topics that are not nice and also how much they are trying to conform or  how much they care about other peoplea opinions. All of things you can simply get by asking them what's their opinion on people who are attracted to children. The amount of times I can immidiatelly tell if a person is an npc just through their reaction to this simple question is insane.

0,2024-06-27,"CMV: If you claim to be a moral realist, in your actions you are a moral relativist and/or subjectivist. ",u/ThemDawgsIsHell_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dpseko/cmv_if_you_claim_to_be_a_moral_realist_in_your/,changemyview,"I'll show this through some examples. Also, I understand you could be a moral intuitionist; I'm gonna bracket those folk (of which I am more/less one) for the sake of this argument as it speaks, from my anecdotal experience in society, to a tiny amount of people. How I am open to this changing is through being shown that actually, most people hold moral realist views and actualize them in their actions, disregarding their personal feelings, beliefs, and societal norms for the sake of actualizing moral realistic perspectives.  

The popular 'Bear in the Woods or random man?' question. If you are a woman who is a moral realist and in the camp that you'd rather a random bear than man happen upon you in the wilderness and find this judgement to be a moral one to make, you have to also own the concept that one can judge other people based on gender or race or other ontological domains and still be moral. 

1. *I would rather a random bear than a random man cross my path.* 

2. *I would rather a random \[black\] bear than a random \[black\] man cross my path.*

In both cases you are taking a physical reality, the existence of humans, bears, and their potential interactions in nature, dividing them up into ontological *branches* or *domains* (eg race, gender, age, etc.) which is a metaphysical distinction, and then placing a value judgement based on a believed universal, objective, and absolute (ie moral realism) ethical standard. In the above, if you have a universal, objective, and absolute moral fact of the reality, you should have an equal adjudication or desired moral outcome for both 1. and 2. If they differ (ie it is morally acceptable to hold the position of 1. but morally repugnant to hold the position 2.) then you are showing you hold either/both moral compunctions/validations relative to your society's/group's values and/or subjectively based on your personal values and taste preference. Or you believe the universe has objective moral facts which are inconsistent yet amazingly happen to fall in line with your desired subjective outcomes for society. 

Another example would be a Christian who believes there is one objective, absolute, and moral standard in reality: The word of God. In this case, let's take the ethics of sex, although there are many other areas to choose from, held objectively, universally, and absolutely to be gay sex is a sin. You also have that premarital sex is a sin in this moral realist claim. Yet the vast majority of Christian's in Western culture value one as being ""more"" sinful and the other is either passively ignored or is actively embraced. I live in the American South and just looking at country music, the lyrics, the live shows, the music videos, the notion of premarital sex is accepted en masse from this group. 

Yet, I find many times more anti gay people in this group for the reason that it violates the one true moral reality of the universe (God's). The distinction here is no different than the Bear in the Woods argument above, it simply highlights the reality which is the vast majority of people, even when they claim to be moral realist, in the actual application of their morality, in the use of their morality (actions speak louder than words, ironically here), in believing in one objective, absolute, and universal moral standard applicable to all, most people are actually moral relativist/subjectivist, pushing their personal/communal ideas as though they were universal and absolutely objective facts of the universe. 

This is in no way an exhaustive list, it permeates both Left and Right, religious and secular humanist, etc. etc. etc. "

0,2024-06-27,CMV: you should stop engaging in politics ,u/JealousCookie1664,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dptgm9/cmv_you_should_stop_engaging_in_politics/,changemyview,"My view relies on 2 statements and basically goes like this, you do not have the capacity to be right with regards to political matters in a non-luck-based systematic manner and being wrong in and of itself can cause you to become a bad person therefore you should stop having political opinions unless absolutely necessary in order to stop being wrong and by extension avoid being bad, until you are certain that you have found a rigorous way to be right about any political belief you may have almost 100% of the time.

First let me explain my first statement: (you do not have the capacity to be right with regards to political issues in a systematic non-luck-based manner). 

You may think your opinions are correct but that‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt get out of your own head, statistically speaking a large percentage of the average person‚Äôs political opinions are wrong and you are probably the average person meaning a large percentage of what you think is right is wrong, this would not happen if you had a systematic way of being right. So you almost definitely don‚Äôt have a systematic way of being right when you form political opinions.  

Onto my second statement which is that being wrong in and of itself can make you a bad person.

Think of the 9/11 suicide bombers according to their set of beliefs what they were doing was extremely noble they were sacrificing their lives and dying for their cause and deity. The only reason the 9/11 bombers are bad people is because fundamentalist Islam is not true their badness is dependent on this fact. So clearly the wrongness of a belief alone can make you a bad person.

Therefore by engaging in politics there‚Äôs a high chance you will form wrong opinions and then as a result be a bad person.

Think of all the people who voted for hitler in Germany, you could be wrong just like them and not know it.

I used to be heavily engaged in politics but then I realised lized my way of coming to conclusions wasn‚Äôt effective at making them correct so I stopped reading the news and completely disengaged from politics.

Think of the opinions of old people about contemporary issues, more likely than not they are horrendous, the only way to not be wrong like them is to not have opinions, or to have correct opinions, and if you know a way to have provably correct opinions exclusively please let me know.

1: Julian Assange is a Russian asset. There is literally zero real evidence for this claim. This is an extremely bad faith conspiracy theory based entirely on the fact that he exposed Hilary Clinton. He has, again, zero ties to Russia and there is not a single shred of evidence that he has done anything on behest of the Russian government.

2: American soldiers and Iraqi informants were killed as a result of Wikileaks publishing. Could you make an argument that some of the information released was potentially dangerous and should have been redacted? Absolutely. Did a single person die as a result of that publication of documents? No. Independent investigators/journalists as well as the US government have confirmed, no one was killed as a result of Julian Assange‚Äôs leaks.

3: Julian Assange is a rapist. Well he isn‚Äôt in jail for rape, so he shouldn‚Äôt stay there for it without due process. For clarity, the accusation is that he had consensual sex with two women in Sweden, however he was not wearing a condom and they had thought he was. He immediately agreed to cooperate with Swedish authorities if they had agreed to not turn him over to America after the investigation concluded. 

Julian Assange sacrificed his freedom to expose the crimes of the most powerful.  He exposed unfathomable levels of corruption. Exposed war crimes. He made me and the world less ignorant.

I think if Trump wins, we'll get maybe a little more economic freedom for a few years (while losing some social freedoms), and then we'll have to cope with a borderline dictatorial executive branch moving forward. People are willing to vote for this because they're desperate for some ability to earn a good living, which I get. It's *absolutely not* worth the price long term though.

I don't really want to vote for Biden though. I might, but Biden is a profoundly boring, aged Democrat, and likely has cognitive problems (as does Trump - but still). He loves regulating random stuff ""for the environment,"" and does not think people deserve to make simple decisions for themselves like deciding whether to give themselves a vaccine or go grocery shopping during a pandemic.

0,2024-06-27,CMV: The recent cultural trend in gaming focusing on challenge runs and time locked formats shows that the last 15 years or so have been underwhelming accross all industries.,u/erutan_of_selur,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dpxe8x/cmv_the_recent_cultural_trend_in_gaming_focusing/,changemyview,"Just so we have some standardization for this topic here are a few examples of things I mean accross the spectrum:

1.)Alternate formats in Trading Card games. In MTG you have EDH which has overtaken competitive play and has begun to dictate at least some product design in Magic. Similar examples would be GOAT or Edison in YGO in addition to the popularization of things like Progression series runs and the Juniour Journey format.

2.)In MMORPGs things like Area Locked or Tileman accounts in Runescape, or Solo Self Found runs in MMORPGs like WoW or FFXIV. Oh and of course time-sealed expansion content such as classic WoW.

3.)In single player entries like Fallout where players try to add as much superfluous tedium and dimensionality to the game to resemble a deeper challenge. ""Can you beat Single Player game with only a XYZ?"" type content has been running amok.

4.)Nuzlocke runs and further Kaizo Nuzlocke runs. Pokemon Single player gameplay has actually gotten so tedious that people have worked out the AI into a complex slot machine to try and extract entertainment out of it.


Now, I understand that holistically within each of these communities these are probably anywhere from 1-5% of total players. But if you took 1-5% of total players from every aspect of the gaming industry that's a much, much bigger percentage of people who are all basically admitting to themselves on some level that the game they are playing is not very fun to them, and then they have to add so many self imposed challenges to get a modicum of enjoyment out of the game. To me this speaks to a broader point that games are in fact much easier than they were 20 years ago.  In the case of time sealed or alternate formats, yes a smidge of that is nostalgia, but these communities don't persist on nostalgia alone. They are consistently attracting new people to them such that an argument of nostalgia falls short. 


To that end my view is that these types of challenges runs are an implicit acknowledgement that the base version of the game you are playing, or the live service version of the game as it exists today, really doesn't reach people the way they think it does. If the only way you're having fun with WoW is by adding tedium, it means that WoW probably isn't that fun of a game. If you're opting to play the player designed format of EDH over traditional MTG formats, it means that Wizards of the coast designed a shit game that people wanted to move on from. 

This isn't to knock emergent gameplay wholesale. I understand that communities form and then emergent gameplay deepens, and then the science of the emergent gameplay takes over as the fascinating aspect of these types of alternate playstyles. But it also means that the person who made the game originally missed the mark because the features you would have liked to see are not even on the radar of the companies you're giving money too.

Everyone likes to say that resources aren't going to the easiest possible modes to the game and that adding a ""Hard mode switch"" is a trivial addition.

I have trouble with the common knowledge that being alive is a gift, i guess when you‚Äôre hardwired for survival you‚Äôd think that‚Ä¶ however 


Some discussion about euthanasia for humans  had peaked my interest, specifically the spectrum that it implies when they say something like ‚Äúeuthanasia is for someone who is suffering‚Äù 

Wither it‚Äôs a debilitating illness or condition (be it physical or mental) 


Picture someone who suffers from debilitating pain, and how their quality of life can be terrible‚Ä¶ death is the best option, probably. 



My point is: 
When you‚Äôre alive‚Äîregardless of the quality‚Äî you‚Äôre subjected to a wide array of experiences and emotions that ranges from bad to good. I don‚Äôt think the good is a reason enough to endure the bad. 

Even those with debilitating illnesses can justify that in the future we will have treatments, cures, answers whatever it is, you can extend the same logic to and it will be consistent. 

‚Äúgood, and bad‚Äù quality of life is extremely subjective, but being dead means you will not endure anything. 

How is that worse? 

Why stay alive for potentially good then bad then good then bad? When you can just end the cycle?

0,2024-06-27,"CMV: I that the death penalty is more humane and efficient than life in prison, and that death by Firing Squad or Standard Drop hanging is more humane and efficient than lethal Injection.",u/Salty-Dig-8127,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dpyrjc/cmv_i_that_the_death_penalty_is_more_humane_and/,changemyview,"For context I am an American who is talking about this in the context of American prisons, my opinions are quite different for those in Nordic Prisons. 

So my view is decided by a couple of things, firstly I believe that the purpose of justice is not fundamentally to punish people, but instead to maintain social cohesion, by attempting to PREVENT crimes via punishing offenders, to discourage similar crimes. Eg ‚ÄúMen are not hung for stealing horses, they are hung so that horses will not be stolen‚Äù. Putting a man in prison for life is a strong punishment that makes the prisoner‚Äôs life suck (at least it can) but from the point of view of discouraging crime, the death penalty is a stronger disincentive (admittedly only for non suicidal people). To me putting people in prison for life without parole is more about trying to punish an individual rather than acting to prevent future crimes, which I acknowledge is the intended goal, however I feel that this purpose is incorrect and a waste. For example it costs roughly to $140,000 to imprison someone for just 1 year, as opposed to the price of an execution, which when taken with my second claim, and allowing some rather sardonic math, can be done for price of 1-7 person(s) hourly wages plus 1-7 rounds of ammunition would come to at most 750 dollars, assuming a quite high hourly wage of 100 dollars. Paired perhaps with the cost of incineration or burial as per the family or states preferment, might come to at most 5,000 which might not even have to be paid for by the state.

Now for the most obvious counter-argument ‚Äúwhat about innocent people?‚Äù This is a serious concern but I see there being 2 mitigating factors. Firstly the Death Penalty is treated with the procedural care it deserves, taking years and often decades to go through, so if someone is to be exonerated they will likely have plenty of time to do so.
Secondly should this long of a period pass, say 20 years, which is about the average, the prisoner is most likely, as far as society and the prisoners ability to reintegrate into it, far beyond any ability to find meaning or fulfillment in life.

 American prisons are horrible and no one can spend time in one and not be broken. A prisoner will either be completely isolated causing significant mental emotional and even physical problems to person, or they will have socialized only with other criminals. There‚Äôs a saying ‚Äúif you want to become a professional criminal go to prison‚Äù. So either a person comes out a broken shell of a person, or as a hardened criminal with a legitimate grudge. If a person were to be imprisoned in 2004 and released in 2024, they will have no non criminal friends, no work history, no experience, no money, and be completely unattuned to modern technology and life, and we expect them to not fall into poverty and or crime? Essentially at that point the state has made a massive mistake with no real way to rectify it. Obviously if someone is exonerated after 20 years that‚Äôs great and they should be released but if someone has been in the system for 20+ years, is executed and then exonerated, that sucks that‚Äôs horrible, but the person is probably better off.

My second claim is the one I suspect will be far less controversial. Most people today understand the massive flaws with lethal injection. I know that if I were to executed, there are at least 3 ways I would prefer before lethal injection, firing squad my personal favorite, (what a silly concept, a favorite execution method), standard drop hanging which when performed well instantly kills the person by breaking the neck, as opposed to slowly strangling them, or the Guillotine which again, when done well is instant. I would only prefer lethal inject over electrocution, strangulation, or the gas chamber.
Again I feel this will be less controversial but I‚Äôll still seek to justify it. The methods which I have described as preferable are instant death, cheap, and fairly easy to perform. As opposed to lethal injection which is none of these. I think that we deemed lethal injection to be more humane simply because it looks more modern and scientific, even though by all accounts it is terribly painful and quite slow for what it is, not even including the massive logistical and technical problems related to it. Which as opposed to my listed methods can be done be by even the most impoverished municipality, or prison.
This is my first time on this sub so I apologize if I have made any errors in formatting or logic, but as I know I am in the minority opinion I would very genuinely like to be convinced to the majority position."

Biden has to convince voters that he's up to the job mentally, which is important because the other party has been lobbing a non-stop barrage of insults about his health. But they've reversed course in the last week or so, demanding drug tests and other silliness in case he makes their candidate look bad. 

Trump has to convince voters that he's tuned into the world we all actually live in and not some fantasy land in which the US economy is collapsing, we're not the world's biggest oil producer, and Vladimir Putin is on a mission to de-nazify the world and Joe Biden is both a doddering old fool and the mastermind of vast criminal empire stretching from Delaware to Beijing. 

While many voters are dug into their positions, pollsters insist that [as many as 20% of voters are undecided](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/). The undecided folks are probably looking for fitness and sanity. 

I expect this to be the most consequential debate in US history, or at least since Kennedy/Nixon. Change my view. "

But the ridiculous unbelievable scenarios were allegories for something much more real. It uses an attention grabbing movie cliche to bring attention to a real issue. That the France government officials are so out of touch with reality that they believe the prestige the olympics will bring is worth the massive financial loss during a critical point for a potential financial crisis.

Spending over a BILLION dollars to clean the seine when the country had a budget decline of 6 billion in the past year. That level of absurdity is rightly represented in the movie by the mayor choosing to host a triathlon with killer sharks in the river. Shes so out of touch and overly concerned with money and status that she's unable to see what is truly at stake: everything. The animal rights protestors were representative of far left protestors and their misguided activism, such as the climate protestors who vandalize various monuments. 

I also liked how in the last 5 minutes of the movie everything got exponentially worse and worse because I think its representative of how a true climate crisis would play out.

0,2024-06-27,"CMV: AI art isn't stealing, just like how parody isn't stealing.",u/Afraid-Buffalo-9680,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dq1dsc/cmv_ai_art_isnt_stealing_just_like_how_parody/,changemyview,"Many people say that AI art is stealing, since it's trained from existing works without permission. However, the same is true of parody. 



For example, this \[Family Guy parody of Citizen Kane\](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILSbYH9pvjQ). This clip took elements from an existing work, but transformed it to create something new. It altered the original work significantly to provide new meaning. Despite directly using Citizen Kane, the parody is not considered stealing.



Similarly, AI art is trained using a large body of existing works. It creates things that are completely different from the images that it's trained on. Just like parody, AI art builds upon existing works, but the result is something transformative.



To elaborate on the ""transformative"" point, the AI uses the training data to fine-tune parameters for a mathematical function that turns prompts into images. There are so many parameters, and so much training data (millions of images) that the impact of a single image is negligible. If you look at the parameters, they'll look like random numbers. Can you tell me how a bunch of random numbers is copyright infringement or stealing? I can go on DeviantArt, download the first 100 (copyrighted!) images, put them into a .zip file, and then compute the sha256 of that file. I get 9D63E3EFFB9B8ED942D059829B3E77ACBA7DA1BBACC95CF18FCC09E491E1F2D6. Is this string of bits stealing or copyright infringement? Keep in mind that to generate this string of bits, I had to use copyrighted work from artists without their consent. 



You might argue lack of consent as an issue. However, \[consent isn't required for parody\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell\_v.\_Acuff-Rose\_Music,\_Inc). In the same way, I don't think that using images to train an AI requires consent either. The AI is not reproducing these images, instead, it's generating new, original content. 



So, if we accept that parody, which uses existing elements in a transformative way, isn‚Äôt stealing, why should AI art be viewed differently? "

 Very detailed: the guy Maurice knew.


I was at the 7/11 in my area. And I met a man. ( Don't know him) And I guess he just so happened to know that I was looking for a job or something. Because he starting asking me if I'm looking for a job and started to suggest a trash job for me. And he told me that he'll send the trash job to my phone. So I agreed. About 2 days later, ( I completely forgot about him and his trash job thing.) 2 days later, he texted me. Asking me if we could met up basically at the 7 11 again. So I agreed. ( It was late at night, but my friend actually wanted to me to met at the same place around the same time too. But my friend wants me to wait for him for about 4 hours in his car. 

( And of course I didn't want to do that, even though sometimes I would.) I just thought that since the man ( trash job guy) wanted to met up there. 


I thought that, it would make time go faster, if I hangout with the ( trash job guy) for a little bit until my friend finish work. ( My friend works at the 7/11.

 So I knew that I wouldn't be far. So I decided to hangout with ( trash guy) to past the time. We talked. And had alittle to drink. ( alcohol- silver Tequila) I had alittle bit, because I didn't want to do too much, because I was hanging with someone that I didn't know. 


So fastword. He asked me is it ok if he could masturbate in front of me. I told him sure. Because he wanted to. (so he can feel better, and I thought that  maybe if I let him do that then he would be ok, and we can just go back to talking.) After he did that, he asked me can I put my mouth on him. ( I didn't want to) so I told him no. ( When I told him no, I still just wanted to talk to him. Because he made me feel like I was important and that he cared about what I actually had to say.)  ( I don't have support from no one, from family, friends etc. No one.) 


But he actually made me feel important and made me feel like my pain/personal problems really matters to him. The reason why I'm saying this is because what I did next, I felt like l leaned him on.).  .... Here it goes:. So after I told him no. ( When he asked me to put my mouth on him.) He started leaning really close to me. Trying to touch my chest. And I felt uncomfortable, so I got up. And walked a few feets away from him. But I thought about ( how he made me feel and I did enjoy the conversation we was having earlier), so I decided to go back to him and I told him "" hey, huh I really enjoyed talking to you and stuff, that's all."" Something like that. And the next thing I remember was that he was trying to touch me again. ( But this time)  when I tried to get up and walk away from him. He grabbed my arm and asked me to sit down. ( I didn't want to sit down so I didn't.) Then he asked me to sit down again but in a more demanding tone. ( And I still didn't want to sit down, so I didn't.) Then he kicked the back of my left leg, causing me to fall onto his lap.and grabbed my hands in a heading position. (Where I could not move my hands as freely as I would like. then he started to touch my v-lady part. I tried to move his hand away, but he put pressure on my v-part. And I still tried to move his hand. And when he moved his hand, he tried to pull my pants down, and when he did that I pull my pants back up but then he pull it back down. At this point I started to say, "" I wanna go home, repeatedly, and then I said no. But in a really low tone.( I was actually surprised that he heard me)

Yeah I said no. But In a really low tone... And when I said it, I was on his lap at this point, and I just bend closer to my legs.Because I was really nervous to say it in a louder tone. (And since I was on his lap I guess it looks like I was bending my back to him. Which is not what I mean to make him think that I wanted him or anything..üò£üò£üò£

I just did that because ( I didn't want to sound rude or anything. And I also was to scared to say it louder. 

Tbh, it was really hard for me to be able to even say it in even in a soft low tone Way, as I did. I was really nervous and kinda scared.) 


After, I said no in a soft-low tone.

I heard him say that he was gonna put it in. And then, I felt him inside of me from behind. (But he wasn't all the way in, but in enough for me to feel it. And when I felt it, I started screaming it hurts over and over.


And then the next thing I remember was that he was trying to touch my chest again and I tried to move his hand away from my chest, but he kept putting his hands back on me. Fast-forward. I was struggling with him, and I almost fell/my body leaned on the bench. And ( I think when he saw me almost fall. He tried to force me down on the bench. And he did. My body was laying there.... But I think he heard something in the area. and just grabbed my personal bag. And took it with him.( I really needed that bag it had all my id, birth certificate, and SSn in that bag. So, of course I needed to get that. So, I followed him to the place that he went to, it was in a more darker area. But ( I didn't want to lose my personal stuff.) So I kept going. When I caught up with him, he was sitting down on another bench. And he was just sitting there. ( At this point, I didn't know what to do. I just looked at him.) And he asked me why I'm acting like that.( My body was kinda in a scared  standing position.) And he started saying stuff, that made me feel like I was overthinking the whole situation. Basically saying, "" why you being like that... And etc (so I felt stupid and I thought if I played it off,maybe we could just talk and I'll get my bag back . At least that's what I thought.) So I sat next to him, I didn't get a chance to say anything. He already touching my chest, and I tried to moved away, but he was holding me so hard that I had to struggle until we fell fall the bench. When we fell, I asked him not to hurt me. And he told me that he won't. I tried to get up and next thing I remember was that on the bench he kissed me, and then I move my face away from him. Then, I remember that he pull my pants all and started to do it to me.

I‚Äôm sure this is gonna come off as ignorant or disrespectful but i wanna preface this is simply personal feelings and not something i would turn into a physical action. i don‚Äôt think respect and physical action (such as personally telling someone about my lack of respect for them) go hand in hand anyways. 

this is more of an argument against the blanket phrases of respect towards these things.

definition of respect: a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements. 

now there‚Äôs tons of different definition but the main points seem to be either admiration and/or worthy of high regard. ‚Äôll give a few specific examples of things i don‚Äôt respect outright simply for their existence, and why i think this way. 


RELIGION - for religion i‚Äôm going to be talking about the mainstream ones, such as christianity, islam, and other religions that clearly state they are against things such as homosexuality. now we can get into some odder things about these religions like mistranslations but i don‚Äôt think those arguments have much backing and the majority of followers seem to believe that things like homosexuality are in fact a sin.  so we have a religion, that is vehemently against the act of homosexuality at its core and even if every member did not attack others for this, their existence would be a sin in itself. these beliefs are responsible for personal suffering, persecution, and actual death. i find that horrific. so why would i admire or think people who continue this rhetoric are worthy of high regard? why would i respect them if their beliefs are something i find abhorrent? 


MILITARY - now this one is harder to talk about and not come off as an insanely disgusting and hateful person but im gonna try my best to be as clear with my ideas around this as possible. ‚Äúrespect the military‚Äù, ‚Äúrespect soldiers‚Äù and phrases like that are very confusing to me. are there some soldiers that deserve praise and admiration? ofcourse, but they deserve that respect because of their character and personal actions, not because they are simply a soldier. every single military institution on this planet has done things the majority of people would find unforgivable. so if a person does things i find unforgiveable; why would i respect them outright simply because of their occupation? now i know not every soldier commits war crimes, but the majority of them have gone into wars that have in turn led to the innocent suffering of people. i don‚Äôt think most people would find that worthy of respect. now ive heard the argument of that even if we don‚Äôt agree with what they did, they still thought what they were doing was right, which i again find weird. where do we draw the line with that? at what point does a personal understanding become unjustifiable in the face of real actions? do we just respect soldiers on our side, or should we respect every soldier regardless of what they fought for because they believed what they were doing was right? 

this all boils down to my main point, what exactly is worthy of respect if i don‚Äôt have respect in the things they believe in? 

this doesn‚Äôt mean im gonna scream at a soldier or punch a christian in the head while he is praying, it just means that their beliefs aren‚Äôt worthy of respect. i‚Äôm sure they can prove in other aspects that they are personallly worthy of admiration, but i don‚Äôt think any religion or occupation that has the ability to cause harm should simply be respected outright. i don‚Äôt think those beliefs deserve anything that even resemble admiration.

ofcourse this is an opinion, but if someone finds someone beliefs unable to be respected, i don‚Äôt think they should be swayed on that belief.

I did some research and found out Hungary was partitioned between Yugoslavia, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Austria after WW1 at Versailles, and that it was signed by Hungarian officials to secede 2/3 of their land.

Later, Horthy would use this to gain popularity, saying it wasn't fair that Hungary be torn apart, losing most of its land and population. And yes, there were ethnic Hungarians in these places, so it swayed the population.

After WW2, Hungary was carved up again into the original territory after WW1, losing its new land in Slovakia and Northern Transylvania.

You could say that this also happened to Germany after WW1, but you also need to account to the fact that Hungary lost most of its Population and Resources, and now it is an insignificant country with no influence.

He's the oldest president ever and for all he knows these might be the last few years of his life, or at least it might be the last few years his health is relatively good.

Instead of spending them in peace he's running for president at a very stressful time.   
There is extreme political tension in the US and this election might be very tight, Russia is engaged in a massive war in Ukraine and its allies are in intense competition with the West - cyber attacks, military exercises, technological development.

He's got to have a televised debate with Trump, his health and everything he does is under the microscope, even a minor mistake or strange act will lead to accusations of him having dementia. This is an extremely difficult time to be president, especially for someone so old who has lost so much.

My guess is, he's running mainly because (regardless of whether he's right) he is scared of Trump and doesn't want to leave the US in his hands at this stressful time. I'm not saying if those fears are founded, but obviously that's what he believes and he's spending what could be the last few years of his life under extreme stress to do what he believes is right.

That's heroic. I think conservatives and liberals alike will come to see him as a hero in the future, somebody who spent the end of his doing a very stressful job for the benefit of the country.

I would also say that I think republicans at some point in the future will move away from Trump and possibly see him as a bad president - I'm not saying that's the case, only that I think that's what they will eventually believe and that they will see Biden as a hero for running against him."

The first opinion is the one I strongly disagree with. It is the economy is doing pretty good. They cite the low unemployment, rising wages, inflation being cut significantly since the peak 2 years ago, high stock market, etc. A poll was conducted which is often cited by this side stating most people think the economy is doing poorly while they themselves are doing fine.

My opinion and the majority opinion is that the economy is doing very bad at the moment. The data we use are higher credit card debt, lower savings rate, rising car repossessions, inflation is still high, etc. They see a horrible affordability crisis where many necessities have exploded in cost outpacing wages these things include mortgages, cars, child care, food etc. 

I believe strongly in the second opinion. In the current economy most people who didn‚Äôt own a house by mid 2022 are screwed. There are a lot of people in this economy who are doing well, but that‚Äôs because of the foundation they built before Biden economy. 

For example a homeowner might be doing well and saving $1,000 a month right now, but they can only do that because they bought their house in 2017 and refinanced in 2021. Had they bought their exact same house today their mortgage would be much higher then that $1000 their saving assuming their house appreciate the average amount. This is an economy where people with wealth are able to preserve it, people trying to build wealth are struggling to make progress, and people with no wealth who we‚Äôre struggling to get by before are still struggling just as much if not more due to the unaffordable living expenses.

Currently watching the most low-energy debate in my life. We don't hold our politicians to nearly enough scrutiny. You think the candidates are asleep? They aren't half as asleep as the mods.

Also, claims such as ""If I had been the president at the time, Russia would have never attack"" or ""If this guy is president and congress passes a bill that ban abortion nationwide, this guy will sign it, I would veto it"" should trigger an objection for speculation.

This debate is even more painful to watch than the 2020 presidential debates, and that‚Äôs really saying something.

Trump may sound more coherent in a sense but he‚Äôs dodging questions left and right, which is a terrible look, and while Biden is giving more coherent answers to a degree, it sounds like he just woke up from a nap and can be hard to understand sometimes. 

So, it seems like our main choices for president are someone who belongs in a retirement home, not the White House (Biden), and a convicted felon (Trump). While the ideas of either person may be good or bad, they are easily some of the worst messengers for those ideas.

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this but I think RFK might actually have a shot at winning the presidency, although I wouldn‚Äôt bet my money on that outcome. I am pretty confident that he might get close to Ross Perot‚Äôs vote numbers when it comes to percentages. RFK may have issues with his voice, but even then, I think he has more mental acuity at this point than either Trump or Biden.

I‚Äôll probably end up pulling the lever for the Libertarian candidate, Chase Oliver, even though I have some strong disagreements with his immigration and Social Security policy. I want to send a message to both the Republicans and the Democrats that they totally dropped the ball on their presidential picks, and because of that they both lost my vote."

Over the past few years Democrats have elected a bunch of very popular governors and Senators from the Midwest, which is the region democrats need to overperform in to win the Presidency. These include but are not limited to Jb Pritzker, Tammy Baldwin, Tammy Duckworth, Gretchen Whitmer, Gary Peters, Tony Evers, Amy Klobuchar, TIna Smith, Tim Walz, Josh Shapiro, Bob Casey, and John Fetterman.

  
A ticket that has one of both of these people, all of whom are younger than Biden (I did not Google their ages but I know that some of them are under 50 and a bunch are under 60) would easily win the region. People are tired of Trump and don't like Biden, who is too old anyway. People want new blood.

But mathematically, this makes little sense.

Assuming you vote for who you believe is ""Lesser of two evils"", for your vote to change the election result, two conditions would need to be true:

1. Your vote would need to be the one deciding vote that flips the state. In swing states odds of this are higher, but still extremely unlikely. In solid blue/red states, this is nearly impossible. 

2. Your state needs to have enough electoral votes that your state flipping changes the outcome of the election.

The odds that both of these conditions are true is difficult to exactly quantify, because it depends on so many factors. But you're more likely to die in a car accident on the way to the polling station than impact the election result. 

So overall, the only real benefit of voting is being able to say you voted and being proud of your vote. That, and local elections with small numbers of votes that you reasonably might swing.

But if you vote third party, you can send a message- that you were willing to go to the effort to vote, but neither party appealed to you, and you were willing to vote for a candidate that will not win.

This sends a message to politicians from the major parties. If 5% of voters voted for a third party, what is it your party can do to appeal to those voters? Thus even by losing, you still make a difference."

Essentially, your overall impression of a person (""He is nice!"") impacts your evaluations of that person's specific traits (""He is also smart!"").

This especially is true when considering the bias of beauty or charisma. In almost every society the individuals who are more charismatic and attractive tend to be viewed as more caring, trustworthy, intelligent...etc. Our perception of celebrities' are an excellent example of this phenomena. I have many friends who believe Taylor Swift is a caring, powerful, intelligent nigh ""perfect"" woman. If I bring up any contradictions to this, such as her dating a known racist or that she has used more fossil fuels than any other celebrity, they basically deny and subvert the reality for their perceived bias. 

This isn't a new concept. We can observe it through the ages with famous figures such as Steve Jobs and Thomas Edison. Steve Jobs didn't create any of the Apple products, nor did he actively participate in the coding or hardware development. Even in the face of that, many people thought he was a ""genius"" due to his Charismatic nature. Thomas Edison in a similar fashion, became known as ""The Father of Invention"". Edison stole and extorted patents from a multitude of other unaccredited inventors. He was a bully that threaten many less affluent and charismatic inventors with legal recourse if they did not allow him to patent their work.

There are a multitude of studies enforcing the idea that physical appearance and adhering to social norms gives you advantages over other individuals who aren't conventionally attractive or charismatic. I know that these studies don't take into consideration the individuals overall happiness and quality of life, but I feel like it has a hand in the way in which you get to those conclusions. A disadvantage no matter how it is implemented, is still a disadvantage.

My definition of success has much less to do with life satisfaction than with monetary and social gain. Success in a traditional sense is, to make financial gains, garner social clout, propel your career, be viewed as an upstanding citizen...etc.

I don't WANT it to be this way. 

I'm a reserved none conventionally attractive dude who has a thyroid issue. I hate that it's like this, but there is so much evidence to prove this as a reality that I don't see how I could deny it.

Also, spotting failures have lead to multiple deaths. The safest way to remove yourself from a danger in the event of a failed squat is 1) using safeties in a power rack; should be just below your sticking point so you can just drop a bit and that weight comes off and you can slink out. 2) bailing; if the squat is high bar or front or overhead it is very easy to simply drop the weight and move in the direction opposite the barbell. 3) two spotters on either side who can grab the plates and assist in lifting. 

The most dangerous is a single spotter coming from the back, because they are basically just grabbing the upper body and are so far behind the center of gravity, they put unnecessary stress on the lifters back and often end up pushing the weight over the lifters head. This is how many people have died squatting. 

So change my view: Its safer to have no spotter than a single spotter when performing heavy barbell squats, as there are a number of much safer ways to bail out of a failed lift. "

don't make sense. Saying that constellations look like what they are named for is pretty much always a big stretch. (Except for like the big and little dipper, because those are pretty obvious.)

We've all heard the arguments, ""You could connect any stars you want and get any picture"". - there's so many stars, it's like a page full of dots, so anyone can just connect any dots they like to make a 'picture'.

 Or, ""No you can't connect those, you have to connect the right stars!""- theres so many stars that it really highlights that even the stars selected to make the 'picture' are very particular and easy enough to confuse with the dot field that is the milky way.

Or, ""What? That's supposed to be a bear? That could be any thing with legs!"" Basically my main point that what these constilations are supposed to look like is far from what they actually do.

The amount of chemical reactions that are occurring in perfect harmony for things to function the way they do could not be randomness. It points to an intelligent mind.

I know that WV exists because they disnt want to join the confederacy but I still want to express my view because there is similar news coming out of the Southern USA. Also, the South is home to some of the most blatant scams, scam culture, and backward culture in our nation.

Not new. There was a higher profile and larger enslavement ring of Latinos in Georgia. 

My view: 

Southerners in general process less information than foreigners and Northerners. They‚Äôre not as intelligent, and they‚Äôre of a different ethnicity than most of us. They are mostly consisting of agrarian serfs of the Victorian era. They‚Äôre not sure how to behave in civilized societies and they need to be taught and instructed. Luckily they inherited a slave trade from Africa and for a short time had a more capable agrarian population working for them (by force). When that ended they still haven‚Äôt fully adapted, which is why the South is still less developed and is all but guaranteed to make political decisions that make life worse for all residents there. 

Why is there heavy industry in the South at all? Over time Northern industrialists have moved in and supplied industry but still some Southerners continue to live in the woods and believe they‚Äôre capable of being great like the Egyptians (who also had slaves).

You might say i see trump supporters because of my feed being changed for my taste but thats not the case because i tested it on incognito. i also know this is a reliable indicator because back in 2020 i saw memes and jokes on trump everywhere on social media and there was a clear preference for biden.

A good example of this is Defund The Police and ACAB (All Cops Are Bastards). Both of these sound like extreme statements and imply that democrats want to create a lawless society with no law enforcement, that is until you read more about it and find out that democrats want to reallocate police fundings into other areas. Another example is the term ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù in comparison to the term ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter.‚Äù Despite the second term often being a racist dog whistle, it‚Äôs hard to argue that on the surface, it is a much more effective branding for an idea, as it implies that every single life matters, which would encompass people of colour. The term ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù is also a much more effective term than ‚Äúpro-choice‚Äù as it implies that republicans are protecting the sanctity of a life, whereas ‚Äúpro-choice‚Äù on the surface just sounds more selfish.

Here‚Äôs why this infuriates me:

1. **Settlement Expansion**: Since Rabin's death, the increase in settlements in the West Bank has been outrageous. These land grabs are blatantly illegal under international law, and they crush any hope for a future Palestinian state. This land grabbing is still an ongoing blight on any peace efforts. [link ](https://www.timesofisrael.com/smotrich-recorded-describing-mega-dramatic-plan-for-civilian-control-over-west-bank/)
2. **Political Shifts**: Israeli politics have veered sharply to the right. Leaders like Netanyahu don‚Äôt even bother hiding their disdain for a two-state solution. Most of the ministers in power are so extreme that they‚Äôre practically salivating at the thought of exiling the remaining Palestinians from their lands.
3. **Military Operations**: The sheer number of military operations in Gaza and the West Bank since 1995 is staggering. These brutal operations have caused immense suffering and destruction, making the occupation even more entrenched. It feels like peace is a joke to them.
4. **Legislative Actions**: Laws like the Nation-State Law from 2018 are an insult to any notion of a two-state solution. This legislation blatantly prioritizes Israel‚Äôs Jewish identity over any Palestinian aspirations, effectively pushing them aside like they don‚Äôt even matter.
5. **Stagnant Peace Process**: Despite all the so-called peace talks and negotiations, nothing has changed. Settlement expansion and on-the-ground actions make it crystal clear that Israel isn‚Äôt interested in any real agreement.
6. **International Relations**: The Abraham Accords and other diplomatic moves are a slap in the face. They‚Äôve normalized relations with several Arab countries while completely ignoring the Palestinian issue. The focus has shifted so far away from solving the conflict with the Palestinians that it‚Äôs sickening.

  
**Hebron Protocol (1997)**: Divided Hebron into H1 (Palestinian control) and H2 (Israeli control). This created a fragmented, unlivable mess for Palestinians.

**Wye River Memorandum (1998)**: Promised redeployments but kept key areas under Israeli control, isolating Palestinian territories into non-contiguous blocks.

**Camp David Summit (2000)**: Proposed a fragmented Palestinian state with Israeli settlement blocs and security zones, making any real statehood impossible.

**Taba Summit (2001)**: Detailed more of the same‚Äîfragmented Palestinian areas under a patchwork of control.

**Road Map for Peace (2003)**: Phased plan kept Israel in control of significant West Bank areas, turning Palestine into disconnected cantons.

**Annapolis Conference (2007)**: Yet another division proposal, with Israel retaining major settlement blocs, slicing up Palestinian territories.

**Kerry Initiative (2013-2014)**: Proposed maps with land swaps left Palestinians with fragmented, non-contiguous territories.

**Trump's ""Deal of the Century"" (2020)**: Outright insult‚Äîannexing settlements and the Jordan Valley, leaving Palestinians with isolated enclaves under Israeli control.

  
Every so-called peace deal fragments Palestinian land, making statehood a joke. It‚Äôs clear that Israel is not interested in a viable Palestinian state.

The same goes for some Palestinian leaders who would like to see the distraction of the Jewish state. however, people here argue that Israel tried to make a deal or help Palestinians to have their own state and I call that bullshit.

personally, I would like Hamas to go and the Palestinian Authority (PA) to control Gaza so at the least the current Israeli government won't have a so-called ""asset"" terrorist group in the leadership there to use as a scapegoat to kill and dehumanise innocent people. 

Also to add if they are currently doing god's work in Gaza then allow News media to do their work and let the world be the judge of that.

But then we can apply the same logic to woman having preference for taller men.

0,2024-06-29,CMV: The early timing and shotty performance of the Biden-Trump debate on Biden's part were all part of the plan. ,u/godlike_hikikomori,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dr8tzh/cmv_the_early_timing_and_shotty_performance_of/,changemyview,"

This might be a bit of a far fetched hunch, but the early timing and  shotty performance of this debate on Biden's part might have been part of the plan all along. I mean.... why would Biden and his team decide to set up a debate  with Trump if they thought he wasn't entirely confident? Why would he do this if he thought this would be shooting himself in the foot? None of this really adds up, and there wasn't even supposed to be a debate for this election in the first place. 

The strategy may be to let Biden appear like the weak and worn old man that the media speculated he is, and purposely get the Democratic party all riled up and panic to feel like the underdogs earlier in the election cycle. Provide Biden and Democrats with enough time to recover but also enhance that sense of urgency and panic they all felt in 2020 and 2022. Let Trump keep exposing the liar and narcissist he really is. Now, I do believe Biden really isn't as sharp as he was; and he definitely isn't the same person prior to 2020.  Really, that just comes with age.But, I also don't believe that he is the dementia/Alzheimer's patient that many pundits paint him as. 


You know what. I had an ""aha moment"" when I just recalled the old saying that ""complacency is a democracy's greatest enemy."" And, complacency is the key word here. 

If my memory serves me right, the main reason why Democrats lost so much in 2016 is this notion of complacency and inevitability they had with Hillary. Voter  turnout was quite low at all levels. Same thing with the 2010 and 2014 midterms where the public expected to see change without really participating in it, because there was this sense of complacency that Obama alone will set things right.  I know this sounds like copium, but I believe this whole strategy was concocted in secret by Biden, the top brass of his cabinet, and his inner circle. Multiple sources state that he's had private meetings days leading up to the debate regarding campaign strategy with Obama and some other key figures. I just find it a bit odd that none of the key figures, not even Bernie, is bashing and dissuading  Biden after his bad debate.  Hopefully, Biden & Co . know what they are doing to ensure a victory over Trump.

Anyways, I'm open to anyone else sharing their insights regarding my rationale. Whether or not he, his team, or his party made a genuine mistake on their part is up in the air, but there is no doubt there is now a heightened level of panic and much less complacency now within the party. One comforting yet very odd development is that the horrible debate didn't seem to fracture the Democrats at all, since Bernie and other progressive figures still appear to support Biden's candidacy.

The bottom line is: democracy is as good as people's willingness to participate in it in good faith and in a well informed manner. It will rot from the inside if neglected long enough. It may be likely that the top down strategy might be to stir up participation by raising the stakes and panic level to an all time high to get as many people to participate.

Full disclosure: I'm an RFK Jr. voter (who voted Dem going in 2020), and I'm gonna stand behind that going into November. I'm well versed with his stances, his history, flaws and strengths. If reading that is enough to get you to dismiss what I'm about to say, then by all means, don't waste your time reading this. It's a free country after all.

That being said, here's the way I see things.
___________________________

The Democratic party had RFK who wanted to run and stay as a Democrat, and was pointing out the weaknesses in the Democratic platform (as well as Biden's other weaknesses against Trump) from the beginning, and the DNC smeared and chased him out the door, as well as screwed him in the New Hampshire and Iowa primaries.

They had Dean Philips and Marianne Williamson, both well liked with the Democrat base and moderates/independents, and the DNC canceled primaries and bullied them into the abyss as well.

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Donald Trump was the best thing that happened to the Democratic party, because his presence allowed them to gaslight, bully and abuse their own voters into accepting whatever they give them without the DNC doing a damn thing to deserve their prolonged support. Using him as a Boogeyman to scare their voters out of holding them accountable by either voting existing leadership out or voting elsewhere.

I'm an independent, but I've always wanted Democrats to genuinely succeed. Not just by winning in elections, but by actually doing right by their constituents and even those that don't vote for them, because this country belongs to every American, not just those who voted for whichever party is in power. But the modern Democratic party establishment is lazy, stubborn, and actively torpedoes likable candidates with actual crossover appeal with moderates and even conservatives, and instead prefers to act entitled to votes or if they're feeling generous, shameless empty pandering/virtue signaling without any real action.

And to add insult to injury, instead of taking the opinions of their disillusioned voter base seriously, instead they opt to dismiss and shit on anyone who isn't lock step with the party leadership, which is how 2016 happened, and actively do whatever they can to [chase alternatives off the board](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/dnc-war-third-party-candidates-rcna143290) in the name of ‚Äútrying to save democracy‚Äù, in order to do their half in locking Americans into a horrific matchup that [70 plus percent of voters didn't want](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/25/2024-trump-biden-presidential-rematch). And how do they respond to the discontent this time? [Telling us to stfu and accept our abominable spoonful](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2024/04/03/hillary-clinton-fallon-interview-biden-trump-stephen-a-smith-nn-vpx.cnn)


Personally, I think that RFK still has a path to the White House, but it also isn't lost on me that we could very well get Trump again, and I hate that shit. And it's not my fault, your  fault, or any other voter's fault. Nor is it third party candidates' fault, nor that of their voters. It is solely the fault of a Democratic party that fumbled the bag. Voting is the sovereign right of the people to voice their opinions of officials that are elected to serve their interests, period. If they didn't do a good job in office, they don't fucking deserve our vote. That‚Äôs. Fucking. Democracy. But instead of taking that lesson to heart every time they lose power, instead they turn around and gaslight us voters into believing that it's *our* fault for putting our foot down, instead of handing them the renewed keys to a kingdom they didn‚Äôt earn nor deserve.

The bar was set so fucking low since 2016, and they still want to fucking play limbo.


TL;DR: The Democratic party had ample opportunity over 3 election cycles to become a better party that the majority of the nation could have faith in and believe in. Instead, once they realized how easy it was to sit back on their laurels and coast, while using the fear of Donald Trump to bully their voters into submission and blind loyalty, they now can't be bothered to actually give a shit. And when they don't get their way, they point the finger at their voters for trying to hold them accountable.

And yes, I am aware local politics are far more important than the voting populace realizes, and wouldn't hold it against anyone for leaving the President bubble on the ballot blank, while voting on everything else.

You can change my view by showing me that the DNC *has* been listening to their voters, hasn't been dismissive of the complaints of moderates and their base, hasn't become lazy and complacent, and hasn't been acting entitled to voter support without doing enough to earn voter's confidence."

Although she might not be the most liked or best candidate there is truly no one else that makes sense to replace Biden on the ticket if he decides to step down.

To start off she is part of the administration currently. This is key for a couple of reasons. First of all she provides continuity of the ticket. It makes it easier for Biden to step back and say he will focus on governing the country and allow Harris to continue his administration's progress. 

She also provides continuity of the administration and the easy messaging of her campaign. The only other nationally electable candidate in the administration is probably Mayor Pete but he cannot match the experience of the other likely candidates.

Of all the candidates she is the only one that makes sense in terms of party unity. Do you think Josh Shapiro or Gretchen Whitmer will be ok with nominating Newsome without a primary, and vice versa if it were to be one of them. Harris' role as VP puts her at an advantage over challengers being upset that they were not chosen.

Electability wise she might not be the best candidate but of the voters who already know they will not vote for her were most likely not going to vote for Biden anyway. She doesn't have to take the same amount of time to build national credibility like Whitmer or Shapiro and she does not really have a lot of actual baggage."

However, college campuses are not ideologically diverse. A large majority of college students and professors are left leaning with liberal views. A college student or professor with right leaning conservative views is few and far between.

Colleges being a place where people discuss ideas, thoughts, and information as its main function, doesn‚Äôt it seem odd that a majority of the people participating all have the same liberal core beliefs? Wouldn‚Äôt people with the same core beliefs discussing things just lead to confirmation bias and lack of personal growth?

Also, according to Gallup polls, 37% of Americans are moderate, 36% are conservative, and 25% are liberal. If a college is going to claim to be diverse, shouldn‚Äôt its student/professor population somewhat reflect the national percentages?

Shouldn‚Äôt ideological diversity be one of the most important types of diversity in a place where ideology is discussed so frequently? 

College students and professors are extremely liberal and left leaning, meaning they are not ideologically diverse. Yes, there are some non-liberal, non-left leaning students and professors but that group is much smaller. Which is not reflective of the national averages. "

However, when we say ""gender affirming care"", the right interprets this as ""omg bottom surgery for five year olds."" Of course, this is not what we mean, but because ""gender-affirming care"" is so ambiguous, it CAN include bottom surgery, so the right can jump to that conclusion easily. Instead, we should be more specific about what we recommend for five year olds (specifically, not surgery lol)

2. ""Sex workers."" Sex work is work. I see the value of having an inclusive title such as ""sex work"" that can include a number of different types of sex work. However, the struggles a model who only does cam work has and the types of support they need are very different from what a street prostitute has and needs.  Having an umbrella term is useful but we do not use the specific terms when we should.

I of course realize that law and especially family dynamics are different in each country, so here I am talking primarily about the western world where both parties typically have access to gainful employment and control of their finances. 

With that in mind, things change. If you marry rich, you‚Äôll live rich - but it shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise to anyone that those riches disappear in case of divorce since they came with the other person. Even in the event that you are not at fault, life is unpredictable and nobody is owed a certain lifestyle above what you can provide for yourself.

I do believe an exception should be made for stay-at-home-parents (not spouses!) who usually halt their careers and income opportunities with the understanding that the other party will provide. But even then the alimony should be paid either in the amount of what the SAHP missed during the rearing of children (based on their previous employment) or for a very limited time (a year or so) to give the parent the opportunity to find employment and appropriate child care. Of course child support will not factor in this, as it‚Äôs a separate payment alltogether. 

It generally seems very strange and unfair to me that a person who no longer wishes to be in a relationship with another person should pay for their luxuries going forward, especially since relationships are supposed to be partnerships and marriage generally has nothing to do with employment or earning opportunities.

I don't want the nazis coming of hiding as they have done recently. I don't want someone who refers to ethnic groups as rats or animals; that's always the first step in an ethnic cleansing event. I don't want any of that at all! 

But holy hell, Reddit is absolutely demented on their take after that last debate. I don't sincerely think that Joe Biden is capable of being president at this time, physically or mentally. I think it was plenty evident that he's struggling to put together coherent ideas and even getting to the stage and talking requires deliberate effort on his part. His health is a REAL concern for anyone who needs to govern on such a stressful world stage where the slightest failure or fault of character can absolutely ruin global relations and more. 

I've seen way too many posts saying that even though Biden is clearly physically unfit, that they would vote for literally a steaming pile of dog shit or a dead corpse over Trump. Though I agree that literally any other candidate would be a better alternative than Trump, I think it's absolutely demented to think that someone who clearly doesn't have his bearings can actually hold such a position of power and have a positive affect on a global stage. 

The only one thing that Trump said during the debate that wasn't a flat out lie is that other world leaders need to respect the USA otherwise violent acts of war will continue. It's true that a lot of world conflicts have escalated in the last 4 hours and that they have ALL been handled absolutely terribly. The US can't be the world police and also weak at the same time, unfortunately. 

If Biden supporters has any sense at all, they would consider voting 3rd party or even supporting a new democratic nominee. HELL, I would literally vote for anyone else that they put on that stage other than Trump, but they should at the very least have a pulse. 

It's so clear that Reddit is pushing a narrative that things ""aren't as bad as they seem"" with the egregious number of half truth articles being posted like ""undecided voters will vote Biden"" when referring to a group of 10 random Latinos. Or posts saying that they would put a corpse in office before they put in Trump. They are digging their heels in the sand to stand against one man without realizing that the way they are going about it is absolutely wrong. It's delusion at best, and willful ignorance at worst. 

It is my opinion that as a group we should come together and decide who IS the best alternative. Whether that be a 3rd party or another nominee. This year I will absolutely not be voting Trump or Biden. I think if enough people make this singular change just this one time it would show the two party system that we are sick of their manipulations and lies. Both parties are out to get power and screw the American population over. We need to send a message to BOTH parties because neither one actually has the interest of America in mind. If we actually have a reasonable discussion we could make a change starting this year, but we have to stop being DELUSIONAL. Biden is NOT fit for presidency. 

My mind could be change in one of the following two ways. If you could demonstrate that a physically and mentally unfit president can govern during such stressful times at a global scale. Alternatively, I could be convinced if you tell me why no alternative confidante at all  is a reliable option in opposing Trump.

So artificallly inflated house prices allowed them to sell up and live in the shires while preaching ""diversity"" to anyone too poor to be able to follow them. 

Cheap, mass migrant labour that undermines the working class, first from Eastern Europe and now from poorer parts of the world was celebrated by the trustafarians who got cheap nannies/builders/take away drivers etc and if you suffered any economic/social consequences and didn't appreciate that, you were called a Nazi. 

Advocating for equality regardless of race, sex, sexuality etc was considered bigotry and it was replaced by calling everything the white patriarchy (which distracts from the economic privilege they all benefit from of course). 

Integrating and becoming part of British culture to cement community relations was exchanged for pretending there is no British culture, but if there is it's entirely about imperialism and colonialsm so everyone should adopt a neo-segregationist mentality. Thus keeping the poorer in society divided.

Sexism and homophobia is accepable if you come from certain religious backgrounds. Crime is OK as long as it only affects the poorer people. Screaming about causes on social media is considered ""activism"", rather than ever actually helping anyone ever. 

The toxic combination of economic self interest and US-style identity politics has led to one of the most insidious political tribes in living memory. One that genuinely seems to think it is progressive and advancing society while actively doing everything to atomise, undermine, incite and gaslight for the ulimate sake of money, whether they consciously realise it or not. .

I think most people would agree that the man is not guilty of a crime. Suppose further, the man waits eleven seconds and then shoots the assailant again, killing him. Is the man guilty of murder?

What if we were to find out that the man's mother was an alcoholic who while drinking during her pregnancy, caused developmental delays in the man's brain. As a child, he showed poor impulse control and a violent disposition. Suppose further, during childhood, the man was subject to physical and sexual abuse, ending up a homeless prostitute by 13. In addition, the man had been stabbed by an attacker a week before killing the assailant.

As a jury member, would you find the man guilty of premeditated murder?

Genes coupled with environment determine our behavior, where environment includes both the internal environment we are subject to invitro as well as our environment after we are born. At least that is the position of Robert Sapolsky in his book *Determined*. 

If you believe in cause and effect, you have to acknowledge that each behavior has a cause (genes and environment). That cause is beyond our control and therefore is not a choice.

Imagine this scenario: it‚Äôs 3 AM, NORAD receives alerts that the United States is in imminent danger from a nuclear attack from Russia. The secret service must now wake up the president and he must choose how to respond. No staffer or competent military general gets to make this decision, it ultimately rests on Biden‚Äôs shoulders.

She didn‚Äôt ‚Äútaint‚Äù it. RBG utterly destroyed her legacy with her selfish, self centered, and short sighted decision to not step down from her seat on the Supreme Court in 2014 when the Democrats held both the White House and Senate and could have replaced her with a liberal justice. 

At the time she was 81 years old and had suffered from multiple health issues, including an episode of pancreatic cancer, which is THE deadliest kind of cancer, in 2009. Given her age, health issues, and the fact the Democrats were widely projected to lose control of the Senate in the 2014 mid term elections, a lot of people thought that, to help protect and preserve a lot of the things she had spent her life fighting for, including ‚ÄúRoe v. Wade‚Äù, that she should step down when a younger liberal successor could have been appointed instead of leaving it up to fate. 

Despite all that was at stake, she decided to ignore those pleas and suggestions and remain on the Supreme Court. Supposedly she wanted to stay on long enough to be replaced by Hillary when she became President and also expressed a wish to emulate Justice Louis Brandeis's service of nearly 23 years. 

Of course we know what happened next. The Democrats did lose the Senate in 2014, Trump got elected in 2016, Mitch McConnell blew up the filibuster to get Neil Gorsuch confirmed to Scalia‚Äôs seat and, despite her firm belief that Pilates made her immune to to the certainly of death, RBG died just short of the 2020 election which restored the Democrats to the White House and Senate majority and, as a result, were now destined to see Amy Coney Barrett‚Äôs smug face on the court for the next 30-40 years. 

I‚Äôve heard all the bullshit excuses from the RBG fan club like she deserved to go out on ‚Äúher terms‚Äù, that she couldn‚Äôt have possibly known what would happen in 2016, and that, even though she looked frail as hell, she was actually some kind of super woman due to her workout routine. 

And all I have to say to that is: Bullfuckingshit. 

RBG wasn‚Äôt an idiot and she knew that, given the delicate balance of the court, that conservatives would absolutely do anything necessary to flip her seat if given the chance. She could have left when there was a 100% chance her seat would have been filled by a liberal successor, or leave it up to the fates. For a bunch of purely selfish, self centered motives, she chose the latter, and tens of millions of others have paid the price for her hubris and stupidity. 

As we saw once again with this week‚Äôs SCOTUS decisions, the court is absolutely hell bent on continuing to destroy and progress from the last 50 years and, with a 6-3 conservative majority, there is absolutely nothing that can stop them. 

Is RBG the only one responsible for this? Of course not. 

Did her decision to not retire in 2014 play a HUGE role in all of this? Absolutely. 

Should she have known better? Hell fucking yes she should have and the fact she didn‚Äôt and played such a huge role in allowing the GOP do finally achieve their goal of a far right enough majority to carry out their plans unopposed had totally destroyed her legacy of what she accomplished while alive. 

In the end she faced the ultimate choice and she failed miserably. 

I held back for a long time because of how sensitive some people are on protecting the hagiography of RBG, but I don‚Äôt fucking care anymore. She‚Äôs dead, and the rest of us have to live with the consequences of her decisions. So I don‚Äôt want to hear anymore of this ‚Äúnotorious RBG‚Äù crap, or the fact she wore little lace neck garments, or how she said ‚ÄúI dissent‚Äù a lot, or any of the other supposed ‚Äúrock star‚Äù things she said or did. She was just another flawed human being who was given to her own self interest. And, as we saw again this week, those flaws have had disastrous consequences for countless people with more to come in the future.

In Game 7 of the 1962 playoffs vs Boston, Wilt ""only"" scored 22 points (7/15 FGs and 8/9 FTs), had 22 rebs and 3 assists.

Wilt haters love to point out how Wilt averaged 50 PPG that season... of course he didn't even average 40 ( 39,7) vs Boston with Russell playing (who had Russell to slow him down and they used the full court press to keep the ball away from Wilt). He averaged 33,6 PPG on great efficiency in the playoff series. 6 points less than in the regular season, BUT he played stronger defense and rookie Meschery was on fire and Wilt had more scoring help (during the regular season, he asked for more help, but Gola told him that they will just go to him because he played great).

Back to Game 7.

The newspaper (which was generally very unfriendly towards Wilt, in some cases even disgustingly unfair) said that, even though Wilt only scored 22 points, he was outstanding on defense and as a team player.

Not only that.

Philly (The Warriors) was 5 down, 50 seconds to go, and Wilt tied the game by scoring 5 straight points.

To tie it, he grabbed the offensive reb and made a 3-point play.

Then, as Meschery put it, someone messed up in defense and Sam Jones had the ball for the game winner. He was alone tnx to Russell's pick.

Wilt tried to fix that defensive mistake and went after Jones. Jones said that Wilt looked like a mountain going after him, but he managed to get a shot off over Wilt. Jones thought it was a bad shot and thought it will not go in. But it did.

The Boston time keeper then stole 2 seconds and left only 1 more second for Philly, which of course wasn't enough to tie the game.

Boston was exhausted after the 7-game series. They admitted that it was the toughest series they ever played.

What kind of a hater do you have to be to shayt on Wilt for this one?

The guy played great defense, great team ball and was clutch as hell.

If anything, both these teams deserve great credit for giving the fans such an awesome and hard fought playoff series.

I wish we could watch all of it.

Game 7 wasn't the only crazy game either.

Wilt went nuts in clutch time to decide Game 2 and Game 4 as well.

NBA fans really need to respect such performances instead of looking for ways to discredit a great player.

They also need to understand that every game is different.

To have such a great Game 7 and still get mad shayt for it just tells you how great Wilt was.

For example. How did MJ do in elimination Game 3 vs Boston after scoring 63 points in Game 2?

Not bad, but he got nowhere near 60 (he scored 19 points on 8/18 FGs and 2/3 FTs and had 5 turnovers. He also fouled out. He did have 1 3-pointer, 10 rebs, 9 assists, 2 steals and 1 block though) and Boston really didn't let him score.

I don't see anyone doubting MJ's greatness because of that game...

And Wilt played waaaaay better in comparison.

But that's the problem.

Wilt isn't competing against other greats. He is competing against expectations that people had for him!

It wasn't enough just to play better than anyone else then or ever...

Messed up."

Where did that come from? Why did that just occur?"" That is a whole hierarchy of questions. Why did that occur? You're asking which parts of the brain did or didn't do something in the last half-second. But you're also asking something about the sensory stimuli for that individual in the prior minutes. Were they terrified? Were they stressed, aroused, hungry, sleepy, whatever? Because that's going to affect how your brain is responding to stuff. But you're also asking, ""What about your hormone levels this morning?"" Because that's going to have been shaping how sensitive your brain was to various environmental stimuli. What were your last years like in terms of trauma, finding love, finding God, etc. You will get major changes in brain function and structure in response to experience like that. 



And then there's adolescence, childhood, fetal life, your genes. You also have to consider what kind of culture your ancestors came up with, (what kind of ecosystems they were living in). Because the culture in which your mother was raised will influence her mothering style and you. So why did that person just do what they did? Because of everything from one second ago to millennia ago, all of these influences.



There's two key punchlines. The first one is, when you look at the amount of our behavior that all of those prior events encompass, what you conclude is we are nothing more than the sum of our biological luck over which we had no control and its interactions with the sum of our environmental luck, which we also had no control over.



The second key point is something deeper than the idea that if you examine enough different disciplines, one -ology after another, you‚Äôre bound to eventually find one that provides an answer, falsifying free will all by itself. It is also deeper than the idea that even though each discipline has a hole that precludes it from falsifying free will, at least one of the other disciplines compensates for it. No, the key point is all of these different disciplinary approaches merge into one. You're talking about genes and behavior. If you're doing that, by definition, you're talking about millions of years of evolution of your genes, and you're also talking about what your childhood was like when experiences then were causing lifelong epigenetic changes in your gene regulation. And you're also talking about what proteins your brain were making on the direction of your genes 25 minutes ago. When you look at how it forms this one continuous arc of influences, my two cents is there's not a crack anywhere in that edifice in which you could shoehorn in free will."

Many are suggesting he drop out, but there is no  current nationally recognized, and viable, alternative that will be able to shift public perception of the Democratic candidate to make a meaningful difference.

Having said that, there is one person who still has enough political goodwill and is widely regarded as a capable leader: President Obama. While he is not able to run directly as President, there is no law preventing his running as Biden‚Äôs Vice President. Not only would this quell any concern over Biden‚Äôs ability to lead (as Obama would make an excellent replacement should the worse come to pass), but his final Gallup approval rating (59%) was among the three highest (Reagan/Clinton being 1 and 2) suggesting he could bring many of currently undecided into the Democratic fold.

Same with girls who are raised by parents who keep telling them that they are pretty and so they grow up to bully girls they deem as not pretty or sabotage their competition.

Even if the person does happen to be right, at the end of the day, we cannot simply choose to do something purely do to the fact that somebody else told us to, if we did this all the time, we would be living other peoples lives and not our own. It has to resonate with what we personally believe through our personal experience in order for us to follow through with what they‚Äôre saying. If our personal experience has taught us something other than what they are telling us, then for all we know they could be completely bullshitting us.

We have to fall and learn from our mistakes every once in a while. The phrase ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù discourages one from taking risks and will leave them feeling unable to make decisions for themselves and that they should listen to everyone else‚Äôs opinions rather than their own.

14,2024-06-29,CMV: Falling birthrates are a cultural and not economic phenomena.,u/Sensitive_Remove1112,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1drm8dg/cmv_falling_birthrates_are_a_cultural_and_not/,changemyview,"I've seen a lot of talk online in the last couple of years about falling birthrates across the world. It seems that the most common retort is that this is caused by declining economic opportunities for young people. I think this is pretty obviously wrong - at least in America I cannot speak to other countries - and instead declining birthrates seem, to me, to be the result of shifting cultural values among young people relative to their parents. Everything else in ancillary. I grew up in a Mormon family - I left the church - and have \~60 cousins when you add up both sides of my family. Already my cousins have had over 10 more kids and are on track to have a TON. Having kids is just viewed as extremely important in my family. There is both positive and negative pressure to get married and start having kids.

This of course comes at a significant cost to things that I imagine most people on this sub¬†wouldn't be willing to compromise on(myself included). Mormonism is stiflingly sexist for example. But what I keep circling back to is the immense amount of work it takes to be a Mom. Outside of Mormonism I sometimes see a perception, that being a mother¬†isn't a real job¬†which I find frankly offensive. The truth is as long as motherhood isn't valued socially birth rates will stay low. Either liberalism finds a way to square itself with sustainable population growth or Darwinistic selection selects for a society that does. 

I believe that financial incentives \~probably\~ have a marginal effect on birth rates but I cannot help but consider my owner experiences at Stanford. As a graduate student the school offers about as extreme of a pro-natalist policy as I can personally imagine.¬†

For PhD students we get an additional 20k a year(roughly half of our stipend), access to superior housing(2br town house rather than studio for a married couple), subsidized childcare, and \~$500 a month off our rent if we have a kid. I‚Äôm yet to hear a single person be motivated by this.¬†

Fertility seems overwhelmingly driven by cultural variables + it‚Äôs just hard to have a kid if you're a young working woman. The failure of Stanfords policy to unleash a real baby boom among PhDs is something I plan to write about in the future.¬†

Quoting from an article I wrote about exactly this. 

""Nearly every American can afford children. Resistance to this takes the shape of a Motte and Bailey argument where if pushed people will concede they could in fact afford children but that it would require significant financial sacrifices. Effectively what people mean when they say they cannot afford children is that they could not continue the consumption patterns to which they have become accustomed if they had kids. But what standard is that really? Mechanically how could people ever afford children under that criteria? Since the household is larger but the number of adults remains unchanged?¬†  
  
The alternative argument is that parents will not have enough money to give their kids the experiences they want to. Again, this is fully within your rights to believe but how many of you would choose to not exist if given the lifestyle you could offer your own kids? Obviously being able to do things like afford piano lessons for your children is amazing and should be celebrated, but just as I think it would be horrifying to argue that people in the developing world should just totally stop having kids because their quality of life would be lower than a Norwegian, I don‚Äôt think lower class Americans should simply refuse to have children. Life is struggle and necessity, rejecting that is rejecting life.""

Biden or Trump? Well, neither. I dislike them both and neither of them deserve to be president in my eyes.   
To me, Biden is a puppet to the democrats that can't speak and Trump is a hard-headed tyrant that speaks too much. Why would we pick between asses and elephants when neither are fit to run the country?

I brought this up to my family, and now that I can finally vote, I'm set on voting for a 3rd party. But they argued that ""If you vote for a 3rd party, you're wasting your vote"" No I'm not. I'm voting for who I think should be president(which is the whole point of voting), not who I think is gonna win between two evils.   
  
And it seems like most, if not all voters are stuck in the mind-set that if you vote for a 3rd party, you're wasting your vote. Yet I hear everyone complain about both major parties running for office, ridiculous. I will gladly ""waste"" my vote on a 3rd party, especially in an election like this 2024 election. And if everyone voted for who they like instead of between two evils, we could actually get a non-corrupt 3rd party in office. But again, everyone is stuck on the idea that ""If you vote for a 3rd party, you're wasting your vote"" and the war continues between asses and elephants.  


Think about it, if everyone who didn't like Biden and Trump voted instead for their favorite 3rd party, we might be able to get out of this Red vs Blue predicament. Again, why would you vote for someone just because you think they're gonna win? Vote for someone who actually deserves your vote, or we're gonna be stuck in this Democrat-Republican loop forever. Which isn't entirely bad if both parties weren't corrupt, but they are.  
Instead of picking between two evils, lets find a party that we can all be confident in. Are all American voters stuck in the Red vs Blue mindset? Or are there shades of Green and Orange still out there, waiting to win their first election in American history?

I'm looking forward to new arguments and opinions. I've heard plenty of arguments stating that I'll waste my vote, but I'm not convinced. I refuse to vote for either, and the alternative is just not to vote at all, which feels like an even bigger waste of my vote than if I voted for a 3rd party. At least if I vote for a 3rd party I'm doing something with my vote.

There, I've tried changing your mind about 3rd parties in America, now you try to change mine."

That being said, what‚Äôs the bright side? The bright side is that all of these plans take a compliant, effective, and competent staff to actually implement. Once DJT is in office, he‚Äôll find out that a plan is easy to have, but implementing it is not. If I learned anything from the previous administration it‚Äôs that there was immediate resistance and adaption at the state level, especially in blue states that have more economic power. There are laws now in the books that expand protected classes, that create political and immigration sanctuaries, that enshrine adoption rights, that protected interracial marriages, and that protect gay marriages and expand punishments for hate crimes. During DJT 1.0 there was the largest ever protest movement in history with every major city and smaller cities experiencing enormous cross generational uprisings. There was a growing movement of industrial action and policy insulation that started up immediately. 

US allows adapted and expanded their own alliances and arms production capacities and NATO expanded to include Nordic countries with literal arsenals (Finland) and near infinite money (Sweden via their oil wealth and access to critical minerals in the thawing arctic). I think over the next decade it‚Äôll be enough to replace the USA, if we were to completely pull out of NATO. 

Elections cannot be canceled and the House and Congress were opposed to Trump for most of his term, and as a result he wasn‚Äôt able to accomplish much except lower the level of foreign deployed staff at the state department. 

What exactly will happen if federal staff massively walk out and stop doing their work? What if they delete their code, their documents, and basically destroy everything, leaving an incompetent administration to build everything back from scratch?

If Project 2025 is to work, it‚Äôll need almost zero resistance and will need a competent staff and compliant population. That‚Äôs just not who we are as a country. I definitely don‚Äôt suggest we need to do nothing, but I‚Äôm trying to measure how much of a threat this actually is. To me the ideas of an extreme threat and anyone endorsing them should be crushed under the wheels of an electric Hummer, but I don‚Äôt think the implementation will go well or smoothly.

This post isn't focused on the morality or legality of abortion, but rather on when human life does or doesn't begin.

I don't believe that a fetus a week after conception is a human being. I think it's not inaccurate to describe it as a clump of cells. I don't believe human life begins at conception. But I also don't believe human life begins at birth. I'll explain. 

I have a friend who was born 2 months premature. It was uncertain if he would survive, but thankfully he did. Now, if someone had killed him when he was a month old, all people, pro-choice and pro-life, would regard that as the taking of a human life. But why would it be different if he had not been born premature, and instead his mother had opted for an abortion at 8 months of pregnancy?

It seems to me that to say one of these is the taking of a human life and the other is not, you must believe that the process of birth has some magical effect of changing a clump of cells into a human being. To me, this seems like a belief based only on faith, similar to how a pro-life Christian might say human life begins at conception by appealing to Psalm 139:13.

To put it more succinctly - there is no single, definitive moment that a fetus/clump of cells/whatever becomes a human being. Rather, it is a gradual (typically) 9-month-long process transformation. 

I hope I've explained my view well, and I'm happy to clarify any confusion over my position."

I believe her experience living as a man, or trying to, shows us a lot of interesting things about the differences between men and women, and most importantly I think it shows us some really uncomfortable truths about gender dynamics that cast doubt on some ideas and lend great legitimacy and vindication to others.

I really wish I could discuss what we see throughout the segment in regards to how unconvincing Norah is as a straight man, but I think that would violate Rule 4, so I will omit that from this CMV.

**POINT #1: Women have all the power when it comes to dating**

9:27: ""Throughout the project, Ned dabbled in the art of picking up women"". As they say in the segment:

>""Norah was reminded that in this arena, *it's women who have all the power*.""

>She goes on to say, ""We \[women\] sit there...and just with one word, ""no"", will *crush* someone. The thing is, we don't have to do the part where you cross the room, go up to a stranger, and say the first words. And it's so hard to say those first words without sounding like a cheeseball. Or jerk, or whatever else.""

Of course this is only more true in the years since Norah did this experiment. There are actually dating apps like Bumble where women have the power - when they match with a man, they decide whether or not to go forward. Apparently they *just* changed this.

But it's actually a moot point because of the nature of dating apps shows that women have all the power anyway. As the saying goes, ""Women die of drowning, men die of thirst"". Since there are so many men vs. women on dating apps, they're spoiled for choice. And this leaves a lot of men in a desert where they have no or few matches.

10:03 ""Norah says the brush off she gave Ned is typical"".

The report goes on, ""Ned went on about 30 dates with women, mostly arranging them on the internet"".

Reporter: ""Did you have any fun?""

Norah: ""Rarely.""

At 7:00 in the segment, we see Norah discuss this. In her words, she says ""Female sexuality is up here (mental), and male sexuality is down here. It's a bodily function.""

She also says ""Because we don't have testosterone in our systems, we don't understand how hard it is \[to deal with\]."" Pun intended?

I want to emphasize that I understand that men are stronger than women (kind of a redpill point in itself), so I understand that women don't have *physical* power in dating, and that for a woman, arguably the risk for them is the danger of being assaulted or something like that. I think most of this can be mitigated by staying in public places on dates and carrying self-defense measures if you go somewhere private with a man, such as a tazer, mace, or even a gun.

**POINT #2: Women are attracted to masculine men**

As they continue in the segment:

>""The pressure for Ned to prove himself was grueling. **Norah was surprised that so many women had no interest in a soft, vulnerable man.""**

>Norah: ""My predjudice was that an ideal man is a woman in a man's body. And I learned...nah, that's really not true. There's a lot of women out there who really want a manly man.""

So I think this really demonstrates the critical importance of masculinity when it comes to dating, and that while women will give lip service to the idea that they want someone who is sensitive, thoughtful, kind, etc, what they really want is a **masculine** man.

**POINT #2A: Many women are closeted bisexuals (or bi-curious)**

I'm not sure if this is a ""redpill"" argument, but I found it very interesting nonetheless:

According to Norah, once they learned that Ned was actually a woman, they were still interested in continuing the relationship romantically (or at least sexually). This is very interesting because the women were ostensibly interested in dating a man, but they found Ned too feminine as a man and were not interested. But when they learned Ned is actually a woman, their feelings changed. When these feminine traits were coming from a man, they were turned off, but these same traits coming from a woman made them sexually interested. I think this shows that many women are bisexual (or closeted bisexual), even if they don't specifically seek it out.

I suppose you could also use the term ""bi-curious"".

**POINT #3: ""Toxic masculinity"" is not as common in social spaces as some might believe**

At the 3:00 mark in the video, Norah discusses how she wanted to enter a ""quintessential male space"", so she joined a bowling league in a working class Pennsylvania town expecting that she would be mocked and experience what we would call ""toxic masculinity"" - however, she discovered that the opposite was true.

Rather than being mocked or cast out, she was fully accepted. Even though she was an awful bowler, and, as the men in the group discuss in the news segment, they saw Ned as very effeminate and assumed ""Ned"" was gay. But regardless of this, she was accepted with open arms. And if this was going on in 2006, I see no reason to believe that this would be any less common almost 20 years later.

In Norah's words, ""They just took me in, no questions asked"".

I believe toxic masculinity is really something that is more likely to be isolated to a man's home, his family dynamics, how he treats his wife and children, etc. In terms of social spaces and ""men's spaces"", I don't believe toxic masculinity is a problem at all. I think people who believe this are making a supposition based on an ideological worldview.

**Conclusion**

I'm sure there are many more points to make based on her work, but sadly I haven't read *Self-Made Man* for many years and I don't recall much of it.

Anyway, I think even this short news segment from 2006 about her book shows some really interesting and stark differences between men and women that would probably offend the sensibilities of modern westerners, but I think Norah's unique experiences show that some of redpill ideology is probably true.

TO BE CLEAR, I want to also express that of course she makes some valid arguments about how men are unable to express themselves emotionally and are often suffering silently because of this, etc, which would be considered a mainstream or ""bluepill"" perspective, and some of what she says about this is also true, but I'm focusing on the redpill points here."
0,2024-06-29,CMV: The age of majority should not have a set age but instead should be proved by a test.,u/OwnerOfGvaciu,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1drrcq9/cmv_the_age_of_majority_should_not_have_a_set_age/,changemyview,"It is ridiculous of the concept how once someone reachs a certain age (18, 21 or another age) that they are considered a legal adult even if they are not able or heavily struggle to do basic tasks or perform aspects of adult life by themselves. I think that legal adulthood should be something that is earned and not just simply given. Not all people mature at the same rate, which explains the reason why there should be no set age of majority. A simple age should not reflect that the person is capable of doing everything perfectly as an adult would. Instead, there should be a test, similar to a performance exam where you would have to prove that you are able to function as a legal adult that consists of performing different tasks, which could be, but are not limited to: 

- Financial management (budgeting, taxes, banking, etc.)
- Understanding of legal rights and responsibilities 
- Ability to live independently (cooking, cleaning, self-care, etc.)
- Critical thinking and decision-making skills
- Emotional regulation and impulse control

The reason why I think that legal adulthood should be implemented this way is to avoid the overgeneralization of all young people not being able to take care of themselves because of their age or because of their brain not being fully developed, as well as to reduce people infantilizing young people, treating the same as a young child.

Also, if you are wondering if there is a scenario where a grown adult is still living with their parents and never decide to become a legal adult which burdens the parents in many different ways, the parents should be allowed to kick them out of they are capable of becoming an adult but refuse to become a legal adult unless they are proven to have a mental disorder or disability that may have them not able to have them take care of themselves. They will be forced or at least heavily pushed to become a legal adult since they are capable of being one.

The parents or guardians of the teen/adult should not be able to keep them away from taking the test unless they can prove that they are incapable of being a legal adult. I am not saying that I am giving 8 year olds a free pass into becoming an adult, because it would be nearly impossible for someone that young to be able to do the same things of an adult.

The new term of legal adulthood applies to everything besides times where performance does not determine whether they are able to do something or not (example drinking alcohol which no matter what they do they will be confirmed to have negative effects no matter what they do).

The title of legal adulthood can also be taken away if the person suddenly continuously fails to take care of themselves and perform adult tasks.

There are a couple counterarguments against this article, such as:

1. The age of majority should be 18.

Many people but not all people at 18 still struggle to take care of themselves or need help with doing basic tasks of a legal adult. And some people could be ready to be a legal adult even before the age of 18. 

2. The age of majority should be raised to when the brain is fully developed (for example, 25).

I disagree with this statement because the idea of the brain needed to be fully developed to being able to make a rational decision and the idea that anyone not fully developed isn‚Äôt able to make good decisions is wrong and even harmful since it over generalizes every single person under that listed age. At most, your brain being fully developed may increase the chance to make good decisions. Why would a person a couple years until their brain is fully developed not be able to make simple decisions? I don‚Äôt think that the people supporting this counterargument mean that they can‚Äôt make any minor decision, but again, the overgeneralization of everyone not being able to make simple decisions just because their brain is not only wrong and ridiculous but also could make wrong impressions of younger people and lead to infantilizing them. A decision don‚Äôt have to be anything big, but it could be even the smallest thing. For example a small decision is choosing where to look, or even think in your head. That counts as a decision.

If they able to perform all of these tasks correctly, they would be able to be called a legal adult. However, if they failed to perform these tasks correctly, they would still be considered a minor. 

If you wonder if I am an adult writing this or not, I am a minor, and even if I am writing about this unpopular view, I do not believe that I would be able to act like an adult and take care of myself without help.  This post was not made so I could call myself an adult, but for me to express the flaws of what is considered an adult or not. 

I am not expecting this post or idea to actually be implemented or even widely recognized and considered, especially without any corrections or clarification, but this is an idea of mine since I realized that people mature at different rates and that some people are not ready for adult responsibility despite being at the original age of majority. 

Whether if you agree, have mixed opinions, or disagree with the post above, explain in the comments if you want and point out suggestions, flaws, and questions about my argument. I might reply with an answer or talk about it with you if you want. Keep in mind that I might not be able to respond to every comment, not come up with an answer, or be able to come up with a good response since I may have difficulty responding to the answer. Positive criticism is fine and even encouraged, but don't respond with hate or bullying. I am not sure if an idea like this is realistic let alone can be implemented into this society, and I expect lots of disagreements or questions here.

This bullshit DNC establishment spent the last four years gaslighting us and trying to claim that Biden DIDN'T have dementia until the 11th hour. Until it was too late. But they still want to act like it's the most important election of our lifetime.

It's a coronation for them at the end of the day. It's always ""HeR tUrNnNnN!"" or ""He's the most electable!"" or some bullshit like that. Enough is enough. If they're not taking it seriously, we shouldn't either. 

Remember this: he has an entire infrastructure of pages, PR people, a comms team, consultants and other social parasites whose high six-figure jobs all hinge on his reelection. He's not getting replaced. We're stuck with him. And he's bound to lose because he's got a diaper brain.

Never let establishment Democrats shame you into voting for a conservative Democrat ever again because, at the end of the day, Democracy is just not as important to them as keeping their high-powered DC jobs. They'd rather gamble on our country's future than risk their own status. They all belong in a dank gulag. I AGREE that it's fascism vs. democracy. I just wish they believed it too as much as they say they do.

If they wanted to win so bad they would send him out to pasture. But they don't care. Because they won't suffer from a Trump Presidency like we will, and many of them would actually materially benefit from it. The entire reason we're stuck with Trump in the first place is because they insisted on running Hillary in 16 despite how unpopular she always was. Because the DNC has a corrupt and intractable patronage system in place, and it's easier to hold voters hostage every four years than it is to dissolve that infrastructure.

There is no opposition to Trump. At this point I believe the DNC is actively colluding with him. So fuck them!"

That isn't hanging around the goal, and that isn't some major advantage.

The rule rarely seems to stop crazy goal keeper disadvantages, instead what happens is, penalization of an offensive player who saw a play happening before the defense did. So if your defender isn't awake, he's rewarded for being asleep.

They need a rule, but the current implementation of this rule is trash. And in cases like the Dane's toe, too luck based."

The birth rates decline when the country becomes richer. You can see it with every rich country in the West: U.S., Canada, whole Europe. You can also see it with  Japan, South Korea, and Australia. 

The reason why I believe it is not connected with higher costs of living is because nowadays people have changed their attitude to life and family. Having a child is a sacrifice for many. Yes, it costs money but that is not the real problem. The problem is that many want to use that money to enjoy life. Having a child is a sacrifice of time, that many need to fulfill their life desires, dor example travel around the world or any other joyful activity that would be hard to do if you had a child. Having a child means being responsible of a person, and many are afraid of it. 

The other factor linked with what I have already said is that the mentality ""my goal in life is making a family"" changed. The main goal now is to enjoy life. Like I said before, many could perceive that fulfilling that goal can be achieved only without kids in the way. So having kids is not the normality, in sense that you are programmed to do that. The normality for which life has a meaning is be happy. 

In short, it never really was about economic issues, although they still play a partial role in that. It is more about the new lifestyle: be happy. Being happy is without kids for many.

The first is what I consider the most likely, it‚Äôs the thought that inspired this post, and is by far the worst outcome for the DNC. They wait NC (get it?). Biden‚Äôs polling numbers don‚Äôt recover enough, and, as November approaches, they realize he isn‚Äôt going to win, panic, get Biden to step down, and announce a replacement. With a few weeks or a month or two to campaign, they aren‚Äôt able to shake Harris‚Äô deep unpopularity and lose. Or,l they go with a different candidate, don‚Äôt get their name out enough because they‚Äôre short on time, and they lose.

The second is that they do nothing. It‚Äôs the second of the two scenarios that inspired this post. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen, continue as before, and run Biden against Trump in a 2020 rematch. Biden, who wasn‚Äôt certain to beat Trump before, at the height of his unpopularity, runs amid his low rating, doubts about his mental ability, calls to step down from his own party, and (at least the perception of) a shaky economy and high prices. He loses.

The third, and the least likely, is the winning scenario. The DNC acts now gets Biden to step down, replaces him with a younger, more virile candidate, and all of trump‚Äôs doubtful supporters flock to the younger alternative. With the benefit of three months of vigorous campaigning, they take the win.

There is technically a fourth scenario. The fallout from the debate is minimal, Biden runs normally and defeats Trump. If this was likely, we wouldn‚Äôt be hearing calls for him to step aside from his own party and from major media outlets."

We need to be getting more out of our defense dollars, but we may also need more defense dollars to supply American military supremacy. Otherwise, the U.S. may lose a war to China or a combination of actors in the not too distant future.

Now, one could reasonably ask, why must the U.S. be the indispensable nation? Why can't it simply mind its own business? Global order can emerge multilaterally as other nations pick up the slack. True. A new order will emerge. But in order to achieve balance, there will first be conflict. 

Nations will seek to expand there spheres of influence to fill the void left by a retreating American security umbrella. Considering the nations who are acting aggressively to do this already, it seems likely that this will result in a large expansion of influence by authoritarian nations. Liberal democracies around the world appear ill-prepared to defend themselves without American backing and susceptible to forcible regime change.

My view is that a number of democracies will fall if the U.S. does not defend them. You may not think this is a bad thing or that it is America's responsibility to protect other nations, but that is not relevant to my view. Nor is this a referendum on American actions in history when it has not always projected its own values abroad.

0,2024-06-30,CMV: Public Sex should be accepted and supported,u/Turbulent_Pound4806,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1drwlaw/cmv_public_sex_should_be_accepted_and_supported/,changemyview,"Okay, hear me out.

  
Sexual intercourse is not an easy act, is not a clean one either AND is not a calm one for sure, and even if it was, it wouldn't be the nicest in smell. 

  
I am here however to offer a naturalist opinion of mine, that is to make public sex, if it happened, okay and accepted and supported, and I hate how I have to mark this as NSFW, because the subject at hand is completely okay and normal!

  
Sex, is seen as a very intimate close act, and if not, it's seen as a very private and closed one, and this is normal, it's what society has conditioned us, and certainly what religion has conditioned us for decades and centuries, and it's what has been enforced by the conservatives masses and individuals in power.

However, what we can learn from Europe is that, nudity can be integrated publicly into society, and because of that, you can understand how such a normalization is possible. 

Sex is not a terrible act when is done between consenting adults. Sex is not a risky act when is taken care of hygienically and with protection. 



Now I want you to picture this. A couple is doing it on a public bench in a park. it's spring, it's really nice out there, they got a towel, they got cleaning up tools and equipment, they are just enjoying themselves and nature. This is beautiful, it's humanity, it's what humanity was always about!

We should never be ashamed of the fact that we desire freedom, love and harmony! We should never be ashamed that we desire love and we want to spread love and we want it to be known and heard and seen!

This is pure art, it's an expression of what kept us, as species going, as what kept us happy couples happy, so my question is, why should we be ashamed of it? Why should we illegalize it? Why should we hate it?

Now, I will address some common arguments that conservatives forming right now.



1- What about public cohesion and order? 

A/ 

Public cohesion and order will not be affected by public sex, ***IF*** we make sure to educate people about sex!

It's really that simple! We educate people about sex, as it's an act of love, something we should do responsibly, we educate that there is nothing wrong with it. We educate students about its side-effects and its side-products and educate them ways of how to clean up the environment after them! Use towels, cleaners and perfumes! Tell them that the noises are that of pleasure and love and not of pain and oppression!

It will be admired and understood.

This way, sex will not hurt anyone physically and healthily. 



2- What about security risks?

A/ 

Security is a real valid concern, but we must not sacrifice our freedom for some temporary security, because as Benjamin Franklin said, if we do that, we deserve neither. 

For that, if we wanted to legalize public sex, then we will want to compromise and make it related to married people, this way, they are protected under the law. 

This way, sexual assault cases that has been documented by the law, can be differentiated between consented public sex, and assault!

And trust me, for a freedom loving society where everyone is loved and appreciated, the legal hustle will be all worth it.

Sadly however, this is a real concern and I offer no actually legally valid, educated and solid counter-argument on it, so you win on this one.

  
3- What about people with different backgrounds, cultures and beliefs that are disturbed by this?

A/  

Well, then they have failed to truly integrate themselves into our society. They have been taught for generations since birth by the oppressive to hate the body, to hate nature, to hate love and to hate sex. This is the problem with religions overall, and this is why public sex is sadly not becoming legalized for now AND this is why doing it is a danger for you too if you chose to practice it! As the religious will attack you and condemn you for it, further more proving that they are the aggressors of freedom.

Change is hopefully on the way though, as people are starting to abandon these old myths and turn to love and nature!

4-  What about the children?

A/

Oh this is a classic argument they use. 

I will have to get real with you here, and by that, you'll need to look no further than Europe. Unlike our US, the Europeans are no longer controlled by puritans and conservatives. They have normalized nudity for centuries! Nudity to them is a norm, it's so normal to go out there in the park and see a nude woman entertaining nature and love! 

Children find no problem with this at all! They have been taught since birth that being naked is okay and it's just love, so why would they find any problem with that? It won't make them worse people, it won't make them close minded, freedom hating and out of their way to shame someone for their gender and race! IT WILL TEACH THEM to love humanity!

This is why there's nothing wrong with nudity there. The next step now, will be to make this apply to sex too! And now, we will end up with a free, love infested society! No one will be depraved, sad and alone! 

  
Overall, as a final thought:

I know I sound very naive, and I truly am. I know it's a world I'll never live, a one that will be fought by the greedy, the old and the religious, but hey, it doesn't hurt to dream and hope, maybe one day we can all be free and happy. 

All the arguments above proves that public sex as a subject, is worthy of thought, and perhaps support.

I see nothing wrong with public sex, and I am very interested to see how you'll change my view!

0,2024-06-30,CMV: Dating Women Is a Liability,u/JRob513973,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1drwqdc/cmv_dating_women_is_a_liability/,changemyview,"I (M) would like to start by saying: I'm very glad I'm also attracted to men.

Next, I'd like to say that I am not inciting violence against women. Any unprovoked violence against anyone, including women is wrong. Although with how many women that get away with domestic abuse, I will say that I condone self defense. And I encourage women to do the same to their abusers. Exercise your 2nd amendment right if necessary. Also, can we normalize women carrying weapons. If we did rape cases would significantly plummet.

Now, into my claim: Having a relationship with a woman in today's society is too much of a liability. Fourth-wave feminists have perpetuated this idea that all women should be undoubtedly believed, when accusing men of sexual misconduct (rape, SA, etc.). Not only does this negatively impact innocent men, but it also negatively impacts the women, that are real victims of sexual misconduct, because people will be less likely to believe them ([The Boy Who Cried Wolf](https://www.storyarts.org/library/aesops/stories/boy.html)). I can't fathom why feminists would intentionally make men disbelieve them, by indirectly encouraging false accusations against us.

These extreme positions held by feminists have unfortunately contributed to a major uprising in misogynism. A large portion of misogynist propaganda is simply quoting modern feminists' ideas. I genuinely think the feminists are fueling the misogynist movement more than the misogynists are. I'm not a misogynist, but I'm gonna stay away from as many women as I can (except family) for my own safety, especially after being falsely accused of following a woman, because we were both walking to the same jobsite, where we both worked at. 

I wish that all these feminists that say they don't need men would create their own society. I believe anything a man can do a woman can do. But they don't, not because they can't. I've met amazingly skilled female construction workers, psychologists, teachers etc. They don't, because that's not the goal of modern feminism. The goal is not segregation of the sexes, like they seem to be pushing towards. The goal is just chaos. I believe this radical version of feminism is meant to distract the media from something else, but that part is just speculation.

So, I'm kinda done being bisexual. I've decided to be effectively gay, until society unfucks itself."

43,2024-06-30,CMV: Biden's age doesn't matter. It's better to vote for a rock than Trump.,u/EdisonCurator,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1drxlft/cmv_bidens_age_doesnt_matter_its_better_to_vote/,changemyview," 
To be clear, I'm not talking about whether Biden should step down. Maybe he should. My view is that, if it came down to Biden Vs Trump. Biden being senile just doesn't matter at all. There are two reasons I believe this. 

1. What matters after the election is what policies will be implemented, not who is implementing them. Personally, I think Biden's track record is much better than I expected. The economy is objectively doing great. I'm fairly sure that this is the consensus among economists and experts. The US economy is so good that other western countries are trying to imitate Biden's policies. 

I am dissatisfied with how he handled Gaza, but it's honestly better than I expected from any American politician. American politics has always strongly favoured Israel due to structural reasons. No matter how pro-palestine a president is, their hands are often tied by factors outside of their control. 

Whether the track record is been delivered by Biden or his team, I want it to continue. I think his actual track record is a much stronger indication for what will actually happen than how he talks in front of a camera. 

2. Even if he is too old and won't deliver anything at all, it would still be better than having Trump. A rock is a better than a fascist. Nothing changing is better than things getting (significantly) worse.

I'm open to be challenged on any of my claims but here are points that I can foresee being challenged on.

A. Maybe who implements policy matters over and above which policies get implemented due to some democratic principle? Perhaps we don't want unelected people to be making important political decisions. My issue with this is that, even if it did matter, it doesn't matter so much that I'd vote for Trump.
B. Is Trump better than a rock? I don't see my mind being changed here, given that Trump is a fascist, and fascists are worse than rocks, but it would be interesting to see someone try 
C. Is Biden also worse than a rock? If Biden is worse than a rock, then the argument that Biden>rock>Trump doesn't go through. I think most arguments on this front will be appealling to his actions are Gaza, being potentially worse than no actions at all. To me, this is insufficient. You'd also have to show that other presidents wouldn't have been forced to do the same actions. The American foreign policy blob is famously powerful and i think a reasonable presumption is that the president has very little room to maneuver there. 
D. Maybe to you, the choice is whether to vote for Biden/rock or to not vote for anyone. I think we should vote for the lesser evil and I've never seen a good argument against it. Some argue that voting for Biden is being complicit in his actions in Gaza. My view is that Trump's actions would be much worse, and not voting for Biden makes you complicit in Trump's actions if Trump wins. Here, I really don't think the action/omission distinction makes sense. Think of it like a modified trolley problem. The trolley will either kill 1 person or 5 people. Which tracks it heads down to is determined by a vote. Not voting at all seems immoral. Voting for the 1 person track is not being complicit in killing one person, it's being complicit in saving 4.  
E. Lastly, maybe you are concerned about Biden not being able to negotiate with other world leaders effectively or make decisions in emergencies. I think this is a good worry, but again, a senile Biden would still be much better than Trump. A senile Biden would not be kissing Kim Jung Un and Putin's asses. He would not stop supporting Ukraine. If a war happens, Trump is much more likely to lead us to nuclear Armageddon or escalate the conflict in reckless ways."

I think his chances are negligible, but debating that isn't the point.  I think that even if Newsom, or Harris or some other has a worse chance than him, he should be replaced because he simply shouldn't be President.

It seems implausible that on January 19th 2029 Joe Biden is still capable of being the President.  Him winning would be a bad thing, because it will require either someone who seems almost certain to be *completely* medically incompetent for some of his term being President, or him being replaced by a VP that nobody voted for President.  To support him is to pretend that isn't the case, and hope the American people vote for him having had this lie told to them, which is undemocratic.

He also seems to have a very low chance of winning, so giving some of that up in favour of a chance for someone who is massively more suited to the job seems like a good tradeoff.

All of this presupposes the perspective of a US Democrat.

You could change it by:

* Challenging that underlying logic.

* Showing that the situation with his health is not as I seem to think it is.

* Showing that enough people who will vote for Biden as to constitute a plurality are genuinely okay with him dying/getting dementia in office.

* Some other thing I didn't think of."

211,2024-06-30,CMV: Living under the rule of a Christian Nationalist government is arguably one of the worst things that can happen to Christians.,u/logicisking__,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ds0zfb/cmv_living_under_the_rule_of_a_christian/,changemyview,"Reason one: The Christian Nationalist movement draws its legitimacy from the hero‚Äôs journey.

The Christian nationalist movement isn‚Äôt dominated by the need to shelter the homeless, feed the hungry, or aid the spiritually broken to find comfort in the teachings of Jesus Christ.

Far too many in the movement have convinced themselves or have been convinced that Christian Nationalism is all that is good in America. That to be righteous means Christians must engage in a holy crusade to purify America from all that Christian Nationalists deem evil. Starting by ensuring that the movement leaders or its affiliates gain political influence over America‚Äôs society.

Today‚Äôs main villains are the left and their leftist ideologies. For the sake of this argument, let‚Äôs assume Christian nationalists gain reign over America‚Äôs governance and successfully suppress or expel the left, non-Christians, etc.; who will then become the villains of tomorrow? The hero‚Äôs journey needs a villain. How will Christian nationalists' religious leaders, politicians, and their media legitimize themselves to their flock in an America empty of those deemed pagan?

Time and time again, history has taught mankind a lesson many elect to conveniently ignore. A nation designed for religious people by religious people often turns on itself. Which brings us to...

Reason two: Not all Christians share the same values.

If Christian Nationalists succeed, what America will they create? And more importantly, for whom?

If their stance is that America was founded as a Christian nation for Christians, therefore, America‚Äôs government institutions and society should adhere to Christian values, then the next logical question should be which particular set of Christian values should Americans be ruled by?

Will America be a nation designed by Christians where all Christians can practice freely, or will Christians deemed heretics be expelled, jailed, or hanged √† la Salem Witch Trials?

On June 19, many Christians rejoiced as the Ten Commandments were mandated in every Louisiana public school. I can see why so many view this as a triumph. The doctrine of the Ten Commandments is one Christians can agree on. However, which mandate should come next?

What if inspired by his beliefs, Louisiana's Roman Catholic governor mandates that every public school child must be taught the teachings of the Roman Catholic Bible? Should Protestant children be obligated to study the additional Deuterocanonical books excluded from the Protestant Bible? Books reformers like Martin Luther consider apocryphal. 

The Inquisition, the Crusades, the countless Christians burned, tortured, and martyred by fellow Christians, by now should have made it self-evident to all of us that the separation of church and state is inherently beneficial to Christians, since the separation of church and state not only protects the state from the church but inherently protects the church from the state.

In my view, what lies in the best interest of religious people is to exist in a secular society, for secularism offers faith and spiritual a form of guaranteed security."

Full disclosure: I'm an RFK Jr. voter (who voted Dem going in 2020), and I'm gonna stand behind that going into November. I'm well versed with his stances, his history, flaws and strengths. If reading that is enough to get you to dismiss what I'm about to say, then by all means, don't waste your time reading this. It's a free country after all.

That being said, here's the way I see things. 
___________________________

The Democratic party had RFK who wanted to run and stay as a Democrat, and was pointing out the weaknesses in the Democratic platform (as well as Biden's other weaknesses against Trump) from the beginning, and the DNC smeared and chased him out the door.

They had Dean Philips and Marianne Williamson, both well liked with the Democrat base and moderates/independents, and the DNC [canceled primaries](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/30/florida-democrats-dean-phillips-election-00129403) and [bullied them into the abyss](https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-block-high-schoolers-meeting-marianne-williamson-1809422) as well. 

I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Donald Trump was the best thing that happened to the Democratic party, because his presence allowed them to engage in blatantly anti-democratic strategies, gaslight, bully and abuse their own voters into accepting whatever they give them without the DNC doing a damn thing to deserve their prolonged support. Using him as a Boogeyman to scare their voters out of holding them accountable by either voting existing leadership out or voting elsewhere. And if anyone tries to call them out on it, they bellow ""sToP TrUMp!"".

I'm an independent, but I've always wanted Democrats to genuinely succeed. Not just by winning in elections, but by actually doing right by their constituents and even those that don't vote for them, because this country belongs to every American, not just those who voted for whichever party is in power. But the modern Democratic party establishment is lazy, stubborn, and actively torpedoes likable candidates with actual crossover appeal with moderates and even conservatives, and instead prefers to act entitled to votes or if they're feeling generous, shameless empty pandering/virtue signaling without any real action.

And to add insult to injury, instead of taking the opinions of their disillusioned voter base seriously, instead they opt to dismiss and shit on anyone who isn't lock step with the party leadership, which is how 2016 happened, and actively do whatever they can to [chase alternatives off the board](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/dnc-war-third-party-candidates-rcna143290) in the name of ‚Äútrying to save democracy‚Äù, in order to do their half in locking Americans into a horrific matchup that [70 plus percent of voters didn't want](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/25/2024-trump-biden-presidential-rematch). And how do they respond to the discontent this time? [Telling us to stfu and accept our abominable spoonful](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2024/04/03/hillary-clinton-fallon-interview-biden-trump-stephen-a-smith-nn-vpx.cnn)


Personally, I think that RFK still has a path to the White House, but it also isn't lost on me that we could very well get Trump again, and I hate that shit. And it's not my fault, your  fault, or any other voter's fault. Nor is it third party candidates' fault, nor that of their voters. It is solely the fault of a Democratic party that fumbled the bag, yet again. They had a wide, diverse pool in 2016, and Bernie was even projected in certain polls to beat Trump (and I'm not a Bernie bro, far from it), yet they decided we were getting Hillary instead, and when the emails were leaked and the DNC got caught they just shrugged and essentially went: ""we're a private organization and can do whatever the fuck we want, stay mad. Oh and btw, it's Hillary's turn so if you don't vote for her, you're a misogynist, and a sexist."" 

Voting is the sovereign right of the people to voice their opinions of officials that are elected to serve their interests, period. If they didn't do a good job in office, they don't fucking deserve our vote. That‚Äôs. Fucking. Democracy. But instead of taking that lesson to heart every time they lose power, instead they turn around and gaslight us voters into believing that it's *our* fault for putting our foot down, instead of handing them the renewed keys to a kingdom they didn‚Äôt earn nor deserve.

The bar was set so fucking low since 2016, and they still want to fucking play limbo. 

_______________________

TL;DR: The Democratic party had ample opportunity over 3 election cycles to become a better party that the majority of the nation could have faith in and believe in. Instead, once they realized how easy it was to sit back on their laurels and coast, while using the fear of Donald Trump to bully their voters into submission and blind loyalty, they now can't be bothered to actually give a shit. And when they don't get their way, they point the finger at their voters for trying to hold them accountable.

And yes, I am aware local politics are far more important than the voting populace realizes, and wouldn't hold it against anyone for leaving the President bubble on the ballot blank, while voting on everything else. In the long run, that still will foster a new crop of politicians, and potentially transform party platforms to be more in line with actual voter interests.

You can change my view by showing me that the DNC *has* been listening to their voters, hasn't been dismissive of the complaints of moderates and their base, hasn't become lazy and complacent, and hasn't been acting entitled to voter support without doing enough to earn voter's confidence."
0,2024-06-30,"CMV: Disease susceptibility in biomedicine is intricately modulated by a complex interplay of genetic predispositions and environmental influences, challenging the deterministic view of genetic causation alone.",u/CompetitionExtreme36,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ds3fj0/cmv_disease_susceptibility_in_biomedicine_is/,changemyview,"The landscape of disease susceptibility in biomedicine is marked by a dynamic interplay between genetic determinants and environmental exposures, a paradigm that underscores the multifaceted nature of pathophysiology. While genetic predispositions have traditionally been scrutinized for their role in disease etiology, the integration of environmental factors unveils a nuanced framework that redefines the deterministic dogma of genetic causation. This essay aims to scrutinize the intricate interplay between genetic and environmental influences on disease susceptibility, thereby advocating for a holistic perspective that transcends reductionist interpretations.

**Genetic Predispositions and Pathophysiological Mechanisms:** Central to the discourse of disease susceptibility are genetic predispositions, which encompass variants within the human genome associated with heightened susceptibility to specific pathophysiological states. From single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to structural genomic rearrangements, genetic predispositions confer varying degrees of vulnerability to disease manifestation, thereby shaping the phenotypic landscape of affected individuals. The elucidation of disease-associated genes through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) exemplifies the empirical strides in deciphering genetic underpinnings of complex diseases, underscoring their potential utility in prognostication and therapeutic stratification.

**Environmental Determinants and Epigenetic Modulation:** Contrary to the deterministic narrative of genetic causation, environmental exposures wield considerable influence in modulating disease susceptibility through epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetic modifications encompass reversible alterations in chromatin structure and gene expression patterns that occur in response to environmental cues, thereby exerting profound regulatory effects on disease susceptibility. From dietary factors influencing DNA methylation patterns to environmental toxins perturbing histone acetylation dynamics, epigenetic modulation transcends genetic determinism by integrating environmental signals into the genomic framework. The advent of high-throughput epigenomic profiling techniques augments our understanding of environmental contributions to disease susceptibility, thereby challenging reductionist paradigms and advocating for a comprehensive appraisal of gene-environment interactions.

**Dynamic Interplay and Systems Biology Paradigm:** The emergence of systems biology paradigms illuminates disease susceptibility as an emergent property of intricate networks comprising genetic, epigenetic, and environmental determinants. Systems biology encompasses holistic approaches that integrate multi-omics datasets with computational modeling to delineate complex interactions governing disease predisposition and progression. Network-based analyses unveil interdependent modules of genes and environmental factors implicated in disease pathogenesis, thereby elucidating the non-linear dynamics inherent to disease susceptibility. The conceptual shift from reductionism to systems biology underscores the imperative of comprehending disease susceptibility through a multidimensional lens that embraces the synergistic interplay between genetic determinants and environmental influences.

In summation, disease susceptibility in biomedicine defies deterministic reductionism by embodying a complex interplay of genetic predispositions and environmental influences. The integration of genetic insights with epigenetic dynamics and systems biology frameworks augments our understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, thereby advocating for a holistic perspective that transcends reductionist interpretations of genetic causation. Embracing the dynamic interplay between genetic determinants and environmental factors affords novel insights into disease susceptibility, fostering a paradigmatic shift towards personalized medicine and preventive strategies tailored to individual genetic and environmental profiles."

If you have a bench trial, with just the judge hearing the case, they explain how they came to their decision. They'll tell you why they feel the prosecution proved their case, or where they fell short, leaving a reasonable doubt.

I think juries should have to do the same thing.

Now I don't propose changing anything else about the jury system. Double jeopardy would still be in force, so an acquittal is still an acquittal, even if the jury gives the dumbest reason for it.

But if the jury finds the person guilty, and then gives an invalid reason for their verdict, then that can get the ball rolling immediately for an appeal or having the conviction set aside. Without that explanation it could take years, if it's ever discovered at all.

At the end of the day, anyone can render a verdict, anyone can say ""guilty"" or ""not guilty.""

But if a judge of facts cannot show their work, then how can we believe in the soundness of their judgement?"
0,2024-06-30,CMV: Trump will win after that debate.,u/SacluxGemini,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ds43fd/cmv_trump_will_win_after_that_debate/,changemyview,"Let's start with the obvious: Biden's already trailed in a majority of polls, and Thursday's debate likely caused him to lose a few more points. There are many calls for Biden to be replaced, and mainstream media keeps releasing stories about how party insiders and delegates are calling for him to step down. There are many reasons I think the Democrats are disfavored in the presidential race whether Biden withdraws or not, but for the sake of brevity I'll focus mostly on those surrounding the debate.

**If Biden withdraws:** 

Well, only Harris will be able to use Biden's war chest per campaign finance laws. And unfortunately, the more people see of her, the less they like her. If the 2020 primary was any indication, she cannot run a campaign in her own right to save her life. If Harris also withdraws, the Democrats will have to find a new option fast, and some polls suggest that other candidates fare equally badly against Trump, and that's *before* the GOP starts attacking them. There's also the fact that much of the messaging will have to be redone - it's not easy to go from ""vote for Biden/Harris"" to ""vote for Whitmer/Shapiro"" or whatever. Finally, many of these rumored replacement candidates have been vocal supporters of Biden and would no doubt be attacked ruthlessly for flip-flopping. None of this is to mention the ""DEMS IN DISARRAY"" headlines that are already sprouting like poisonous mushrooms and are likely to multiply exponentially if Biden actually does drop out.

**If Biden refuses to withdraw (which I think is more likely):**

Well, we're already seeing it now. After that debate, half of Democratic voters think he's not fit for office, let alone most Republicans. Yes, he might have had a cold, but the average voter doesn't care about that. Even if Biden fares better in future events and the second debate in September (assuming it still happens), the GOP is bound to run many more ads of Biden looking senile during the debate. It'll be burned into swing voters' minds and they'll never forget it. It might not move everyone, maybe not that much, but it'll deprive Biden of the momentum he needs WHEN HE'S ALREADY TRAILING. CBS' first post-debate poll, while it lacked topline numbers, showed that only 27% of Americans think Biden's fit to be President. That's not going to go away easily. And yes, the hour following the debate was Biden's best fundraising hour of the whole 2024 cycle, but money doesn't buy you love when a majority of the electorate  doesn't want you - just ask a few of the unsuccessful Democratic Senate candidates from 2020. 

Before you attempt to change my view, know two things:

1. Like I said, I'm trying to keep this strictly to the effect of Thursday night's debate on the election. While I believe the Israel-Palestine conflict is also a major threat to his reelection, that was baked in prior to this debate. The debate was Biden's last chance to turn things around prior to the convention (when he'd presumably be replaced, if it happens at all), and he made negative progress.

2. I am a Democrat who would vote for Biden even if he was literally in a coma because I don't want Trump to win. "
0,2024-06-30,CMV: LGBTQ+ people oppress themselves.,u/TurtleSoda69,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ds4cbb/cmv_lgbtq_people_oppress_themselves/,changemyview,"I'd like to start this off by saying that I am bisexual. I would also like to say that nobody knows that I'm bisexual unless I open my mouth and tell them. Please keep this in mind.

Firstly, there are people who cannot escape prejudices or systematic oppressions just by closing their mouth. 

The community created all of these flags, the different names, the different labels, the different spectrums, essentially everything possible to separate themselves from what is considered to be the norm. I understand that this is representation but if being gay or bi is
also normal, why are we separating ourselves from other people? It's directly contradicting.

That draws attention and creates nuance. If you're trying to make something blend in, painting it yellow and calling it a highlighter makes it stand out. I can't escape my skin color so I don't understand how there's this whole movement for something that you honestly can choose when you want to disclose.

Essentially what I'm trying to say is, there's no oppression unless you create oppression. *In this situation*

Like nobody is going to know my favorite color is green unless I tell them that and wear green all the time. Have pride for sure but it's a choice to adopt a label, it's a choice to tell people your lifestyle, it's a choice to make your lifestyle a personality trait. It is not a choice to wake up a certain skin color or a certain gender or in a certain place."

81,2024-06-30,CMV: Uninstalling a program on your computer should remove all the associated files for that program.,u/rangerguy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ds4xr3/cmv_uninstalling_a_program_on_your_computer/,changemyview,"When you uninstall a program (I use Windows but I assume it's true for other OS), oftentimes there will be residual files left over in your Appdata, Program Files, documents, even registry or wherever. Some of this information contains your user data and/or state of your program, so that if you reinstall you can pick up right where you left off. But I believe by default programs should completely clean up after themselves. If I uninstall a program, my intent is either to cease using it or to reinstall it due to some bug or malfunction. I don't want files left over in 10 different directories. In both situations, it would be better to completely remove all files. If I don't plan to use a program there is no reason to leave residual files cluttering up my storage. If I'm trying to fix something not working leaving files and settings can prevent a truly fresh install. 

An argument I can anticipate is that leaving these files can act as a backup or simply be more convenient if a user decides to install the program again. However, I believe uninstalling a program should not be a trivial decision. The user should be relatively sure in knowing they do not need the program or associated data. Nowadays many services run on cloud platforms where your data is stored and retrieved from anyways. Those that don't generally for reasons of simplicity, lightweightness, locality and privacy of data etc. would be even more in line with tighter control of a user's program's own files. 

My bottom line view that if changed will earn you a delta is that there is no reason that at the very least the user should have the option when uninstalling to completely nuke all of a program's files and settings from their computer. I also work in tech so while I don't have much experience in this area don't hesitate to provide more technical responses if necessary

To my understanding, the only reason why this is the case (at least for Windows programs) is that it is the responsibility of the program developers to take care of this as there is no built-in standard in Windows itself. Most developers however do not care to bother with this aspect of their app and Microsoft themselves do not bother to implement a system that would make it more standard for Windows program developers.

However for all it's popularity, the superhero genre is the ultimate definition of style and no substance. It is filled with nothing but recycled storylines and repetitve tropes. It is not realistic and you don't gain anything from it. There is a reason why Martin Scorsese says that superhero movies are theme parks and not cinema .

Of course due to some superhero media containing mature theme ans violence, you would think that means it's not for kids right? Well yes but it dosen't necessarily make it for adults either, it is made for rather immature people who want to feel mature. 

The violence and the cynical tone comes off as "" look at me, i'm not for kids, i'm realistic and mature"" rather than actually having substance that adults can appreciate. 

Really i don't see why any well stable and intelligent adult would ever have any interest in superhero media because it's not actually cinema or art.

I don't like trump as a person but he does have really good leadership qualities. The most important quality he has is that he doesn't make the same mistake twice. Even though he dodged some questions during the debate, he was still able to let Biden talk his was into embarrassment. That's what trump needed to do in 2020.

Trump will and has done anything policy related that the country needed while he was in office. Something needed to be done about the border crisis so he did something. Something needed to be done about china and their the games they been playing that hurt our economy, he dealt with it for once. 

Something needed to be done at the start of the pandemic too. He was able to do an acceptable job with handling it at the start. Not perfect by no means but no one really knew exactly what to do.

Trump is a douchebag and donr some really messed up things like cheating on his wife, but this by no means makes him a devil. He needs to do do better with speaking to others that oppose him, but I think he can get defensive because he gets verbally attacked by the media often. 

To go back on my main point. People that lean Left especially my generation (gen z) just say things   seen. online or on tv thats against him. The right does the same to Biden so that goes for everything. It's fine if you don't care for his policies but you need to understand him and his supporters. They voted for him for a reason and the reason I'm voting for him is because he does something about issues that need attention.

0,2024-06-30,CMV: criminalizing accidents leads to many unnecessary deaths,u/emetovnwodzlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ds7mrm/cmv_criminalizing_accidents_leads_to_many/,changemyview,"To be clear, I mean manslaughter charges which are about a negligent driver causing death.

The first reason is that if you are going to be criminalized anyways, you might as well try to run away without helping the victim. Giving a lighter sentence if the person stays will not help, because the chance of getting caught is a much bigger deterrent than the severity of the punishment (source 1), so a reckless driver will take the chance to escape. How many people died and could have been saved had first aid been administered immediately?

The second reason is that the money used to lock someone up could be used to have more traffic cops giving tickets. The cost of one inmate is almost 40k a year, which is very close to the cost of having an entry level officer on the roads at all times (source 3). Since the chance of having the punishment is a much better deterrent than something the driver thinks will never happen to him, the dangerous behavior that causes accidents will be deterred with much higher efficiency. 

The last reason is that if the driver does not face any other penalty, we can revoke his license, thus taking him off the roads for good. This means there is one less dangerous driver to worry about. Also, the person who caused the accident might drive recklessly to escape, potentially causing more accidents. Meanwhile, someone who managed to escape can easily go back to driving and endangering everyone.

Trump is a populist and his hyperbole and his rhetoric, all of his court cases, the whole show is a song and dance, it is a popular movement. Trump will get all conservative votes, he will get at least some of the anti-establishment votes and he will get all of the voters that break for whoever is the most popular.

I recently read a post(a photo of a fake clickbait twitter thing to be clear, this DID NOT happen) where apparently some man cut off the genitals of his daughter's rapist, cooked it, and fed it to the rapist. Let me make two things clear.

1. I¬†**hate**¬†rapists.
2. I also support human rights.

These things can both be true.

Now, when you look at the comment section, the people who somehow believed the post was real were calling the man a hero, and saying things like ""jury nullification"". This really confuses me. Rapists are bad people, but does being a bad person mean that people should have the right to do just¬†*anything*¬†to you?

My dislike for responses like these are twofold. First, the whole point of human rights is that they are unconditional. The worst serial killer will still get a fair trial-the judge can't say ""it's really obvious now throw them in jail"" You are not a hero or a good person for torturing people necessarily

Second, it's really hypocritical. I hope I explain this correctly but if I don't please tell me. You cannot say ""its okay to torture people I hate"" and then look at other people torturing people they hate and say ""wait that's bad"". This is \[special pleading\], isn't it? Consider public whippings of gay people in the middle east. The people in the comment section will certainly be okay with someone whipping some rapist or predator, but I would argue based on my experience with reddit that most of them would not be okay with the whipping of gay people. I don't think you can say, ""but pedophilia is ACTUALLY bad"" because the people supporting whipping gay people will say ""being gay is bad too""

I support gay people to be clear(Happy Pride Month)and I hope my message there is coming across correctly. Human rights aren't optional for me. There is no ""opt out program"". You cannot torture people, no matter what, or you should be put in a cell as well. That rapist(even though he doesn't exist) should theoretically just face justice, or the closest thing you can get to it.

So why do people celebrate people like this as heroes? Or is this an isolated incident or a joke I don't get? Thank you!"

Probably we would just end up creating new kinds of unproductive debates, but it could at least give us a chance to reboot our political and cultural conversations.

- - - - -

What do I mean by ""what we get""?

Well, every four years we are subjected to a reality TV style competition between two individuals, and that competition dominates much of our media content and our public conversations. The remaining political and cultural discourse is often squeezed through the lens of that two-person face-off, or is in some way brought back around to it.

For the last ten years, this phenomenon has mutated into an almost non-stop orgy of speculation, bickering, disillusionment, disbelief, outrage-bait media ""coverage"", choir preaching, low-effort memes, and personality politics. The only people who have anything to gain from the current state of affairs are media outlets and partisan diehards on both sides of the fence.

Talking about alternatives to first-past-the-post presidential elections isn't some huge lift here. It's a¬†*little*¬†complicated (and decidedly unglamorous) but it's also one of the few things that most people on both sides of the progressive/conservative cultural split could conceivably agree on.

We should be bringing it up constantly, at least just to say ""you know there are alternatives to this¬†*particular*¬†hell"". I don't expect the media or politicians to talk about it unless they're forced to, but it should be a much bigger part of any conversation about US presidential politics on Reddit, twitter, IRL, etc.

If we can't do that then we deserve to be stuck in this horrible samsara, forever wandering through an ideological amusement park where talking heads chatter ceaselessly and giant Biden- and Trump-shaped balloons block out the sun. If we can't at least ""put it on the agenda"", then we are reaping what we've sown by accepting an artificially polarized template for societal discourse.

- - - - -

Btw, maybe you want to tell me that getting rid of FPtP presidential elections in the US is impossible? My responses are as follows:

1. Even if that's true, then my CMV title still applies: we deserve what we get.
2. A bunch of other Western democracies have made it work to a greater or lesser degree - why is that not enough proof of it at least being possible?
3. Can you persuasively argue that it's impossible in America beyond merely stating it as ""a fact""?
4. Can you see how saying it's impossible is a self-fulfilling prophecy? What do we have to lose by at least talking about it as a serious option?

Digital coupons are a huge hassle and it is easy to make a mistake with them. It takes too much time to go through your phone ""clipping"" the coupons and it is easy to make a mistake when you do it. You have to write down all of the things you clip because the store may have not have sales stickers on these things. These are the best deals of the week but if you are not careful you will overpay by stocking up on a sale item when you have failed to clip the electronic coupon.

If a non-digital sale item has a sale tag on it, a dollar amount is usually highlighted with larger font. Sometimes that dollar amount represents how much you will ""save"" on the sale item but other times that amount represents the actual sale price of the item. You have to be careful to determine whether you are looking at a regularly priced $7 item is on sale for $2, or the $7 item is on sale for $5 so you are ""saving"" $2.

Different brands sell things in different amounts. For example syrup might come in a bottle that has 20 oz. or 28 oz.. This makes it harder to compare prices. The everyday price stickers on the shelves appear to break down the prices for us but converting the total price to the price per a given unit. The problem is they don't all use the same unit. One price sticker will break down the price to show us how much we pay per ounce and another will show us what we would pay per pound or quart. Why aren't all like items broken down to the same size unit so we can easily see the ""per ounce"" cost on every bottle of syrup? The lack of consistency often makes the sticker breakdowns useless and misleading.

I doubt if even the most careful shopper, spending much more time than should be necessary, could fill a large order without making mistakes related to the sales items. In addition, many elderly or infirm lack the tech ability to navigate the digital deals. Basically, the stores have made grocery shopping much, much harder than it ever has been or ever should be."

I know that is not the typical way to do it but most people don't think about it much and mindlessly add the cereal first. ...       

I have occasionally poured the cereal first but regretted it because then I can't tell how much milk is in the bowl because the cereal is blocking it.          
 If there is too much milk, then there's not enough cereal flavor, and if there is not enough milk then it is too dry.

0,2024-06-30,CMV: People calling india a facist and ethnostate have no idea about its legal system and hence shouldn't give their opinion before knowing all the facts,u/InternationalKale368,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dsaql5/cmv_people_calling_india_a_facist_and_ethnostate/,changemyview,"Lets start with 1947,  India is divided on the basis of religion. Muslims got an islamic republic and if we are to follow this logic India should have been a hindu republic but it chose secularism but it's secular only on paper. 

1- Muslims who stayed back in India got sharia in a so called ""secular"" country where they are ""allegedly"" oppressed

2- Next Congress gave Muslims the waqf board act which literally states that the waqf board can take any property which they ""feel"" is a property of the waqf. Exploiting this law waqf board became the third largest landholders in India and this act also has a clause which says a person cannot go to a court to dispute their decision. The latest example of this law being used was when the waqf board took over an entire hindu temple in TN state of India which is older than their religion. 

3- Under the Constitution Muslims, Christians got the explicit freedom to promote their way of education. They even get funding to do so by the government meanwhile hindu schools are shadow banned. 

4- Government controls Hindu temples and taxes them and using this money madarasas are  funded. Meanwhile Churches, Mosques and Gurudwaras are controlled by their respective boards

5- India provides a Haj subsidy and travel spaces for Muslims there's no such subsidy for Hindu pilgrims 

6- The Constitution provides provisions for establishment of only Christian or muslim residential societies exclusively for their community meanwhile no hindu can do it. 

7- Muslims and other minorities are given reservation and scholarships to study abroad. 

8- The Indian government and to a larger extent international media tried and successfully hid several crimes against hindus Eg- kashmir pandit genocide/exodus. And the fact that no one talks about Godhra train burning which was the reason for 2002 Gujarat riots. 

9- If Muslims are so ""oppressed"" Then how come they behead people every second day and how come the judiciary reduce their sentences because they are offering ""namaz"". Eg- Odisha High court reduced the sentence of 2 muslim men who were convicted of rape and murder of a 6 year old because they were offering "" Namaz""

10- The Indian state of West Bengal and bihar daily experiences violence against hindus and hindu women by illegal rohingya and bangladeshi immigrants. An example from today- a women and a man were beaten by Muslims after being caught having an affair they were brutally beaten with sticks because it was ""sharia complaint"" and WB is  a ""muslim society"". Also the recent case of mass sexual exploitation of hindu women by an illegal bangladeshi immigrant- Sheikh Shahjahan in the WB district of Sandeskhali. 

11- There are more than 50m estimated illegal immigrants in India more than 80% of them are muslim but if we want to deport them we are ""facists"". Can someone explain me how this works exactly? 

12- Muslims construct illegal mosques on railway stations encroach on government land but when these mosques are demolished they start rioting Eg- haldwani riots by illegal bangladeshi immigrants. 

13- Now I know you all are going to say ""only Muslim houses are demolished"" No it's not the case it's blatantly false even hindu temples and houses who were constructed illegaly have been demolished but no media tells that cause how it will fit their oppression narrative. 

14- in last 10 years more muslims have gained housing, education, population growth than any other religion. Their participation in civil services has also increased upto 10% 

I am denying the increasing hatred against them but when one section of the society (especially when it's in majority and had to lose its land to the same community) are being systematically and legally oppressed in favor of minority appeasement you can't expect them to be patient. We want equal laws in India, a country we founded after giving away two chunks to let them form a sharia nation. 

I am ready to accept I am in the wrong if anyone can counter my above points"

29,2024-06-30,CMV: capital gains should be taxed at the regular income rate.,u/ppmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dscb2m/cmv_capital_gains_should_be_taxed_at_the_regular/,changemyview,"Capital gains taxes are much less than income tax. especially for people with huge capital gains.  We have many people that don't actively contribute to society, but live of largess left over from their ancestors or lucky investments, which is fine, but they don't deserve a tax break for this.  

I think that if you have capital gains and income, then the capital gains tax should only be enforced up to the limit of your real income, everything after that amount should be relegated to income tax.  Example: If you make 40k in income and 80 k in capital gains/investment., then you pay regular tax on 40k for income, capital gains tax on your first 40k of capital gains and then  regular tax on the remaining 40k.

CMV: Excessive capital gains should be taxed at the regular income rate."

0,2024-06-30,CMV: Bicycles do not belong on the road regardless of what the law says,u/SlimFlippant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dscibn/cmv_bicycles_do_not_belong_on_the_road_regardless/,changemyview,"I sincerely believe that people who ride their bike on the road with cars have a small (or not so small) part of them that does not care if they die.  Especially when they're going the same direction with traffic and can't even see what's coming up behind them.  Not only is it dangerous for the cyclist, but it is an unnecessary liability for drivers.  I'm not excusing drivers not paying attention, but if a tire pops or tie rod snaps, that extra 3-5 feet could be the difference between the driver regaining control before they hit you or not.  I am including bike lanes in my definition of ""the road"" because a drunk driver or out of control vehicle is not going to be stopped by a painted white line.



Exceptions:

1. Large groups of long-distance cyclists traveling together.  They may be annoying as all hell but that's a separate conversation, and they're easily visible and riding at a higher speed than your average street bicycle.

2. Dense urban areas where people are not only driving slower but there are huge numbers of pedestrians to avoid and many more people use bikes to commute.



It's in suburban areas like the one I live in where I will see someone riding in the bike lane of a long 60mph road with a perfectly good sidewalk literally right next to them with zero pedestrians, where I wonder how any logical human being wouldn't make the self-preserving choice to get further away from traffic.  I live in Florida so the drivers are extra spicy, and we don't have inspections, so people are driving around in vehicles in all sorts of disrepair where a catastrophic malfunction is more probable.



Addressing the potential rebuttals:

""It's called a sideWALK""  yes, people skateboard, roller blade, one-wheel, and utilize all sorts of alternative transportation methods on the sideWALK and the law says nothing about it.  

""A bicycle is legally considered a vehicle"" sure, and you aren't any more protected on a bike than you are on any of the other things I listed above.

""People don't want run-ins with law enforcement"" this is the most understandable reason to me, but my entire premise here is that I disagree with the law.  Smoke your weed before you leave your house if you don't wanna get caught with it.  Either way, it's being judged by 12 or carried by 6.

""Obstacles or pedestrians get in the way"" see the exceptions above for pedestrians.  The cool thing about bicycles is they are also easier to maneuver and can go on grass, so don't act like that foot-wide telephone pole is stopping you from utilizing a 5 foot wide sidewalk.

I have a terrible feeling that the USA is going to have a civil war, no matter who wins the election. There is so much on the line for both sides, including freedom and liberty.

Either a guerrilla uprising or a full-blow nation wide revolt, this will most likely destroy American power and lead to Socialists or Communists gaining the majority of the Gen Z population to sway to their side, while older generations might stick with (fascist) Trump and Project 2025.

But I will garentee there will be nationwide upset whoever wins. And when the civil war starts, I am moving to Argentina or Poland.

So, the current 2 party system is not gonna reform itself, and the leaderships are out of touch mummies from the time of Thutmose, if Biden wins, the DNC will keep playing its game, the RNC elders will try to whether the Trump storm or absorb some of it, I.e nothing changes.

Trump winning means he takes over the RNC for good, it will be a catastrophe for the DNC and probably the country, for a time.. but eventually his presence will fade, but both the DNC and RNC will have to reform, maybe we get a progressive party and a sane republican party at least down the road.

That's it. I don't think Trump can turn the country to a monarchy or that more SCOTUS appointments would be more damaging than we already have, but at least the DNC will have to cater to young voters to regain any appeal.

0,2024-06-30,CMV: The SPECIFICS of morality are societal pressure and nothing more ,u/hydrochlorodyne,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dsero1/cmv_the_specifics_of_morality_are_societal/,changemyview,"Humanity as a species is hardwired to have morals, much as humans are hardwired to communicate and reproduce etc, it is an instinct. But the specifics of these are entirely up to social pressure and have no actual backing outside of a social context.

Morals vary so widely between society to society that it is impossible to say what is good or bad if you divorce yourself from the context that you are in. Many societies in the past have valorized dying a bloody death in war, or sexual contact between adult men and boys (Ancient Greece) or sacrificing your children for your own benefit. Existing societies and subcultures today idolize dying in a terrorist attack for god or race or nation, or approve of circumcision or female genital mutilation or child marriage. As we think subcultures who deviate from our moral norms are awful, these past societies would have thought us awful, and by their own standpoint - who are we to say in that we, (i'm assuming western as i am western) 21st century westerners, are the first people in the world to actually be good?

Religious morality is of course social pressure. It is agreed to because the society agreed to it, it enforces it through scripture and church and doctrine. In a society that falls out of belief, religious morality is pointless - though this is of course different if you are a believer and I am not.

Secular morality is also social pressure, though it doesn't pretend to have any logic behind it. It is bad because we say it is and we have no further answers on the topic.

There is no actual genuine backing or logic to any moral system outside of the instinct to have any one of them and the pressure from those around you. It is just as ""logical"" to completely spurn existing systems of morality for your own that appeals to you because you feel it does."

I stopped using dating apps earlier this year and I feel like it improved my mental health quite a bit.

If you are someone who uses dating apps with the intent of dating or meeting a potential future partner, you are putting yourself in a subpar position where someone is either simply ""rejecting"" you by sliding their finger to the left or is initially content with you by sliding their finger to the right. This very basic process is determined by someone first seeing if you are appealing to them through a photo(s)  and maybe (hopefully) skimming through whatever choice things you decide to list about yourself to see if you can connect on another level other than appearance. Even if you do both swipe right on each other and ""match"", it is pretty typical that you will be more eager than the person you matched with who is most of the time either going to make no attempt at all to connect further (aka not respond within the first few messages) or will provide mediocre replies that essentially facilitate the end to a conversation (short, non-thought provoking responses and/or showing no interest in getting to know you). 

  
I expect at least a few replies to be something along the lines of ""it is up to you to determine your own value and not rely on other peoples opinion"" which I do agree with, but I also think it is much wiser to remove yourself from the situation I described above by taking initiative to put yourself out there more (think meetup groups and generally trying new hobbies that can encourage socializing) so that worst case scenario you improve your social skills and best case scenario you end up meeting someone you want to be with.
