Let me explain. The pinky is not very strong but its very mobile because it sits on the end of our hand and therefore doesnt have to bump into other fingers as much

The pointer finger is much stronger yet equally as flexible as the pinky because it doesnt have to share real estate with our off-set thumb

The middle finger is strong but not flexible. Hell i see many people struggle to make a middle finger gesture let alone wiggle it side to side. The ring finger is a bit dubious but its usually a solid middle ground betweem stront and flexible, but its not as intuitive as the pointer finger"

But I still find it interesting.

Let's say you ask your mom for more rice at the dinner table and she tells you that you can have more, as long as you don't take too much. Of course, if you put too much rice on your plate, she will tell you that's it's too much. But what is the exact quantity of rice where it goes from enough, to too much?

For better understanding, let's say you can go back in time every time you serve your rice portion and your mom tells you that you have enough rice. You would then go back in time and add one more rice grain to your plate, and see if your mom tells you that it's too much. You would continue doing this thousands of times, until you reach a point where adding one more grain of rice triggers your mom to say that it's too much.

What is the exact moment and how does your mom know that it's too much compared to the one with one grain of rice less? We can even take it a step further and use a soup instead of rice. What is the exact quantity of milliliters or even microliters where your mom goes from enough soup to too much soup? Please tell me I was not the only kid who used to ask this question."

GPT4 is supposed to fix a lot of inconsistencies however that's not a guarantee that it's going to be factual data you receive and not just 'well that's what I deduced from the data I have'.

On the same note, people who 'fake it till I make it' plays the part from what they know about said part in a relationship/job/otherwise and continually improve due to positive and negative responses until they are actually in that part...

The youth of our present age is melting into an amber of ingenuity and filth. The hunger for cruelty and lackluster content has reached its highest peak. This peak casts a thick shadow over our world and it will only get bigger, until the engulfing of our dear blue sky destroys the last remaining remnant of awe. We, as a collection of thoughtful minds have the duty to fight against this treachery at our gates. In a world muddled with media and opinion it is difficult to relay an expounding message across the globe, to reach our youth, and to classify the filth that has plagued their minds.   
The message is Re-evaluation. Evaluate everything in your personal spectrum. What are you truly seeking? Have you reached a nirvana of senses? Or has this stage of nirvana fascination fooled you into believing that this is it and no further thought process is required? If you have reached a point where thinking is not necessary to achieve the pleasurable bliss you have found, then something is terribly wrong. Your mind suffers each day from malnutrition. Lack of substance has plagued and suffocated your mind into a catacomb of hallow hallways, thickened with the furthest substance from a solid. Nothing to grip, nothing to grasp and cherish. A melting amber of pulsating pleasure and indulgence has plagued your thought process. Cleanse your pallet and seek the truth beyond the flashy colors of fast scenery and towering egotistical acts that present a false and ingenuine representation of culture. Break out of this layer and begin to carve your true purposeful existence. Carve and mold yourself into a being of intellectual thought and mindfulness. Here, in the wake of pure thought, is where the absolute mission of seeking begins, and the change will begin to pave its path."

A. A thesis, put forth to others to make the person’s point in the discussion

B. ‘A row’, shouting, aggressive, confrontational, disagreement in very extreme ways, to the point of anger

Surely a mature civilisation would view the concept of an ‘argument’ to be wholly positive, because it means there is vibrant and lively discourse all the time, on massive scale about how to continue to improve the Nirvanic society we have evolved to, and keep it getting better. Therefore, the word just wouldn’t be associated with an alternative meaning which has overtones of aggression and violence.

In that kind of advanced society, perhaps a synonym for ‘Arguement’ would be something majestic and positive like ‘Chorus, angelic harmony of ultimate divinity intertwined in the lyrics and lullabies of the most beautiful songs ever written’."

This fact is that while you're chained to your employee, they're performing to the limits of a given manager's expectations.  However, innovation, creativity, or sheer talent often see employees exceed, or shatter said limits.  When you think about it, this is output left on the table, production left on the table, and most importantly, unrealized profit left on the table.  I understand why managers may think that it's the best route, however, by joining yourself to the hips of your subordinates, you're effectively utilizing two people for one job that can be done by one person.  One qualified person, and one overqualified person.  


Wouldn't you rather learn to explain better and more consistent and give your employee the opportunity to fail / succeed?  More often than not, they will surprise you..."

Diamonds are made out of ONLY Carbon. In order for a diamond to form from Carbon it just needs several Carbon atoms.

When we breathe, we inhale oxygen and our lungs convert that into Carbon dioxide, which we then exhale out into the world.

Carbon dioxide has Carbon atoms in it.

When the Carbon dioxide goes out into the world, it mixes with carbon dioxide that others breathed out into the world.

That’s a mix of Carbon aka diamond.

So then surely if a scientist were to breathe into a sealed container that can take heat such as a test tube with only an entry point (like the ones used for blood tests) and then heat the test tube at a high enough temperature, wouldn’t it make microscopic diamonds from the carbon exhaled, heated and pressurised in the container?

By the way 1 carat of Diamond weighs 0.200 grams or 1/5 gram.
A tiny spec of diamond smaller than 1 gram."

1,2024-01-20,Recipes are why people hate cooking,u/Dawguard,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/19bst3w/recipes_are_why_people_hate_cooking/,Showerthoughts,"Cooking from a recipe involves researching what you want, finding a recipe which looks good and you can make, and shopping for the specific ingredients. In the end, unless you know some basic cooking techniques the result isn't as good as you expected, and you end up with excess ingredients that slowly accumulate until you have to throw them out.  It's just too much effort for too little reward. However, if you know some basic cooking skills and don't need to look up most recipes, then cooking is a breeze. Just mindlessly toss some things together and in half the time of reading/following instructions you can get something twice as good.  


If you want to get someone to enjoy cooking, keep them away from recipes, at least at the begining."
