69,2024-01-29,"The government using facial recognition technology on it's citizens was always science fiction, well guess what? It's not science fiction anymore. There's a company called Clearview that's literally collecting all public photos of everyone off the internet, they're even collecting photos of kids",u/superdude500,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1aedipy/the_government_using_facial_recognition/,technology,"So there's a company called Clearview and they're literally collecting all public photos from the internet of everyone, including children. So Clearview literally has billions upon billions of photos of people (including children) which they've gleaned from the internet. Here read this real quick

""Recently, Clearview announced that it was on track to have 100 billion face prints in its database within a year, enough to ensure ‚Äúalmost everyone in the world will be identifiable.‚Äù These images ‚Äî equivalent to 14 photos for each of the 7 billion people on Earth ‚Äî would enable covert and remote surveillance of Americans on a scale unlike anything seen before. Reports suggest that neither the U.S. government nor any American company has ever compiled such a massive trove of biometrics.""

I mean we're headed toward a surveillance state where Big Brother will be watching our every move. And I want you to understand this, facial recognition tech was something that was always in the realm of sci-fi but now it's a full blown reality! As citizens we are giving our government too much control over our lives.

This is creepy, Clearview is collecting photos of everyone on the planet! Including our children! And the authorities in the USA are using Clearview to bust criminals. This is a slippery slope though, the potential for abuse of this technology is extraordinary.

Here's a quote from Benjamin Franklin one of the founding fathers of the USA ""Those who would give up liberty for safety deserve neither""

As of right now law enforcement in the USA is using facial recognition from Clearview. We need to demand our government to ban facial recognition, it is a huge invasion of our privacy. What are we slaves to the government?

""The government is going to use facial recognition more. That‚Äôs bad."" https://www.popsci.com/technology/gao-report-facial-recognition-federal-government/

You gotta admit a company collecting photos of literally everyone on Earth, including children, for the purposes of providing facial recognition to the government is kinda creepy. How much control do we want to give to the government?

Yes facial recognition can be used to bust criminals but in my opinion, we are giving the government too much power, they will have the ability to track us wherever we go. We need to say no to this.

Oh, one more thing. In addition to face recognition there's also something called gait recognition technology. They can now track you just by the way you walk, they can literally identify you just by the way you walk using AI. Seriously, we're headed toward the book 1984 which is a book about mass surveillance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four

There are calls to ban this stuff.

""Enough is Enough. Tell Congress to Ban Federal Use of Face Recognition"" https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/enough-enough-tell-congress-ban-federal-use-face-recognition

""Cities and counties across the country have banned government use of face surveillance technology, and many more are weighing proposals to do so. From Boston to San Francisco, Jackson, Mississippi to Minneapolis, elected officials and activists know that face surveillance gives police the power to track us wherever we go.""
