170,2023-12-31,"CMV: ""Black coded characters"" are at best stupid and at worst racist",u/Applesauceoutoflove,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18vkjp3/cmv_black_coded_characters_are_at_best_stupid_and/,changemyview,"So today I watched a video about Steven Universe while eating and the creator of said video said that ""Steven Universe is racist because it treats Garnet in a certain way and Garnet is black coded"" and I just wondered what the term actually means. I saw it get thrown around with Darwin from The Amazing World Of Gumball but never really looked into it.

I saw a few different interpretations, but I just go into two

One is that the character is voiced by a black person. This is stupid. So can a character be white coded? If a black person voices a white human character, is that character also black coded? What does that even mean, Garnet is a purple rock alien lmao

The second one and far more racist one is that.. its just a vibe? Like the way they act? It was extremely vague but in Garnets case I read something along the lines of ""She has a no-shit character"" and ""a third eye to see through the bullshit"" like yeah. She is presented as a level-headed, stoic, intelligent, competent leader. How are these traits ""black"", I can name you several white characters with these traits. And as I just mentioned Drawin from Gumball is black coded by a lot of people and he is literally the excat opposit of all of these traits. Its almost like there are no skin color specific traits, crazy how that works and I also mainly see this term thrown around in childrens media.

The term is pretty saying ""Well that character is clearly black because they act different, they are different from white characters, all or most black people have this specific trait, thats what makes them different"" which is racist. 

The term is at best a annoying buzzword with nothing to it and at worst problematic and racist itself."
1,2023-12-31,"CMV: Capitalism, though flawed, is practically the best method of resource allocation.",u/BlackDahliaMuckduck,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18vkmq7/cmv_capitalism_though_flawed_is_practically_the/,changemyview,"Though capitalism is imperfect, I'm hard pressed to understand a workable system that is better. The only practical alternatives of which I'm aware are controlled economies (government price setting) or communal ones (prohibition on private property). I suppose the abolition/destruction of resources is theoretically perfect, as there would be nothing to allocate, though obviously impractical. 

Price setting is complex. In order to set an accurate price, both supply and demand must be known. This means understanding both the means of production (and input materials, labor, etc.) as well as the needs and available resources of each potential buyer. A theoritally correct price would take all of these factors into consideration and the historical track record for governments setting prices is poor, leading me to conclude that it's an unworkable solution.

Prohibiting private property and forcing property into public ownership (communal) is problematic because it only works if everybody agrees to it. This is a better alternative to capitalism which doesn't work at scale, making it impractical. A small commune where everyone is on the same page may find value in this method, but a large nation will inevitably have dissenters, rendering the system oppressive through its lack of individualism. Even communes have individual boundaries, such as my nieghbor is not free to burn down my residence while I'm living in it. (Though I suppose I could just as easily move into the arsonist's residence at no cost.)

Capitalism's flaws include the anti-trust paradox, the subjectivity of certain resources, the inheritance problem, scamming, and greed cycles.

Anti-trust: As popularized by Robert Bork, the more regulated a monopolized industry is, the more paradoxically monopolistic it becomes. He argues that this is because regulation presents an increased barrier to entry, thus reducing competition by filtering out potential competitors who do not have the resources to clear the barrier to entry and enter the industry, making it even less competitive.

Subjective Resources: Some resources cannot be quantified, and therefore price setting is not an applicable method of allocating the resource. Human life, for example, is quantified by the life insurance industry by projecting a person's future income. Reducing a person's value to a dollar figure provides an incomplete picture of their worth because they have many sourcecs of intangible value, such as their relationships, their ideas, their experiences, etc. Governments may combat this issue with welfare programs, but those programs generally also assign dollar values based on an individual's situation, such as people with disabilities receiving a certain amount of money, families with lots of children receiving a certain amount in tax breaks, etc.

Inheritance: Capitalism provides the wealthy with greater influence over resource allocation. Wealth is indirectly correlated to price sensitivity; i.e. the more money you have, the more you're willing to spend it without feeling the pain. This still works theoretically because the people who earn the most money have provided a valuable resource to society in order to obtain it and therefore should be able to effectively decide how future resources are to be allocated. However, in reality, large sums of wealth often get passed down upon death and inherited by a person who did not provide value to society, and therefore does not understand how to allocate resources effectively. For example, kids who inherit large sums of money tend to blow it quickly, just like lottery winners, who have demonstrably worse lives after winning the lottery and are ineffective in the allocation of their lottery winnings. Note: Some may also argue that the government has no moral right to tell individuals how their private recources ought to be allocated.

Scamming: Capitalism provides an incentive for dishonesty, namely obtaining money without providing value in return. If the government is unable to crack down an scammers, then the only recourse is for consumers to band together to combat scammers (which may be impossible or difficult depending on the situation).

Cycles of Greed: Capitalist markets have gone through historical cycles of prosperity (euphoria/greed) and austerity (fear). Instead of markets remaining at a steady equilibrium with gradual changes, they tend to overshoot in both directions, exacerbating both the positive and negative effects on either end of the spectrum. In the case of euphoria, people live high on the hog, giving in to greed and excess, thus acting wastefully. In the case of austerity, people in fear go without, causing unnecessary harm and devaluing consumers who ought to have been able to access certain resources, yet are no longer able to. In both cases, the allocation of resources is inefficient.

Ultimately, prices are prohibitive; they require a cost to be paid in order to obtain a resource, ensuring that resources are allocated to the people who need them the most, i.e. are willing and able to pay for them (in the capitalist context). If prices are not prohibitive, then resources will be misallocated because waste will no longer be seen as painful, there is no cost to be paid. Capitalism harnesses individual selfishness (getting the best deal for one's self and avoiding steep costs) in order to promote the greater good (allocating resources across a society in the least wasteful way possible via pricing).

The invisible hand is our best option. There is no practical economic system which is better at allocating resources than capitalism because no system fixes the flaws of capitalism without introducing more egregious flaws of its own."

We are animals, and no other species lives in the delusion which we do. Our consciousness is not some special gift. Yes, humans through this consciousness have produced and realised some beautiful things. But these are merely distractions from the brutality of reality, not the answer to suffering. ""Love"" will conquer jack shit in the long run. Most people are hypocritical assholes, and we are all susceptible to immorality because that is literally our nature.

There is no exclusivity and you can say ""happy new year"" to anyone you meet without making them feel left out or alienated. Even if they celebrate new year at a different time than you, they are welcome to experience yours as well without any (well, very minimal) religious baggage.

New year is not the anniversary of something that happened in a book, its not about a historical event. Its a completely arbitrary moment. The thing that gives New Year meaning is not your belief in anything or your belonging to anything. But in fact, this gives it more meaning than any other holiday. Its meaning comes from the simple fact that we all experience it together, however insignificant of a moment it is.

I come from a Christian culture, so my runner-up will naturally be Christmas. But Christmas alienates me more and more as I get older. The pressure to give gifts, the strange social implications, the politicization of ""Merry Christmas"" and ""Happy Holidays"", the Santa decorations and fake snow and big flashing signs for sales and things that I need to spend money on. 

And the Christmas music. In 2000 years of Jesus none of us have managed to think of a good song about it. The best we ever came up with was Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas is You"".

New Years has the best holiday song ever written, possibly the greatest song ever written. Auld Lang Syne is such a great song you cannot find a good recording of it on youtube. Auld Lang Syne exists in your heart, and to hear it performed properly you need to get drunk with a large group of strangers. You will be moved to tears for reasons you don't understand, because you are experiencing the pain, loss, optimism, regret, and joy of all of the events of the past year experienced by everyone you sing with.

""Happy New Year"" acknowledges that we, as strangers, know nothing about eachother. I don't know what your year was like, you don't know what mine was like. But we both experienced a year, and we are both about to experience another. I hope yours is happy.

People look back, look forward, or don't think about the day at all. But we all do those things at the same time. Happy new year.

CMV by convincing me another holiday is better, and I promise to start celebrating it."

Few (but not all) reasons include: 

- no periods

- dads get wayyyyyy more slack than mom in society 
- higher pay for the same job 
- physically stronger (and faster) on average 
- more respected in society 
- everything is designed for male bodies (ppe and airbags) so they are less likely to get injured 


Atp i feel like there are Litterally no benefits to being a female or all the “benifits” are useless/ have drawbacks

My entire life I’ve felt as though i got the “short end of the stick” or whatever cuz ik that whatever i do, a man can probably do better (especially in terms of sports/ working out). 

Any advantages that women have over men are useless as mentioned. This could be that they see colour better or that they have better hearing. Ofc you need those things but imo, strength is more important than that. And overall i think that mens bodies are superior to womans bodies"

Europe wasin the perfect position to dominate the world, it has some of the best climate and farmland in the world.

Toyotas are pretty basic and boring. There is never anything special about them, they are usually one of the last car companies to introduce a new technology into their vehicles. For the same price of a Toyota you can buy a Volkswagen that is faster, has a nicer interior, and has better tech. But what Toyota does offer is its reliability, they just work when you need them to. This causes them to have very high resale value compared to other cars. Volkswagen doesn’t have that same reliability. 

That is similar to iPhone, in that for the same price as an iPhone you can buy a Samsung that has a bigger screen, faster processor, and way more features. iPhones are boring and basic and just do what you need them to do without adding any fluff. And because of their simplicity they are more reliable because of it. iPhones on average have a [4-8 lifespan whereas Samsungs only have a 3-6 year lifespan](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/average-lifespan-of-smartphone).

Although I’d prefer it not happen, the consequences of leaving him off primary ballots is not nearly as big as a general election ballot.

However, when it comes to the general election, he should not be left off.

I have 3 assumptions and 5 reasons I have this stance and I will flesh it out here.

Assumption 1: Donald Trump wins the GOP primary 

Assumption 2: The charges against Donald Trump do not change, and the evidence does not change significantly 

Assumption 3: SCOTUS actually allows states to do this (which I think this is 50/50).

Reason 1: Donald Trump has plausible deniability for the events of January 6th. There is no way around that. You can think whatever you want about what he did (and for what it’s worth, he acted disgustingly), but the fact is that he did tell his supporters to go home, and there is no evidence of him directing riot leaders. 

I would change my mind on this reason if there emerges some sort of direct evidence that he directed 1/6 rioters. To me, the ‘inflammatory language’ is normal political speech (eg. fight, take back, etc etc), or at least can be argued that way.

While you might think that trump incited a riot on 1/6, plausible deniability does exist. He and his lawyers have made this case and in a vacuum, it is compelling. Take off your ideological goggles and look at it objectively. To count trump as a traitor based on the 14th amendment, you have to make a series of assumptions that are not clear. If you respond to this post going after this first reason, I will likely not change my mind. 

While the first reason in of itself (if you accept it) should not disqualify him from the ballot, I will give 4 further reasons that it is a bad idea even IF I concede reason 1 to you (for the sake of discussion).

Reason 2: Removing one of the two major parties from the ballot is completely unprecedented, and if that precedent is set, do not be surprised if in the future, it is used in ways you don’t like.

Reason 3: You are picking a fight that is completely inconsequential. It is highly unlikely that he would be taken off the ballot in states that he would be a favorite in. So you just enflame tensions further for no real gain other than owning the trump supporters. 

Reason 4: If supporters have no agency to select a candidate at the ballot box, they have no options left to engage in politics other than violence. 

Reason 5: In the 1860 election, Abraham Lincoln did not make the ballot of many of the southern states. While circumstances were different, removing candidates from the ballot would erode the democracy that you claim to protect."

Monogamous fidelity is a concept that was originally made from religious ideologies, though I accept that it is probably better for the taboo to exist, maybe people will start to consider the expectation of fidelity a hinderance to sexual freedom and people will start protesting through rampant unapolegitic cheating. Eventually everybody starts believing that they have no right to stop someone else's sexual freedoms. Currently open relationships do exist but these have honest participants, however infidelity involves lying manipulation and other bad things(or maybe not if these values are themselves to be challenged). But maybe later expecting even honesty for their sexual behaviours be considered a breach of privacy.

We've supposedly become inattentive goldfish unable to focus on anything, incapable of engaging with substantial content, instead succumbing to instant gratification and immediate fulfilment.

Many point to the rise of TikTok & other short videos as a symptom of this disease. This ""evidence"" is cherrypicking. I'm sick how uncritically accepted this trope has become.

It ignores the numerous flourishing examples of popular long-form content, some of which can reach movie lengths or even exceed it. It ignores the exploding growth in audiobook sales. It ignores the popularity of lengthy podcasts. They may not be reddit's favourite people, but podcasters like Joe Rogan & Lex Fridman command audiences of millions of listeners for podcasts often exceeding 2 hours. It ignores many long-form videos that populate Youtube; multi-hour video essays, reviews, documentaries, and tutorials. There's a beginner Python tutorial on Youtube with 40M views lasting 4 hours. Is that indicative of a culture of instant gratification, of viewers unable to focus on content requiring an attention span over 60 seconds? It ignores livestreams that can command a significant audience for hours, amounting to billions of hours in total watch time. You could almost propose those viewers have attention spans that are too long. The audience of all this long-form content, like TikTok & its competitors, skews young. Sometimes overwhelmingly so. 

So what accounts for the common complaints that people can't focus on anymore?

What I think technology has actually done is reduce tolerance for poorly made, unengaging, uninteresting, uninspired, and/or boring content since its more vulnerable to being supplanted than ever before. Prior to the digital era, individuals had fewer options for entertainment and information. This 'patience' was not necessarily a longer attention span, but a lack of alternatives. Attention has always wandered when things are boring or subpar. Today, there is both an awareness of better alternatives and ease to access them on-demand. Note that 'better' doesn't refer to just being entertaining, though that *can* & *should* contribute to quality. If effectively presented, substantive in-depth information on interesting topics can also successfully engage people, as my earlier examples demonstrate.

I think many who complain about lower attention spans are misdiagnosing the problem. The problem is not with the audience's attention span, but with their own tedious unengaging communication. They communicate without regard for whether it has the quality that deserves to capture & retain the audience's attention. They should look at themselves rather than shifting the blame to the audience. If you're one of these people, I'm sorry, but your communication & presentation skills probably suck.

To summarise: while many say technology reduced attention spans, I think it just decreased tolerance for subpar content. Rather than blaming 'decreased attention spans', the focus should instead be on improving communication to retain audience attention."

I think most _humans_ are highly intelligent (in different ways!) but were just conditioned to behave in certain ways/express certain things that make them _seem_ less intelligent than they actually are. In other words, not “stupid”, but “misguided”.

I think it happens when you put success and intelligence in the same box too. You could have someone with brilliant ideas that is so incredibly bad at articulating them properly, and as a result they’re humiliated out of confidence to follow their own goals. Or you could have a comedian who says and does silly things all the time and is never taken seriously, but in truth they’re intelligent and just humble. Or, even someone who’s incredibly loud and arrogant but once you put their obnoxious ego aside, you see that their words come from a place of insecurity not idiocy. 

Understanding is so scarce nowadays. People are so quick to judge. I get it, no one has the time to sit and hear out someone’s life story. But it’s so narrow-minded to take someone’s mental capacity at face value. 

Or, maybe this is common knowledge and I’m just behind."
1,2024-01-01,CMV: The sale of organs should be legal,u/Guilty-Hope1336,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18vt82j/cmv_the_sale_of_organs_should_be_legal/,changemyview,"One of my most radical political opinions is that organ sale should be completely legal. It should of course, be regulated so that people aren't taken advantage of and the rich don't get a monopoly on organs. But it should be legal. Like organ wait times are insane for people, something like 3-5 years for a kidney, and if allowing people to sell their organs lowers this wait time, then we should do it. 

The biggest argument I have heard is that the poor will be coerced into selling their organs because they need money. But then why shouldn't they be able to? It's their body, they should be able to do with it what they want. If they want to use it make money, why should we stop them? If it will save a life, why should we stop them? 

I also find the argument of commodification stupid. Just because it feels uncomfortable doesn't mean anything. People sell their labour and thus, their muscle strength in physically demanding jobs like construction. People in Universities sell their ideas and, thus their brain power. You can also sell your sperm. Why should we treat organs differently? We all sell some portion of ourselves to make money, so why not organs?

My preferred system would be that people sell their organs to the government, who pays them a fair price and the organs will be distributed by the triage system, as is currently utilised. This way we can ensure that the people who truly need organs can get them, not just those who can pay more. But I would also allow people to sell their organs to a specific individual, if they so choose. This would also apply to blood and bone marrow."

Reddit seems like a platform that draws people into debate, something in itself which has great potential. However, the current upvote system seems to give the impression that bad faith rhetoric is often superior to good faith discussions.

 Laying out well drawn points, providing evidence, any attempt at actually provoking thought which may be contrary to the beliefs of a particular subreddit seem easily dismantled by anyone who may respond to a thoughtful comment or post with a simple point and snarky remark. They do not have to actually engage with the point at all, as long as their response has the appearance of a moral high ground, properly straw-mans the post/comment, maybe ridicules it for its extensive thoughtfulness, and adds a cheeky remark intended to invalidate the commenter for good measure. 

I have often had thoughtful comments and arguments upvoted even in subreddits where it challenges norms, because at the moment of replying comments are seen in their proper context. However, after minutes/hours onslaughts of downvotes come, because as people now visit the discussion at a certain point context and truthfulness is lost and only the optics of who bested who in rhetoric or who seems to be on the ‘right,’ side remains."

I don't think he's the legend or GOAT he loves reminding everyone he is. Let's put that aside, no changing my view there.

CMV: I believe people who defend Dave Chappelle, or worse even laud him for his opinions on trans people and how he doesn't ""punch down,"" are so wrong. 

How can anyone agree or celebrate what Chappelle is doing? The argument that ""no one is safe in comedy and that is true equality"" is so weak. People like to bring up the right to free speech as if that's why my panties are in a bunch. No, it's just infuriating that Chappelle cannot step back with any humility or self awareness that his actions and words cause real harm. He will die on this hill, making special after special dedicated to him defending his actions and words in regards to trans people.

Shock humor, edgy humor, none of that is genuine comedic talent to me. I think it is the lowest rung of comedy and serves to entertain the lowest rung of the masses. It is not funny to liken a trans woman's vagina to beyond meat, forget that it's ""offensive,"" it's BORING. Wow, you're just perpetuating the lamest opinions as if they're clever in any way. I'm Asian and I'd compare it to someone making a joke about me eating dog, it's just so contrived. But with Dave Chappelle delivering these jokes to a wide audience, people who don't understand or *empathize* with this community, that is where it delves into truly problematic territory. During one bit Chappelle just makes a statement, I don't even know how you could consider it a joke, that he is a proud TERF. It's times like those where I'm just rolling my eyes, he's just trying at this point to be edgy. I truly believe he isn't fully aware of the implications of stating something like that, but it ruffles feathers and he's definitely into that.

Haven't seen his latest but my husband relayed a joke about his first meeting with Jim Carrey, who was an idol of his, and Chris Rock helped him meet Jim Carrey, and he was super excited to meet Jim Carrey. But it turns out that Jim Carrey was doing Andy Kaufman's biopic, so he wasn't completely in character, and it was a very disappointing experience for him because he had to pretend that this guy was Andy Kaufman, and then his punchline was, and that's how it feels being around trans people.

I get the punchline and how the set up and comparison sets up a joke, but it gives me big ick feelings the implication of it which is he doesn't believe trans people are real and he has to willfully pretend in his interactions with them. What/who does this serve??? People hear this, they laugh, see others laughing with them, and in turn is societal permission to discredit a real human being's existence. It is normalizing ignorance in the best case, and perpetuating hate and disgust in the worst case. I'm just so over people going after marginalized communities and the tired excuses they give to keep doing it instead of choosing empathy and humility. To pursue equality is empowerment, it is not at all what Dave Chappelle sets out to do.

As someone who left his career when he started feeling the difference between people laughing WITH him and AT him, it is so ironic he doesn't see that his comedy isn't allowing his audience to laugh WITH the trans community, they are very much laughing AT the trans community. He's punching down, and to use the memory of his trans friend to prove he isn't, well that's the oldest trick in the book. I'm not racist, my friend is black!

How can anyone defend this?!"

FAANG companies are notorious for this. They spend absurdly large sums of money which could be used to innovate on pointless mergers and acquisitions to avoid having to deal with the 'free' market. This is true even in the EU. The recent rise of Chinese EVs is driving european EVs out of the market and these companies are actively seeking to get them banned to save their own skins. Google, Amazon and Apple all continuously engage in anti-competitive practices to drive out competition because they can't deal with the fact that they can not innovate like smaller firms can.

I think it's fair to say that smarter animals suffer more. 

So why don't we make them dumber? We can clearly do it - we were able to breed some dogs to be extremely intelligent. Border collies are as smart as a small child, and there is a huge gap between smartest and dumbest dog breeds. I can't see why breading for less intelligence should be difficult. Frankly, I'm surprised it hasn't been done already.

I understand this can only be a temporary solution because we would only be reducing animal suffering, not eliminating it. Additionally it doesn't address environmental concerns such as methane production by cows and deforestation. It would be great to move on to other sources of protein such as lab grown meat once that becomes economically feasible.

1,2024-01-01,CMV: A key step towards peace in Israel/Palestine is for both sides to recognise each other's collective trauma.,u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18vvcxj/cmv_a_key_step_towards_peace_in_israelpalestine/,changemyview,"As I talk to people and read about Israel/Palestine, I came to realise that what makes Israeli identity and Palestinian identity unique is how core their respective ""collective trauma"" is to their identities. For Israel, it's the millennial-long European antisemitism that culminated into the Holocaust (and, minorly, the Jewish exodus from the Muslim world but I'll address that later), and for Palestine, it's the ethnic cleansing campaign Nakba that took place 75 years ago. I began to realise that the chasm in understanding between both camps, Israeli Jews and Palestinians, is in large part due to the lack of recognition of such trauma, which is why both sides feel like the other side is doing all they can to invalidate one's identity. 

1. Holocaust denialism. While Zionism wasn't founded because of the Holocaust, it had certainly accelerated the support and expansion of Israel on the international stage. Israel's foundation is partially built on the collective trauma of the Holocaust, but you would see many instances of Holocaust denialism from Palestinians, like when[ Mahmoud Abbas](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/11/intellectuals-condemn-mahmoud-abbass-attempt-to-justify-antisemitism), leader of the Palestinian Authority, said “They say that Hitler killed the Jews for being Jews and that Europe hated the Jews because they were Jews. No. It was clearly explained that they fought them because of their social role and not their religion.” Hamas has also refused to allow Gazan children to learn about the Holocaust, calling it a fabrication of the Zionists. I would also like to quickly highlight that Palestinians are _not_ responsible for the Holocaust, but in order for both groups to live in peace, _recognition_ must come first.

2. Nakba denialism. On the flip side, Israel has also attempted to wipe their hands off the Nakba. Since 1948, until around the late 1980s when files began to be declassified, Israel has denied any involvement in the Nakba. But even today it's still happening. The term ""Nakba"" is [banned](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/22/israel-remove-nakba-from-textbooks) in Arab children's textbook. They also passed the ""[Nakba Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_Law)"", which restricts fundings to organisations looking to commemorate or recognise Nakba. [Haareetz](https://archive.is/1QVVm) too has a piece on systemic denial from the Israeli government of the Nakba. Even today, many Zionists would claim that Nakba was merely a result of the Arab-Israel war, or Arab nations were actually responsible for telling Palestinian Arabs to flee, when the evidence suggests otherwise. In contrast to Holocaust denialism, Israel _is_ responsible for Nakba, therefore for both groups to live in peace, Israel must take responsibility, recognise that what they are doing _now_ is further inflicting trauma, and reparations must take place.

3. Jewish exodus from the Muslim world. It's not uncommon for some people to compare Nakba to the Jewish exodus and call it ""Jewish Nakba"". While the pain of MENA Jewish communities must be recognised by the Muslim world, I don't think it's helpful to use the word ""Nakba"" when it already means so much to the Palestinians. It'll be like calling the Romani Genocide ""Romani Shoah"", it's just wrong. I will also say that the exodus was not all forceful, many Jews left for better economic opportunities or adherence to Aliyah. So while this event is important to recognise, I think the first two are much more important and hold significantly more gravity than this one.

All in all, I think that for peace to be achieved, either one secular federal state or two independent states, the recognition of ""collective trauma"" must come first. This means Israel needs to properly recognise the Nakba and pay reparations for it, and Palestinians need to recognise that Zionism as a colonial project was not an ideology founded on the want to exploit and bully but on the traumatic history of Jews in Europe."

Thus the only fair way to allow legal immunity for an official, is to allow any crimes towards them.

The congregants perform repetitive rituals, the purpose of which is to make themselves appear bigger. In ordee to maintain a reverent environment they wear headphones and rarely talk to each other. Acceptable noises are groans, grunts or pained moans which help represent the sacrifice being made. Music chosen by the clergy is also acceptable.

The members stare at themselves in mirrors and some of the more devout, called ""influencers"" have started to record video of themselves so thst others may join in the worship of them. The larger males are the high priests, walking stiffly with chest puffed out and taking up as much space as possible. The high priestesses often find the most useful rituals to be a variation of protrudedly displaying her hind end in front of the large males. However the males are forbidden from viewing these displays without concealment under threat of being called a ""creep"".

While it could be, there’s no reason why we should assume this. If anything, it’s incel-ish to assume that any short guy can just “overcome” their height and find a partner. Some people will just likely never find partners in life. That’s the reality. We know that women very often refuse to date men shorter than them, which is their right, but that’s also the reason short men can’t find dates, not because of their “personality.”

I also agree that short men should do the things that we tell everyone to do, such as going out, being social, and just generally being a fun person to be around. But it’s not like they’ll get dates because of it; rather it’s for their own self enrichment and because being a fun person is a good thing whether you can find that person or not.

The one “tip” I think is acceptable is that if you’re at the taller end of the height range in the OP, then it’s reasonable to maybe ask someone to consider moving to an area with shorter women within their country. Outside of that, let’s try to stop gaslighting short men into thinking their dating problems are their fault and accept that it is simply a result of standing eye to eye with the likes of Bruno Mars, Kevin Hart, and in more extreme cases Danny DeVito."
1,2024-01-01,CMV: Stealing from a large corporation isn't more ethical than stealing from a locally owned business,u/villa1919,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18vzdtb/cmv_stealing_from_a_large_corporation_isnt_more/,changemyview,"There seems to be a fairly common consensus in society that stealing from large chains is either ok or much better than stealing from a smaller locally owned business. Most of the reasons given to justify this are fairly invalid.

The first reason given is that the company is large so they can afford it. This reason is pretty foolish because while a larger company has more profits they also have more stores to be stolen from so the theft essentially scales with the business. Also most local business would also still be profitable to some extent if people stole from them.

The second reason given is that the company is owned by rich people. While some retail companies for example Loblaws in Canada or Walmart have billionaires with large ownership stakes this is often not the case. Most large retailers are publically traded companies that are mostly owned by fairly normal people who buy index funds in their retirement accounts or by other groups like pension funds. If you took the median beneficial owner of a large retailer they probably wouldn't be much wealthier than the average small retailer owner.

In a similar justification people often bring up the CEOs pay but this also isn't relevant. They say things like ""if the company can afford to pay the CEO $20 million they can afford for me to take a loaf of bread"". This year Target expects to lose $1.2 billion to theft which is far greater than the CEOs pay which is probably in the $20-30 million range. Also shareholders have to pay a lot out in executive compensation to get people who are qualified to run such a large company in a role that often has low job security and a lot of scrutiny. It can be argued that CEOs as a whole are overpaid but there is little that an individual firm can do about this anyway.

Another factor to consider is the fact that large businesses are often more important to their customers meaning that stealing from them could have a worse community impact than stealing from a small business. From my experience small retailers these days are often involved in specialty discretionary products like Jewelery, art, comics or home furnishings while large retailers are more likely to be groceries or pharmacies. In cities like Chicago stealing from Walmart got so bad that they decided to close many stores and this created a food desert for many people as well as making it more difficult to get prescriptions. It is also important to consider the impact on staff and the broader community as well as the ownership of the business."

They say the epitome of manhood is being able to take care of another human being, whether that be a child, your GF/wife or both. This means you need to provide a stable home and environment for people who are smaller and weaker than you to feel safe and secure. Well, modern men are generally failing at that, they don't own homes nearly as much as previous generations, they have less disposable income and they are less likely to keep the same job for decades (job stability). But this isn't entirely men's faults. The housing market is terrible right now compared to back then. The average US median home income in 1970 was $9,870 a year, the average US home costed $17,000 (inflation adjusted $112,941. Nowadays the average US house costs $3336,900. More than 3 times as much. No wonder less people own homes. 

Women on the other hand are seen as progressing and being better than their previous generations, but this has a lot more to do with having more opportunities than their elder female counterparts did than them just being better humans, women couldn't even have their own bank account until the 1960s in the US. Before they were just under impossible circumstances to build a life of their own. I see all the time people say, women are getting better and men are declining without acknowledging the changing landscape of society or what these men and women are being compared to. 

Men are not ""weaker"" than previous generations of men, they are just dealing with much different circumstances, it is harder to afford a home the traditional way that we were taught in school, women are now equal to men in the workforce because they have been given opportunities that simply didn't exist for them in the past. This has made men appear weaker. They can't be that alpha provider that they used to be because in a lot of cases you need 2 incomes to afford a house. This means the woman has to work and earn her own money, in some cases this could end up being more money than the man makes and this leads to another plethora of problems. If the woman outearns the man than she is now the authority figure of the household. This is problematic because she will lose respect for that man. Women lose attraction and respect for men that listen to them too much, they don't want an obedient man, but what can a man truly do in that situation if he earns less. Women think you look like a joke if you're doing what they say. Why this is? I'm not entirely sure but it's biology and nature. 

These are just some of the reasons of why I believe it looks like modern men appear weak or that they appear to be lesser than, than their older counterparts. The situations are too different to fairly compare, we also need to redefine what we consider to be true masculinity. Being a man is NOT ONLY about being a provider and protector for your woman and your child, but it is also about leading them by example and in a positive direction. Many men back then were providers but they were also physically abusive, that is not a good man either. It is not enough to be the head of household, we must also lead by example for our women and children.

Like every narcissist, it would be a thunderclap of extreme humiliation and abasement. After Trump was done shrieking in horror and self-reflection (Scrooge in *Christmas Carol* style) and bellowing repeatedly to the nation how wrong he was (perhaps White House aides needing to restrain him as he flailed and thrashed about in self-shame), he would then have adopted much more compassionate policies in governance. Covid would have been handled much better. There would be genuine bipartisanship with the Democrats. He would double taxes on himself and all other wealthy Americans. Trump would donate everything he had to charity, legalize immigration of all kinds, and he would never utter an untruth again."

1,2024-01-01,CMV: Ukraine is highly unlikely to win the Russo-Ukrainian war,u/jadacuddle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18w34q8/cmv_ukraine_is_highly_unlikely_to_win_the/,changemyview,"First, let’s define what a win would be for Ukraine. Winning a war is best defined as meeting the victory conditions set forth by the leader of the state engaged in the conflict. For example, the leaders of the Allies in WW2 decided that their victory condition was unconditional surrender of all Axis nations and the dismantling of the fascist states. For his victory condition in this war, Zelensky has decided that restoration of the pre-2014 borders of Ukraine will do, including Crimea and the entirety of Eastern Ukraine. I believe that Ukraine is unlikely to achieve this condition or anything close to this.

Ukraine’s offensive was supposed to be the moment in which they decisively moved close to achieving this goal. Their hope was that they would push to the Sea of Azov, break the Crimean land bridge, and eventually regain Crimea itself. However, the offensive was an abject failure. Their best units, the 9th and 10th Corps, who were very well armed and well trained, took serious losses and did not come close to achieving their objective. They did not even get halfway to Tokmak.

Given the failure of the offensive, we must ask if Ukraine will get a better chance to take back some of currently Russian-occupied territory. Given the manpower issues the AFU is facing, the rapid drying up of Western support, and the destruction of some of Ukraine’s best units, I believe the answer is a clear no. The size of Western aid packages is dwindling and will likely continue to shrink, the average one of their enlisted soldiers continues to rise, and Russia still has no manpower or industrial issues to speak of that are anywhere near what Ukraine is facing. Ukraine’s military strength seems to be on a downhill course without much hope of regaining significant strength.

I also believe that Ukraine’s military strength is likely to continue its decline because of how the AFU has begun to cannibalize itself. The 47th Mechanized Brigade provides a good example of this. They burned through their best equipment, and, instead of accepting these losses and adjusting the tasks they were attempting to preform, they instead began to use their best remaining assets in a defensive capacity in an attempt to retain their original capabilities. This resulted in massive losses for the unit without strategic gains. This is a canary in the coal mine for the AFU and provides a warning as to how the manpower and equipment shortage Ukraine is facing may snowball as cannibalization spreads throughout their military.

Now, if Russia were facing a worse long-term situation, Ukraine may still have hope of taking back Crimea and the other Russian-held territories. However, Russian industrial production has been steadily ramping up, their military has become significantly more effective than it was at the outbreak of the war, and they still have massive reserves of manpower to draw upon. I don’t see any indication that their combat strength is decreasing and I do see indicators that mark an increase in their combat power, such as the aforementioned manpower advantage and industrial advantage. 

Given the failure of the Ukrainian offensive, Russia’s relatively better position  and the decline of their military strength, I believe that they will not restore their pre-2014 borders"
1,2024-01-01,"CMV: A lot of the time, improving yourself outside of a relationship is not enough to improve yourself within it.",u/DownvoteIfYouWantMe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18w3dsf/cmv_a_lot_of_the_time_improving_yourself_outside/,changemyview,"It seems that a lot of people say to work on yourself if you get jealous within a relationship and become distant or petty from it, or if you exude toxic and controlling qualities within a relationship, you may not necessarily be a bad person, just unaware of what you're doing. You might become cold to your partner in some cases, lack communication, be inconsiderate of their feelings, not realize you could've made them happy by doing a certain thing, but you didn't, etc. All these things can only be improved by having experience within a relationship and experience ups and downs of it.  
  
With my first relationship, I used to get jealous incredibly easily, like if she complimented someone else and called them cute or handsome, I would feel a pit in my stomach every time. I asked people online what to do, but they said to work on myself. My second relationship I had developed a lot of great traits. Started the gym, did skincare, meditation, got much closer to my friends, etc. But I did the same exact things when I got jealous, I became distant and tried coping by preparing for losing the girlfriend by immersing myself into my hobbies and being a little cold to her.  
  
The next relationship I had (this one), I felt done with feeling this shit every time so commonly. It feels like I haven't improved a single bit in this category despite all my efforts. I learned to emotionally accept this kind of thing half because I had more experience with it and half because I had the right SO that was down to fully communicate our feelings and could understand me a lot better, so the feeling was less overwhelming. I also noticed that after some time, I stopped saying things like ""I feel uncomfortable when you hang out with your male coworker alone"" etc. and instead started telling her I'd like some general reassurance without telling her the topic of concern at all to ease the burden on her and still feel fine in the end. 

Things like this you don't really think up or consider unless you're actually in a relationship. You also learn how to deal with and analyze your own clingy or unattractive mannerisms by experiencing yourself while in a relationship which is just as important as it is to analyze them while single after a relationship ends. So I think it's very underrated to work on yourself while in a relationship targeting specific areas you have once you develop a solid personal basis of confidence. "
1,2024-01-01,"CMV: the category of ""expert"", as such, should be replaced with professional/experience descriptions (""climate researcher"", ""physicist"")",u/quantum_dan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18w43mn/cmv_the_category_of_expert_as_such_should_be/,changemyview,"To avoid any ambiguity, I am absolutely not arguing that present-day experts are illegitimate and I am not denying the value of expertise.  Expertise is valuable and people accurately referred to as experts typically possess relevant expertise.  This is about terminology.

Also note that I am not suggesting a fixed level of specificity; in different contexts, different levels will be appropriate (""researcher"", ""earth scientist"", ""hydrologist"", ""surface-water hydrologist"", ""river restoration researcher"" - describing the same person in different contexts).  ""Researcher"" is different from ""expert"", despite its breadth, because it still refers to a profession.  ""Expert"" is something one is, rather than something one does.

The designation ""expert"" isn't inherently attached to a field and is often used on its own (""trust the experts"", often said to argue against doing so).  By that characteristic, it tends to signal blanket authority - so one sees experts in one field being taken to have credibility in another, because they're experts, right?  Conversely, it often leads to mistrust (warranted or otherwise) of experts in one field translating to other fields, when a person simply concludes that expertise is untrustworthy.  These effects are enhanced by ""expert"" being a quality of a person, rather than something they do, so it connotes fixed authority rather than relevant experience.  A Forest Service research hydrologist becomes ""someone who knows stuff about fish habitat"" rather than ""someone who is actively investigating fish habitat"".

There's the disadvantage of using a lumped category which refers to authority rather than practice.  From the other end, I don't see any advantage ""expert"" has over just referring specifically to someone's area of practice, whereas it might be very useful to indicate precisely where someone is coming from and why they know stuff.  A flood researcher, snow hydrologist, and climate researcher all have relevant expertise on climate change impacts in the American West, but they have very different expertise and it's useful to know which is which.  Decent reporting will specify anyway, but what use does lumping them all together as ""experts"" have instead of just distinguishing to begin with?

Potential lines of argument I am aware of:

* Demonstrate that profession-specific descriptors would not be practical.  (This does not include arguing out that the examples I provided would need to be restated - e.g., ""people might not know what a hydrologist is"" - unless the argument is that many fields of expertise are not describable in publicly-accessible terms.)
* Demonstrate that the lumped ""expert"" category has positive value I overlooked, to a sufficient degree to justify the widespread use of the term.
* Demonstrate that the disadvantages I mentioned aren't specific to the ""expert"" lumping, in a way that undermines the argument here."

The issue is getting to that first date. With dating apps it takes an enormous amount of effort to get to what in my opinion should be step one. The time required alone is bananas. 

Secondly as someone who doesn't drink its difficult to meet people and ask them out. I find a good amount of success in dance clubs which works for me, however, I find that asking someone outside of accepted areas people are turned off by a man being forward.

1,2024-01-01,"CMV: Conservatism is not, and can never be, ""punk"" or ""counterculture""",u/Trazzster,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18w688w/cmv_conservatism_is_not_and_can_never_be_punk_or/,changemyview,"Given the recent hullabaloo regarding bands like Green Day and Rage Against the Machine, and given the fact that the right-wing ""culture war"" has been turned up to 11 and has permeated all discussion of media, from music to movies to video games to freaking tabletop RPGs; I think it's time we had a little talk about what it means to be ""punk"" and why conservatives, by their own nature, cannot be punk.

To be ""punk"" requires a level of honesty. To be able to honestly criticize the government and the society of the country and/or planet you live on. To engage in good faith: even though you might come off as rude or controversial or shocking, you're still honest and sincere and speaking the truth to the best of your knowledge. To be inclusive and sympathetic to the marginalized and the downtrodden.

To be punk, you have to be real.

Conversely, to be ""conservative"" requires a level of dishonesty. To never engage in good faith, to never be honest or sincere(going as far as to treat those things as weakness!), to treat injustice as inconvenience and inconvenience as injustice whenever it suits your argument. To believe that there are in-groups that the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups that the law binds but does not protect.

To be conservative, you have to be fake.

And that's why you right-wingers can't be punk, and you never will. I'm sure that the ""shocking and controversial and rude"" part about being punk is what appeals to you modern-day conservatives, but the problem is that all of those punk bands wrote those songs about YOU! They wrote those songs about what YOU believe, and what YOU did!

Hell, you guys STILL can't be honest about these things! Republican presidential candidates STILL can't talk about the real reason the civil war happened! You're STILL out there trying to overturn legislation that civil rights activists and the punks of those times spent decades fighting for! You're still lying about January 6th, even though we all saw what happened!

Furthermore, how the hell are you guys gonna call yourselves ""punk"" when you've been reduced to making increasingly absurd arguments on the internet that you could never say to a person's face in the real world? When you're scared of any city with a population of over 100k? Your brains have been cooked by decades of right-wing culture war bullshit, you don't even know which way is up! 

If and when conservatism collapses into a joke ideology, it doesn't magically make conservatism the ""new punk rock"" or the ""new counterculture"" just because you're now ideologically outnumbered and outgunned. It means that the punks have been vindicated and that your fraudulent worldview will be relegated to the dustbin of history."

This maximizes the value these goods provide the buyers, because how much people are willing to pay for something is directly tied to how much value they think the goods will provide them. Goods at market price will naturally find themselves providing more total value than goods below. 


There’s also no such thing as stupid easy money, if there was, more people will fill in to make scalping less stupid easy money. Thus I’m claiming that scalpers are middlemen and provide value as such, as middlemen are historically hated because of this fallacy. (For a willing transaction to take place, it must provide positive value to both parties in the transaction.) 

The people mad at scalping should know, that finding a good below market value is lucky, and not willing to pay market price means that the goods are not worth market value to you, and the goods will provide more value in the hands of those willing to pay market price."

In this context, each frame is split into even and odd lines, resulting in 30 frames with even lines and 30 frames with odd lines. This aligns with CRT displays, where one field of even lines is followed by one field of odd lines, akin to an analog version of a frame. Contrary to common belief, CRTs actually displayed 60 fields per second. After drawing the first field, it would fade out while the next field was drawn, creating a blend, but digitally speaking, it amounts to 60fps. Thus, 60i should be recognized as 60fps, challenging the misconception that it is equivalent to 30fps.

Same thing with racists in America. They know about the bad history of America’s racism, they just don’t care. They know about slavery, they know about George Floyd, they know about the mistreatment of indigenous people, they know about the civil rights movement and what it stood for, they just don’t care. I remember reading a study that showed a scary amount of people would be willing to bring back slavery given the choice.

This is especially common with politicians. Maybe the average person is relatively oblivious to certain parts of history or what is even currently going on, but most politicians are fully aware of general aspects of history, they just willingly choose to disregard it.

Discuss, argue, theorize. I'm all for getting to the bottom of this (if there is one).

I'm team 2PM here, and I think most people will disagree with me. But I'll try and explain why I think this.

Imagine you are a train on a train track (travelling at a fixed speed), and the meeting is a train station. In order to get to the station sooner, you would have to move the station **back**, against the direction of travel. And if you kept moving the station **forwards**, you'd never reach it. 

Additionally, if you had a time machine and wanted to visit the year 2050, you would need to go **forwards** in time to a later date.

I'm really curious to know if there's a definite link between whether you say 10AM or 2PM, and which of the two ways you perceive time.

This was probably due to someone walking into the room and saying ""wait, this guy is a Nazi so he must obviously be crazy"" and shoehorned in random murder to his character.   


This is not Doctor Doom. Doom is an unabashed Fascist, and the hes **correct**. He is the only one, conquering the entire human race under his iron fist, where world peace can be achieved. This has been stated multiple times throughout  the comics by God figures who can see the future. The outcome of Doom's final victory is just unacceptable for Marvel, so they will have to make him crazy rather than the cruel, but charismatic and brutally intelligent sorcerer whos only flaw can be an overstep in his master plan he has been for the last 30 years of his character history.

1,2024-01-01,CMV: AI Art is not inherently unethical.,u/Kell08,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18wdsi2/cmv_ai_art_is_not_inherently_unethical/,changemyview,"I've seen a lot of backlash against AI-generated images/other art on social media, and while I can understand the criticisms I've seen, I don't agree with them. Working under the assumption that artificial image generation is ethically acceptable unless it can be reasoned that it isn't, here are some grievances about AI art I've seen and why I don't agree:

* **AI image generators are stealing other people's work/copyrighted images.** This is a valid criticism of an image generator that takes a base image from the internet and modifies it, which is indeed how some of them work. That is akin to a human tracing art, or editing existing images. However, my understanding is that the higher quality image generators are simply trained on publicly available images, and generate their own pictures from scratch using what they've learned. This isn't stealing, in my view. It's akin to a human artist looking at other pictures for reference, then creating their own.
* **AI art is taking away opportunities for commissions from human artists.** With how good artificial image generators have gotten, and with how good they will likely become in the future, it's clear that they are an appealing tool for anyone who wants to create a picture of anything with little cost or effort. Naturally, this could conceivably reduce the demand for artists creating pictures for graphics, thumbnails, viewing enjoyment, and so on. However, as unfortunate as that might be for affected artists, it doesn't mean that the engineers behind AI image generators or the people who use them are doing anything wrong. Sometimes technological advancement just reduces the demand for doing things the old fashioned way. You're allowed to introduce a new product that competes with an existing industry. For example, [Taxi drivers have objected to the rise of ride-sharing services like Uber](https://www.thethings.com/stephen-colberts-guest-travis-kalanick-was-rattled-after-hecklers-angrily-interrupted-his-interview/) for how it's affected their industry in the past, but that doesn't mean ride-sharing apps are unethical.
* **People can falsely claim to have created artwork when they are actually just showing what they generated with AI.** The issue here is that the hypothetical individual is lying, not that they are using an AI image generator. Yes, artificially generated images have become very well refined and can't always be distinguished from something that is human-made, but that isn't an inherently bad thing. Obviously falsely claiming to have made something you didn't is plagiarism, but we aren't going to start calling WikiPedia unethical because someone could copy-paste it and claim it's their own work.
* **AI can be used to create likenesses of real people in inappropriate situations or for otherwise deceptive purposes without their consent.** This is an issue with a potential use for the technology, not the technology itself. I don't consider AI-generated visuals/audio to be unethical as a whole simply because they could potentially be abused. The internet can be (and is) abused for some truly heinous things, but that doesn't mean the internet itself is a bad thing.

Overall, I see how controversial this developing technology has become, but I think the main criticisms don't really hold up to scrutiny. I would be interested in reading what people who oppose AI art have to say about this, since I don't think I've personally ever really seen an in-depth discussion of the points I'm making here. I'm sure it's happened, but I would like to see for myself."

Like when people say they dislike a trans person not for them being trans, but for actual character flaws such as Caitlyn Jenner or Christian Weston Chandler or Keffals. Like what is transphobic about it.

And I agree there are moments where transphobes and bigots obviously get lumped in with the rest of the critics and dissent and I can admit is ‘bigoted’ or hateful like misgendering or making offensive remarks towards people who are minorities, on the basis of them being minorities. 

But then there are times where it’s just said because you see a person of colour, a member of the lgbtq community or a woman on the screen being criticized.

This will have many beneficial effects. Instead of inflation, you would have steady but healthy deflation, as seen during the gilded age in America when prices fell about 1.5% per year (wiki gilded age) but wages were increasing rapidly and there was tremendous economic growth. This deflation would incentive savings, which is really how economies grow in the first place. Imagine if your money was worth more every year instead of less. If prices kept falling instead of going up. 

Inflationary monetary policy facilitated by fiat money transfers wealth from creditors to debtors. This might sound alright to someone struggling under student loans, but historically it is actually rich people who borrow the most money (think Donald Trump), since they have assets to back it up. Banks don't really lend to poor people. And it is the middle class and the working class who save money a lot of the time, so inflation is really a scam to make the rich richer and everyone else poorer. A gold standard would prevent that, since it is a lot easier to print 2 billion dollars worth of paper money or to create 2 billion dollars worth of money in a bank account then it is to acquire 2 billion dollars worth of gold.

Fiat (paper) money also enables militarism and war. During WWI all of the belligerent nations went off the gold standard, because they wanted to print money to pay for their armies. Fiat money is an indispensible aspect of militarism and war. If the people were forced to pay the cost of going to war directly, through taxation, there would be much more opposition to imperialism and militarism, but because of inflationary monetary policy the cost of the war is hidden in everyday higher prices. This is a serious threat to world peace.

Finally, fiat money, central banks, and fractional reserve banking are responsible for the boom bust business cycle. What happens is, credit expansion (credit created out of thin air, instead of lending out actual savings) mimics a higher degree of consumer savings, either in the form of lower interest rates or a greater supply of available credit. This leads to the ""cluster of errors"" when entrepreneurs over invest in capital goods industries (because they think that consumer time preference has lengthened). Ultimately these investments are found to uneconomic and must be liquidated. The boom and bust. By adopting gold, we can end the boom and bust business cycle, and have steady prosperity.

Empirical data is of no use, neither will it be relevant in the discussion of human relationships, and I will not ntertain answers that attempt to use empirical data for this CMV.** 

Relationships ARE transactional, and it seems like the people who *refuse* to even acknowledge it in some way are people who are afraid that they would be seen as fake or judgemental for simply stating it as how it is. 

Human relationships being transactional **DOES NOT** mean that the relationships human form with each other are inherently ingenuine, but it simply showcases that *humans use each other and interact with other people based off what they can provide (in any way possible).*

In friendships: You are friends with somebody *because they provide you something.* t could be anything. Perhaps their humour, their knowledge, mutual interests,  being in the same community (like gamers), enjoying activities together and sometimes even cultural/social alignment. 

You wouldn’t be friends with somebody *you don’t get along with*, right? Thats because your interests do not align or you cannot get along with each other, which means both parties are **unable** to provide something for the other party in order for the relationship to even start/form. 

The same goes for romantic relationships, but there are more things to consider. For example, how attractive you find your partner. 

You being attracted to your partner and them being attracted to you **IS the transactional part.** *You both offer each other something.* When one party doesn’t, you break up. Emotional connection, compatibility, growth, sex, etc are all things that are interchangeable in the relationship. 

These are things you *offer* your partner and they offer you the same or more in return. 

I know someone might bring up having kids and how the relationships are transactional so I’ll clear that up now as well.

T he relationship between you and the children you have are ALSO transactional, you *may* get joy from raising them and loving them, and you receive love from them. 

**Relationships are transactional. CMV.**"
1,2024-01-02,CMV: People actually CAN identify as attack helicopters,u/BicycleNo4143,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18wmx20/cmv_people_actually_can_identify_as_attack/,changemyview,"Let me preface this by saying this post is not about tr\*ns people (censored due to filter). I understand that issues with identity may have points of intersection with gender, but my concern is largely about identification as a whole and the ideology behind it. That being said, I am seeking to have my view changed about this, or for it to be explained meaningfully to me how I am wrong in believing that people actually can identify as attack helicopters (among many other ""weird"" things).

I understand that there are very many schools of thought regarding identification and it's a very complex topic. I also want to note that I'm not particularly well-informed, and I am really trying to approach this from the position I feel most comfortable with. I don't wish harm on anybody, and I certainly don't want to invalidate anybody. These are my priors, these are the bases with which I operate, so I generally believe that **as long as it's not harming or infringing on others, people should be left to their own devices, regardless of how socially taboo or ""strange"" it may appear.**

That being said, **I therefore believe that people can meaningfully identify as attack helicopters, or any other object for that matter.** I'm just using them as an example, as more often than not, we see them being utilized as a point of contention in regards to identification. People who derisively remark that one could then identify as an inanimate object often make use of this apparent absurdity to imply that there is an irrationality associated with respecting others' purported beliefs about themselves. But there really is, in my view, **no principled or ideological reason to distinguish between these forms of identity.**

In the modern age, there is a lot of ways to identify oneself that are often considered very strange or absurd, and these extremely niche groups of people are often ridiculed from pretty much every angle of the political strata. More conservative folks predictably consider their abnormality itself to be the basis of rejection. More mainstream progressive folks dislike them for an alleged ""harm"" to greater perception of progressivism. I'm talking not only about neopronouns (ze/zim/zer) and anypronouns, but also people like furries, Therians, transrace, transage, and Otherkin. **Obviously these groups have very complicated beliefs, and I urge you to research more about them,** but to the best of my understanding, these are groups of people who identify as species, ages, and even as inanimate objects. The ease by which society at large can mock these groups makes even progressives reticent to defend them.

I obviously do not agree with the conservative outlook that something new, strange, and bizarre is in and of itself wrong or worthy of mockery. **For people who hold a conservative viewpoint, I do not have much to argue with, as I do not believe we have values in common.** But I also very much reject the progressive arguments such as ""these people are bait/not real/disingenuous/just a tiny handful"". **These viewpoints and beliefs, whether they are bizarre or not, are clearly and undeniably real to a small subset of people, and their small population does not, in my view, make them any less worthwhile of our time or consideration.** 

**If these individuals do not perform any harm,** is there a significant issue involved with acknowledging and respecting their preferred identity? For example, if a ""transage"" individual does not on the basis of their identity perform any inappropriate or harmful acts, or if, say, an individual who is a Therian does not engage in zoophilia, but these beliefs are constrained in a harm-free manner, **is there a principled and rational argument for why it is okay to reject their identity or refuse to respect them, particularly from a progressive perspective?** I believe many progressive people share the values of ""if it's not hurting anyone, we should respect people's identities and beliefs"", and so I have a hard time understanding why the mainstream progressive position appears to be dismissive of these people on what often seems to be like a very shallow basis of optics. **""It doesn't look good to the general public if we admit that it's okay to identify as X, so let's not let them into our club"" is just a wholly irreconcilable and inconsistent position, in my opinion.** 

**In other words, or tl;dr;** I believe that the progressive values which underlie many mainstream progressive ideologies regarding identity of ""as long as it doesn't hurt anybody, we should respect the identities and beliefs of everyone"" do support a wide spectrum of identities that are, at present, rejected or ostracized by mainstream progressive ideologies. Otherkin, Therians, transage and transracial individuals, as well as countless other niche groups I have neglected to mention, are all regularly shunned by progressives for reasons that elude me, although I suspect that optical shame or ""making our movement look bad"" is much of the reasoning I have seen. Oftentimes these groups are admittedly weaponized by conservative groups to elicit public outrage and hysteria, but the progressive response is just as often inconsistent and disappointing. ""These people don't genuinely believe that"" or ""it's just a couple of Internet weirdos"" is not a reasonable justification for dismissal; there are real, substantial communities with these beliefs, and their small numbers do not justify such negative treatment, especially from people who ideologically have no reason to be treating them this way."

 For some reason Instagram thinks I have unresolved issues with my mother and has inundated me with nonsensical whiny propaganda regurgitated by fresh and fit and that genius pearl. And an overriding theme that seems to emanate from their effluence is that women historically stayed at home and photosynthesised while their brave husband went outside empire building or some other rubbish, and that they should go back to being at home and be 'traditional'. I'm going to call this don Quixote syndrome, men with hilarious views on manliness and chivalry tilting at imaginary foes that 'threaten' their precious masculinity. 

 But let me tell you a couple of three things, first of all the notion that women historically never worked, and that men were the primary breadwinners in society. This is a modern myth and fantasy completely divorced from reality. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS WORKED. Women have for the entirety of the history been engaged in labour and work. In pre industrial agrarian societies both men, women and children were engaged in farming. Subsistence farming without industrial tools is incredibly manpower intensive and the idea you have half the adult population exclusively at home is ridiculous. You can see this even to this day in less developed economies, tea pickers, and hell visit any village in India you will find just as many women in the fields as men, it is literally necessary for survival, particularly in rice growing societies that women also engage in field labour. Now you could say that men did more field work than women in general, ok fine, but that does not denigrate the very real and important labour that women did do to a far greater extent than men. Textiles, spinning and knitting, the clothes on most of humanities backs were manufactured by women, how could a man wield a scythe in summer if his wife didn't the clothes that kept him from freezing in winter??

 But moving on from that into the industrial age, literally the very first workers in the new burgeoning factories were women! They worked the spinning jennies, women were at the forefront in the new sectors that opened up in the industrial revolution. The coal mines had entire families working in them, mum, dad , and the kids, not just the men. Gruelling labour that women got paid less than the men for, the children a mere pittance. Women had to work, to bring home money or the entire family would starve, for 99% of people for 99% of history, the mans wages were simply not enough.

  I believe this idea that women are meant to stay at home and only raise kids and do housework really originated with the rise of the middle class. With a tranche of society where men had the luxury of being able to financially take care of multiple dependants. Thanks to this for a few decades, particularly in post WW2 America there was a time where the economic circumstances allowed the culture of a stay at home wife to become prevalent.

 But moving on to this other notion that men in the past were all brave heroic adventurers who went of brave overseas conquests. Again another fantasy, sure apart from the maybe few thousand kings and upper nobility that existed in societies for the other 100 billion humans that have existed it was a daily battle for survival. You were tied to your land, your status little more than a slave, unless of course you were a slave. You couldn't read or write, you couldn't leave your land without the lords permission, you'd most likely be pressed into service so your master could gain another bit of land, and if you survived you'd go home a cripple. And the idea that any of you if you were born during the past somehow break free and rise is laughable, social mobility was extremely rare, you try that alpha male andrew tate sigma nonsense as a peasant you'll get your head lopped off by a knight in a heartbeat. While maybe men had it slightly better of than women their position was still pitiable. So you know what if everyone should be traditional then 99% of men should be subservient, and die at aged thirty after getting sepsis from a papercut."

The US wanted to be the world leader during and after the cold war. Which is all good with the strength of their economy and tying it to gold standard. 

And when they realised that expenses can no longer keep up with revenue, they decided to switch from a gold backed currency into FIAT - essentially not being backed by anything. Prior to that, $35 is 1 ounce of gold. Now $1 can essentially be anything people want it to be. 

What this also means is that all forms of basis for what $1 means is essentially baseless - and also why you are experiencing both inflation and shrinkflation while companies are still recording record profit. Because the numbers today mean NOTHING. 

By changing the basis of what $1 mean, it essentially means 'we dont know what $1 can get you nor are we telling you what it is worth. It is worth whatever the market is telling you is worth and if you dont have enough numbers in your bank account, will luck be with you. 

This also means your bread that used to cost $1 can be priced at $3 because when you say 'things are expensive', what is it compared to? Nothing - because your $1 no longer had a base value. 

So why does it link to the entire globe? Because most countries used to peg their currency to USD even post cold war which is fine and dandy till post 2010s when shit start to hit south and in the post 2020s it is a shitshow on steroids. 

And because US is still a major consumer, when US says 'im gonna buy it at 5USD', with the currency exchange, export makes more sense to manufacturers, so they will export to the US, leaving locals with the base price of 5USD. 

And when goods that are demand inelastic start to feel this effect and manufacturers realise people will pay for it anyway, they start to hike prices for no reasons besides 'cost related issues'. 

So then everyone now feels these price hikes for 0 good reason and there you have it inflation. 

Those who try to school me that is not how inflation works - it is. Your GDP when calculated does not take into account real value, all it takes into account is the number (CPI) compared to the previous year."

Point: We've all heard it. The usual anti-change garbage that is 'phones are ruining your lives!'. And, rather bizarrely, I agree with it. But not for the usual reasons. While cyber-bullying and addiction are massive problems, the larger problem is that phones are used as a kind of social shield. When I don't want to talk to someone (because I don't like them, or because I'm feeling socially anxious), I simply open my phone and do anything on it. As a result, I am often unable to actually meet people, because I don't make the effort --- the serotonin released by scrolling through TikTok is faster, easier and less risky than the serotonin received from any kind of relationship, platonic or romantic.

As an example --- I volunteer at a local organisation, and they require us to come together in person for one day once a year for a training session. There are many breaks in between the training sessions that take place on that day, and many chances for me to go up to someone and introduce myself. But I don't --- the fear of being rejected is too high. Instead, I use my social shield, and scroll through TikTok.

Do you see my point? Sorry if that was a bad explanation.

TL;DR: We use our phones to get out of making new friendships and as a result lose the potential benefits of a deep relationship.

Disclaimer: I know many of you will probably say 'yeah but we use our phones to text with others'. True, but that's not forming (as in creating) a new deep relationship. Those relationships were most likely forced upon you due to social pressures, e.g. school, work, family. There is also the rare case of internet friendships, but not many of us can truly claim to have a deep relationship that is hosted and was created on our phones.

Credit: The initial idea isn't entirely mine --- I was shown a video of someone talking about something similar by a teacher. However, I have applied it to my context and developed on the original idea."

It is the natural logic because all things have a cause (as the popular argument states) and in my view all causes have a causer and are the consequences of an action. In nature, things occur because of the natural unfolding of nature’s existence set in motion that is unable to be stopped as far as we know. However, the initial cause for nature can reasonably be conceived to be a Creator, as that would be fully consistent with the rest of the human experience and things/events encountered in life.


God cannot be physically proven nor disproven to exist. It is a question of mainly faith and spirituality. Therefore almost all Atheistic debates surrounding science are mostly pointless unless it comes to certain points. The experience of colour is unique and therefore trying to rationally explain it to someone who has never experienced colour will always be greatly inadequate, as it cannot be compared to anything else that can be connected to it and used to explain colour, the same way believers or atheists try to connect the idea of Divinity and God to the idea of science to explain its existence or non-existence. Even the statement I used “all things have a cause and therefore a causer” is inadequate as Quantum physics can challenge that statement, yet cannot deny nor prove the existence of God."

Whenever we talk about kids movies/cartoons. If you say the movie the response is oh it’s for kids, but I don’t think that’s a good excuse.

Let’s think about it. One the best kids cartoons of all time: Avatar the last Airbender is catered towards kids but it’s story and the lessons it teaches are enjoyable for people of all ages.

Even growing up I grew up with shows like: Young Justice, Justice League unlimited, Ben 10, Regular show, Adventure time. And one thing that combined all of those is no matter what age you were you could enjoy it.

Even currently the Mitchell’s vs the machine, Puss in Boots, Minions, Nimona all kids movies but very enjoyable at any age. 

Just because it’s for kids ≠ it has to be bad kids should get good story telling as well, and yes I’m aware some kids probably won’t understand it but media is one of the greatest teacher a kid can have."

A very common talking point by pro-Palestinians is to ""dissolve Israel"" ,""end the Israeli regime"" and ""destroy Israel"" to send send back all the jews that were not there pre-1948 back to where their ancestors are from. 

Their reasoning is they believe Israel was founded illegitimately. But I don't think that's relevent to Israel in it's current state. Israel now is 75 years old, there was 10 million living there, generations there and Israelis now identify usually only as Israeli. Therefore, proposing to force Israelis from Israel is ethnic cleansing as it was their grandparents country, not theirs. 

Even if you could argue Israel's founding was not valid, it does not matter. 

This is why I think for there to be peace between both populations in the future, they either have to: 1. Create a Palestinian state which will coexist with Israel in relative peace or 2. Have one nation, i.e. Israel, in which all Palestinians in the WB and Gaza are given Israeli citizenship. 

I think the first one is the most realistic. Dismantling Israel will not happen, sending Israelis to other countries will never happen and should not happen so both pop. will have to live together."

The scene where she flashes back to her married life irritates me so badly.

Context: Her husband worked at the Campbell Soup factory during the day and was a singer at night.

One morning, he was in no condition to go to work, but Joy tells his boss that he's going to work knowing he's not in any condition. Here she is kicking and slapping him to wake him up.

He even says, ""No honey, I'm sick."" to which she says ""you're not sick.""

The only two people who have any agency to say if he's sick is him and his doctor. She is neither of them.

Eventually, it's a lot of back and forth about it, until she eventually pulls the victim card out of her ass after going behind his back and making decisions for him to his boss.

Fast forward to next scene, they're signing divorce papers.

I get that movies portray people and stories differently for creative license. That's fine.

However, I researched it a little more.

Joy said that she divorced her husband because [""he was still being free and having a fun life.""](https://people.com/movies/joy-mangano-talks-divorce-new-miracle-mop/)

Sorry, but that just screams ""big bitch energy"" to me. She divorced him because he was happy.

    1. While it is true that Cuba can trade with other nations the USA has a huge monopoly on those foreign companies who do wish to trade with Cuba, the Helms-Burton act basically makes it extremely difficult for other countries to trade with Cuba. Foreign companies risk trading with Cuba. While it is true the EU trades and a lot of other countries trade it makes it really hard

2. The USA now allows food and medicine this is true but it’s still limited, also the USA being one of Cuba’s biggest trading partners doesn’t much mean: The embargo prohibits American companies from trading with Cuban not the US government something people forget, it’s American companies prohibited not America, something that a lot of people do not distinguish government actions vs company actions.



   So my belief is that the embargo is why it is poor, but not the sole reason of course, I don’t deny government actions of course especially domestic. My argument with the embargo comes from trade related things not anything to do with national security and although the US has all rights not to trade with Cuba, it doesn’t mean that other countries even US allies shouldn’t be prohibited from trading with the island which is my grip with the embargo - it extends beyond American companies not trading."

But as far as I can tell, that claim is baseless and flies in the face of easily observed reality. Dogs, for example, act in ways that strongly resemble human emotional reactions and so do most other mammals.  Their brains and endocrine systems are also very similar to humans and they undeniably share many of the same reflexes and instincts as humans.

Is it sensible to think that humans spontaneously evolved our full range of emotions so recently that no other extant species have similar emotions? If evidence for such an extraordinary hypothesis exists I am ignorant to it.

I will certainly concede that animal emotions are likely to be somewhat different than human emotions and I can accept that reading animal emotions is not always easy because of differences in body language. I do believe, however, that it is undeniable that most mammals share a basically similar set of emotions."

Vlad in the Court of Mehmed was locked up and abused he was radicalized against the Ottomans and Islam. His brother became a Muslim iirc. Vlad watched his brother renounce his faith and saw himself be persectued before fleeing.

He led the Wallachian Dukedom over the course of 3 separate regimes and scored military victories against the Ottomans killing thousands of them and putting them on pikes it worked and spooked Ottomans out of Wallachia.

1. Vlad is not a man who simply wanted to be evil for the sake of evil he was radicalized by mistreatment at the hands of Turks and Muslims 

2. Vlad wanted to preserve Wallachias borders and stop Ottoman Influence in Europe 

3. The people Vlad killed were armed and dangerous not Innocent folks.

To my knowledge, Israel is known for it's ability to conduct ruthless and very efficient special operations, even in enemy territory.

**I don't buy that Hamas is really that large or capable, in comparison to Israel.** Their largest attack ever, Oct 7th, was pretty weak in the big picture. Like if their maximum military capability is firing a bunch of dumb rockets (extremely ineffective against the iron dome) and flying paragliders over a wall to attack a music festival, I just have a hard time believing that they are this deeply organized and threatening organization. 

**One of the most advanced countries on Earth probably has the capability to conduct covert operations to take out Hamas's leaders and essential nodes of operation** without mass bombing. Gaza is 50% children, barely has a functioning government/economy/society really, I can't imagine that sneaking around it is that hard or dangerous. 

To change my mind you'll have to establish that 

A. Hamas is a major organization and a serious and immediate threat to Israel's existence as a country and society.

B. Israel lacks the ability to conduct on-the-ground operations to eliminate Hamas.

Let me give you an example: when I was 7, I stumbled upon a porn video. Lots of couples having sex. I thought it was disgusting.

When I was 10, my friend made me feel weird for not being aroused to porn he showed me.

But slowly, as I reached age 11, I started wanking. That's when I got it. It's that feeling of orgasm. Cue 15 odd years of porn addiction, and then psychedelics which forced me to see the faces of the women in the videos. And then my addiction slowly fading away as I wouldn't be able to watch more than 2 mins.

Is it an innate feeling of longing for a ""father"" figure? Not saying you grew up without a father, but: in my home country, the older people talk with great pleasure about how good the times were under Hitler.

However, here is where one thing comes in. When you look at those alpha male/billionaire motivational videos, shorts or tiktoks, with tons of B-roll of rich people on planes, beaches and similar, and you read some of the advice they give, a bit of it, a fraction of it, and a fraction of that mentality seems like it has some merit to it.

For example: often they push the advice(slightly exaggerated) such as wake up at 4am, workout, have cold showers, reject comfort, have a grind mindset, and grind and grind and grind. And I think that that has some truth to it, granted it doesn't work for all, but it seems to me like those tips are no less helpful than such as those of the productivity YouTubers(like Thomas Frank or Matt D'avella) and for some they work. I think there is a sweet spot, because following just the grindset advice you're bound to burn out sooner or later, but it can be helpful to have that mindset for a while to give you that extra push.

It's not a cosmetic mask for nations to wear at the Olympics; it's a truth that exposes the folly of certain actions.

If you, as a leader, disregard reason and make decisions for billions that contradict what logic dictates, then you're leading people to their deaths. There's no glory in leading a flock to slaughter; it's a chilling testament to your indifference towards your people.

World leaders have recently demonstrated a blatant disregard for the advice of scientists and rational thinkers. They prioritize imaginary power pockets for select groups over reason, the future, and the well-being of their citizens. I, for one, find no pride in witnessing 1% of my population prosper while a war ravages me, my future, my aspirations, and my very way of life.

National identity is a construct I neither understand nor embrace. It's not a wearable comfort blanket or a source of entertainment. Is this fabricated identity merely a tool to justify job requirements – requirements that enable some to pilfer from the public purse? Why haven't we questioned the need for this ""mediator"" of self-regulation?

Academia and methodology exist for a reason. Can't a well-defined methodology create guiding principles enforced by ordinary people doing their jobs? Why the need for supreme leaders, kings, or anyone susceptible to corruption, capable of stealing, declaring irrational wars, or sending people to die against their will?

It's time for the world's educated masses to critically examine the role of politicians. What do we expect from these individuals? Are they merely rule-makers? Do their positions necessitate human representation, especially when they spend exorbitant amounts on self-promotion?

Why do politicians contradict scientific advice and historical lessons? Why do they obsess over borders, enemies, and war? We often assume that rules safeguard the majority, but history shows that human elements can still lead to minority oppression. Reason and logic, not corruptible individuals issuing harmful orders, should guide civilized life.

If we can algorithmically define left, right, and centrist policies, determine what's revolutionary, counter-revolutionary, or reactionary based on specific criteria, and teach these things to our children, then the parameters for self-regulation are calculable through reason.

Surveillance is acceptable, but those wielding it must also be under scrutiny. After all, it's just a job. The role of a politician is not an essential one; it's akin to that of a king. We've lived without televisions, telephones, and the internet; why can't we imagine a world without leaders?

As long as we have rules, formed through logic and reason, why do we need people susceptible to egotism, corruption, and a lust for superiority? Intelligent people are capable of self-regulation. If we were more analytical, we'd realize that many decisions are based on harmful constructs that impede rational thinking.

Why hoard food and space when others suffer? Why kill others based on imagined national bonds and historical ties? Why must everyone conform or die?

It's time for the educated and intelligent to question the very existence of this ""kingly"" leadership instead of simply complaining about individual corruption. What purpose does this job serve? Does it require human creativity, or is the creative aspect merely stealing from the public? Why does this job still exist?

These individuals haphazardly declare wars and disregard all sense and reason. People don't yearn for death; they have to be manipulated into it. The fabricated situations that lead good people to take dangerous actions are unnecessary. The status quo is maintained solely for the benefit of a select few, creating a system of superiors and inferiors.

But there's a better alternative. The number of people uninterested in power politics far exceeds those vying for leadership. If they chose to self-regulate and self-monitor, adhering to commonly agreed-upon rules, society already has the technology and capability to function effectively.

So why do we keep whining about corrupt politicians while allowing this archaic system to persist? What benefit, besides the usual corruption, do we gain from leaders who grant themselves positions and privileges without effort or merit?

It's time for us, as a society, to evolve and embrace a more scientific approach. We have the technology for participatory democracy, self-surveillance, and self-regulation. Let's utilize it to create a future guided by reason and logic, not the whims of fallible leaders."

I believe with the recent weather anomalies globally its all but confirmed. We (humans) can't switch to renewable energy fast enough to effectively halt or slow global warming anymore. In fact we are consuming and producing more oil than ever before. With this, based on developing nations consumption, increasing in the coming years. Furthermore the resources used and carbon produced for the conversion will also  contribute to the crisis 

In other words we are already dead, we just haven't hit the pavement 

I honestly don't know how bad the climate shift is going to be. I've seen estimates that range from between 5 to 10 million by 2050 to hundreds of millions. The main factor being shocks to food production and how powerful storms will become. This doesn't factor in resource wars that may erupt over water and fertile land. There is also a misconception, that fortunately or unfortunately has started to dissipate that climate change was/is a ""developing country problem"". With the lack of snow in Canada, wild fires, water shortages, flooding, sea water contamination etc... Developed nations won't be able to feed themselves just as the developing.

I feel that Governments should stop giving lip service to carbon taxes, carbon reduction goals, EV targets etc... because they don't mean anything in the grand scheme. Possibly with the exception of renewable long term energy projects E.g Hydro-power, Solar and Nuclear.  Outside these, they basically political talking points. The discussion should be securing food, water and the development of a social safety net. With the general public put on a ""wartime footing"" to combat the increase in deaths, high unemployment, homelessness (areas abandoned), sickness , famine etc...

Ive met many people from im this gen and they are just terrible. They are racist, close minded and think they’re above everyone.

In other words, there are many dimensions in which children who grow up in poor homes are worse off than their peers from wealthier socioeconomic strata.

Black people living in the U.S. who are anti-Israel, calling for a ""ceasefire,"" and criticizing ""Zionism"" are not only anti-Jewish and anti-Jews but also anti-Black. Those who follow the hate train on platforms like TikTok, without a historical understanding, risk alienating our Jewish brothers and sisters who have stood with us since the 1880s. Without Jewish support, the Civil Rights Acts in the USA may not have come to fruition, limiting opportunities for Black people in media, government, and American culture.

As a Black individual, I feel ashamed of those spreading propaganda against Jewish people. Dressing it up as ""ceasefire,"" ""anti-Zionism,"" or anti-Jewish sentiments is repulsive. Is this how we repay friends who supported us, even in dangerous times for Jewish individuals siding with Black people in the early 20th century?

When Black people support Israel's enemies and spread their propaganda, it's reasonable to expect a reconsideration of support from Jewish people in America. This could mean less backing for Black civil rights organizations, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and Black representation in media and American culture. In conclusion, if the majority of Black people on social media demonstrate anti-Jewish sentiments, it's natural for Jewish folks to reconsider their alliances.

Allow me to preempt this objection: being anti-""Zionist"" is being anti-Jewish, regardless of justifications. Zionism, in simple terms, advocates for a Jewish homeland. Opposing that means being anti-Jewish. To argue otherwise is akin to claiming a white person advocating for abolishing the Civil Rights Act and supporting ""State's rights"" is not racist or, at the very least, not motivated by intense dislike towards Black people.

Arab people, with few exceptions, on the whole, despise Black and African individuals. Don't believe me? Visit their countries. Not only is the N-word openly and enthusiastically used, but if you're not a white man living in those countries, you're treated like a slave. It's one thing to side with people neutral towards your community, but it's entirely different to side with those who harbor animosity.

When two groups are fighting, and one group (Jews) is my ally or at least friendly, while the other group despises me, the least I can do is support my friend. Studying U.S. history and the Civil Rights movement reveals that Jewish people were always friends to Black people, offering both financial and other support.

## This will not change my mind:

1. Pointing out a Jewish person who is anti-Zionist doesn't invalidate the interests of the entire group. Finding a Black conservative opposing Civil Rights laws doesn't make Civil Rights inherently bad.


2. Most of the UN supporting the ceasefire won't change my mind because the UN includes Arab/Muslim countries that are anti-Israel or anti-Jewish. Their pre-existing bias doesn't alter my perspective.



## What will change my mind:



Show me that, by not supporting an ally and long-term friend like Jewish people have always been, Black people will still receive support and be seen as allies by the Jewish community in the USA."

Math Classes throughout grade school and most high school is taught exactly this way, that there's a specific ""correct"" process to solving each problem and any other path and answer is incorrect.

Once you get into more advanced mathematics though, it begins to require more and more abstract and creative thinking that depends on imagination and ""Right-Brain"" and even ""playful"" type thinking. A lot of involves intentionally trying to push things past what limits are traditionally imposed on them, and seeing what happens. And early example of this that you might've come across might be imaginary numbers: Originally, you''re taught that negative numbers don't have any square root, and there's just no way to do it. Later on though, its examined as ""Well, lets just pretend you CAN take the square root of negative one, lets see what sort of properties that might have."" Another would be in Geometry, when you are taught ""All triangle' angles add up to 90 degrees, parallel lines never meet, etc"", but then you explore Non-Euclidean geometry, and find out that's not always true. You might come across a function like Factorial, which is only defined for whole integer numbers, but a good mathematician wouldn't be satisfied with that, and would try to find a way to figure out what 3.5! would be, and they'd come up with the Gamma function. 

I think if these things were explored more, and in mathematics classes you were taught how to try to break rules just as much as you're taught to follow them, more people might be interested in. Particularly a lot of people with creative/imaginative mindsets that would end up being good at higher level mathematics. I was kind of inspired to make this post by [This Video](https://umsystem.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=a8656409-597c-4b18-bfdf-aaff015a0576&start=2079.839818), which I think does a great job showing how this could be taught around things like Dividing by Zero, and how teaching math in a more explorational and playful way could be much more engaging for students who typically are drawn to math.

Life is too short to not have good sex till we are too old to do so."" 

2. ""It was an arranged marriage, love and lust were not even a consideration in the first place, other things like religion/caste(too common in India)/diplomatic relationships etc were considered. The couple was not compatible at all, but they were forced to marry. It was completely the decision and abuse by their families. The other partner does not want an open relationship as they care about the other reasons more than their SO/scared of families. Leaving is not possible due to pressure by families. Having and affair would satisfy their sexual needs, and if caught would force divorce so benefitted either way.""

3.""The relationship became toxic, the victim of the abuse(not sexual) is manipulated to fear leaving the relationship and hence cheats to get their sexual needs met.""

4.""Law does not forbid it. Everything legal is moral. The way one defines their own morality is upto them and we should not judge as long as they abide by the laws.""

Now clearly the predators are the bad guys in the situation based on what they’re doing. And while the intention of the vigilante groups may state they’re there to protect children, and that may be a consideration, the purpose is just because it’s trendy content that can get views and money. If these channels were only pulling in 1,000 views a video would they actually pursue this

Very few of these groups even attempt to get police involvement because it’s not conducive to creating content. They would have to put more time into it, would need to follow the law which results in less content, and therefore less money. The outcome would be more people going to jail but that doesn’t make for popular content. 

They’re prioritizing entertainment and money over the safety of children (some of these channels actually use children). The second this trend dies they will be on to the next one that gets them views.

Sex is the most intimate form of connection one human can provide other. Even though one has the right to decide what value they give this act for themselves, and when making relationships, they should always match with another person who values sex in the same way atleast at the beginning, and then break up when there are disparities. Cheating would simply be  devaluing the other persons intimacy which they decided to give you on the promise of fidelity. If the other person held sex in high regard, it is one of the biggest emotional blows a person can face. I believe it to be worst thing a human can legally do.

Some people would argue that one of the partner does not satisfy them sexually. They have kids and divorce is a worse option for the kids. They have tried discussing about finding sexual lovers outside marriage, but the other partner 'does not care about their sexual demand' or 'too entitiled after not performing'. Life is too short to not have good sex when we are young. I don't agree with this because cheating poses higher risks for the children as it sets a bad example for them and also distance them from the cheating parent, leading to their hindered development. I believe this to be more important than risks posed by simply divorce.

Some also give another very strong argument that it was an arranged marriage, love and lust were not even a consideration in the first place, other things like religion/caste(too common in India)/diplomatic relations etc were considered. The couple was not compatible at all, but they were forced to marry. It was completely the decision and abuse by their families. The other partner does not want an open relationship as they care about the other reasons more than their SO or is simply afraid of losing ''dignity' in case family finds out. Leaving is not possible due to pressure by families. Having an affair would satisfy their sexual needs, and if caught would force divorce so benefitted either way. 

Another situation where people justify cheating is when the relationship became toxic, the victim of the abuse(not sexual) is manipulated to fear leaving the relationship and hence cheats to get their sexual needs met.

Both of these are situations that have the same premise that somehow leaving is very difficult. However I would argue that these are situations where leaving is still possible and I would still believe the fact ""leaving is better than cheating"" remains true despite the cheater being made to believe otherwise."

Here's my definition inspired by Mentiswave with some examples

""Woke, I believe, is an aggressive push for identity politics for the sake of identity politics and is often hypocritical.  
People getting mad that The Witcher 3 is mostly white people without thinking about the fact it takes place in medieval Poland is woke  
People cool with a black Ariel but not a light skin Storm is woke.

1,2024-01-03,cmv: It Is Therefore I Am,u/No-Adhesiveness-8688,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18xeu9f/cmv_it_is_therefore_i_am/,changemyview,"For the Mods: the question is imbedded in the thesis 

  I think therefore I am, I know therefore I am, I understand therefore I am, I doubt therefore I am; these phrases are all apart of a sum of “it is” whatever that “it,” is. It can be doing something, it can be not be doing something. It can be something, it can be nothing at all, just nothing in particular to give a completely new perspective. I am challenging the old notion, “I think therefore I am” and changing the phrase to, “It is therefore I am.”

 “It” is means “it” is, no matter who is thinking about “it.” Thinking can mean, I am thinking about something or someone. Thinking can mean the way the brain processes information. Thinking can be about an emotion I am experiencing as a result of external or internal stimuli. Thinking has too many different definitions and “it is” has only one meaning. Either way the argument which I am about to talk about cannot use “I think.”

 It is easier to know, “it is”. Simply because, “it,” means nothing as much as, “it,” means everything. The word thinking is subjective to the mind, specifically, the mind of the individual who is thinking. I cannot know what my thoughts are always going to be nor can I control all the things I think. I do not own all the thoughts I think of, and I cannot be because of the thoughts I have. I choose the thoughts which makes me, me and therefore my thinking does not make me, nor the thoughts I choose to accept make me, me either.
 
 Moreover, I cannot think therefore I am because I don’t have my own thoughts or belong to all the ideas “my brain” decides to conjure up. I cannot think of everything that makes me, me. It is the inability to know all my thoughts, in conjunction with the fact I cannot control my thoughts that makes this phrase fallible.

 What I would come to realize is that thinking does not come from me, nor am I the one who thinks. It is something that thinks and I hear those thoughts in my experience. That something which I hear those thoughts through is defined by science as my “brain”. I say this because I don’t own all the thoughts that I think, nor am I all the thoughts I think, so therefore I am not “I think.” 

 If I choose to lie, my actions make me a liar not my thoughts. If no one knew I lied in my thoughts, I would never be called a liar. If I think about lying but don’t lie, that also doesn’t make me a liar. Does the thought of me lying or wanting to tell a lie make me a liar? No, I have to lie to be called a liar. It is through the action of deceiving that makes me a liar. It wouldn’t make sense if I said “I think about lying therefore I am a liar.” It makes far more sense if I said “I lie(d) therefore I am a liar.”

 If I think I will eat a sandwich, I am not the sandwich I am about to eat, nor did I think that eating a sandwich was me. It is argued that we are what we eat, but I am not a cow, even though I eat cow. Eating that cow cannot physically change me into a cow, I am still human. The thought, eat, came to me because I was hungry and a sandwich came out as the thought of things I can eat. I was not even thinking about what I should eat, or what I should not eat, “ it” just gave me the thought and I experienced “its’” thought through my “brain.” How then can “I think,” become me? If I think of a sandwich it is not me who the sandwich is. The sandwich which is imagined in my mind that is created by “it” through my “brain” and for me does not make the sandwich me. 

 The phrase I think therefore I am can fall into this trap of thinking. I would rather use the phrase “It is therefore I am.” Moreover, “it” and “is” are two things which are not perspective at all and cannot be owned by or with an object. The phrase “It is,” is not affected by the mind of the person who is thinking “it is.” “Is” and “it” are both universally understood as “it” and “is”, while thinking is again subjective to who is thinking.

 Me not controlling what I think is a good indication that “I think therefore I am” is stated unfortunately and wildly untrue. I do not think myself. “It” is rather a process of “it” whatever “it” is that is thinking. I just experience the thoughts of “it,” whatever “it” is that is allowing me to have these thoughts now, as much as the thoughts I have had in the past and the thoughts I will have after this moment.

This means that anyone whose ancestors have not lived in the region for centuries, well before the founding of modern-day Israel, can also claim citizenship and the RTSD.

How it will help is that it will give people a clear understanding of their current abilities and holes that they can fill up and improve, as well of being very efficient at a shorter timeframe.

Not only would it help student to be more efficient, it will also be extrapolate into other domains that require a lot of focus, such as learning a new skill, going to university, solving everyday problems etc.

Wouldn't it be beneficial for soceity if ideally everyone could be able to learn on their own and be self-sufficient? In my opinion, I believe that could help with the challenges we face with education, as we further shifts towards a fully digital curriculum, the lack of timeless practical skills will probably cause more problems down the line.

In Princess Morbucks' debut episode, ""Stuck up, up and away,"" she expressed interest in becoming a Powerpuff Girl because she was so accustomed to getting whatever she wanted just for the asking. The girls say no, which set her off because *it was not something that was ever told to her*.

On two separate occasions, Princess expressed desire to become a Powerpuff Girl, which were met with hostility from Buttercup, where she came close to physically assaulting her for even wanting to be a Powerpuff Girl, only to be held back by Blossom and for Blossom to diplomatically let Princess down.

Things came to a head on the third day, where the four of them have a fight. Buttercup finally attacked Princess, only to get thrashed by Princess. Apparently, Buttercup thinks that wanting to be a Powerpuff Girl was ""asking for it for a long time,"" which is unhinged.

The ones that do it for the unpunished violence. I feel like, if we punished every soldier that hides behind ""Was just following orders"" more severly, we would start to finally see a change in the military. Until then, more of these kind of people will be attracted to this job.

For example, Vietnam. The massacre of My Lai was only the one that got the most publicity, as it was only one in a long series of massacres that were even more brutal. It was a common occurance for South Vietnam and US soldiers to kill and rape civilians, and many of their fellow soldiers, even if didn't participate, did nothing to stop them. In fact, men like Hugh Thompson Jr. were the exception, willing to shoot his own comrades to stop the atrocity. If the soldiers that knowingly did nothing to stop the others or the ones that directly participated, received harsher sentences, these kind of people would not see the military as the way to let loose and commit war crimes, and less would enlist to it.

Another example: Guantanamo. Today we can say the situation is a lot better, at least when viewed from outside. But in the earlier days, doctors and US soldiers tortured people from all over the world, with the only charge against them being that of terrorism, but without a trial. If it is ever closed, the military and the government could finally do something right and punish every soldier, from the higher ups to the simple guard, that let torture go on, ordered it or partecipated directly in. The defense of ""Just following orders"" was not even valid at Nuremberg, so why would it be now? Even if the ones that they did it against were ALL terrorists(something that i think can be true, especially after many were given clearance to be sent back to their countries), they still did inhuman actions against defenseless people, that consisted of sodomy, torture and humiliation.

Even if punished, soldiers recieve laughable punishments, nothing compared to what they have done. And most of the time the ones that are punished are the scapegoats, the ones stupid enough to be caught and be the recipient of all public hate, while the rest continue committing atrocities.

The military, at least for now, is only a collection of inhuman, cruel and monstruos people that participate in atrocities, order atrocities, and silently endorse atrocities.

I have recently come to this view because of a video I saw from Emma Watson where she describes paparazzi trying to get upskirt pictures from the day she turned 18.

In short, the capitalist system runs only on reward, and not on punishment. I think that’s a bad thing. 

I do not propose consumers can just take money from companies. That would amount to stealing and many people would just do this because they want the money. I propose either a tax voucher consumers receive yearly and could pass on to companies or a system where consumers can pay a tax where the companies they choose would have to match that amount (or perhaps a multiple of it) or the right to take certain products from companies for free simply to destroy them.

I have glimpses of memory all throughout my life hearing it in media. On Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar. Listing to the audiobook for To Kill a Mockingbird. On South Park's Wheel of Fortune episode. In Dave Chappelle's specials. Every one of these memories is associated with a palpable sense of discomfort.

What I am looking for here is someone capable of removing that sense of discomfort associated with the word. Someone capable of breaking into extremely deeply rooted, damn near intrinsic social programming and make a change. I'm pretty certain it's not going to be easy.

This would include the dismantling of the vast majority of settlements. It would include airport and seaport in Gaza, probably after a few years given that the agreement is kept. it would include some symbolic right of return for some tens of thousands of people as well as some monetary compensation. it would include end of demands on both sides as well as commitment to peace. it would likely include for at the very least 20 years demilitarization of the Palestinian state. It would include some kind of assurances for the holy sights in Jerusalem.   
It could include some other things or not exactly follow the numbers I've given here, but that's the jist of it. Some of you may not agree that it's reasonable, but this is how most of the world views a reasonable pragmatic solution these days.

I define Committing to peace to be - stopping any violent attempts and denouncing them in the few cases whenever they do happen instead of celebrating them on the streets. changing the education material to promote peace. eliminating the famous ""Martyr fund"" (paying terrorists). Issuing many public statements that they want peace and willing to compromise on a reasonable solution. Possibly removing corrupt holocaust denier Abbas from the PA. Possibly public acknowledgement of Israel \*as a Jewish state\*. Changing Hamas' charter (even the updated one) or replacing them. Basically showing the Israelis and the world that they actually want peace.   


Basic analysis of why I think it's the case.   


1) Palestinians haven't actually tried this alternative. You can't find long periods where there aren't violent attacks aimed at Israelis. These days, it looks like there isn't any will to go towards peace where on Gaza you have Hamas as the Palestinian government and on the WB you have the very unpopular PA that's considered moderate even though they have some very non-peaceful activity like pay-to-slay policies and educating to hate Israel. According to polls - the majority of the Palestinian public believes that violent attacks would server the Palestinians cause. A large number of them believes that Israel has no right to exist in any form and wouldn't be settled with any 2 state solution.  


2) The Israeli narrative in majority of society is built on peace. It is built on the idea where Israel wants peace while their Arab neighbors want to destroy Israel. Accepting the division plan in 48. returning lands to Egypt for peace. offering 2 state solutions while the Palestinians decline. These were major moments in Israeli society. Even more recently - offering any Arab state that doesn't recognize Israel normalization of relations in the Abraham accords. There are songs about peace. Yitzhak Rabin, the leader that was arguably the closest to achieving peace is celebrated for that in most of society etc. In recent years, this narrative has been weaker, partly due to more and more terror attacks and the rejections of peace plans that's caused many of the Israeli public to think that - ""there's currently no real partner for peace"". Palestinians showing that there is a partner for peace would likely empower the first narrative.   


3) Israel is a democracy. while you may argue that some of Netanyahu's government are fanatics that wouldn't agree to a Palestinian state - in less than 3 years there would be an Israeli elections (if not sooner). This government was unpopular even before October 7th with massive protests that included the most influential parts of Israeli society. If the Palestinians would show will to peace it would affect the elections a lot. This is especially true when Arab Israelis that are about 20% of the population vote in relatively low numbers and this is an issue that's close to many of their hearts.   


4) The world - many countries in the world want to see this conflict end. Whether it's presidents of countries that want to gain political support for solving possibly the most complicated conflict in recent history, whether it's countries that care for both sides, and whether it's countries that have interest in peace in the area - we'd see heavy pressure on Israel to agree to such calls. On a pragmatic level - Israel not supporting peace despite Palestinians showing genuine and consistent efforts towards peace would heavily undermine Israel's position in the world. This is likely to affect any government as well as the decisions of the Israeli public. Currently, this is not the case, many countries understand the Israeli position here - that they don't want to live next to a place that wants to kill them and has ways to do so,  and we don't see a strong pressure for a two state solution. I think most of the countries just wait for Abbs to die before trying again.   


5) Parameters that are close to what I wrote above have been suggested before, and are supported by some grassroot peace initiatives as well as major institutions. I also think that within these parameters you could keep the large Israeli settlements under Israeli control which would mean that Israel could evacuate realistically the other settlements as it has done in the past in Gaza or Sinai.  


Change my view :)

I've had hundreds if not thousands of convos/debates with feminists over the past decade+. Yes, there are good ones, but talking to virtually any feminist who is part of an organization, including a subreddit, goes the same way- hostility, trivializing or denying male victims of DV. Just browse any feminist subreddit- sure they'll make a token ""yes men can be victims too"", but the majority of what they say is along the lines of ""most women's violence in the self defense"" (lies and victim blaming), ""men cant be seriously injured"" (lie and trivialization), etc. They abused Erin Pizzey, and today lie about it, there's the video I can't find of them storming a support group for male victims screaming at them and calling them ""women beaters.""

&#x200B;

It was feminists who constructed the duluth model, which de facto trains police to assume men are the perpetrators in any domestic call. in 2020, they pushed to amend the proposed domestic abuse bill to become gendered- it was initially gender neutral, which they protested against.

These companies have spent enormous amounts of money on anti-environmental causes and propaganda. They take large sums of money in subsidies from the government, and rape our land for profit.

The fossil fuel industry should be nationalized with a legal imperative to use all profits for environmental causes with a special focus on reducing net emissions, developing environmentally responsible energy infrastructure, and restoring damaged wilderness areas. There should also be an imperative to decrease fossil fuels production over time and transition  completely to environmentally responsible forms of energy generation by a set date, to be decided by experts weighing the practicality of the transition against the threat of climate change.

This is not a magic bullet to kill global warming but I believe it would help. I anticipate the following rebuttals.

""This sets a dangerous precedent, that the government can nationalize entire industries at will.""
-This precedent has already been set. The government seized large amounts of infrastructure during each of the world wars. This is an emergency of comparable, if not greater, scale than the world wars.

""The government is corrupt and incompetent, they'd just screw it up.""
-The fossil fuel industry is currently an active enemy of environmentalism. Replacing it with an entity with a legal imperative to work for environmental causes would be an improvement even if the new entity is incompetent. Corruption is a potential threat in any organization, of course, but I see no reason to believe that fossil fuel companies are less corrupt than the US government.

""Gas prices would skyrocket!""
-Maybe they would, or maybe they wouldn't. It's impossible to say for sure but even if they did increase, that's a price I'm willing to pay.

""Communist!""
-I don't care if you think this is communism. The environment is more important than your preference in economic systems.

""What about gas stations and other small businesses?""
-Any business which does not produce or extract fossil fuels would not be nationalized.

""But most oil and coal isn't extracted in the US, so it would be pointless.""
-The United States could have a positive impact on the environment by doing this, and the development of environmentally responsible infrastructure would make it easier for other countries to build similar infrastructure."

The following arguments make life seem inherently immoral and should not exist, change my view if you can. 

&#x200B;

1. Consent - Nobody ever asked to be born and live through a lifetime of risk, of pain, of suffering and tragic deaths. Even the most perfect life ends with death and hardly harm free. People try to argue that procreation is justified if most people don't hate their lives and accept death, but that's just a cold utilitarian view, not a moral argument. Even if all lives are perfect and we live in Utopia (Utopia is impossible), every birth is still a consent violation, is it not? We suspend consent for children, medical emergency, conscription, etc, but those are done to reduce existing harm, not to create unnecessary harm out of nothing, which is what procreation is. You also can't say consent doesn't matter because nobody can say no to their own birth, because that's like saying its ok to harm somebody if they can't say no, its ok to smoke and drink and do drugs because the fetus can't tell the pregnant mom to stop, that's ridiculous logic. 
2. Selfishness - All births are selfish, no exception, because nobody can be born for their own sake, we are all born to fulfill the selfish desires of parents, society, country, species, etc. Even if parents love us and care for us, we are still created for their emotional fulfillment, NOT for our own benefit, because we never asked for it, remember? What happens when we encounter suffering and other serious harm in life? That's the parent's fault for knowingly exposing us to a risk filled world, just because they wanted kids to make their own lives fulfilling, isn't it? We become nothing but living means to our parent's emotional fulfillment end. 
3. Suffering - no amount of suffering or victims can ever be justified, you simply can't say life is justified because most people don't suffer or die tragically, because that's totally immoral for the victims. You also can't say it's acceptable for some people to be seriously harmed because there are more people that will not be seriously harmed. Ridiculous logic, isn't it? This means we simply cannot create life using this logic, it's inconsiderate and cruel. You also can't say life is justified because Utopia will come soon, because that's an unlikely (more like impossible) fantasy. 

Summary: 

All three arguments complement each other, once you combine them, you can't escape the conclusion that life is simply immoral and should not exist. Without consent, with parental selfishness and unsolvable suffering, it is just not possible to justify life. What should we do about this conclusion? Well, some people suggest voluntary extinction, but that won't prevent animals suffering, so others have proposed a technological solution that may one day painlessly erase all of life, like what Thanos did, ehehe. 

I'm not saying we should do this, just stating what people think. But still, my view stands, I just don't see how life can be morally justified. Can you guys change my view? 

What is so great about life that we have to accept so many moral violations, harm and suffering to create and maintain it? Why do we assume life is moral by default? "

A real estate agent is essentially just doing some of the leg work of searching or haggling for you but it really doesn't require too many extra skills that a normal person couldn't do. Really the best reason to have an agent is just that other agents will make your life harder if you try to sell by owner.  All you really need is a title agency to write up the contract and that is basically how real estate deals are handled in much of the world. Real estate agents are paid significant commissions for doing work that isn't all that necessary and we could eliminate the entire industry tomorrow, or cut the commissions paid by half, without much harm to consumers or the broader economy.

I hear all the time that employees don't owe the company anything and that they shouldn't be required to put in a 2-week notice. This is wrong.

An employee/company relationship is a perfectly even trade: you get tasks done for them, they pay you money.

If they were to lay you off, you would receive a severance package. Severance packages ensure that the company isn't screwing you over completely and leaving you high and dry. They are giving you a cushion while you find another job.

Giving your 2-week notice is exactly the same. If you quit on the spot, you're putting the company in a tough spot and leaving them high and dry. They will have to scramble, and the people who will most likely be affected by your action are your peers who will have to pick up your workload. By giving them notice, you are ensuring that they have time to figure things out before you're gone, just like a severance package gives you time to find another job.

Yeah, yeah, I already hear you saying, ""Well what if they don't give me a severance package?"" And my response is that it is morally wrong for them to not give it to you, just like it's morally wrong to not give them a 2-week notice when you quit. In other words, yes, a company doesn't HAVE to give you severance, and you don't HAVE to give them a 2-week notice, but both are the right thing to do. **So for you to expect your company to give you severance if they were to lay you off but not respect them enough to give them notice is hypocritical.**

I've been laid off twice, my wife has been laid off once, and I have tons of friends who have been laid off, and we ALL received generous severance packages (Typically 2 weeks pay per year of employment + PTO and benefits buyout). So companies tend to take care of their employees when they terminate them.

(To be clear, I am not referring to instances where you are being fired. Companies have every right to fire you without severance if you break a rule or do something wrong. Just like you have every right to walk out if your boss is abusive or manipulative.)"

Now, I know, most of us have kinks and fetishes. Some of which we prefer to keep to ourselves.

However, I encountered some transgender and plus-sized women online who argue that any kind of fetish towards another human being is immoral as you reduce the person to mere appearance and sound. Eventually, I became ashamed of fetishizing women I see on adult websites and started to wonder if I am an asshole or a meanie for objectifying women.

As I see it, there are three options here:

1. Donald Trump is genuinely, actually, overwhelmingly stupid. As in, 85 IQ stupid. 
2. Donald Trump knew what Jeffrey Epstein did, and still openly praised him. He voluntarily rode on his plane, spent time with him,  even brought his children around him. 
3. I don't actually have a third option, **for me to change my mind I think you'd have to come up with a third explanation and prove that it is likely or reasonable.** 

And this is the best case scenario, I'll refrain from too much unnecessary theorization about Trump's possible further actions, but I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that he may have also participated in poor conduct, Epstein-style.

I disagree with this, and think that as long as the art is good quality then it's fine, I also don't think that promotion of sickening ideas is a point against the art itself (eg, rap that talks about fucking hoes and shooting people and all that jazz).

I think we should be challenged more by this stuff, we shouldn't treat art made by bad people as worse by default. Especially because we completely pick and choose who is okay and who isn't (eg, Roman Polanski is fine, but Kevin Spacey isn't, double funny because they're the same kind of terrible person).

One of my favourite films is Natural Born Killers, a film that treats the two murderers as loveable goofballs. They psychologically torture their victims before killing them. It never treats the murder part as something for us to resent the main two characters for, if anything it villainises the justice system and the journalist trying to expose them to the world.

What we should do more of is allow terrible people to make art and accept the art even if it promotes terrible and hateful ideologies. We should free up our world to discuss any kind of issues without fear of reprise.

This isn't about being able to critique art, or consider things to be in bad taste. And it's fine to acknowledge that art is promoting a bad ideology. But I don't think it's fine to dismiss art like this outright. Although it's a natural reaction for a lot of people, so it's not like I have a solution here. I just don't stop engaging with things I enjoy because I find out their creator is a bad person. They can be a bad person and an artistic genius. Hitler's art was pretty good, it's not world changing but it's not terrible either, just a bit generic."

Anti-vaxxer content often spreads misinformation that can lead to real-world consequences, affecting public health and safety. Censoring such content aims to mitigate the impact of false information. While I value freedom of speech, I argue that when speech poses a clear threat to public health, there's a need to strike a balance. Censorship, in this context, aims to protect the greater good.  Social media platforms have a responsibility to the communities they serve. Censoring anti-vaxxer content aligns with the ethical obligation to prevent the spread of information that can harm individuals and communities. Given the interconnectedness of our world, the spread of vaccine-related misinformation can have far-reaching consequences. Censorship may serve as a means to limit the global impact of such misinformation."

Being dead doesn't have any potential to bother the condemned as there is noone/nothing left to be bothered. (If you believe in an afterlife, the afterlife just starts sooner, but it wouldn't last longer or shorter because of being executed per se.) Bringing the inevitable (death) forward in time cannot consitute a punishment in and of itself, because the condemned is not left to remember the bringing forward in time of death. The only thing that is taken from the condemned is something they were certain of losing at some point anyway. And even then, the life is cut short, but eventually there is noone whom it is taken from. As there is no consciousness experiencing anything having been taken away.

In short: The outlook of your life being cut short, with the execution being open to the public, knowing you leave loved ones behind, is a punishment for as long as you have left to live. The actual taking of the life is not a punishment, because a life being taken away is not experienced by the condemned at any point.

Please, change my view."

1,2024-01-03,CMV: The Term 'People of Color' is Problematic and Perpetuates Existing Issues,u/Anonymous345678910,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18y09pq/cmv_the_term_people_of_color_is_problematic_and/,changemyview,"As someone who identifies as a person from an underrepresented background (what some people would consider a “minority”), I have always been conscious of the language used to describe different ethnic groups. However, one term that has always bothered me is 'people of color.' While it may seem like a harmless and inclusive term, I believe that it is actually offensive and perpetuates existing issues in our society.

First of all, let's break down the term 'people of color.' The word 'color' refers to skin color *(something that has been a constant cause of division in our society)*, and by grouping all ‘non-white’ individuals under this label, it implies that ‘whiteness’ is the norm (still). This reinforces the idea that this is the default and anything else is 'other.' It also homogenizes the experiences and cultures of different non-white groups, reducing them to a single category.

Moreover, every time I hear the the term 'people of color', I can’t help but think it has the same feel as the term 'colored' used during the time of segregation. While it may not be as explicitly derogatory, it still carries the connotation of segregation and division based on race and skin tone. It also has a proven history of being used by white people to refer to non-white individuals, further perpetuating the idea of a racial hierarchy.

Additionally, the term 'people of color' is often used by those in positions of power, such as politicians, companies, and media outlets, as a way to appear inclusive and politically correct. However, this is often just a performative gesture and does not address the systemic issues that continue to oppress and marginalize people of color. In fact, using this term can actually divert attention away from the specific issues and struggles faced by different “minority” groups while having the appearance of recognizing them.

Furthermore, the term 'people of color' ignores the fact that race is indeed a social construct and that individuals within this group have diverse and unique experiences. It reduces people to a single dimension, disregarding the complexities of their identities. *Of course, skin color varies from person to person, so the visible pigment of the skin (whether brown, tan, olive, etc.) is not a made-up construct. That being said, the idea that this color of your skin somehow separates you from being “normal” or even existing in relation to another person who does not have the same skin tone, is where the problem of race comes in, which is why I say it’s a social construct..*

I also believe that the term 'people of color' is a step back in society. While it may have been a breakthrough and progressive (i.e. forward-thinking) term in the past, the fact that it is still used today shows that we have not made as much progress as we would like to think. It continues to discount the unique and detailed ethnicities by grouping everyone under the bracket of “color,” when in reality the majority of the “people of color” have very different cultures and backgrounds that have nothing to do with their darker skin. Some of them don’t even consider their skin color a determining factor of these cultures. With this term used to collectively refer to a large group of people, it’s still nothing more than an exclusion of a variety of people—to maintain a distinction that focuses on the wrong aspect of what makes these people distinct in the first place.

Some may argue that the term 'people of color' is necessary for unity and solidarity among marginalized groups. Perhaps that is a reasonable observation. However, I believe that there are better ways to achieve this without homogenizing and reducing diverse groups to a single label. We should focus on acknowledging and celebrating our differences rather than trying to fit everyone into a single category. Acknowledgement is not the same as classification as if we are to be put into a box.

To conclude, I believe that the term 'people of color' is offensive and perpetuates existing issues in our society. It reinforces the idea of a racial hierarchy, homogenizes different ‘non-white’ groups, and ignores the complexities of individual identities and cultures. While I am of course open to my view being changed, I still believe that there are better ways to promote inclusivity and unity among marginalized groups. My view states that it is time to move away from this outdated approach and problematic term and start using language that truly embraces diversity and celebrates the unity in our differences instead of simply creating new ways to be seperated and labeled."

The core idea is that the type of person that would abandon their shopping cart in the parking lot is likely a bad member of society.  On the other hand, someone who puts their cart back in the corral is demonstrating a basic level of selflessness by doing something marginally helpful for the whole parking lot and shopping cart system.

This whole thing got thrown around the internet with thought pieces arguing for or against. Plenty have pointed out the theory is ableist in a lot of ways. There are other critiques, and like all grand theories, it can’t be considered all-encompassing, or black and white. Feel free to google the discourse, I am not interested in debating the Shopping Cart Theory on its own by its own merits.

My View is that The ‘Shopping Cart Test’ of good/bad societal membership is imperfect, but it’s still the best one we got.

Some huge percentage of people in America go to big stores (target, Costco, grocery stores, etc.) with big parking lots on a regular basis. Frequently, those people use shopping carts. I’d argue the whole thing is as universal an experience as there is in America today.

Of that percentage of Americans, I’d argue that the majority are capable of returning their carts to the corral or the storefront after using it.

Altogether, I think the theory mostly holds up, and it’s a semi-useful way to judge somebody’s character, with the known caveats that are out there.

BUT, I’ll C my V if someone can identify another scenario that is a better, more all encompassing, litmus test for good/bad member of society.  

So it’s gotta be something that is:

- as universally experienced as shopping carts in parking lots, 

- as cleanly, A/B, simple as returning or not returning a cart, 

- and as intrinsically selfless as returning a cart (an act that the performer receives no real benefit from, nor does the performer have any real say who will benefit from the act).

Feel free to pick apart anything else I’ve put in here. I’m coming in good faith and to have a little fun."

If something bad were to happen to Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Lauren Boebert, Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, etc. I don't believe the liberal response would be one of, ""Oh, that's terrible, I wish that hadn't happened - hope they get better soon."" I think the response would be ""GOOD, they **deserved** it.""

If you were to give a liberal a big red button and tell them, *""If you push this button, the nation gets universal healthcare, a huge reduction in carbon emissions, a $20/hour minimum wage, higher taxes on the rich, nationwide free access to contraception and abortion, and the only price to be paid in return is that 1 million MAGA-hat-wearing anti-LGBT fascist right-wing thugs will drop dead,""* I firmly believe that not only would many liberals press that button, they'd **SMACK** it.

Being part of a family that is under the poverty line, I have strong feelings about the status of bottom class workers and sourced labor in the U.S Economy and believe that it is quasi-slavery in reality.   
  
My reasoning is that most of the jobs worked by those groups are in warehouse and retail industries that, in my experience, are extremely strict when it is not needed in forms of limited bathroom time, micro-management, etc. Those workers are without a doubt treated as being lesser human beings, God forbids you get sick or a member of your family dies and having to ask permission to take a sick day off or go to the funeral ceremony. If you treated like cattle by being told when to eat/rest, having set durations bathroom and have to beg them to take UNPAID time off, then what is the difference between you and the slave?  
  
Before you answer the question about, take a look at your boss/CEO and think to yourself, would they accept those work conditions themselves? what about their children ? you already know the answer.

What irked me about it is that as a Business & Engineering college student, I get to see people from that don't even know how to make a PDF — let alone fix a car — get paid highlight to fk around from 70% to 80% just so I can go back home and see both my dad and mom having to survive while working 40 hours jobs  (80 if you include Uber driving).

Now I do understand that they get paid to do the job, and can quit whenever they want but in reality the can barely survive without government subsidies and for the most part, if they quit, they likely to end up having a different employer with the same work environment (admittingly, even they don't see a problem with it which in my opinion is because that's how they have been working for many years).

Note: I am open to hear out any arguments against my take. However, I would like to ask you to please avoid saying blanket statements like the economy will crash, who is going to work their jobs, etc as countries with better equality between the classes/types of jobs but by all means use anything if it's a crucial part of your argument.

For everyone to decide to self extinct on a global scale.

I can see only one singular downside to the extinction of humankind (which I think is ultimately worth it) and I will address it at the end.

However, there are multiple positives I can think of when it comes to the voluntary extinction of the human race.

- no more human suffering of any kind or capacity be it illness, wage slavery, wars, poverty, boredom and grief

- no more animal suffering as a direct result of human action, we will no longer hunt/poach animals, eat them or torture them for research purposes 

- the environment would thrive better and host its other occupants such as plants and animals more efficiently

- it would be very empowering to be in charge of our destiny and to die on our own terms. Rather than say, slowly dying as a species via fallout radiation after an inevitable nuclear war of grand proportion. Or as earth becomes unliveable due to the worsening climate crisis. It would be very wholesome to die on our own terms and with dignity. 

- nobody would actually exist anymore to care about the fact humans are extinct so it’s really and truly not a big deal whatsoever. It’s non existence.



Now, on to the 1 downside. It would kinda suck because obviously there would be that last generation of people who would suffer their final days on earth. 

They’d have nobody and nothing. They’d struggle for food, meds, basic necessities, electricity etc as nobody exists to provide these services. Or if provisions are put into place in advance, there’s no guarantee they would last or function until every last human dies. 

And they’d all be too old to do it themselves. So that is kinda bleak to think about. 


I mention it so you pls don’t use this as a way to CMV as I am aware of it and it does not change my view.

I believe all noble acts require sacrifice and this final generation are the sacrifice I guess so it would still be worth it for the betterment of planet earth and cessation of human suffering.

1,2024-01-04,CMV: The idea that ''Just 7% of spoken communication is verbal'' is false and/or meaningless.,u/LandOfGreyAndPink,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18y8onx/cmv_the_idea_that_just_7_of_spoken_communication/,changemyview,"This claim was originally developed from findings by Mehrabian in the late 1960s. I've come across it several times, e.g. in counselling courses, and it's always put across in an unquestioning, blase, matter-of-fact way. However, I believe that insofar as it can be true or false, it's false; and, insofar as it can be meaningful or not, it's meaningless.

\#1 A claim such as ''7% of spoken communication is verbal'' is an unusual one to make by a person familiar with statistics. Indeed, Mehrabian doesn't in fact state things this way - and rightly so. Instead, he talks about percentages of *variance*, a statistical concept. Compare:

\- ''81% of my happiness is derived from friends and nature'';

\-''The questionnaire I did found that 'friends' and 'nature' accounted for 81% of my \[rated\] happiness''.

You might say: These two statements are the same thing. In a sense, yes: if we want to create a popular media story, say, or we're having a casual chat with friends. But in other, important senses: no, they're not the same.

\#2 Often, verbal interactions involve a *goal* for at least one party, and here at least, words matter far more than other, non-verbal aspects. Perhaps paradoxically, because of this goal aspect, the exact words used often *don't* matter all that much. Suppose I go to a railway station to buy a train ticket. When I'm at the counter, I can wax lyrical to the cashier/seller/assistant, or mumble my request, or go on a lengthy monologue. To an important extent, which one I choose doesn't matter, as long as I get the ticket. Likewise, I can gesticulate a lot, smile (etc.), but again: if I get the ticket, my language has 'worked' - it has been successful, so to speak.

\#3 When I've come across the claim in training sessions, it's taken in a literal, matter-of-fact way: 'spoken communication' is taken to be something that we can meaningfully apply percentages to. In addition, we can break this 'spoken communication' down into meaningful, discrete components - verbal, non-verbal, etc. - and meaningfully apply percentages to those components, too. I argue that all this is totally misguided. Certainly, we can apply comparative terms here: 'I talk too much'; 'they use a lot of hand gestures when speaking', and so on. But that's about as far as it goes. It is, IMO, a mistake to think that we can therefore 'translate' these comparative terms into meaningful percentages. Compare:

''I'm a very messy person, especially at the weekend'' \[a true fact about me\];

''74.5% of my messiness occurs at the weekend''."

Furthermore, Adlerian Psychology, of which I am quite a fan, argues that deterministic approaches are simply avoiding responsibility, in that they can say: 'Don't worry, it's not your fault; you're like this because of your childhood/environment/neurotransmitters.'

Is anyone able to argue a strong case for our behaviour being out of our control?

Especially when you look at countries like Korea, Nigeria, China etc who dedicate their teenage lives to studying and most of the time end up broke. Meanwhile an American for example can just sleep all throughout school and get a $40k job afterwards.  
  
My solution is to have a promotion and relegation system at the education stage, let's use Holland as an example.  
  
Let's say a Dutch person got BBB in their A levels (or whatever education system they have over there) and a Nigerian got A\* A\* A\* then the Dutch person would be relegated and the Nigerian promoted. They would then swap houses and it would be law that the Dutch parents have to house the promoted Nigerian for at least 10 years and visa versa. It won't be as much trouble for the Nigerian family because the promoted person can send money back home.  
  
Any people not from Holland may take the exams for free and get their own examiner who comes along to invigilate.  
  
This system would be more fair to the majority of the world, however it would be expensive. My solution is that the people who get promoted will have to pay additional tax of let's say 10% to help fund this all, but only when they start getting a salary over 30k euros."

I was taught to balance a budget, plan for the future and stuff like that. The teacher we had talked about her going to an expensive private college and owing like 50k in debt.

as a high school jr, I thought, “is this lady stupid?” I was always tempted to ask her if she’d reconsider going to that college. Though I never said any of those things out loud.

Now I’m not some rich elite guy sitting on my tower saying, the poors shouldn’t go to college if they can’t afford it. I did go to college, I went to community college for a few years then finished at a local cheap university. You know how much I owed? Like 1500 bucks by the end. I didn’t stay in the dorm, I commuted from home to college and did classes online when I could. I could have had my teachers same job with significantly less debt if I decided to become a teacher. like imagine a person who eats a a high class restaurant and pays like 500 bucks and decides. “Why is food so expensive, the government needs to do something about this.”

Now to be fair, the cost of education can be insanely inflated, I mean they give loans to anybody no matter their major or likely ability to pay it back. If I ran a college and knew I could get guaranteed pay no matter how much I’d charge, I’d raise the tuition every year as well. Students should still be smart enough to consider the cost of education, their major and likely income and where they should attend school based on those factors. But that goes back to the title, college isn’t too expensive in general, expensive colleges are too expensive.

now I make more income than the average person, paid back my debt and have no problems. It would be insane for me to expect anyone to cancel the debt I had. Even if I didn’t make more than average, my debt was so low that I could pay it back without even using my degree. I was proactive in my decisions and thanks to that, I would have been okay no matter what."

He has won the World Cup for gods sake! That’s what every player dreams of, now he should focus on winning everything else at club level, break all the records, cement his name in history, his talent deserves to be all the way up there with Messi, Ronaldo, Maradona, Pele but unless PSG get their act together he will never reach those levels, how long will it take? 5 years? Longer than that? 

He’s already 25 years a old, Messi had 4 ballon d’or by that age and Ronaldo one, look at Haaland he has already won everything at club level because he decided he wanted to go to a club with a structure and a plan, he even is the favorite to be the next ballon d’or recipient, I do not understand why Mbappe is letting his best years go by.

Test cases are a way to increase the confidence you have in your system doing what you want it to do. Theoretically, if you have an entire codebase that is a black-box, if you write enough good test cases then you can be confident that the system is behaving in the way that you want it to regardless of the implementation.

1,2024-01-04,"CMV: The belief in modern day ""collapse"" is fundamentally wrong",u/GodlordHerus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18yj3fn/cmv_the_belief_in_modern_day_collapse_is/,changemyview,"Humans have been on Earth for at least 200,000 years. Life started before the Earth's inner core did, 3.7 billion years ago. Constantly changing and shifting into new life and systems.  Due to internal and external pressures. Human civilizations, in the \~12,000 year record we have, have also gone through similar changes. ""Collapse"" of human made systems into others is the norm. Modern day China and Egypt are built on top of \~5,000  years of collapse and re-birth. Iran, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe etc... and large parts of Europe all have similar stories. It is natural. Death and re-birth are a part of not only life but the very processes that make planets, stars and galaxies

  
Therefore I believe that what most people are afraid of when they discuss ""collapse"" isn't a fear of death or this natural process. But a fear of change

  
To clarify I'm aware that the process is/ may be violent. We have had 5 extinctions on Earth killing 50 to 80% of all life. But new more adaptive and complex life appeared, every-time! So where did this fear of change come from? The best answer I've been able to come up with is the 1990s. Post the Cold-War, the world found itself at the threshold of change.  Francis Fukuyama famously called it the ""End of history"" that this was the end-point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government. This statement not being true, in my opinion, is what people are actually afraid of. Because we (those who live in it) can't imagine anything outside of it. There is a fear at the heart of our societies that our systems may be broken and rather than fix them, we are doubling down

  
This fear also causes divisions among populations. With some feeling that the system was ""somehow"" perfect at a previous point (the 1960s/ 50s maybe 80s depending on the country). Them pushing for regression or a halting of any progression. While others, out of disillusionment, come to see a mixture with other failed systems such as one party communism/fascism  as the only solution. Or the issue being scale, dedicating themselves to proliferation and assimilation of as much of the world as possible. All these feelings best exemplified in Brexit.

  
I don't think the collapse of ""western"" society will be the end of humanity. Realistically speaking it only \~10% (893 million) of the global population (8 billion). The rise of China and India show that (as in the past with the rise of the US itself post WWII) new powers come in to fill the void. Even in the worst case scenario, total global nuclear war. There are estimates that say the high end, including nuclear winter is \~4 billion  (50%). Humanity won't end

1,2024-01-04,"CMV: Anti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic, though both Zionists and Anti-Zionists can be antisemitic",u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18yjhdv/cmv_antizionism_is_not_inherently_antisemitic/,changemyview,"Zionism is the national movement for the return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel. It is NOT just the self-determination of the Jewish people. To disagree with Zionism is not to deny Jewish people of their right to self-determination, but to resist the maintenance of **Jewish sovereignty** in **Israel**. 

It's not anti-Kurdish to say that Kurds shouldn't have their own state, or anti-Scot to say Scots shouldn't be independent in Scotland, or anti-Roma to say that Roma shouldn't be granted a state. Therefore it is not antisemitic to say that the Jewish people shouldn't have their own state.

Furthermore, saying that Jewish people shouldn't have their own state is not the same as saying Israelis shouldn't have their own state, just as saying Whites shouldn't have their own state in England is not the same as saying the English shouldn't have their own state in England. There is a leap of logic that Israeli == Jews for that equivalence to hold true. One can hold anti-Zionist position while believing that Israelis living in modern-day Israel deserve a state, which is also my position.

On top of that, it's not antisemitic to say that a people shouldn't have inherent sovereignty in a country. If someone says ""There should be White or Black sovereignty in America"", you are not a racist to criticise that person.

Lastly, no group is entitled to return to their homeland. Americans of German descent are not entitled to anything in Germany, the Romani people are not entitled to anything in northwest India. Chinese diaspora in Singapore are not entitled to anything in China. Singaporean Chinese can't just move to ShenZhen and start claiming the city belongs to them. I am not anti-German, anti-Roma, anti-Chinese for pointing all of these out, so why am I antisemitic for pointing this in Zionism out?

With that being said, there are anti-Zionists and Zionists that are antisemitic. On one hand, it's not uncommon to hear things like ""Zionists control the media/the bank"", ""Zionists are too rich"", etc. in the anti-Zionist camp, these are antisemitic statements and should be condemned. On the other, many neo-Nazi parties and fundamentalist Christians are vehement supporters of Zionism yet they hold some very antisemitic views. A report in the UK showed that the far-right are 3x more likely to hold antisemitic views than the average public."

Furthermore, the resulting primary battle in the Democratic Party would overwhelmingly drown out Donald Trump in the media. It’d be  front page news every day until Nov 7.

In this era, it's pedophilia. We've come terrifyingly close to giving up our privacy/security for the sake of catching pedophiles online. Legal ambitions to end encryption and force companies to install backdoors have been quite prevalent. Much of the MAGA crowd is fueled primarily my pedophilia hysteria. It's completely dominated our politics, and lacks much benefit in terms of protecting children. We lock people up for years over possession of images even. Such images are understandably repulsive, but seeing an image hardly constitutes evil.   


One may argue that it fuels the market, but the market isn't like most. It's one that's built off of biological inclinations, not supply and demand.  Typically these things are shared via p2p. The forums that have  existed aren't typically for the sake of profit. They appeal to the loneliness and isolation of the pedophile, where they communicate with similar people, because society forces them to hide it otherwise. Sadly though, even the more innocent of the pedophiles are at risk in such societies, since the sadistic individuals often hide in the same corners. By having strict laws outlawing such content entirely, individuals who have pedophilic attractions end up encountering much more obscene content than they had initially sought. They could be looking for young teens, finding themselves exposed to truly obscene and repulsive assaults on young children.   


Significant amounts of abuse content these days are produced by children with their smartphones. Some of these scenarios may involve manipulation, but many of them are just young teenagers doing stupid things. Sexting is extremely common among teens, but it's also a sex offense and felony. Teens have been charged with child pornography production, simply for taking selfies. Most content that's out there is created by the child/teen themself. One would protect children from this far more, by not handing smartphones to every child.   


Most abusers aren't technically pedophiles. They're often narcissists and sociopaths, seeking children because they're easy targets, and not because they're necessarily attractive. That's why so incidents of ""Pedophilia"" have seen so abhorrent and evil, they're often sadistic individuals who're being categorized as pedophiles despite not having an attraction to children. These are individuals who are twisted and just like to cause harm. Categorizing them as pedophiles is misleading, they'd just as easily abuse an elderly or disabled individual because it's easy.  


Pedophilia itself, it's just an attraction. That's all. It doesn't make an individual sadistic or a rapist. It doesn't mean an individual is more likely to abuse a children. I fully believe that the pedophiles who abuse children almost always have sociopathic/narcisstic personality disorders to some extent. They have traits that would make them a threat even if they didn't have an attraction to children.   


All that this hysteria results in, is leverage for politicians to use in their shit throwing fights, a means to exploit privacy, and some boogieman to terrify people with. Ironically, people claim to want to protect their children, yet they also attempt to censor their children from the world. They claim that children don't understand enough to consent, yet they fail to educate their children so that they do understand. If their understanding is so poor, shouldn't it be necessary to educate them? One of the common themes among abuse survivors is that they don't understand what's happening when faced with the abuse. It's confusing, strange, and weird.   


They are told being touched is bad, but they don't understand what that actually means, and what its purpose is. For some reason, we try to keep kids naive about such subjects, yet we think they'd be able to protect themselves and avoid a bad situation? They end up like deers in the headlights.   


We can't shelter them from everything. If we give them phones, they will come across porn. If the phone has a camera, there's a significant chance they'll take pictures of themselves. They need proper education to understand and be aware of such situations. If children aren't capable of consent, shouldn't we be teaching them so that they are capable, and simultaneously capable of protecting themselves and seeking help if needed?   


We shouldn't be seeking to arrest people with an attraction, because that's not a useful measure of an individuals danger. We'd have more luck protecting children by preemptively targeting narcissists and sociopaths. We should also be changing the stigma around the whole situation, so that children can seek help without feeling shame. The whole issue is shrouded in darkness, and that brings shame to the child.

For a platform known for right wing propaganda (which I understand, given Elon musk’s personal behavior and his allowing some abhorrent individuals back on the platform) it does call people out on their misinformation. Meanwhile, Reddit gives moderators total power to influence / silence their subreddits - even by shadow ban (when the person doesn’t even know they’re banned). You only have echo chambers, left wing and right subreddits will remove posts / comments that don’t directly support their POV. You could argue that if there are both left and right subreddits then Reddit as a platform doesn’t discriminate, but if there is no discourse on either side - how is this any better than Twitter. I’m not saying either the current state of X or Elon musk are good things, but I’m just curious how Reddit is better."
1,2024-01-04,"CMV: One major problem with political discourse today is that many people assume guilt until innocence is proven instead of assuming innocence until guilt is proven, which is a far better approach",u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ymgl2/cmv_one_major_problem_with_political_discourse/,changemyview,"I'm thinking mostly about racism and sexism and other forms of bigotry, although I think there are other things this applies to as well. 

Not infrequently, two people are having a conversation and one person says something that is similar to something a bigot said at some point and immediately there's suspicion that said person is a bigot and they are forced to defend themselves. 

The way I look at it, of course there is going to be overlap between what non bigots say and what bigots say, because educated bigots will start with something true and then make faulty, bigoted conclusions. That does not mean everybody who starts there is a bigot and people should not automatically assume they are a bigot. 

It's one thing if, say,  a doctor says something odd that sounds like something a bigot might say. Patients depend on doctors so assuming a doctor isn't a bigot when they actually are could be a major issue. But in an online discussion, if a bigot isn't detected I don't think anything will happen. So I think it would be better to err heavily on the side of ""not a bigot"" than ""bigot."" CMV"
1,2024-01-04,CMV: if you are able to consider any food or substance like (clean) water “harmless/completely safe” then there are also some illegal psychoactive substances that are “harmless/completely safe”,u/Xtrouble_yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ymt79/cmv_if_you_are_able_to_consider_any_food_or/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I in no way advocate for people to break the law, this is purely a discussion about safety. I also want to say this assumes the user is not under development/has a fully developed brain, the chemistry involving brain development is very complex and unpredictable so this is about people who are 25+.  

So,  
I always hear “there’s no such thing as a completely safe drug”, even in pro-drug contexts, but i think that any usable, practical definition of “completely safe” that is meaningful in any way would have a few certain drugs fall under it (mainly just weed and certain psychs (lsd, psilocybin, dmt, mescaline) come to mind).  

Why? well, what are the reasons most people say these aren’t safe? (aside from those that are just misinformed and assume that the reason they’re illegal is that they’re harmful):  

 - Smoking/breathing anything other than air is harmful to the lungs: Well yes, technically any sort of smoking can cause some sort of lung damage, however that is not a problem with the actual substance but with the method you’re using to administer it, edibles exist, your problem then isn’t with the substance itself but with one of the ways people use it, i’m not arguing against anybody who is against smoking, but about the consumption of a substance in general, so due to all the ones listed being able to be ingested orally, this argument wouldn’t apply.  

 - Messing with the mind isn’t natural: Well, without getting into the argument about whether it’s actually natural or not since there’s other animals like dolphins who do just the same thing (with actually harmful substances which they could actually fatally overdose on), and that us humans have been doing this for so long that in the cases of nicotine and alcohol (both of which are still actually toxic to the body in any significant way unlike the ones listed), that we have literally measurably evolved traits and/or enzymes to process it more efficiently/safely than before, whether something is “natural” or not is completely made up. We call everything every other animal does “natural”, why are we different? we are just an animal that naturally builds little huts we call houses and buildings, any of the behaviors and products generated by humans we don’t call “natural” we would call natural if it wasn’t humans doing it and we could observe it on other species, why can’t we observe ourselves as any other animal? in a society that was more accepting of these substances, humans’ relationship with these safe drugs could have even been considered specifically as natural symbiosis. even if that still doesn’t convince you why would that even matter? what’s wrong with things that aren’t “natural”? modern medicine makes us live way longer, dying at 25 from nasty diseases was the natural way, but again, if some other animal developed an equivalent of modern medicine we’d call it a wonder of nature but when we do it with our brains nature gave us and tools we’ve made from nature then it’s bad and “unnatural”? that view has always felt illogical and biased to me but maybe i’m just missing something.  

 - Drugs are inherently unsafe because they could have other more harmful substances in them/be laced: Your balanced, perfectly healthy chicken salad isn’t inherently unsafe due to the fact that someone could have poured cyanide in it. “But i made it myself?” well what if some crazy person injected the chicken with cyanide while it was sitting at the store. you can’t ever be 100% sure of anything, but of course we can all agree that, when someone says “this balanced, perfectly healthy chicken salad isn’t completely safe to eat” and you ask them why and they explain that it could theoretically have cyanide in it you’d laugh at them. that definition of “completely safe” is completely useless because then absolutely nothing would apply, and a label is useless if its impossible for anything to apply to it. There isn’t anybody out there injecting chicken with cyanide but there also isn’t anybody out there lacing shrooms, they’re both as completely crazy and asinine and neither of them happen. Something sold as a tab of lsd could be something else but testing your drugs isn’t hard, people. and even then that doesn’t mean lsd is dangerous, that means whatever else they might put in the tab is dangerous, and that doing untested lsd is dangerous, like texting and driving (as opposed to doing something you actually do know is pure lsd, which is like texting while not driving, for all intents and purposes, completely safe).  

 - You could do too much and overdose and die: That is true of water and any food too, if i’m not wrong none of the drugs i’ve listed have had even a single reported death from overdose, unlike water which has had many… there was a recorded medical case of this person who though pure lsd powder was cocaine (you do lsd in the micrograms and cocaine in the milligrams) and they did over 500 times the amount of lsd people usually do and while they obviously didn’t have a good time for a bit they still perfectly survived with no apparent long term damage (and even noted positive long term effects, but that’s besides the point). With the amount of people who do weed and it’s super long history you’d think someone would have died by overdose by now but it still hasn’t happened, because some drugs just aren’t toxic, unless you get to amounts that even substances like water that must fall under “completely safe” would kill you.  

 - you can get addicted and throw your life away: so the thing is that a lot of drugs are quite physically addictive, like alcohol, opioids, benzos, nicotine, meth, cocaine… if you stop, you get strong withdrawals, some of which can actually straight up kill you. most psychedelics actually show the opposite in a lot of cases and many people feel less desire to use them right after use, ending up being self regulating, even then if you do abuse psychedelics often they won’t form a physical addiction, just like how if you eat the same (non-harmful) food over and over again you won’t get hooked on it and get withdrawals. Weed can in some cases create some level of physical addiction but this is so much milder than that of those other drugs and won’t happen unless you absolutely royally overuse it for an extended amount of time, that its benefits and harmlessness for those that don’t abuse it to that point greatly outweighs this temporary non-lethal annoyance for those who do. What you could experience is psychological addiction, which isn’t dangerous, just unpleasant, and can be formed for anything, any food, healthy or not, or any behavior. Psychological addiction can be for anything and so has nothing to do specifically with drugs, and i have personally gone through it with a specific cereal supplement, it wasn’t fun but it doesn’t make it “dangerous” because then every food and action you could eat and do would be dangerous and the word would be meaningless.  

So yeah, my view is that if you allow for anything to be considered “completely safe”, a few drugs would apply too, and i acknowledge that saying “there isn’t such a thing as a completely safe drug” can be something said to keep people from getting too comfortable and not practice safe drug use but i’m talking here about reality and not what is best to tell people. But the opposite is something i hear so much so often even from pro-drug places/people, that i thought i’d see what you guys say, perhaps i’m wrong."

1,2024-01-04,CMV: Identifying as Agnostic is more scientific and fact-based that considering yourself an Atheist while strict Atheism is not that far off from religion,u/Doppelkrampf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ynlm7/cmv_identifying_as_agnostic_is_more_scientific/,changemyview,"Hey everyone,  
so in my personal circle, many identify as atheists, an most of them reason that it is the most logical conclusion, based on facts and science. They argue that concepts like God and an afterlife are historical constructs born out of a desire to explain the unknown.  
My perspective differs. I think the most factual and scientifically backed stance on topics like afterlife, god-like entities etc. is considering oneself an Agnostic (aka I don´t know if a God or an Afterlife etc. exists, but I will not say that I´m certain that they don´t). I believe we lack the knowledge to assert certainty on these matters, distinct from claiming nothing of that sort exists. I'm referring to general concepts, not specific religions. Consider the questions science currently can't answer: the origin of life, the true operation of the human mind, and the purpose of human intelligence. And much more.

So at the end of the day, if you are saying ""No God exists, no Afterlife, all that is complete bullshit"", that is like defending a Religion to some point, since YOU DON´T KNOW FOR CERTAIN. You just feel better because you have fact based science behind your back (allegedly), not some old book. But that is viewing science backwards.

And I´m gonna make an argument with, you guessed it, science.

Here are the things we know (read know as in it is scientifically proven to the best of our current level of knowledge and understanding) and what that does this imply regarding the mentioned religious concepts:  
The universe didn‘t always exist. It was created or popped into existence at some point, most likely a few billion years ago. We don‘t know what caused that though.  
The laws of physics we base all our understanding of anything on, did not always apply, even after the creation of the universe (Plank Epoch). They don‘t even apply universally after that (Black Holes). And we have no idea of what was before all of that.  
We currently use two big theories to explain what we know about the universe, Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, and they conflict with each other. So what we do with those is always a approximation, no matter how well the models work.  
So, the laws of physics as we understand them today don‘t always apply, even within our universe, and our theories of explaining them are at the very least missing some key factor(s)we don‘t know of and they even could be entirely wrong.   
Also the universe did not always exist, which implies that there could‘ve been something before that (before is a complicated term to use here as time probably didn‘t exist, at least not the way it works now).  And that also opens the possibility that that „before“ didn‘t stop existing when the universe was created. So a state where none of the laws of physics apply, time doesn‘t exist etc., something that is literally unimaginable for humans, could exist outside the scope of our universe.We have no idea what is going on there, if this “plane of existence”, should it exist, or if it can interact with our Universe.  
So is there any proof of one or several god-like beings/entities or something resembling what we call the afterlife existing? No.  
Is there enough „wiggle room“ in what we currently know that there could be? Yes.  
Why is it considered to be unscientific to believe in that kind of stuff? Because we have no proof of it.  
Is the „not having proof“ thing kind of inherently tied to those concepts? Kind of, I think?  
Like, most established religions base their believes on stuff that supposedly happened a long time ago, where a god-like figure made connections with humans, which is unscientific. Believing in what the Bible, the Quran or the Torah says is unscientific, since there are way more plausible explanations why those religions were created and those texts were writtten etc.   
But what I‘m saying includes that it is not completely impossible that those books are right, for all of you guys out there who actually are practitioners of a Religion, but it is very far from just acknowledging that those general concepts could exist.  
And those concepts like god-like figure(s), an afterlife, a force outside of the universe that created life+intelligence+consciousness are not disproven by science by any means. I actually think categorically denying the sheer possibility of the existence of those things is human hubris at its finest.   
We don‘t understand our universe at this point, we don’t even know how far we’re away from understanding it, with all the scientific advances we have made over the last 10000 years. Will there be a Theory of Everything within the next 1000 years, assuming we don‘t get eradicated by something? No idea. Would a ToE solve all the mysteries of our universe or would it just lead to more questions? No Idea. Could there ever be a possibility to look beyond the scope of our universe, or is that a border that is inherently uncrossable? No idea.  
And this is the Universe we live in.   
How can we be sure what happens beyond the the scope of it?

This is scientifically supported and understood.  zodiac signs are associated with specific constellations.  However, due to the precession of the equinoxes, the alignment between the zodiac signs and the actual constellations has shifted over thousands of years. the traditional zodiac signs are based on a system that doesn't account for the precession of the equinoxes.

1,2024-01-04,CMV: Busdriver is the truest jazz rap artist in the history of modern hip hop,u/ChasetheElectricPuma,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ys2py/cmv_busdriver_is_the_truest_jazz_rap_artist_in/,changemyview,"When most people think of jazz rap as a subgenre of rap music, A Tribe Called Quest, Digable Planets, The Roots (namely *Organix* and *Do You Want More?!!!??!*), and Guru's *Jazzmatazz* series are often brought up. All of these artists safely performed over looped beats with jazz-y samples (and sometimes live instrumentation), but their work lacked the defining characteristics of jazz music: improvisation, irregular beats, and syncopation.

A lot of the early '90s Native-Tongues-led east coast jazz rap often employed smooth and almost lounge-like musical textures over a beat without deviating too much from traditional rap conventions. Guru's monotone vocal delivery, for instance, is almost ""glued"" to the beat with little-to-no rhythmic variation. The things that separate Busdriver from Guru, Black Thought, and Q-Tip is that he pulls from bebop, jazz poetry, and vocal jazz while experimenting with syncopated rhythms, unusual time signatures, and complex harmonies on songs like [Right Before the Miracle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ade60_jkWc) (the vocals on this song are improvised), [Jazzy Girl (Freestyle)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p93R74YptQ), [Ain't No Coming Back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4lVfpF0Q94), [Jazz Fingers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djhq5RSZEnk), [The Saboteur's Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk-vT_FCg2A), and [She-Hulk Dehorning the Illusionist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlkltavGGuE).

Busdriver explains the jazz influences in his music below:

>[Jazz is a very integral part of what we \[Project Blowed and Afterlife\] do, and I feel that bebop is the closest kin to underground hip hop as there is in American music. Well, like bebop and punk rock - those things are very akin to underground hip hop. Jazz singers I've studied over the years - like John Hendricks and Eddie Jefferson - I think they do the same thing we do. We put it in a more contemporary context, but it's really similar.](https://www.mushrecords.com/articles/BusdriverPortMercuryJazz.html)  
>  
>[We - me and some of the other Project Blowed guys - used to do these exercises where we'd play the jazz station on the radio and we'd have to rap along to whatever it was playing to toy around and practice our chops. It's definitely a platform from where our styles come from.](https://www.mushrecords.com/articles/BusdriverPortMercuryJazz.html)

At least from what I've listened to, the only other rap artists that come close to capturing the truest essence of jazz music are Myka 9, R.A.P. Ferreira, and Kendrick Lamar (specifically on [For Free?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZTYgq4EoRo))."
1,2024-01-04,CMV: you should give up your seat for a pregnant woman if you can do so comfortably,u/According_Item_8175,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ysa9f/cmv_you_should_give_up_your_seat_for_a_pregnant/,changemyview,"I’ve seen this debate online a few times, and people who disagree with me often say that they owe the woman nothing because she probably chose to be pregnant.

But if she’s standing and the bus or train needs to come to a sudden stop, for any reason, then the baby is endangered. That baby did not choose to be there. Even if I buy into the logic that the woman is owed nothing because she made a choice, why would I morally be okay with endangering an unborn child when all I need to do is mildly inconvenience myself? The baby could end up disabled, in which case the entire family and other siblings, who also didn’t choose to be pregnant, will be hurt. 

Second, and admittedly this is a less strong point - who cares if she made a decision? Who cares what I “owe” her? That is completely separate and distinct from the fact that there’s a person in front of me who is likely uncomfortable or in pain, and I can help, again with only mild disconveniece to myself. If she isn’t being an entitled jerk and is just standing there existing, who cares what she has or hasn’t chosen or what I owe her. The mindset of only doing what’s owed is psychopathically cold and transactional. 

And lastly, women are assaulted. It happens often."

As a man with 3 daughters, 5 nieces, 2 sisters, a mom and tons of aunts that I love, I find it offensive that all they think there is to women is boobs and make up. Literally don’t even need that anymore to call yourself a “women”. Women are SPECIAL and I believe stronger than men in many ways but definitely and most importantly they’re stronger than us mentally. They can do things we can’t and we can do things they can’t and that’s just how it is and we should be helping each other in life. But yeah by putting a dress on and changing your voice/appearance and forcing the world to change basic language to fit your delusion is insane to me. Never mind the the fact that no matter what the situation may be, before they react they HAVE to think to themselves “How would a women respond to this” and then try their hardest to respond like they believe a women would (how exhausting?!). I ALSO believe if you really cared about them you wouldn’t go along with their delusion either because they consistently “unalive” themselves at the highest recorded rate in human history second only to Jews under Nazi control in WW2 and this number doesn’t change after “surgery”. It stays exactly the same…so you can’t say (and be taken seriously at least) that it’s not a mental issue at its core. They are offing themselves at record numbers all over the world, doesn’t that bother you?Don’t give me that line that they do it because of people like me…that’s BS because as I’m sure many of you will disagree with me and think I’m something I’m not and I promise you I don’t care even a little…definitely not enough to not want to live. They do it because no matter how far they go with mutilation or no matter how many people “affirm” them at the end of the day in their heart of hearts they know they’ll never be what they claim to me…they know it’s not possible and they’re exhausted chasing something that’s unattainable…again it’s mental and I think their blood is on everyone who goes along with their delusions hands."

Immigration to the US has been a topic of political discussion for more than a century.  Since 1965, and more so beginning in the 1980s, illegal immigrations from Central and South America has been a contentious topic.  As of late, asylum and migrants have been a political football.

Despite this, and despite the disparate opinions on what the best course of action is, the system works relatively well.

How so?

1. Obviously 100% open borders (or something like it) would have millions arrive every year.  Even the most pro-immigrant person would have to say “well there are SOME downsides” at that scale.  That’s untenable, politically and otherwise.  And on the other side of course our economy relies on low income workers to keep the general economy running.  Even deep red farmers in Alabama say so.

2. By creating a “you’ll live outside of the protection of the law” condition of immigration for many, it filters only the most daring and most willing to work hard and for low wages for a chance at a better life.  Hey all you “free market absolutists” here’s your having no minimum wage for some while keeping it for others!  Low enough to keep agriculture and construction cheap for all Americans, but good enough to still be worth it for those daring it.  If they were legal this would be impossible.  They’d either be out of work or the costs of these industries would be too high for all.

3. But once they live a life here, and specifically secure a future for their children born here as citizens, they are in little danger of the law.  Granted the law is capricious and at times arbitrary, but their children’s lives are secure.  And then, the cycle is ended.

It works for all parties.  It keeps necessary products for Americans cheap (which makes enforcement less than desirable) while filtering most out for fear of the law.
 
Is it perfect?  No.  Nothing is.  But no legal system would work “better” for all parties than what happens right now.

Everyone can immigrate to the US, as a second person who works hard, but your children will be equal and thrive.  On the whole, it works for all parties."

But what isn’t up for debate is that I personally consider it to be a phenomenal work of art with collaboration of dozens of performers across an entire century.

1,2024-01-04,CMV: This is the ideal female-focused family unit.,u/SinopeLycanthrope,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ywk1s/cmv_this_is_the_ideal_femalefocused_family_unit/,changemyview,"I am a man, first and foremost, and that is why I am asking this subreddit for opinions instead of blindly believing whatever comes out of my black ass.  
  
I have had an interest in the conservative idea of a ""nuclear family"" or ""trad (traditional) family"" as of late. Nuclear families were designed to be ideal for men, which is why the concept is most popular with white, male Republicans.  
  
Nuclear families left women miserable, but it was something they had to suffer through. The woman was a dependent when the nuclear family unit was the dominant lifestyle. Women had to conform or they would be homeless. They couldn't easily get jobs, and even if they could, workplace sexism was prevalent, and the wage gap hasn't been criminalized yet.  
  
In the present day, women are way more educated and independent as a whole than they were in the past. And in the present day, birth rates are dropping, more women are single, and some have completely sworn off men. It's blatantly obvious that women aren't happy.  
  
But amid this drop in birth rates and ""traditional"" lifestyles, the popularity of polyamorous relationships seems to be skyrocketing. Keep in mind the reason most women are single: they need a man to support them, emotionally and financially, but they also need a man to pleasure them physically and make them feel like a woman.  
  
The thing is, men can't be both, especially in the mind of a woman. Women's brains love sorting people into categories. We see this in high schools across America. Women love pointing at groups of people and giving them labels, like ""nerds"", ""jocks"", ""emos"", and so on. Women also sort men into categories. Let's call them Type 1 and Type 2.  
  
From my point of view, pulling from my experiences, I hypothesize that a woman's version of a nuclear family, an ideal female-focused family unit, would be polyamorous. Monogamy doesn't work with women at all. Women have no physical attraction for more submissive, emotionally intelligent men who can emotionally support them (Type 1), and ""alpha males"" (Type 2) who women are typically attracted to tend to have no respect for women and end up tossing them aside like a piece of meat.  
  
And you can't have a middle ground either. Women's brains love sorting. Show emotion, you get tossed into Type 1.  
  
The solution is very clear here. Polyamory is the answer. A female nuclear family would consist of a woman, a Type 1 (breadwinner, moral support), a Type 2 (physical pleasure, secondary income), and 1-2 children (Educated women in first-world countries gravitate towards 1-2 children, U.S. average is 1.9 as of 2022).  
  
No, this isn't some kind of perverted cuck fantasy. No, I'm not an incel. I'm not high, or drunk, or trolling either. I legitimately think this will fix the birth rate."

1,2024-01-04,"CMV: Men don't become incels because they're (anymore) misogynist , they become incels because they're lonely.",u/Artistic-Stretch-439,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18ywz3m/cmv_men_dont_become_incels_because_theyre_anymore/,changemyview,"I used to be an incel, so I think I have a unique perspective that most people, especially most women aren't going to have.

I think when people, but more specifically people more aligned with feminism hear the term incel they think every person that incel could apply to is a future Elliot Rodger who believe he is owed a woman and now wants to kill every woman in his immediate area because he can’t find a supermodel sex slave mommy girlfriend. Honestly, I think this is as reductive of a view of the problem, and is akin to viewing all feminist as man hating bunch lesbians that have daddy issues.

I think the primary reason incels are becoming a thing is because men are lonely romantically and socially. Firstly, everyone is becoming more lonely in our increasingly isolated capitalist society, but more than anyone young men. A much higher percentage of young men are friendless and isolated than women. When men do have friends they are typically not very emotionally intimate.  
The common retort to this is “then men need to be better to each other” and while I agree, I don’t think that emotionally intimate friendships would fully rectify the issue. A contributing factor to incels is the lack of romantic success. 

\*\*DISCLAIMER\*\*  
Whenever I see people make points like the one I’m about to make, the jump is that commenters assume the guy is advocation for state mandated girlfriend. I’m not. I am not saying women should have to date men.

So men are growing up with changing ideas of the role of men. Men no longer have to be solely economic providers. Women have more freedom than ever and as a result are able to be much more picky, women are also now the people most privileged in the dating market as they have a wide access of men to choose from thanks to social media.   


Men are falling behind with this. Men born in the 90s and 00s were raised by people who didn’t the majority of their dating in the 80s. And the dating dynamics of the 60s and 80s is a closer than the 80s and 20s. Male beauty standards have always existed but now they actually mean something, and honestly the beauty standard set up by social media and TikTok is a lot harder to meet for men than women.

Women are choosing a smaller and smaller percentage of men every year. I mean 63% of men 18 to 29 are single opposed to 32% of women in that age group. An increasing number of men are lonely sexually and romantically in a society that sees things like losing your virginity and your first romantic relationship as milestones in life that everyone will at some point hint over things that just happen for some people and don’t happen for others.  
Being raised in that society does make people feel entitled but 99% incels aren’t any more entitled than your average man(honestly women feel this similar entitlement very often too) and attractive men that do get attention from women very often feel the same but just can back up the entitlement by being tall and handsome. 

People are just lonely, and they look for community. I think that the constant messaging out out, especially places like here that if you’re a man that frustrated and wants to date that you’re an entitled incel that wants a bang maid contributes to that feeling of isolation.

1,2024-01-05,CMV: Science about the beginning of the universe supports the existence of a God.,u/TheGodHuman,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18yyl1p/cmv_science_about_the_beginning_of_the_universe/,changemyview,"This is a long post, since this is such a controversial and complicated issue. In this post I would like to present scientific evidence for a key premise in a popular argument for God: the second premise in the Kalam Cosmological Argument:

1. Whatever comes into existence has a cause.
2. Spacetime and matter came into existence.
3. So, spacetime and matter has a cause.

Here is a weak version of the Kalam argument:

1. If spacetime and matter came into existence, it has a cause.
2. Spacetime and matter came into existence.
3. So, spacetime and matter has a cause.

The above assumes an A-theory of time. However, on a tenseless theory of time, past, present, and future is equally real. The universe has a beginning in the sense that the first inch of a ruler is the beginning of the ruler. However, one can still speak of an ""earlier than"" or ""later than"" or ""prior to"" and ""posterior to"" on this theory of time. Plus, on a B-theory of time, physical events, such as those in 2023, are still dependent on events in 2022 and so on, so ""prior to"" is still valid in a certain sense. Further, the concept of causation is applicable on B-theory. Here is the reformulated argument:

1. Anything with an edge or boundary to its existence in the earlier than direction has a cause external to itself (i.e. my conception marks the boundary to my existence in the earlier than direction).
2. Spacetime and matter has an edge or boundary to its existence in the earlier than direction.
3. So, spacetime and matter has a cause external to itself.

What I mean by beginning to exist on a B-theory of time is this: something begins to exist at *t* if it exists at *t* and if there is no time prior to *t* at which it exists.

**Why God?**

Since the cause produced spacetime and matter, the cause must be timeless (and thus eternal/beginningless), spaceless, immaterial, very powerful, transcendent and personal. This cause must be personal because if this cause always had the power and preconditions to create the universe in eternity past but was impersonal, then the effect should also be eternal past. The fact that the effect is finite to the past suggests that the cause had free will to create and chose to do so, implying a personal agent. Here is the problem as [WLC points out](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/the-kalam-cosmological-argument): ""If a cause is sufficient to produce its effect, then if the cause is there, the effect must be there, too. For example, the cause of water’s freezing is the temperature’s being below 0 degrees Celsius. If the temperature has been below 0 degrees from eternity, then any water around would be frozen from eternity. It would be impossible for the water to begin to freeze just a finite time ago. Now the cause of the universe is permanently there, since it is timeless. So why isn’t the universe permanently there as well?"" Only the cause having free will can explain this, according to WLC.

&#x200B;

**God of the Gaps?**

This term was created by Christians to criticize other Christian arguments. The term applied to arguments which appealed to a gap in scientific knowledge as evidence for God. This gap in knowledge is then taken as evidence for God and so it is a God of the gaps argument. The problem is that this is not what the argument does. If the argument was “science has no explanation for what causes the universe therefore is must be God,” then that would be God of the gaps. But the Kalam doesn’t do this. Instead, it appeals to scientific evidence and what we know about causation and the law of non-contradiction to rule out the cause of the beginning of spacetime and matter as being temporal, spacial and material.

&#x200B;

**Quantum Mechanics Denies Causality?**

Some try and deny the law of causality by appealing to quantum mechanics, where, for example, virtual particles are claimed to come into being uncaused. However I would like to make seven points in response to this before I continue with the scientific evidence for the beginning of the universe:

* Even if quantum mechanics is non-deterministic *and* causality is not applicable, the situation is still different with the whole universe. For virtual particles do not come into being uncaused out of nothing, but rather out of a quantum vacuum which operates in the context of spacetime and matter. So how can it explain the origin of spacetime and matter itself? At best these particles arise uncaused, but not out of no pre-existing spacetime and matter!
* Even if indeterministic interpretations of quantum mechanics is correct, causality is not necessarily done away with. The problem commonly raised is that certain quantum phenomena, like radioactive decay, can only be given a probabilistic description, rather than what will happen in a given case. However, that a quantum event does not have a unique solution for the later state of the system, given an earlier state, is not the same as lacking a cause. Suppose I cast a spell with a 0.7 chance of turning a prince into a frog, and then suppose the prince turns into a frog. Here, my spell sufficiently explains why the prince turned into a frog, even though the spell merely raised the probability of this event.
* The counterargument from quantum mechanics depends on a non-deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics anyway, such as the traditional Copenhagen interpretation, even though there are many other interpretations or approaches to QM which are equally empirically valid, including deterministic interpretations of QM, which maintain common understandings of causality, such as the Bohmian interpretation, or at least allow for it, like approaches to QM such as [Superdeterminism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytyjgIyegDI).
* That quantum mechanics does not eliminate causality is made clear by the fact that quantum events follow a consistent pattern. For example, uranium atoms consistently decay into other elements, such as thorium and lead, and they never decay into, day, pigs or tanks. This gives philosophical reason to think that quantum events are not causeless but occur within a causal structure governed by the laws of quantum mechanics.
* If one adopts the Copenhagen interpretation, then we have another argument for God. This is because, as WLC [points out](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/media/reasonable-faith-podcast/questions-about-quantum-mechanics-apathy-and-the-gospels), ""As a physical object, he \[the observer\] can be described by quantum physics. That means he exists in an indeterminate superposition of states unless somebody else observes him. But then the same thing is true of that person, and you get a chain where nobody is collapsed! There is no reality, and yet classical reality obviously exists. Here we are! So what collapses the ultimate indeterminacy of the whole universe? Ultimately it leads to a kind of ultimate observer who collapses the indeterminacy in the universe and therefore is implied by the Copenhagen Interpretation. Otherwise it would never get collapsed and nothing would ever truly exist. So this Copenhagen Interpretation, I think, ultimately implies the existence of such a being which is necessary to collapse the indeterminacy of the universe and halt the infinite regress of measurers. That is the answer to the measurement problem – you halt it with a non-physical observer.""

# The Science.

The Standard (or the ΛCDM) Model is the most popular model of cosmic origins, with an initial singularity and a beginning to spacetime and matter. The Standard Model takes seriously extrapolations made from the known laws of physics, as well as predictions made by General Relativity, which (with observations) predicts that space, time and matter came into existence a finite time ago. This is what I turn now. The late great Stephen Hawking says in his famous book *A Brief History of Time* (1988):

>The final result was a joint paper by Penrose and myself in 1970, which at last proved that there must have been a big bang singularity provided only that general relativity is correct and the universe contains as much matter as we observe ... So in the end our work became generally accepted and nowadays nearly everyone assumes that the universe started with a big bang singularity. . . (p. 53).

In the 1980s however, Alan Guth theorized a phase around 10 to the minus 36 seconds to 10 to the minus 32 seconds after the Big Bang, known as ""inflation."" Inflation, according to the Standard Model, takes place after the creation of matter, space, and time. It is true that some physicists fold inflation into a theory of an eternal universe. But that is not true of most. And it should also be pointed out that, while the inflationary theory is widely accepted, a goodly number of physicists reject it, especially since it was tailored specifically to get around the assumption of fine tuning concerning the flatness and smoothness of the universe. But the concept of inflation did change things a bit: if it is correct, then one *can theoretically* get rid of the initial singularity and replace it with the end of an earlier epoch of inflation. But this raises the question: can you get rid of singularities in altogether, and make the universe infinitely old (again, *if* inflation is to be accepted)? A [theorem produced by Alvine Borde, Alan Guth, and Alexander Vilenkin](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0110012) showed that the answer is NO, as long as the universe is expanding and the known laws of physics hold, one can push the singularity as far back as one likes, but one can't get rid of it. In a [1994 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9312022), Arvine Borde and Alexander Vilenkin showed that most ""almost all points in the inflating region will have a singularity somewhere in their pasts"" (p. 3307). In other words, most, but not all, null and timelike geodesics are past incomplete. However, the aforementioned 2003 paper showed ""that null and timelike geodesics are, in general, past-incomplete in inflationary models, whether or not energy conditions hold, provided only that the averaged expansion condition Hav > 0 holds along these past-directed geodesics. This is a stronger conclusion than the one arrived at in previous work in that we have shown under reasonable assumptions that almost all causal geodesics, when extended to the past of an arbitrary point, reach the boundary of the inflating region of spacetime in a finite proper time (finite affine length, in the null case)"" (p. 3). So in the 2003 paper, all inflationary space-times whose Hubble parameters are on average greater than zero were found to be past-geodesically incomplete. As a result of the BGV, Karthik H. Shankar writes in [2020 article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10381):

>""More generally, it has been shown that if the average expansion rate of the universe is positive, then irrespective of any energy condition or even the underlying theory of gravity, there must exist a singularity in the past (BGV theorem). This has essentially shut the door for the possibility of inflationary models to resolve the big bang singularity issue at the classical level"" (p. 23).

Of course, atheist physicists readily began searching for loopholes in light of this theorem, one classic example being Sean Carroll. The loopholes quickly spread in popularity after this, ranging from an emergent universe, a cyclic universe, eternal inflation, etc. These options were all shut down by a [2012 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4658) \- co-authored by Vilenkin. In the 2012 article, Mithani and Vilenkin argued against emergent universe and cyclical scenarios. Sean Carroll and Chen then developed another loophole, which even Alan Guth endorsed (negating previous conclusions he has made even in published works). But Vilenkin closed this Carroll/Chen loophole in a [2013 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3836), as well as Aguirre's and Gratton's model. William H. Kinney also recently expanded the BGV in a [2021 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15380) to certain kinds of bouncing cosmologies, with cycles of expansion and contraction, showing that these too have a spacetime boundary in their past. Kinney also extended the BGV theorem in a [2023 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10958) to rule out Roger Penrose's CCC model as evading a beginning. In a 2015 [Inference article](https://inference-review.com/article/the-beginning-of-the-universe), Alexander Vilenkin wrote that ""we have no viable models of an eternal universe. The BGV theorem gives us reason to believe that such models simply cannot be constructed.""

So it is true though that there are some models that can avoid the BGV, and that the BGV alone is not proof of an absolute beginning. But it is evidence in that it rules out almost all options for past-eternal spacetime and matter, and when the theorem is combined with other data and arguments, an absolute beginning to spacetime and matter is very probable.

There have been many attempts to claim that a popular Christian philosopher named William Lane Craig misrepresents the theorem in citing it in support for an absolute beginning. However, Alexander Vilenkin explicitly said that Craig was not misrepresenting the theorem when he says (recorded in a [Reasonable Faith article](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/question-answer/honesty-transparency-full-disclosure-and-the-borde-guth-vilenkin-theorem)): ""I think you represented what I wrote about the BGV theorem in my papers and to you personally very accurately.""

Many people argue that the BGV theorem is probably not applicable when quantum gravity is taken into account. However, as Michael G. Strauss (prof. University of Oklahoma) says in [this 2021 article](https://www.equip.org/articles/did-the-universe-really-have-a-beginning/),

>Such a criticism may seem compelling because it seems to contrast a “classical” theory, which may be incorrect at small distances, with a “quantum” theory, which is applicable at all distances. But that is not the case. Classical space-time is not the same as a classical theory, and quantum space-time is not necessarily the same as a quantum theory of gravity. Classical space-time may indeed extend to infinitesimally small distances. It basically means only that time has a directionality, and causality can be defined. So any universe expanding on average governed by *any* theory of quantum gravity that retains a direction of time is still constrained by the BGV theorem. An appeal to quantum gravity to invalidate the BGV theorem is not only an appeal to ignorance but also requires the extraordinarily counter-intuitive idea that the correct theory of quantum gravity will ultimately have no direction of time and no causality.

We have to keep in mind that in many of the approaches to quantum gravity, including Wheeler-DeWitt proposals, lead to a theory about time emerging from a non-spatiotemporal state. As   philosophers Vincent Lam and Christian Wüthrich [write](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04500) in their article ""Laws Beyond Spacetime"" (2021):

>Perhaps surprising given their divergencies, one finds a near consensus among the different approaches to quantum gravity according to which the fundamental structure is significantly non-spatiotemporal ... The disappearance and re-emergence of spacetime thus appears to be a generic consequence of quantum gravity. If this is right, then an analysis of laws of nature cannot depend on spacetime. (p. 71).

Those who speak of the *emergence* of classical spacetime from a more fundamental state think that the more fundamental state is some kind of non-spatiotemporal realm. An example of entities with a non-spatiotemporal and mathematical nature are spin networks and spin foams in canonical Loop Quantum Gravity, which claims to get rid of the singularity. But it makes little sense to speak of a non-spatiotemporal quantum realm temporally ""prior"" to first moment of time. Indeed, as Karen Crowther [comments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11444v1) in her 2019 article named ""As Below, So Before: \`Synchronic' and \`Diachronic' Conceptions of Spacetime Emergence"" concerning the bouncing cosmologies on LQG's predictions, ""there is no continuous notion of time that runs from the ‘pre big bang’ universe through to the ‘post big bang’ universe. Rather, there is an intermediate structure that divides these two phases, and this is purely spatial, with no connected notion of time at all."" As a result, some physicists even argue that LQG features a twin birth of two universe from a single non-temporal state in two opposite directions of time. This would remove a bounce. Further, if classical spacetime is both emergent (not fundamental) and has a past boundary or a boundary in the ""earlier than"" direction, then it can be argued that just as the classical regime has a beginning, so too does the quantum regime. However, if the quantum state of the early universe is still temporal, then it would have to be unstable and thus can't be eternal in the past or in the ""earlier than direction."" That quantum gravity will not change the conclusions of the BGV theorem is argued by Alexander Vilenkin in *Many Worlds in One*:

>“A remarkable thing about this theorem is its sweeping generality. We made no assumptions about the material content of the universe. **We did not even assume that gravity is described by Einstein’s equations.** So, if Einstein’s gravity requires some modification, our conclusion will still hold.” (p. 175).

So what is the deal here? The BGV assumes a classical spacetime. Some physicists, like Sean Carroll, want us to imagine that within the Planck epoch, classical spacetime breaks down, and therefore the known laws of physics do not apply. Thus, Carroll wants us to imagine that within the Planck epoch, we have different laws of physics, laws of physics that (a) can't currently be described, (b) have no evidence supporting their postulation, (c) contradict known laws of physics, and (d) contradicts metaphysical principles, such as the law of causality. In effect, Carroll says, ""yes, an eternal universe contradicts the laws of physics, but we can imagine, can't we, a never-never land in which these laws don't apply? Well, then, let's do so!"" He asks to believe that other laws than those we know by science and observation, laws which he himself admits he does not know and cannot describe, must have operated in the past. His model even requires time itself going backward. I think it's obvious that Carroll is trying to get off the hook of an unwanted conclusion.

In a letter to Victor J. Stenger (preserved by an [atheist blogger](https://arizonaatheist.blogspot.com/2010/05/william-lane-craigs-arguments-for-god.html) who asked for contents of some of the letter in an email exchange), Alexander Vilenkin said this with regards to a beginning to the universe in the BGV theorem:

>""You can evade the theorem by postulating that the universe was contracting prior to some time. This sounds as if there is nothing wrong with having a contraction prior to expansion. But the problem is that a contracting universe is highly unstable, small perturbations would cause it to develop all sorts of messy singularities, so it would never make it to the expanding phase. So, if someone asks me whether or not the theorem I proved with Borde and Guth implies that the universe had a beginning, I would say that the short answer is yes. If you are willing to get into subtleties, then the answer is no but...""

How does *Alexander Vilenkin* think space, time and matter came into being without God, though? He thinks that the universe quantum tunneled out of ""nothing."" How does he define nothing? In [this 2012 article](https://now.tufts.edu/2012/05/29/beginning-was-beginning), Alexander Vilenkin says,

>""I say “nothing” in quotations because the nothing that we were referring to here is the absence of matter, space and time.

In his technical work, the ""laws of physics"" he refers to is a timeless, beginingless, space-less, immaterial, transcendent realm of mathematical possibilities, called superspace. For example, Vilenkin, who thinks even inflation mist have a beginning, writes at the end of his *Many Worlds in One*:

>“The picture of quantum tunneling from nothing raises another intriguing question. The tunneling process is governed by the same fundamental laws that describe the subsequent evolution of the universe. It follows that the laws should be “there” even prior to the universe itself. Does this mean that the laws are not mere descriptions of reality and can have an independent existence of their own? In the absence of space, time, and matter, what tablets could they be written upon? The laws are expressed in the form of mathematical equations. If the medium of mathematics is the mind, does this mean that mind should predate the universe?” - Vilenkin, *Many Worlds in One*, p. 205.

What is this ""quantum tunneling from nothing""? The ""nothing"" being proposed by e.g., Hawking and Vilenkin is actually not a part of material reality. The nothing being proposed indeed is without space, time and matter, but it's not nothing in the philosophical meaning of the term. What they call ""nothing"" is known as superspace, a timeless, spaceless, immaterial, transcendent realm of mathematical possibilities. As Vilenkin suggests in the YouTube video cited above, it is a Platonic realm of mathematical possibilities, such as our laws which describe our universe. To make matters even more speculative, Vilenkin and Hawking had to arbitrarily restrict the degrees of mathematical freedom inherent in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in order to solve it (creating what theorists call a “mini-superspace”). Stephen Hawking takes the same tack as Alexander Vilenkin, in his 2010 book titled *The Grand Design*, coauthored with Leonard Mlodinow: “Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing."" Lawrence Krauss echoes this claim: “The laws themselves require our universe to come into existence, to develop and evolve” - Krauss, *A Universe from Nothing*, p. 142. Paul Davies summarizes this type of view spoken of as the following (see [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MF5tTZrtUdY)):

>""... Most scientists would stop at the law of physics and that they would accept that they exist for no particular reason; they're just there ... we can imagine that the laws of physics are ""there"" in some abstract platonic mathematical realm, but there's no physical universe, there's no spacetime, matter, energy or anything like that, but the laws are there so the universe has the potential to come into existence in compliance with those laws. I think actually many of my colleagues would regard that \[as\] their world view.""

As Davies says a minute later in the video, on this ""view the reason why there is something rather than nothing is because the laws that are pre-existing, maybe not in a time sense, but in a logical sense, have the power to bring into existence a universe from nothing."" Further, here is what a physicist named Ikjyot Singh Kohli says in a [2015 review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6091) on Lawrence Krauss’ book,

>""The concept of superspace is not mentioned a single time, even though this is the entire geometric structure for which the proposal he is putting forward of a universe coming from nothing is based upon. There is also a deep philosophical issue that cannot be ignored. Superspace is the space of all possible 3-geometries, and the question is, what types of universes should be considered as part of a particular superspace. For example, one can consider the Bianchi cosmologies which are spatially homogeneous and anisotropic cosmological models, which have three degrees of freedom in the minisuperspace sense, of which the FLRW cosmologies are special cases. The existence of this structure is not predicted by the WDW formalism, it is assumed to exist, which itself goes 3 back to the theme of this paper. How can one claim that something arises from nothing, when this nothing is at minimum, minisuperspace? (pp. 3-4).

Meanwhile, back to Hawking. Hawking, in an interview titled: '['If there's an edge to the universe, there must be a God (interview with Renee Weber)](https://www.the-scientist.com/books-etc/god-as-the-edge-of-the-universe-63996),"" in *Dialogues with Scientists and Sages* (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1986), says, ""WEBER: Why is it so important whether there is or is not an edge to space-time? HAWKING: It obviously matters because if there is an edge somebody has to decide what should happen at the edge. You would really have to invoke God.""

How does Hawking get around the conclusion that God exists, given the singularity on the Standard Model, partially inspired by his own work? Eventually, Hawking introduced imaginary time into one of Einstein’s mathematical expressions that describes the curvature of spacetime. Hawking then simply equated time with imaginary time (t = iτ) to make it possible to calculate the probabilities associated with different possible early states of the universe. Mathematicians call this transformation a “Wick rotation.” In *A Brief History of Time*, Hawking presented this result as a challenge to the idea that the universe had a definite beginning in time. He argued that this mathematical model implied the universe would not, therefore, need a transcendent creator to explain its origin. After he explained how this mathematical manipulation eliminated the singularity, he famously observed, “So long as the universe had a beginning, we would suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end; it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?"" (pp. 140-141).

The problem with this though is threefold. First, as Hawking admits, the use of imaginary time is merely a ""mathematical device (or trick)"" - Hawking, *A Brief History of Time*, p. 136. Second, imaginary numbers have no real-world referent and so have no physical meaning. As Hawking explained, ""Imaginary numbers are a mathematical construction. You can't have an imaginary number credit card bill"" - Hawking, *The Universe in a Nutshell*, p. 59. Hawking also acknowledged that once his mathematical depiction of the geometry of space is transformed back into the actual physical realm with a real-time variable—the singularity comes back! As Hawking says, “When one goes back to the real time in which we live, however, there will still appear to be singularities"" - Hawking, *A Brief History of Time*, p. 136. Third, according to Hawking, imaginary time makes time indistinguishable from space. But this is metaphysically impossible, since time is not space. There are other issues with the Hartle-Hawking model too. In the end, both Hawking and Vilenkin think there is a platonic realm of math which the universe came out of.

Thomas Hertog (world renowned physicist and collaborator with Stephen Hawking) writes in his 2023 book:

>""Most physicists continue to follow Plato on this point. They tend to conceive the laws of physics as eternal mathematical truths, living not just in our mind but operating in an abstract reality that transcends the physical world"" (*On the Origin of Time*, p. 15).

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There seems to only be five options to pick from in light of the predictions made by General Relativity and the extrapolations made from the known laws of physics vis-a-vis the beginning of spacetime and matter:

* Say that the known laws of physics and predictions from general relativity (GR) are replaced by other laws of physics for which we have no evidence and which can't currently be described, within the Planck epoch. Further, these new laws must not only be *new*, but must *contradict* the known laws and predictions from GR. Finally, these new laws must contradict metaphysical principles like causality.
* Say that spacetime and matter arose out of abstract Platonic mathematical structures and equations. The problem with this is that abstract objects don't stand in any causal relationship with anything concrete—the law of conservation of momentum does not cause a billiard ball to move when another ball hits it, for example. Further, unless the cause has free will, no effect could arise out of a timeless state. Lastly, the laws of nature typically are taken as being merely descriptive in science. So how can they exist without what they describe?
* Say that the beginning of spacetime and matter was caused by nothing. This is entailed if one says causation can't occur without spacetime. However, if one says that there's no causation without spacetime and matter, they are committed to the view that the beginning of spacetime and matter was caused by nothing and committed to violating the causal principle. Further, there is no counter example of something coming out of literally nothing, even if uncaused.
* Say that spacetime and matter caused the beginning of the existence of itself. This also violates the causal principle and makes no sense.
* A timeless, eternal, spaceless, immaterial, powerful, transcendent and personal cause which theists call God.

To summarize, let me lay out these six points to conclude. First, the past-finite nature of spacetime and matter is now, and has been ever since the middle part of the last century, the Standard Model of cosmic origins. Yes, there are dissenters among physicists, but that doesn't change the near consensus.

Second, scientific knowledge is the reason it is the Standard Model. The red-shift is an observed fact, and unless the known laws of physics can be violated, the necessity of a past-finite nature of spacetime and matter that it entails, given those laws of physics, is a fact.

Third, the great majority of scientists would agree more or less with points one to four above. For instance, the atheist physicist Lawrence Krauss, in his book *A Universe from Nothing*, takes the above points for granted.

Fourth, the past-finite universe has massive religious, existential, and moral implications, because it entails the existence of a transcendently powerful creator which resembles the God of Abrahamic faiths. In human beings, the intellect does not operate independently, but is moved by the heart and the will. And physicists are human beings. Some find the conclusion of God so terrifying that they are willing to descend into irrationality rather than follow the science to its logical conclusion, such as positing superspace or claiming that the universe could come into being uncaused (like Lawrence Krauss and Alexander Vilenkin has), thus denying the law of causality. Vilenkin for example argues in that [2015 Inference article](https://inference-review.com/article/the-beginning-of-the-universe) that one does not need a cause to the universe.

Fifth, we already know that even some of the greatest physicists are biased against a past spacetime boundary. The late great Stephen Hawking says in his famous book *A Brief History of Time* (1988)

>Many people do not like the idea that time has a beginning, probably because it smacks of divine intervention ... There were therefore a number of attempts to avoid the conclusion that there had been a big bang. The proposal that gained widest support was called the steady state theory. (p. 49).

So there seems to have been a bias and to some level an agenda to avoid a big bang singularity, sometimes at least being because of its implications for the existence of God.

Sixth, many argue that the Kalam stands or falls with an A-theory of time. However, WLC [admits in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhrGWKuhLek&t=2121s) (min 36:30) that while giving up an A-theory of time would result in him ""giving up the second philosophical argument based upon the impossibility of forming an actual infinite by successive addition,"" and would force him to ""redefend the casual premise in such a way that it doesn't appeal to something's coming into being without a cause, but rather to say that something can't begin to exist without a cause,"" he also says that ""the scientific evidence for the finitude of the past would still go in place. So even though the .... abandonment of an A-theory of time would damage the argument and cause you to reformulate some of its support."

1,2024-01-05,CMV: Wages should be less and tipping should be commonplace,u/BrettBelanger,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18z1s5h/cmv_wages_should_be_less_and_tipping_should_be/,changemyview,"I’ve worked several years in and out of the restaurant industry. What I’ve learned through my experiences is that by far and away, the best service employees are servers/bartenders. 

Go to a McDonald’s drive thru and then go sit down at a restaurant. The service will be vastly different. Why? Because the McDonald’s cashier gets their money whether they’re an asshole to you or not. Why check your bag to make sure you got your extra order of fries? You’re just going to get home and be upset you spent $3 for something you didn’t get. Worst case, you drive all the way back and they’ll just give them to you. There’s no reason for waged employees to do anything more than the bare minimum their job requires of them. 

But when you’re at a restaurant, employees rely on your tip to pay their bills. If they’re rude, if they’re unattentive, that reflects in their paycheck. I’ve taken care of countless people I don’t like, some I couldn’t wait to get out the door. But they’d never know that. They get fantastic service and treated with utmost respect while a guest of my establishment and my tip reflects that. 

If everyone received tips, employees would actually care about providing a good service. Your overall experiences would improve across the board. Not to mention better production from staff. The more customers you can take care of, the more money you make. Im not going to take a smoke break, or sit around chatting with coworkers. Im losing money by choosing to slack off.  

Lower wages would also help local small businesses. Struggling businesses could pay employees less knowing that their work performance will pay the employee a proper wage. People think when you go out to eat, you’re paying for the food.. you’re not. You’re paying for the experience. So if your experience sucks, why should the one who ruined your experience still deserve to earn the same as people who provide a great experience? 

Tip grocery cashiers. They’ll make sure groceries are bagged neat and tidy. I tested this out. After consistently tipping a cashier out, I noticed I was treated to a warm welcome when entering the store where before there was none. The experience start to finish improved and there was more care being put in by the employees. I now tip tons of people from places I frequent and my experiences have vastly improved because of this. They know when I am there, their effort of great service is noticed and it reflects in the money they take home. 

I think this would breed a society where nicer, genuine people would be more well off than those who are rude and annoyed. It would literally pay to be nice to those around you."

1,2024-01-05,cmv:Chennai Express should have had South-Indian actors.,u/AdTrick7283,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18z9iad/cmvchennai_express_should_have_had_southindian/,changemyview,"Chennai Express should have had actual South-Indian actors in them. 

My 1st reason for believing so is that, as someone who knows a lot of South-Indians, they believe that actors like Deepika Padukone did not accurately act like a Tamilian, instead acting more like a Malayali, even though she is from Bengaluru. They even say that Komban and Vidhamba were primarily based on stereotypes of South-India from North-Indians who do not know about the 5 states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Telengana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. They even said that many people know Hindi in cities like Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad, etc. These problems could have been solved if more prominent South-Indian actors like Thalaivar Rajinikanth, Vijay Thalapathy, etc. They would have been able to do the needful to not let Chennai Express be racist towards South-Indians.

My 2nd reason for believing so is that it could have been a movie that focused on diversity. It could have cast famous South-Indian actors that would otherwise not have been familiar to the North-Indian audience, such as Vijay Thalapathy, Dhanush, etc. Imagine the beauty of the 2 styles of acting contrasting each other! That would be something new and original for both Bollywood and South-Indian cinema, and since it has such a star-studded cast, it would not be able to flop at all! It would have represented people from all over India properly; instead of only basing Komban and Vidhamba off of racial stereotypes! This would even make South-Indians more interested in Bollywood, and vice versa, bridging the gap between North-India and South-India!

My 3rd reason is that the movie would have been a huge-hit all over India. Imagine how much money a movie with Shahrukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Thalaivar Rajinilanth, and Vijay Thalapathy would have brougt to the box-office. This would inspire other Bollywood and South-Indian directors to do the same, and eventually bridge the gap between North-India and South-India, making the country a better place. Even then, the popularity of both Shahrukh Khan and Thalaivar Rajinikanth would be more than ever. Shahrukh Khan would have participated in more Tamil films due to his extensive knowledge of Tamil, which is shown in Om Shanti Om, and Thalaivar Rajinikanth would have returned to Bollywood with other South-Indian actors that would have brought discipline and hard-work to Bollywood, similar to their own industries.

This is why I believe Chennai Express should have had South-Indian actors."

If teams and their schedule in the SEC are just assumed to be a ""tougher schedule"" then there should be some way of showing these differences. Also, it seems that a game won in October doesn't seem to carry the same weight as a game won (or lost) in November or December. There should be a points type approach where there is more than a ranking where a group sits around picking winners and losers based on opinions. I'd like a points system in one form or another to show an ongoing status for comparisons before a big ""gotcha"" at the end.

1,2024-01-05,CMV: Arguments against DEI collapse under their own weakness,u/erpettie,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18zmk8e/cmv_arguments_against_dei_collapse_under_their/,changemyview,"This topic is inspired by Mark Cuban and Elon Musk going [back and forth on X over DEI](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1742690628465484204).

I feel that often the arguments against DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) are facile and given in bad faith from people who have not taken the time to try to understand DEI. Instead, they start from definitions shared by others who are at best ignorant of these concepts and at worst are cynically manipulating people to preserve a status quo. I think arguments against DEI tend to fall along these lines, none of which are very strong:

1. **We should admit and hire based on merit instead of having diversity hires and admissions.** This falls apart like an undercooked oatmeal cookie upon further inspection. First, merit has to be defined, which leads to the question of *who defines merit*? That leads to a dichotomy. You can either have an exclusive group determine what merit is, which necessarily means creating a standard which favors the point-of-view of one group over another and is, thus, discriminatory, or you can reach a broad consensus on merit by including the perspectives of everyone within an industry, ***which requires*** ***diversity and inclusion***. This perspective also suggests that a person for whom their diverse background is seen as beneficial necessarily lacks merit, which is a false dichotomy. These things are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
2. **Racism doesn't exist anymore, so there doesn't need to be a remedy.** I feel that this is a bad faith argument because it belies the fact that there have been major cases won or settled against government and industry who have been shown to have been acting with intent to discriminate against minorities. But for the sake of this conversation, let's assume that racist ideology has been eradicated. That doesn't eliminate the ongoing impact of the racism of the past. I recently came across a [report my hometown generated on the desegregation of schools in 1977](https://www.google.com/books/edition/School_Desegregation_in_Tulsa_Oklahoma/OLxEu1K8MoQC?gbpv=1), and it was a brutally honest assessment that acknowledged the impact that the decisions made in the first half of the 1900s had on racial segregation in the second half of the 1900s. If Bank of America was pushing minorities into worse mortgages at a higher rate leading up to the Great Recession, then the opportunity cost, alone, would have a disproportionate and lingering impact on minorities. Remedying these kinds of injustices ***requires committing to equitable outcomes for all, which should not be a difficult thing to support.***
3. **It's straight, white men who are the ones who are being discriminated against.**  For the sake of this discussion, let's say that straight, white men *are* being discriminated against. ***Well, the solution to that is diversity, equity, and inclusion***. By ensuring straight, white males are represented in places where decisions governing their lives and livelihoods are taking place, they will be able to contribute their perspectives to work towards equitable outcomes for them, which would mean equitable outcomes for all. Bonus thought: If you recognize the injustice that arises from scenarios where straight, white males would be discriminated against, then you are arguing that racism does exist, and if you then argue that racism is only happening against straight, white males, then the corollary to that thought is that *only white males are enlightened enough to be incapable* of discrimination... which... well, I'll let you be the judge of whether that is racist.

As you can see, for all of the arguments that are ostensibly against DEI, DEI is actually the solution to the problem that has been stated. That's why I believe these arguments all crumble.

The one argument that I would accept is that DEI programs and policies are sometimes poorly implemented by institutions that are just checking boxes, and they are sometimes sandbagged by employees who do not wish to participate or acknowledge their value. Regardless of why a program may be a failure, it fails because it of a lack of a commitment to the underlying principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion, which are that in order to have the best outcomes for *everyone*, you should have a population that is representative of our population (including straight white men), those people's backgrounds should be valued and their perspectives given fair consideration, and  everyone should work together to ensure that everyone has an equal *opportunity* to have the best outcomes.  This does not mean that everyone will have the same outcomes - just that they have the same *opportunities* for success and that their success is commensurate with their contribution.

This lessens the chance of having an innocent defendant having the the threat of another trial hanging over their head just because one person with an axe to grind wants to convict them.

If we kept the votes of the individual jurors anonymous,  it could also allow them to be more honest without worrying about public opinion - any one of them could potentially be the dissenter."
1,2024-01-05,CMV: It is hypocritical for a socialist to not take steps to minimize their personal consumption,u/villa1919,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/18zpcqi/cmv_it_is_hypocritical_for_a_socialist_to_not/,changemyview,"My understanding of Socialism is that it effectively hinges on the theory that the richer you get each incremental dollar becomes less valuable and therefore wealthy people should be forced to pay significantly higher taxes than the current rates.

Due to this one would assume that a socialist would attempt to evaluate how much they need to spend to be comfortable and then either forward the rest to their countries tax authority or most likely donate it to a charity that helps the less fortunate.

Obviously the amount needed to be comfortable is somewhat subjective but in my view many socialists go above and beyond what could be considered reasonable expenses. To give some examples Jagmeet Singh of Canada's NDP Democratic socialist party has been spotted using a Versace tote bag that retailed for $1000+ and also owns at least one Rolex. He also drives a Mercedes. These three items are luxury goods and much of their appeal comes from the fact that others see them and know how expensive they are. To me the fact that one is spending money on items that are primarily intended to demonstrate ones wealth would indicate that they have more than enough money to cover the necessities. Under a socialist ideology the money spent on the luxury goods should have been given to charity. He could have purchased a grocery store tote bag, a Seiko and a Toyota Corolla and he would still be able to do most of the same things the other items would have enabled him to do while forwarding the tens of thousands in savings to a charitable cause of his choice. All of this likely would rightfully help his electoral performance.

Additionally, another Socialist theory is the Labour theory of value which states than when a good is sold and a company makes a profit that profit should belong to the workers who made the product. This should also incentive socialists to consume less as the more they consume the more money wrongfully goes into the hands of the ""thieves"" who own the companies. If the money is diverted to charity then money will be taken away from the ownership class and allocated to the neediest members of society.


Obviously a degree of spending is necessary for a socialist to engage in. I don't see any issue with food, a small residence, nice enough clothing to avoid looking like a slob, modest vacations, a cell phone, a laptop or a TV being bought. People need some level of entertainment and treating yourself is necessary to retain the motivation to work. 


The best argument a socialist could  make against donating excess income to charity is that the lower classes need to feel more pain in order to provoke political change which will eventually result in a more equal society. This argument fails to hold water as the money could be sent abroad to provide aid in a country that is already sufficiently socialist. Alternatively the money could be sent to a country that currently doesn't have an effective government and that is currently suffering from famine like Yemen. Both of these options would send money to people in greater need while avoiding inadvertently propping up capitalism."

I believe the assumption for hiding this information from the general public is that it would cause mass hysteria, confusion, anarchy, etc. but basically I think that it would change like nothing.

Ignoring groups that would straight up disbelieve the evidence and people who don’t think this would disprove the existence of their god, the major overlap is the majority of us who would take this information and do nothing with it. It doesn’t change the fact that you have to get up every morning and go to work, drop your kids off at school, pay your bills, etc. It doesn’t change anything for anyone. The vast majority of people don’t even care about real world problems that affect them like global warming, war, famine, etc.

So yeah I just don’t see it. Everyone is too busy with the rat race of daily life and then they completely unplug their brains with cellphones to give a shit about most things going on around the planet. The knowledge of the existence of aliens seems more like a bit of trivia than the most groundbreaking and life changing discovery in all mankind.

Self described Communists aren't actually interested in revolution because there is no real talk of how to take real steps, today, of how to achieve it. I may agree with many tenets of socialist policies as well. For instsnce, socialised medicine, and the Nordic model that involves more maternity leave and other socialist policies. However, Nordic countries are all capitalist still. None of them underwent a revolution. All involved democracy to bring about change, they didn't involve the workers seizing the means of production. 

It's an odd disconnect I see in subs here, one of which I was banned from for asking basic questions regarding about what measures are being taken to actually bring about revolution. I got no answers but accused of trying to debate. (this is on a learning socialism sub) However many of these same people will also go on at length about some obscure fact from  1918,and act as if the key to how things work now. Even the idea of ""seizing the means of production"" is ridiculous in a modern sense. It was created when workers could literally take over a factory. So how would someone working for a local graphic design firm seize the means of production? And also. Let's say a group of workers do unionize. That's great. But collective bargaining in a democracy is different than the October revolution by light years. And ironically the same people who claim to be trying to bring about revolution don't even vote, yet they think they'll be able to someone convince the masses to follow their ideology? We can't even get a green party candidate above 1% and suddenly the majority of the country will be following the words of a Jewish philosopher from the turn of rhe 20th century? Huh? 

For these reasons I believe almost all self proclaimed communists are not interested in taking concrete steps to bring about the revolution they claim will happen any day now. And remember, chaos, is not a revolution, a revolution is lead by people, with specific aims. They believe a communist revolution will occur. This is absolutely impossible and unrealistic."

I’m going to try and stay away from anything that is super specific for one country but as I’m from the USA I am coming from an American’s perspective. 

1) Climate change: Humanity as a whole really isn’t trying to hard to fight climate change, but it’s also hard to blame a lot of the world for that because it’s people and places like India, Africa, china, etc. that use a lot of natural resources because they are only just now or just recently industrializing and making the average person’s life better and easier. And then add in all the western nations and our constant need of newer shiny tech products that aren’t needed and the current consumerism society we have continually harming the globe… Climate change isn’t going to be truly fought against by humanity until it’s too late because too many people have comfortable okay lives right now. 

2) Immigration/Population issues: This one may be more from my American perspective, but it really seems like the world is getting stricter and stricter on immigration, it’s getting increasingly hard to immigrate to Europe, American politicians are continually flip flopping on immigration policies, while there is also tons of civil upheaval leading to many people trying to find new places to live…. Then there is also the population collapse issue in many countries, but mainly china, S.K, Japan, that are currently major economic and geopolitical powerhouses…. When they fall or inevitably deal with even more instability and restructuring, people trying to leave their countries will make it even worse for them and other countries that are dealing with immigration issues…. 

3) Religion: This one is pretty simple, I don’t see how Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, every other religion, is going to come together and agree enough on anything to solve any of the problems facing the globe right now. For fuck’s sake it’s 2024 and we still can’t even get people to agree on what age it’s ok for people to get married at…. You expect me to believe humanity will be able to come together enough to solve climate change, water issues, food issues, the energy crisis, or anything else within the next like 50 years? Lmfao…. 

4) Food/water wars: If nothing changes soon, there will be wars for food and water as climate change starts to really sink its claws in and affect places… and humanity has barely even thought about it, let alone plan for it… 

With all of these major issues, and others… yea, I don’t see a way that a majority of humanity will survive the next 100 years. Of course, some humans will survive whatever is coming, but I wasn’t born rich or in Norway, so I’m probably not going to be one of the few that survives.

\-Turning the other cheek when physically assaulted by a woman

I want men to start thinking in the following manner. If you are walking down the street and see a woman struggling to change her tire, go through the following mental check first:  
  
If she was a man, would I offer to help? If you say yes, go and help.  
  
If you say no, keep walking.

Now women are able to have plenty more options with social media and can choose only the top percent of men. This has led a whole generation of young men currently with bad genetics who don’t have the genes to seduce a woman, since their grandfathers never did generations before.

15,2024-01-06,CMV: The US should repeal the 17th Amendment,u/jio87,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19023kh/cmv_the_us_should_repeal_the_17th_amendment/,changemyview,"Pretty much the title. This is an opinion I've had for a while but never had a serious discussion on it, and political science isn't my forte, so hoping to see some strong counterarguments.

**Background**: When the US Constitution was ratified, it included provisions for Senators to be elected by state legislatures. As I learned it in college PoliSci, the Senate--which would ideally be composed of persons more learned in statecraft and more educated, and represent the interests of the states as political entities--was supposed to act as a counterweight to the House of Representatives--which would ideally be composed of persons more representative of the actual US population, and represent the interests of the people themselves. The 17th Amendment altered this so that senators were elected directly by the people, just as those in the House of Representatives are.

**My View**: As I see it, because the people elected those sitting on the state legislatures, the Senate would not be too far removed from the people and the interests of the people, but the fact senators reported to the state legislatures, and not the people directly, meant they had a vested interest in limiting the power of the federal government so as to maximize state power, thereby helping to reduce tyranny. They were not beholden to pleasing the people directly, and their longer tenure (6 years, vs. 2 for the House) meant that the Senate could act as a check against novel ideas that might enjoy brief bouts of popularity but become unpopular relatively quickly, leading to a more stable government that enacted fewer short-lived and self-defeating policies.

The 17th Amendment removed an important check on federal power and transformed the Senate into a slightly different version of the House. I believe that this is one of the key reasons that the federal government is so bloated now: There has been a lack of real accountability from federal institutions, except when other federal institutions do something about it, which in many cases amounts to asking a bunch of powerful people with similar interests, questionable morals, and no oversight nor accountability to abide by the honor system. Moreover, because the Senate is elected in the same manner as the House, the same political developments that affect the House affects the Senate in the same way. So, as laws and Supreme Court decisions (e.g., Citizens United) have allowed politicians to be more easily controlled by corporations and moneyed special interests, it has affected both the House and the Senate equally, and there's no capacity for one to act as a check on the other.

I'm sure there were problems with the Senate, which is why the 17th Amendment passed in the first place, but I have a hard time imagining that it would be worse than the current, directly elected version.

**Known Counterarguments:** The only argument I've ever seen in favor of the 17th Amendment is that it is more democratic, as if maximizing the amount of direct democracy in a government is an inherent good. I think this is problematic. People are riddled with cognitive biases that can be exploited, and modern politicians take full advantage of this. Democracy is valuable because it gives the average person some voice and influence in the workings of government, which is vital, but pure democracy is essentially mob rule. The House of Representatives was the (vital) mechanism in Congress that allowed for direct representation, and it was sufficient by itself."

They have  boundaries and one must earn their trust and their love. A lot of people want instant affection from their pets, which is why they tend to gravitate towards dogs more than cats. Dogs are very easy to win over. Cats on the other hand,you have to earn their  trust and affection. That requires time and patience. There’s a reason why cats tend to gravitate towards people who dislike cats. People who  tend to dislike cats, tend to  not respect a cat’s boundaries.

The world it creates, the story it tells, and the work it does to preserve the memory of a generation’s heroic sacrifice in saving the world simply cannot be overstated. No other film or show has done more to promote interest in WWII history and honoring the legacy of those who fought it. The casting is also damn close to perfect. Sure, the show has its minor flaws (the Blithe factual error, the excessively harsh portrayal of Sobel, some liberties with exact details, etc.), but I think it nevertheless stands in a league completely of its own."
94,2024-01-06,CMV: The term 'manosphere' perpetuates unproductive stereotypes,u/Kindred87,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1904y8n/cmv_the_term_manosphere_perpetuates_unproductive/,changemyview,"I came across this term for the first time and I was immediately shocked by it.  Attempts to figure out why this term is used was met mostly by assertions of ""That's what we call it 🤷"" before I was shut down.  Not a very compelling answer, hence this post.  Below is the context, then reasoning, behind my shock.

What is the term manosphere?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere

> Communities within the manosphere include men's rights activists, incels (involuntary celibates), Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), pick-up artists (PUA), and fathers' rights groups.

> While the specifics of each group's beliefs sometimes conflict, they are generally united in the belief that society is biased against men due to the influence of feminism, and that feminists promote misandry, or hatred of men.

> Acceptance of these ideas is described as ""taking the red pill"", a metaphor borrowed from the film The Matrix.

While I believe that male advocacy isn't inherently anti-feminist, that is a separate discussion.  I'm focusing on the term manosphere in this post.

One of the prevalent issues in online communities today is [polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_polarization#Attitude_polarization).  One method in which polarization propagates is through the mechanic described in [this CGP Grey video](https://youtu.be/rE3j_RHkqJc?si=mGwumnMQuHas_7wO), where an ideologically homogenous community depicts the ""opposing"" demographic as an antagonistic monolith.  

What this means is that negative characteristics that exist in a subset (part) of the demographic are attributed to the entire demographic; asserting that what is sometimes true is actually always true.  These are what we know as [stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype).  These attributions are performed through [implicit language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype) (""X is Y""), instead of explicit language (""I believe all X is Y""). Through this, the demographic itself is painted as a perpetual threat or problem, rather than certain members of it.  

This applies to any ""competing"" demographics you can think of: the rich, the poor, men, women, young people, old people, conservatives, progressives, and so forth.  And this applies to any characteristic so long as, in polarized spaces, it's negative. From a desire to harm others, to corrupting society, to being incompetent.

I'm sure you've seen it.  And while it's okay to not always be nuanced, what polarization does over time is [reinforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_theory) stereotypes to the point where they *feel* more true than anything else.  In a polarized space, this will be apparent when an attempt to address an oversimplification is met with hostility.  For individuals who have spent enough time in such spaces, the very concept of nuance or complexity may seem annoying or even manipulative.

It is this toxic reinforcement through implicit language that sits at the core of my view on the term 'manosphere'.  

With this in mind, does the term 'manosphere', which colloquially refers to toxic male spaces, contribute to this polarization-driven propagation of stereotypes?  I believe that it does, and it's this belief that you're invited to address.

My belief is that the male-specific prefix 'man'  in a word referring to toxic behavior ties the gender to that behavior in the same way that statements like ""Men are [negative characteristic]"" do.  By perpetuating a stereotype; ""this is how men act"". A word on its own really doesn't matter, no. However, the usage of the term in a polarized space (social media) causes it to be a problem, in my view.  Because of the synergy with the stereotypes that are already being reinforced.  

It can help to understand what I mean by removing ourselves from what's normalized.  For this, I will turn to female analogues.  

Terms for controversial female groups use non-gender-specific qualifiers to lead the term.  Red-pilled women and trad wives being two common examples.  Imagine if we could place these groups under an umbrella called 'conservative femininity', but instead went with 'the femisphere', or perhaps 'woman-pilled'.  

It's offensive just on its face.  Because in my mind, it implies that the female gender is not only united in such behavior, but also that the gender is causative of this behavior.  It implies a stereotype; ""this is how women act"".  Again, I believe this is very problematic in a polarized space.

To close, the word unproductive in the title was chosen because I think an important element in navigating present gender issues is collaboration between the two main sides.  Perpetuating stereotypes (which of course are usually negative) about either side is unproductive because it both generates animosity and fails to recognize that behavior is not confined by your gender.  Why would you reach across the gender aisle if you have come to feel that there is something inherently wrong with the other gender?

Thank you for your time."

This state is the wealthiest in the nation and holds a remarkable economic standing, with a GDP that, if considered independently, would rank among the top 10 globally.

On top of that, the GOP has this habit of throwing around racist remarks, which just doesn't sit right with Asians. It's the kind of stuff that could be used against them, especially when we're talking about the surge in hate crimes against Asians.

While Asians encompass a rich tapestry of ethnic diversity, I want zero in on the ""holy Asian trinity"" (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) due to their numerous and influential representation among the Asian community. Democrats tend to lean towards supporting social safety nets and regulations, and this tends to resonate more with educated minorities.

Education holds immense significance in Asian culture, exemplified by phenomena like cram schools in East Asian countries such as Korea and Japan, where students attend supplementary classes to gain a competitive edge in entrance exams to some of the most competitive colleges in their respective country.

Drawing a comparison within the U.S., states under Republican governance tend to exhibit lower academic achievements than their Democratic counterparts. This discrepancy is often attributed to the Republican Party's inclination to reduce funding for education, resulting in lower academic outcomes.

While there is a consensus that schools could benefit from increased cost efficiency, the solution does not lie in defunding education. 


To change my view:

Provide insights on how the Republican Party can effectively cater to and address the interests of the Asian American community as opposed to the Democrats."
128,2024-01-06,CMV: All social media apps should be able to turn off any 'suggested' content or algorithmic feed,u/CosmoAce,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1905751/cmv_all_social_media_apps_should_be_able_to_turn/,changemyview,"Examples: 
Instagram, I should be able to turn off: suggested reels, explore page, suggested threads and other similar content.

Youtube, non-subscribed shorts.

Tiktok, Discover, and For You (I am not too familiar with the app as I never downloaded it.)

Just to be clear, I am not advocating to total removal from the app, nor am I saying companies should not be profitable. I am advocating that any obviously algothrimic non-subscriber/following content that does not follow the traditional advertisement exposure pattern, which I define as brief snippet of content clearly targeting to sell a specific product and does not have an entire page on the application driven by algorithms meant to keep user endlessly engaged. 
For example, McDonald's post inbetween followed content. Or a Chevy commercial in between TikTok reels.

To further elaborate, disabling these features should only be able to be done via computer to make it more difficult from simply switching it off or on. Or making it time based (off for 30 days then back on for 30 days before being able to switch it off again.)

My thought to be changed here is that we can easily break these obviously addictive and detrimental scrolling loops from these applications. I think this approach should be easily feasible from a company's financials and technicals.
It was weird when we started seeing facebook ads of products that we searched on amazon. Now we're seeing those ads in addition to ""suggested/recommended/For You"" content. And it's all by default on the landing pages. We can't disable it, and we can't change Default or Following landing page (easily) and now we can't exclusively see content we're subscribed too aside from the ads."

I am mainly referring to the United States, though I am sure this trend can also be seen in other countries too. Whenever I bring this up, most try to combat it by claiming there is no correlation between women getting rights and civilizations declining into liberalism, and then when I show them the correlation, they shift the goalpost and admit that there is a correlation but say there is nothing wrong with liberalism. It is a fact that most women vote Democrat (in other words, based on their emotions) so it seems that if we want to maintain a morally conservative society, we need to repeal the 19th amendment. The only way I could be proven wrong about this is if women didn’t actually vote overwhelmingly democrat, but they do, so my point still stands. You may argue that there are men who support liberalism too, but those are feminized men who only exist as a product of liberalism."

To concisely put my point:  
  
Unless the ideology is destroyed, any military campaign is a waste of time when trying to get a better state in 2035. Since there is so much collatoral damage on the civilian population, the ideology won't be destroyed. In many cases, it'll remain, or get stronger.

The debate about whether our representative form of government was ever a true ""democracy"" is another topic entirely.

The US has long had a two-party democratic system. Now, one of the two parties is openly un-democratic. They support a candidate who already attempted one coup to overthrow an election, and who openly wishes to be a dictator. So from my perspective, that party is no longer participating in the democratic process, which leaves us with a... one-party democracy? Is that even a democracy at all?

In 2020 Biden ran on the premise of saving democracy from Trump. Now, entering the next election, democracy seems *even farther* from ""being saved,"" and Biden is running on the same premise again. Frankly, it seems a lot like the rhetoric from self-labeled but widely accepted to be undemocratic regimes like Russia and China; ""you must vote for THE party or doom us all.""

It seems to me that the only way out of this situation is to create a viable third-party (or rather, 2nd party, if you assume that the Republicans are not participating in democracy). If the Democratic Party is serious about ""saving democracy,"" then they should be acknowledging the vast differences between their constituents (currently, anyone who still wants the US to operate as a democracy), dividing themselves into factions (sub-parties or new parties altogether), and forming a coalition of those factions to elect leaders through a democratic process (e.g. serious primary elections for president).

Is there something I'm missing? Or is the idea basically just to stall for 4 more years and then have real primaries in 2028, assuming that somehow the specter of a Republican/anti-democratic victory will just disappear before then?"

It is NOT just the self-determination of the Jewish people. To disagree with Zionism is not to deny Jewish people of their right to self-determination, but to resist the maintenance of **Jewish sovereignty** in **Israel** and maybe Palestine depending on which form of Zionism one is talking about.

It's not anti-Kurdish to say that Kurds shouldn't have their own state, or anti-Scot to say Scots shouldn't be independent in Scotland, or anti-Roma to say that Roma shouldn't be granted a state. Therefore it is not antisemitic to say that the Jewish people shouldn't have their own state. If, however, Zionism is PURELY the self-determination of the Jewish people, then anti-Zionism can be associated with antisemitism, but that's not what Zionism is.

Furthermore, saying that Jewish people shouldn't have their own state is not the same as saying Israelis shouldn't have their own state, just as saying Whites shouldn't have their own state in England is not the same as saying the English shouldn't have their own state in England. There is a leap of logic that Israeli == Jews for that equivalence to hold true. One can hold anti-Zionist position while believing that Israelis living in modern-day Israel deserve a state, which is also my position.

On top of that, it's not antisemitic to say that a people shouldn't have inherent sovereignty in a country. If someone says ""There should be White or Black sovereignty in America"", you are not a racist to criticise that person.

Lastly, no group is entitled to return to their homeland. Americans of German descent are not entitled to anything in Germany, the Romani people are not entitled to anything in northwest India. Chinese diaspora in Singapore are not entitled to anything in China. Singaporean Chinese can't just move to ShenZhen and start claiming the city belongs to them. I am not anti-German, anti-Roma, anti-Chinese for pointing all of these out, so why am I antisemitic for pointing this in Zionism out?

With that being said, there are anti-Zionists and Zionists that are antisemitic. On one hand, it's not uncommon to hear things like ""Zionists control the media/the bank"", ""Zionists are too rich"", etc. in the anti-Zionist camp, these are antisemitic statements and should be condemned. On the other, many neo-Nazi parties and fundamentalist Christians are vehement supporters of Zionism yet they hold some very antisemitic views. A report in the UK showed that the far-right are 3x more likely to hold antisemitic views than the average public."

People over the age of 28, and women in general. I think that if you are a man who is struggling with dating the worst possible thing you could do is ask women for dating advice. I feel this way because of two main issues that tie into each other. The first and main issue is that women have NO IDEA what it's like to date as a man.

It is exponentially harder to date and find relationships or casual sex as a man than it is as a woman. So, through know fault of their own, they view dating in a very simplistic light when for the majority of men, it is not like that. I hate the number rating scale, but it's the easiest way to demonstrate this metaphor. If a woman is a 4 or higher, she will get exponentially more attention from the opposite sex.  A man that's below an 8 will have literally no attention and will have to fight for it even from unattractive women. 

None of this is to say women are bad, it's the reality of the situation and men have to learn how to adjust to this reality. The thing is, men cannot learn how to do this from women. In my experience, the most common dating advice I received from women was ""just stop looking for it and it'll come to you"" which is something that could work for women, but will never work for men as men have to play an active role. The only men that don't have to are incredibly conventionally attractive men.

The second point mainly applies when soliciting advice online, it's that a percentage of women have ulterior motives when giving advice.

1,2024-01-06,CMV: There is no justification for not being vegan,u/thapussypatrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/190hbcf/cmv_there_is_no_justification_for_not_being_vegan/,changemyview,"I'll run off a few bases and then effectively most common arguments from the view against veganism

Firstly, veganism I will generalise as the abstinence of the purchase of animal products on ethical grounds (those being to not encourage somebody to harm animals on your behalf as a result)- I won't discuss veganism as something that somebody undertakes due to health reasons, or environmental reasons, because these are usually coincidences; it is only a generalisation for example that veganism will help the environment overall, but it is not *necessarily* grounded in this, nor is it grounded in how it will *necessarily* make you healthier (potentially you could even argue it is *worse* for one's health, hypothetically).

You'll have to forgive me if I miss something important, but these below are the most common reasons people give for not being vegan which I don't think stand up to scrutiny when logically considered

1) ""**It's my choice/it's my right not to be vegan (the 'you can't make me!')**"" - this isn't a moral argument, so we can basically say it fails immediately because it doesn't justify itself at all - it merely excuses itself - one can excuse any immoral act like this i.e. ""I want to keep this person as my slave (let's pretend we're in a southern state in 1840) - it's legal and it's my right so I ought to be able to do this and I shouldn't have to justify this to you""\~ (no, I'm not saying animals and humans being enslaved is 100% the same - I'll get to that later in more depth. Another perspective is this is the same as saying ""it's my right to be a terrible person"" on purely *legal* grounds, because eating and buying animal products is legal. For example, I could be a lying, manipulative bastard to everybody I meet - just because it's legal, is that a moral justification? No, so again, a limp, non-argument, unworthy of much thought in this kind of environment. 

2) ""**I don't think me going vegan will change anything**"" - another generalisation; this assumes that in and of itself one ought to be vegan because it inherently will need to directly transform the world - one's actions carry moral consequences important enough to be done or not done due to those consequences - I could torture a baby and then say ""well, if I stop doing this, this doesn't stop other people torturing babies"" - the goal is *your own* moral self-accountability and conscience; if you know that doing something itself is wrong, you shouldn't have to look at the crowd and whether they'll follow along with you. If encouraging somebody out there to mistreat an animal on your behalf (because that's literally what you're doing: paying them to do this) is wrong, it is immoral in isolation, and that's good enough.

3) ""**We need meat for nutrition**"" - this would be better phrased as ""it's much *easier* to get our required nutrition from meat"". It is nonsensical to say you *cannot* get your required nutrition from non-meat sources. You might as well even turn this into ""it is more expensive for me to get my protein (etc) from non-meat sources"" (if we even hypothetically play around with that idea) - it wouldn't matter if we knew that (a) it was possible to get it from somewhere else despite being more expensive, and (b) are you really willing to suppose that it is better to pay slightly less for your food if it comes at the price of the pain and misery of innocent creatures? If you were to say ""*I literally cannot afford vegan food compared to meat*"", firstly that's very likely complete rubbish, but secondly, if that were literally true, and you'd die if you couldn't eat meat, then obviously you'd have an *imperative* to eat meat because in that scenario it's either your death or the animals' (leading nicely into my next point...)

4) ""**Human beings are superior to animals**"" - subjectively, human beings *are* superior to animals - we are intelligent and they are not (or not like we are, anyway). However, babies, children and mentally handicapped people are subjectively less ""intelligent"" than the typical human - we cannot stake all our importance on our intelligence. Philosophically, we are subjectively superior in a sense because of our kinship with one another as the same species - we share a similarity with many animals in that they are sentient just like we are, which is a strong reason we are adverse to the concept of suffering, because we know how it feels. 

5) ""**Animals are killed/treated humanely**"" - firstly, if it is unnecessarily dying against its natural urge, that isn't ""humane"". Killing it in self-defence, and minimising the potential pain, would be ""humane killing"". If you're killing because you desire a few seconds of mouth-pleasures, or you don't want to spend slighlty more on food, the death of the animal even due to the fact that pain and torment is a *possibility* is enough to trivialise this if one has a full conscience and awareness of the industry. The problem too is that farms and slaughter houses have absolutely no economic incentive to treat animals like we *want* them to be treated on our behalf; presuming that farmers and slaughterhouse workers all think like you is *extremely* naive when you consider what job they've opted to do for a living (maybe that's slightly unfair, maybe not). Even if CCTV cameras were on them 24/7, RSPCA killing standards still involve torment because knocking an animal out, taking away the wrongness of that in itself, is still a potentially torturous process because it doesn't always work. Putting pigs into gas chambers very clearly causes pain until the death finally comes. The very concept too of milking a cow involves forcibly impregnating the cow over and over again (kind of fucked up; they don't wait for the cow to get impregnated by a male - they electricute a bull to ejaculate, and then still their hands up the cow to put the semen inside it). Imagine a woman being forced to become pregnate over and over again. And when they're separated from their calfs, the cows naturally suffer immense emotional torment - because, again, the animal biologically has an urgency to protect and care for their babies, and if you take them from it forcibly, just like a human - they will mentally suffer from that.

6) ""**Meat/diary substitutes taste bad**"" - even if that was 100% true (totally disagree, personally), just go with fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, etc (or in their ordinary forms) - even if it's not *as* nice as non-diary/non-meat, again, morally speaking, it ought to *feel* much nicer if you know what diary and meat involves; it's easier not to perceive it in this way when you don't consciously consider what the animal has to go through. If you lived in a world where the animal could only be killed or ""processed"" right in front of you (or by you) over and over again to sustain your lifestyle, you'd probably start to think ""actually, I think I'd prefer to eat the non-animal products...this is kind of horrible...""

7) ""**Veganism isn't perfect"" (or ""The Piers Morgan"")** i.e. ""bees get massacred during the procurement of almonds"" - it's not an argument against ""veganism"" - it's an argument against the procurement of almonds (or whatever vegan food you want to insert here). Veganism is naturally against the deliberate and intentional harm towards animals - if we are trying to eat vegetables and an animal (typically insects) are caught in that crossfire, that is still a more moral consequence than the meat and diary industry continuing. While a lot of people, too, say veganism would require importing more food from overseas, costing more pollution"", farms themselves (and cow methane, for instance) contribute MASSIVELY to pollution that anything like this would be a drop in the ocean by comparison. 

8) ""**Vegan activists are nutcases**"" - again, not an argument against veganism as a concept - just an argument against the vegan activists in that situation. Personally, I think the best way to spread veganism is merely talking about veganism and changing minds that way. "

Meanwhile, women of all shapes, sizes, and levels of attractiveness can do all of the above and then some.

59,2024-01-07,"CMV: Liberal media bias and its impact on the electorate in the United States is overblown, and mainstream media is underappreciated by Americans.",u/rj2200,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/190l1gs/cmv_liberal_media_bias_and_its_impact_on_the/,changemyview,"Note, first allow me to introduce myself. I am a 23, almost 24-year-old (my birthday is in less than four weeks) man from Alabama, although my political views differ from those that are normal here in AL as I am liberal. (Generally a separate issue, but I'll admit that me being bisexual is a big reason for that, but alas)

Since the late 2010s (first arguably became an issue for me in 2017, though it particularly escalated in 2019 because Donald Trump, who was the President of the United States at the time, was facing the impeachment inquiry that was authorized by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which ultimately led to the House approving the articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of that year), because no surprise, pretty much my whole immediately family is conservative since we're from the South and all white, I've dealt with a lot of my family members, even before my actual political views came out into the open and, again unsurprisingly, led to a chafing reaction from them, but even before my political views became clear to these relatives by 2019, for instance, I was getting flack from an uncle of mine as far back as the summer of 2017 just because I would post news article to my Facebook page that weren't even about political topics, and yet he attacked me because they were from ""liberal, anti-Trump"" sources. Apparently, to him, anything that criticizes Donald Trump is bad.

Anyways, I must admit in all of this that 2019 was a pretty transformative year when it came to this, and not in a good way. Perhaps I made a mistake on Facebook endorsing that I wanted Trump impeached for his bullying and cajoling of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (my political views were actually more moderate back then than they are now, even if I'm not even **that** left of the center even by US standards, but I wasn't like many Democrats in that I didn't want Donald Trump impeached until that happened and Rudy Giuliani made his concession on CNN that he and Trump had been trying to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden and had even pressured the-then US Ambassador to Ukraine in the process, which to me, came off as Watergate-level tactics). To me, Donald Trump had done a **major** obstruction of justice (hence the Watergate comparison), and it seemed like, even if it was a probably similar feeling, seemed like bigger potatoes to me than when my mom was so outraged and disgusted by Bill Clinton's denial in 1998 about having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.

The main reason I state that the beginning of the fall in 2019 was the beginning of a ""domino effect"", basically, is that after Trump's Ukraine scandal came out and he got impeached a few months later, a whole bunch of other events happened politically as well, all really in the span of a year and a half alone up until early 2021: COVID-19 broke out and under Donald Trump's leadership (or, in my view, lack thereof), the United States became the worst-hit nation by the onslaught of a new pandemic; and also, not only, of course, did Joe Biden ultimately become Trump's challenger for re-election, Biden ultimately defeated him, which led Donald Trump, without any sort of supporting evidence or justification, to try to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election, and that of course led to the attack on the US Capitol building three years ago to this day. (That also, of course, got Trump impeached a second time)

I'm sorry I've gotten long-winded. Basically, though, my point is that events took place from 2017 to 2021 that caused a lot of this to escalate (particularly literally in just the span of sixteen months alone, give or take, from roughly September 2019 to January 2021), and apparently, the thing that uncle of mine got most angry about was that I believed ""liberal media"", particularly about Donald Trump. (Now I'm hardly on speaking terms with him and his wife; by late in the year in 2021, they unfriended me on FB because apparently they blamed me for the existence of the ""disastrous Biden administration"", since yes, I did vote for Joe Biden in the 2020 election; the 2020 election was the first presidential election I was eligible to vote in as I was born in 2000, and for the record, I will admit I have pretty much no regrets about my vote for Biden, the closest I came was during the withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, though I doubt it could've been done in a much better way, especially if Trump had gotten re-elected) I'm bringing up this matter now in 2024 because that ""liberal media"" buzzword is still used by my family, on both sides, heavily-another uncle of mine was using it today to criticize my liberal views, claiming I'm brainwashed by the likes of CNN, NBC, etc., and was stating this because he apparently found it offensive that I didn't consider the attack on the nation's capitol on January 6, 2021, to have been orchestrated by the FBI to have made Trump supporters look bad, or how I don't agree with his viewpoint that everyone who entered the Capitol has gotten draconian sentences and needs an immediate pardon. He also likewise claimed the mainstream media is why I think American democracy is in jeopardy, why I don't see a compelling case to impeach Joe Biden based on his son's actions in Ukraine or China or for Hunter allegedly getting money from Russian figures, why I don't also consider the Biden administration's policies on immigration and the US-Mexico border to be impeachable, or how I don't believe Joe Biden has dementia or Alzheimer's disease. He is also angry at me-and this is a more pertinent point regarding mainstream media-for not being mad at those news sources regarding their reporting of allegations of Donald Trump having compromising ties to Russia, and how I refuse to embrace the term ""Russia hoax"".

See, to me, mainstream media is underrated. It's by no means perfect, but in my view, many of the same news sources American right-wingers vociferously and viscerally hate (and ironically, I make an effort to look at all news sources, both liberal and conservative-leaning, even though I can't stand much of the slant the likes of Fox News and New York Post do, but I at least **try** to keep up with the talking points of the American right more than anything else, since they're going to affect me anyway) have tried to be objective in ways that I'd argue are more apparent than right-leaning news sources, that fewer news sources even have a liberal bias than they claim, and if they **do** have a bias, tend to be more biased towards centrism and neoliberalism more than anything else. (Ever wonder why Cenk Uygur, the founder of The Young Turks, considers the sources I've stated to be ""corporate""?)

That leads me to admit more concessions for me to make about my views: I'm a neoliberal, establishment-aligned Democrat. Perhaps I have some confirmation bias going on in that I sometimes wonder if these biases these sources have is potentially a sign that neoliberal, establishment governance with heavy influence from experts is the best way to go (although much of my sentiment here was shaped by the pandemic). I'm also admittedly a major policy wonk, although the fact that I majored in political science in university could be an influence there, too. (I do have some sympathies for Stephen Colbert's quote that ""reality has a liberal bias"")

Just to note, I'm not trying to say that liberals, even establishment liberals, never try to put a spin on things. The main point I'm trying to make is that I don't get what I'm doing wrong, since I get attacked endlessly by my family just for where I choose to mostly get my news from. (Another irony is that I don't even use those sources they hate the most that much, I mainly use BBC and Vox, though I will admit I also really like the New York Times and the Washington Post, both of which make MAGA supporters angry) I do agree that trying to limit bias is a good thing, but I see no good-faith effort by the right to do so, and some things, like January 6, just cannot be bothsidesed. Anyways, I posted to this subreddit because, even if my view seems unpopular, I want to know if it's actually a viewpoint that **needs** changing that I think that mainstream media, even if it has its flaws, has the supposed ""liberal"" bias (one of those uncles went as far in 2020 as to call it ""far-left"", which again, given what I said about Cenk Uygur, seems ridiculous) that conservatives keep complaining about be overblown, and that MSM is often underrated by the public anyway.

One last note: someone even told me that the media somehow caused Donald Trump to not get re-elected, just because it was portraying his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in a negative light. Again, I fail to see how ""the media"" is so powerful it could have that type of effect, and that type of effect alone."
3,2024-01-07,Cmv: school shooters should be quickly and publicly put to death,u/FerdinandvonAegir124,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/190lc4u/cmv_school_shooters_should_be_quickly_and/,changemyview,"Call this angry and impulsive, but as an American student I am so tired of fearing being shot at school. Always having an escape route/plan of action decided. 

Oftentimes the guilt of school shooters is indisputable, if there’s literal footage of your shooting children you do not deserve a trial. You should be interrogated to search/form any connections with the draw of a less painful form of execution, before being publicly executed. This should be true regardless of the age of the shooter (unless they’re a preteen)

Although this will unlikely deter shooters, it will send a clear message and will give closure to the victims families/survivors. Throwing a shooter in prison for the rest of their lives does nothing for society 

If during their interrogation they admit, they should be publicly shot in the heart. A quick and generally painless death

If not, they should be shot in the stomach and left tied in the chair to bleed out publicly. 

If possible this execution should be performed with the weapon they used in a form of metaphorical justice. Barbarism will be met with barbarism

I used to be very against the death penalty, and still believe in reluctance in terms of giving the government the power to execute. However some crimes are just so inhuman, there should be no hesitation.

96,2024-01-07,"CMV: American progressives should stop calling themselves ""democratic socialists""",u/pieceofwheat,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/190mh6r/cmv_american_progressives_should_stop_calling/,changemyview,"A decent number of left-wing political figures have gained prominence and influence in American politics over the last few years. Some of the most notable include Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Cori Bush. They represent a growing progressive wing in the Democratic Party that has flexed some weight by pushing Joe Biden to the left during his presidency. However, while they are making decent gains, the left-flank of the party has effectively shot itself in the foot by proudly embracing the label of democratic socialist.

All of the aforementioned progressive leaders have self-described as democratic socialists. This is dumb for many reasons, but by far the biggest reason is because it's not even accurate to their political or economic positions. Democratic socialism is, before anything else, a form of socialism. It entails a fundamental overthrow of a capitalist free-market economy, putting the the workers in control of the means of production. But the high-profile progressives who so readily adopt the label don't even remotely advocate for that. Their primary agenda includes an expansion to the US social safety net, adding programs such as Medicare for All, free public college, and universal childcare. They also support a $15 minimum wage, a Green New Deal, and a more equitable tax system. None of those policies constitute socialism, democratic or otherwise, by any stretch of the imagination. On the contrary, many of those programs and policies are already commonplace in the vast majority of market-based liberal democracies. The so-called democratic socialist elected officials are very clearly social democrats, a system that maintains a market-economy but places a heavy emphasis on things like social welfare, economic regulations, and worker protections. This is the system that the Nordic countries follow. The fact that Bernie frequently points to Nordic countries as a model to emulate further drives home the fact that he is a social democrat, not a democratic socialist. 

The next problem with their erroneous self-designation is that it completely alienates wide swaths of voters right off the bat. I'm not saying it's right, but millions of Americans view socialism as an instant deal-breaker, and that includes Democrats. Progressives lose out on numerous potential supporters when they proudly claim the mantle of democratic socialism. The worst part is that the progressive agenda is highly popular according to polling, with many of its most important proposals garnering well over majority support among the American public. If Bernie and the others ran on the exact same policies but argued that they were common-sense reforms to our current system that most of the developed world takes for granted rather than a revolutionary socialistic vision, I sincerely believe we would be in a very different place right now.

For those reasons, I strongly believe progressive political leaders should ditch the democratic socialist label once and for all. Unfortunately, they've been associated with the label for so long that winning over skeptical voters might be a lost cause. In that case, I hope the next slate of progressive politicians who enter the political arena will build on the work of their predecessors and broadly embrace their agenda while completely reworking the messaging around it.

I'd love to hear any contradictory opinions. Thanks!"

They’re usually spurred by stuff related to relationships, as I haven’t had one yet. I feel that it is somewhat an indication of me being undesirable and somewhat unlikable, because it feels like my lack of one is confirmation that everyone sees me as unattractive/ugly. This obviously worsens my self-esteem significantly, and it makes the periods of sadness that I go through somewhat hard to break out of, sometimes lasting an hour or more. I have a similar thing when it comes to socialization and friendships. Whenever I mess up an interaction or don’t get invited somewhere, I feel that it is because I am not valuable and am unattractive as a friend to them. This usually makes me feel much worse because I feel that if I can’t even get certain people to like me as a friend, I definitely can’t get them to like me as more. I also don’t get complimented by anyone other than my parents, which annoys me because I feel that they are constantly lying to my face. Even when I’m not extremely sad, I sometimes feel extremely insecure about not receiving attention and validation. I know that it’s bad to base my self-esteem on this, but I can’t seem to break it. I sometimes feel that nobody cares about me and just tolerates me due to this lack of attention/validation which makes me feel like nobody cares about me, even though I have acquaintances/friends."

when it comes to the geopolitical aspects of anti Zionism I'll readily admit conflating it with anti-Semitism is silly. even if I disagree with some of the core arguments of pro-palestineans  I can see that their complaints towards Israel are legitimate (even if I disagree with the remedy) but Israel being a jewish state is irelevant and thus not antisemitic.

But, the genral arguments against israeli culture and its demographic are antisemitic in nature.

1. Culture appropriation - 
specifically arguments stating Israeli culture(; food, slang, language, names and etc') stole or destroyed Middle Eastern cultural aspects.
many anti Zionist for example claim Israel appropriated food as Israeli cuisine. but the argument fails when looked into. israelis never claimed Israeli falafel was invented by Israel but rather that Israel made a distinct rendition of falafel by Jews who immigrated from other posts of The ME or lived in the Palestinian region. American pizza is distinctively American even though its origin is in Italy. 



 When Vox pointed out that Palestinian towns were given a Hebrew name they failed to mention that in most cases the signs retained the the name in arabic (assuming the the sign was not vandalized by zealots or omited by local council). in general Arabic is not criminalised in private or public. with caviat, Palestinian local culture is protcted by and from the state(with caviat of nationalistic expression) of anyone has a counter example of like to hear it.

2. European Invasion 
In general the view that Israeli culture is is invasive to the area because it comes Europe, or particularly the Askenazi refugees and immigrants, comes from a place of hatred of that culture and the emerging Israrli-jewish culturw in the area. Meaning anti-Semitism. that hatred is not limted to pro-palestineans some secular Zionists ire the orthodox jews in Israel for not adopting a broader Israeli culture, that too is a type of antisemitism imo.

some people (on titok and r/ askmiddleeast) pointed out that some  israeli politicians have parents and grandparents with European surnames and they alleged that Israelis tried to make themselves sound more native by changing the surname. nothing is away from the truth than this, the names were Hebrewvised- עוּברֵתוּ  to show reconection with the Hebrew language that was revitlized during the emerging of Zionism. Jews viewd the Holocaust as a betrayal of European nations and tried to distinct themselves from them after seeing Europeans not viewing them as equals. so they adopted a more zionistic idetify with emphasis on the Hebrew languege and not Jewish variants of of other languages (ladino, yedish and Morocco's jewish dialect)

3. ""Zionism is not Jewish""
while many Jewish people don't like Zionism and personally I dont belive religious text give any credence to displace people or to create an ethnic state because of it. But Jewish myth contain core zionistic views. God promised the land to Israel descendants and the prophets promised Israelis will return in a meshiyanic fashion after the Galut(the diaospera). again I don't like this type of justification for a state but divorcing the Zionist aspects of Judaism just to appear not anti Semitic is silly. just bite the bullet, religious Judaism is dumb and it provides justification for expansionism I'd say the same for all other religions. 


Em: General Thoughts - 
 all of this doesn't matter. WB settlements should be stopped Palestians deserve civil rights in Israel or in a Palestinian state(whatever solution is proposed). zionism is not inheritly good and religious attachments to lands are silly. but don't let bigotery invade good arguments in the name of social progression."
1,2024-01-07,CMV: being long term single is better than being in a relationship,u/chessman6500,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/190qozt/cmv_being_long_term_single_is_better_than_being/,changemyview,"Personally, I think being single for a long time is better than being in a relationship. A lot of relationships eventually turn south. Some start that way and progressively get worse, others start out good and then over time worsen. Statistics show that 20 people per minute are abused by a partner in the United States. 

Are there happy marriages? Sure but I feel like a truly happy marriage is the minority nowadays and the way to tell is divorce rates are exceptionally high. At least half of marriages end in divorce. Most people claim they are happy in a marriage but they are actually not.

Also, it’s really hard work to maintain a romantic relationship. Everything is so expensive nowadays and it makes it so hard to even go out to meet people, let alone afford dates with the chance it won’t even work out. 

I honestly think being single, while some may say it’s lonely, is actually far less stressful and may even be rewarding at times. I’ve been single most of my life but it’s left me time to cultivate excellent friendships and work on my hobbies, and it allows me to be more flexible with income as I love in low income housing and everything is discounted. I only have to support myself, which I find much easier.

If that happens, he'll very likely withdraw USA from NATO and end all kind of military aid to Ukraine = Putin would take over Ukraine. Of course Europe could try to continue the military aid, but leaders like Orban would make that difficult. And nationalism is anyway growing in Europe/EU, leading to friction between its countries. And that's exactly what Putin wants and needs for his further plans, I guess.

After taking Ukraine he would start testing the boundaries of weakened NATO. He could organize a small ""operation"" against Baltics. I guess not many members would want to take a risk of nuclear war because of ""some small nations in Eastern Europe."" So he could easily escalate it further and take over those countries = NATO would lose its deterrence.

And then he would go on and on and on. After Baltics maybe Poland or Finland. Then Sweden, Norway...

I am not an expert, though. I hope my view to be changed, because I see nothing good or hopeful in this situation as a person living in the Eastern Europe. I'd rather take a severe disease than war, then I'd know that at least my kids and other loved ones are safe. War puts me and all my loved ones at a high risk of gruesome death.

That being said, I struggle to see how the observations incels frequently make about dating, sex and relationships are wrong. Especially in a world where the leading place where people are dating is online. I fail to see how dating isn't solely about being physically attractive. Tall physically attractive men get the most attention in any arena of dating. Women desire them in ways that men such as myself never get to experience. I don't see how that's something that can be seen as just a nonsense theory held by incels. I mean when I was in college it was a very small amount of men having sex with a majority of women.

I also don't see really how the deterministic aspects of incel beliefs are wrong. If you are ugly or short, there's nothing you can do to fix that or change that. I also don't think physical attractiveness is subjective in any way that's meaningful for ugly men. Like there isn't a single woman alive that would look at me and say I'm more physically attractive than [Michal Mrázik](https://www.reddit.com/r/ugly/comments/190apuz/do_you_ever_fantasize_about_being_someone/). There's not a single thing I could do to make myself look like him. He will have more success with woman than I ever would and if I somehow got a girlfriend and he propositioned her she'd probably cheat on me. These are objective facts, yet people say they aren't.

I just don't get it. I'm fully open to being wrong and would much prefer to heaar that I am, but I just don't see how."

That is a related but separate issue. I will not be responding to comments on the war that are not tied to the issue of American Jews trusting their neighbors.

I’ve completely lost my faith in humanity and in my neighbors, and I see a lot of other American Jews who feel the same way. This is my perspective.

I rallied against violence in Darfur in high school. I tried to get my friends on board, very few of them cared. That was around 200,000 dead, a lot more than in Gaza.

I am part Chinese. Around 100,000 Uyghur are enslaved in China. I’ve often wondered where the outrage for them is.

India and Afghanistan are some of the most sexist places on earth. I’ve tried to learn about the way women are treated, tried to educate myself and my friends. Most of my friends don’t seem interested in learning.

I am American. America as I know it, the freedoms I and my friends enjoy, would not exist without certain conflicts. Sherman’s March in the civil war, which followed a “scorched earth” policy, killed thousands. But that’s small potatoes compared to WWII, where American forces killed 12,200 French civilians during the battle of Normandy alone. My friends, who enjoy freedoms because of these things, seem to carry virtually zero guilt and don’t actually know they even happened.

Then Israel is attacked. Families are destroyed, sexual violence is used as a weapon, babies and children are murdered and kidnapped. 

What do my friends, the same ones who don’t care about Darfur, china, India, Afghanistan, who don’t even understand how they were born into such nice lives, do? They immediately condemn Israel and blame it for the attack. They’re out in the streets, in mass, protesting against not just Israel’s actions in this conflict but its entire existence. Apparently, to them, enslaving 100,000 Uyghurs is okay but displacing Palestinians is not. 

When it comes to the conflict, they are listening to people who have argued against Israel’s existence for decades. They are in bed with terrorists. They don’t if the hostages are released, so long as Israel stops attacking. They call all Zionists dirty, even though Zionism is just belief that Israel should exist and not an endorsement of any particular politician. I didn’t like Trump, but I didn’t want the US to stop existing.

They villainize everything we do. Israel has a no man left behind policy, not because they think Israelis or Jews are better but because if they dont get their people back, nobody will. Even that has turned into comments of “Jews think they’re better than everyone else.” Comments like that, or comments calling Jews dogs of genocidal monsters, are all over Reddit and all over conversations irl.

How do I come to any conclusion other than my friends only care about injustice and violence when Jews are the perpetrators? That they won’t hesitate to dehumanize Jews and Israelis? If they got worked up about all these other issues, it would be a different story. If they could separate Netanyahu’s policies from the existence of an entire country, it would be a different story. But they can’t seem to do that.


I saw another post here where someone asked about the conflict. Most American Jews I know are not engaging with non-Jews anymore, because there’s no point. And those bridges are permanently burned."

From the Victorian period to ancient times it was primarily used as a way to try and gain insights about events that were happening or were soon to come. Now it seems like just the Gen Z version of the Myer-Briggs test, but more sparkly because it is made of star dust. 

The reason why I think that people who believe star signs have real effective influence in their lives are more likely to be narcissists is because they are ascribing universal meaning and narrative to the random and circumstantial experiences of their lives. As the protagonist of their story, everything that happens to them in their life has to further their narrative and character progression. Everything happens for a reason...and the reason is their personal development. 

Helpfully, it also provides a scapegoat for aspects of a person's character that normally we'd argue need working on but now can be excused with ""I can't help it, I'm a Scorpio"", or ""of course she got offended, she's a cancer"". 

Obviously, not everyone is going to believe in astrology to the same extent, but I am noticing when meeting new people that they will ask you for your star sign as one of the ice-breaker questions. But to me that's as weird as someone asking what denomination of a faith I am, presuming I'm a religious person when I'm not.

In Brave New World, you live under the mighty techno-and-scientocratic World State, where your needs are tended everyday, from a standard comfy couch to the most pleasant sensation scientific breakthroughs have to offer.

The State focuses hard on the concept of hedonism: minimizing pain, and maximizing pleasure. What they failed to think of however is that pleasure can be taken from ABSOLUTELY anything. Yes, that includes pain itself, something they want to eradicate so desperately.

They want life to be fun; there is fun in danger, there is fun in crime, there is fun in immorality. They only had a narrow and fine approach when it came to analyzing what we want to feel ""better."" They never decided to look at their backs, or through the windows of a glass tunnel. Why do serial killers kill? Why do rapists rape? Why is robbing a bank rewarding aside from the quick-get-rich money? Simple. Because it's fun and pleasurable. The same pleasure the World State tried to offer.

They only saw the wants of the majority, and never the wants of the minority.

But it can be fixed.

Enter: Simulation. Virtual Reality, Generative AI, Metaverse... We have the technology. We can simulate the pain and pleasure of everything, without consequence of the pain, and everything of pleasure. VR sex exists. Wanna go to war? Call of Duty with some haptic tech can accommodate that for you. Wanna go on a date? A futuristic Midjourney can generate your ideal partner. With simulation, the accommodations of pleasure are endless. Commit a crime without committing it. Submit and enact your deepest fetishes. If you don't wanna commit anything immoral, you can either just... live normally in VR. Hell, you could even live as the best or the worst of society, real or fictional.

""But what about knowledge?""

Then so be it. If learning gives the person pleasure, so be it. If said knowledge is withheld from the person, the person will become distressed and be disillusioned. Something will be wrong. The World State does not like that. After all, from a logical standpoint, it was never said that knowledge was fully withheld from the people, only that nobody ever cared about it.

TLDR: The World State failed to accommodate the needs of the minority, which can be a threat to their ideology if left to fester, and Huxley only saw the worst case scenario of a potential utopia.

We should still watch out though. An idea like that in the wrong hands can cause dire consequences equal to or worse than what you would see in the book."

Women are also opting out in much higher numbers than men. This’ll create a scarcity in the dating market and will mean women have even more choosing power than they already do and only the hottest, best men will be able to experience romantic love or sex.

So I think we should start preparing young men now. There’s this weird thing that especially mothers do where they compliment their sons and tell them how handsome they are and how girls are going to like him, which if it isn’t true is weird as hell. I think this sets people up for failure and disappointment. That at least was the case for me. There’s also a societal focus that relationships and sex are milestones for men to achieve and that’s increasingly becoming not the case.

What I think should be done is from an early age, find the boys who will grow into romantically/sexually unsuccessful men and start telling them and training them up in ways to prevent them from fallin into darker rabbit holes. In my case, if you looked at me at 13, you would be able to tell I was going to grow into an ugly loser. I mean my bullies were able to pick up on it, so I don’t see why adults didn’t. I went through college without a single woman ever liking me.these things are telegraphed and not really suprises.

Sauron, the one and only character purely evil guy for in the original first films.


Which is kind of funny, how it had the opposite effect. Instead of having a new Galadriel, Mace Windu, Leia that people will love for decades. You get the woke Galadriel 2.0, Rey and Reva which nobody really likes and kind of hopes Sauron/Vader the evil guys kills them all pretty fast."

If you put your money even in crazy safe places like real estate and index funds you are doing so ridiculously well right now. My first house I bought in 2011 is worth 6x what I paid for it. I started investing 10% of my check in 2011 into the S&P and a few other stocks. That shit is almost 5x what it was back then. 

How is this not a massive boom for us? Everyone was graduating making 50k-80k a year in the brand new tech sector hungry for talent, easily making the cheap ass rent we had back then. My first apartment was 350 a month in the middle of SD. It was shitty and run down but it didn't even dent my paycheck right out of school.  I had a down payment for a house in less than a year. 

Meanwhile Zoomers are absolutely screwed. They are graduating into the same 50-80k we made, but everything is 5x more expensive. Their rent is now 1700+, and the housing market hyper competitive, absolutely destroying their chances of a crash to get in like we did. Construction has never been pricier. Stocks are at ATH. College is so much more expensive than what we paid. Even the community college nearby I was thinking of taking some classes at for fun is laughably expensive compared to when I did it back in 2008. 

I think people ignore how well we had it as millenials, or pissed away their 20's spending a fortune on junk. I don't have a single millenial friend who hasn't paid off or almost paid off their house at this point, and I grew up right above the poverty line. 

It feels like reddit is a completely different world compared to my lived experiences in 3 different states. All I see here is fellow millenials joking about how awful they have it. Meanwhile Gen X saw their entire fortunes crumble in 2 years for us to pick it clean and zoomers get to watch us in our walled 3% interest gardens."

If we are going to spend tax payer money on free lunches which doesn’t solve the problem - directing those funds to CPS to better fund them and hold the irresponsible parents accountable is the right thing to do.   A child would fare better in a group home being properly fed and tended to  than in a neglected home malnourished.

Reese’s Cups are one of the most iconic American candies. It was only a matter of time before Hershey’s introduced a spin-off candy called Reese’s Pieces, mini M&M shaped candies with a chocolate shell and peanut butter flavor cream inside.

The only problem is that the cream tastes quite different than the peanut butter filling of the Reese’s Cups. In fact, if I didn’t know the names of the candies, I wouldn’t think they were related.

In my opinion, Reese’s Pieces taste more akin to a Mr. Goodbar. I can’t explain it, you just have to try it. Go to the store, get a Reese’s Cup, a Mr. Goodbar, and some Reese’s Pieces. You’ll see what I mean.

As such, I think Hershey’s should rebrand Reese’s Pieces to Goodbar Jrs., which is a play on the name Mr. Goodbar with the abbreviated familial title, and also references the candy’s size relative to the original candy. The colors of the Goodbar Jrs. should be brown, yellow, and red, which references the color scheme on the Mr. Goodbar wrapper.

In addition, I think the creation of a Goodbar family would help bring attention to the less popular, but franky delicious Mr. Goodbar."

The main issue I attribute this to is autism, which makes it harder for me to fit in with others, particularly people who are not autistic, and also having a back deformity which makes me appear hunched in public.

I want to propose that recently divorced men are an even more desirable subclass of employees due to the following several factors. Post-divorce, most men will immerse themselves more in work as a way to cope with personal changes, leading to increased dedication and focus at work. Additionally, loss of a significant portion of their life savings, and likely the family residence, combined with the added financial burden of child support and spousal support payments will drive a recently divorced man to maintain stable employment and possibly strive for better performance, as their financial situation could be more tightly linked to their job. And last, but not least, is that going through a divorce can bring about personal growth, maturity, and a renewed sense of responsibility, which will likely translate into the men's professional behavior and mindset."

1.) Coding bootcamps have lost their point of difference

Prior to bootcamps, CS degrees taught degrees taught things that were superfluous to web development, as well as having little focus on human skills and teamwork. Bootcamps addressed this by creating relatively short courses with an intense workload, focusing only on material that would produce competent full-stack developers. The combination of this with human skills and group projects made bootcamps both appealing to students (for it's short duration and value for money) and employers (who were probably sick of hiring talented but socially inept neckbeards).

However in recent years, CS degrees have upped their game and now pivoting towards group-oriented programming and human skills.

2.) Many bootcamps have poor quality control and have dubious employment stats

My bootcamp accepted people who did not have the aptitude to become developers, and it did not enforce performance standards during the course.  A few of the people who graduated could barely code, let alone build a website. I've heard that this is the same for many other bootcamps.

3.) The industry is swamped with bootcamp grads looking for work

4.) I suspect that the tech industry is now more preferential to hiring people with CS degrees ( see reasons above).

5.)  AI has revolutionized web development

This is conjecture on my part, but I don't think learning js/css/html and frameworks is not going to be enough to get a junior web dev role, especially given how AI is changing the industry. I suspect that there will be far fewer entry level web developer positions.

In conclusion, coding bootcamps suited the tech industry of the early 2010's, but are becoming outdated, irrelevant money traps."
1,2024-01-07,"CMV: American left-wing progressive values are based on a modified, secular version of Christianity while Republican Christians base their ideology on the Atheist Ayn Rand or the Ancient Greeks",u/MentalDespairing,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1912033/cmv_american_leftwing_progressive_values_are/,changemyview,"Modern left-wing values is based on an extreme focus on detesting strong people, aka ressentiment and slave morality. A lot of left-wing beliefs come from empathy, which is great, but you'll notice that sometimes it goes overboard, where you should restrain your own abilities as to not offend anyone. Don't take too much pride in yourself, pride is a sin! The removal of challenge might dull the mind and human spirit completely. Living in a post-scarcity society could be a nightmare if what we end up doing is pursue hedonism 24/7.

American conservative views, claiming to be Christian, ignore the meekness and forgiveness of Christian slave morality. Prosperity theology, if you are successful it is because God decided it, and he rewarded you with wealth and material goods! And some right wingers follow beliefs more akin to the Master Morality of the ancient Greeks. Look at people like Jordan Peterson, Crowder, or any modern popular figure - they are obsessed with a return to masculinity, might gives right - the Greeks went into a decline because they were too feminine and gay!

Imagine if the modern left modified their views and embraced anti-capitalism because it is bad for art and human challenge, to be anti-capitalist from a standpoint of human flourishing! Without an eight hour workday we could conquer the universe and create our own values and art free from economic incentives! Perhaps advocate a slogan like ""Marx was right about the economy, but Nietsczhe was right about the human spirit"". Or perhaps the left should embrace capitalism due to pride parades and corporations now having realized they make money off LGBT+ and minorities and have begun prioritizing cities over rural markets.

And the right would do better in turning to socialist economics + return to slave morality + no more master morality. Capitalism encourages prostitution and alienation. Too much love of money, not enough love of God.

Please explain why my analysis is wrong! "

Now that gender roles are pointless in todays society and men and women are capable and encourage to be in the same roles and spaces, I believe it’s totally fine to not feel the need to be socially referenced by your sex. The word non-binary literally means opting out of the two-sex social reference system and just being considered neither. It is not making up a new and improved gender or ignoring the fact that gender itself is based of of the two sexes. Gender fluidity on the other hand now encourages that you have no identity and it can shift and shape and be bent at will based on any criteria, mood, time, place, whatever. Same with new “genders”, xeno-this, demi-that, it’s a completely new and fabricated concept that isn’t based off anything. If you do not feel your personal identity reflected by your biological sex then that’s FINE, be nonbinary as you don’t feel the need for your genitals to play a part in how people reference you.

I believe this antagonistic relationship is one-sided, and ai artists do not think this way. I think AI artists (idk about the companies) tend to be people with genuine passion who either are not skilled in earlier ways of doing art or were not given the opportunities to develop such skills, so they are using the new technology since they feel it gives them opportunities they otherwise would not have.

I perceive prompt engineering as a legitimate artistic skill, although not one that is equivalent to drawing the piece yourself, nor a currently well developed one among really anyone. 

I am not making a statement about the ethics of the actual companies involved. Personally, I think ai generation software is not plagiarism, and images created by it should be copyrightable as long as they reach a certain originality threshold, and also programs should give a list of images with significant influence on the generated images. I see no issue with using copyrighted material for training since humans do the exact same thing, but I see an issue with uncredited use of copyrighted material. But I think all of this really depends on how such black boxes end up actually working.

&#x200B;

As for the actual AI artists, rather than the companies. I think they should be accepted into artistic communities and encouraged to use this as a point to branch into more traditional means. They could use this to correct the way a certain thing was drawn by the ai or similar. If everything is great except there's a weird looking building in the background this is a good opportunity to learn how to draw a good looking building."

Many smart people claim it is better to just give money directly instead of trying to organize charities and give things or build resources for causes you believe in. I am pretty okay with that concept and have issues with charity organizations. The problem I have is that often the way I see this idea applied is by sending money directly to poor people in 3rd world countries to make the most impact on problems because your money is worth more and can go further there. I disagree for a few reasons. 

First the reason anyone gives money is never purely altruistic. The most benign reason is you want to feel good. It is more difficult to give people this feeling if the person is someone on the other side of the world unless you start going beyond the just giving them money part and fund some group that does marketing and collects information on how that money improved their lives, which would no longer be just giving the money to the person directly. 

Second most often reason I feel like people give money is to champion a cause they feel strongly about. The issue with giving money to someone on the other side of the world is that cultures differ wildly, so the further you get from home the more likely this person will be concerned with some issue you are not. For issues that are not specialized to the area you are donating to then your money will likely not be as effective for your own issue.

Third many of the largest ""donors"" are really giving money to themselves for tax purposes under the premise of creating a ""foundation"". The ""charitable"" actions they do often have effects that pretty obviously benefit the foundation's creator directly. A lot of the people who were advocates of this form of giving were wealthy 'Tech/ crypto bros' who I distrusted already and with cases like Sam Bankman-Fried I feel justified.

Fourth, the same reasons why investment in poor countries is believed to be effective might be a factor in unintended consequences. Giving a homeless person $1000 in the united states might not feel as effective, but in a country where that is a yearly salary it could improve things greatly, but it could have negative effects. If it is only a few people who receive money then their neighbors will be jealous and may lash out. If it is many people you are trying to help then it could cause inflation in the country, workers will want to quit and look for better paying jobs, and there may be a period where what system is there is disrupted until that country finds a new stable point and just produces the same unhappiness that was there before but the country is just richer than their neighbors now. This might make them follow the whole globalization BS death cycle (I know this one is poorly worded and difficult for me to explain, but let's just say I think interfering with another nation's economy is a bad thing, even if done with good intentions.)

Fifth and final, by giving locally you help bridge the gap between yourself and your neighbors, improve your own well being by improving your community, and having lifted those around you up given them a life where they are better able to do the same, letting the effect spread in a more natural and gradual way that is less negatively disruptive to the stability of society.

So there is no need to provide any proof supporting a claim that any religion, theism, or similar Just World fallacies are inaccurate, as the only evidence or record of these constructs has been fabricated, recorded, interpreted, or otherwise created by man. And as previously stated, that makes it fruit of the poisoned tree. Throughout human history the invention of different religions, across different cultures, follows predictable patterns of behavior. And none are unique or different enough to necessitate refuting them individually.

The Gish Gallop is a communication style dedicated to machine gunning the audience and opponents with a rat-a-tat-tat of truths, misleading truths, half-truths, exaggerations, lies, anecdotes and emotionally loaded framing, all mixed together and twisted around one another in such a spray of words and emotions that the audience is left with no ability to critique, and instead is simply asked to absorb the overall impact of the impression until, overwhelmed, they agree with it.

1,2024-01-07,Cmv: women should pay for dates,u/Drcockopus1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/191a3xj/cmv_women_should_pay_for_dates/,changemyview,"Most of my experience is in NYC. Things do seem easier when I have dated outside of NYC.

The normal song and dance is:

Girl: You wanna split? Guy: It’s okay, I’ve got it. Girl: You sure? Guy: Yeah, no worries.

I’m obviously not talking about a situation where the girl actually wants to pay her half, and the guy just refuse to let her.

Some women take awhile rummaging through their wallet waiting for you to offer to pay. Some don’t even do the fake rummage. Some ask, but it’s a fake ask. You lose points if you agree to it.

The ones who actually want to pay half usually make it clear. They just put down their card. They say “let’s split it” instead of “do you want to split it?” But they’re rare. Maybe 10% of first dates…and I’m probably being generous.

Then there are the women who not only expect you to pay, but if the place you pick doesn’t meet some minimum caliber they have in their head, then the date gets canceled before it began."

surely it has to be morally reprehensible regardless of what demographic the victim is part of?? else how is it even discerned which demographics its fine with and which it isnt?

and if all homicide is good then what does it matter the demographic the victim is of? it would be good in all cases."

Hamas is also somehow manages to manufacture and launch long range missiles at Israel. So Israel with all its advanced surveillance and complete control of the sky, can't find where those rockets are being manufactured, stored and launched from and preemptively eliminate them? Keep in mind that Gaza is a pretty small piece of land under total Israeli blockade since 1967.  

Also Israel for some reason allows Hamas to own property, real estate, bank accounts, newspapers, TV channels, etc. Why would Israel allow all that unless they want for Hamas to exist? Israel even transfered money directly to Hamas on many occasions.   

Also how Hamas was able to carry out the attack on 7 October without Israel knowing about it with all its fancy surveillance and intelligence?


I call bullshit. Hamas is Israel. It was all Israeli plan to ethnically cleanse the area from Palestinians, and Americans know that and obviously are helping them to carry out their evil plan."

I was journalling to do self exploration, which always does wonders for me like nothing else, and unravel my issues and explore new ideas.

If they weren't important, our hearts wouldn't make these emotions. 

Mindset matters greatly. Mindset is not easy to change. You can't wish a new mindset - you have to install it. Resentment and bitterness have nothing to do with mindset. They are just existential legacy emotions. They don't tax the person at all or compromise a person's autonomy. I assume said person is mature and action oriented and the things he has resentment towards were beyond his control and violations of trust and such, as with things experienced as a child or as with things done by governments and power structures. 

I daresay the world runs on institutions and ideologies built from resentment, and we don't question them. We even lionize them. So I say there ain't nothing wrong feeling bitter. In fact belief that you should only goes on to make you either disown a part of yourself, or make you feel like a moral failure"

It's either putting your face in front of a screen and calling it reactionary, or just playing audio without creditting the original creator.

As a result of the 1948 war of independence 700k Palestinian arabs were displaced or fled and lost their home. These became refugees and many of their descendants live in the West Bank and Gaza.

So it’s refugees vs refugees. The difference is, the Jewish refugees built a prosperous Israel while the Arab states, NGOs and Palestinian leaders ensured the Palestinians never resettled and prospered and were mostly a political tool to use as cannon fodder against Israel.

1,2024-01-08,CMV: Misunderstanding is the Origin of All Misery.,u/RHX_Thain,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/191fx30/cmv_misunderstanding_is_the_origin_of_all_misery/,changemyview,"I've been working on this theory for quite a while and continually challenging it. So far, my efforts have only improved it. Here are my definitions and justifications:

There is misery. 
There is the absence of misery.
There is joy.
There is the absence of joy. 

Misery arises from misunderstanding. 

Misunderstanding is the difference between what we believe and what is actually happening. 

To draw an arrow and loose it, only to miss, is the difference between what we believe and what is true. This is a measurable difference. All further consequences and considerations become more difficult to correlate from that initial misunderstanding, but from there, the misery will begin to radiate unless the mistake is understood and thus corrected. It could be as simple as using the wrong string on the wrong type of bow in the wrong weather, or as huge as the belief in personal superpowers that transcend all reason which only miss a shot if disrespected by other people nearby. It doesn't matter where the misunderstanding came from, simply that it was misunderstood at the time.

Misunderstanding is the origin of all misery. 

Misunderstanding, however, is not a fault. It is a misunderstanding. Misunderstanding is both natural and contagious socially. Blaming ourselves and each other for such misunderstanding is itself misunderstanding. 

To heal a misunderstanding is an act of acceptance. We must first accept that we misunderstand and seek the cure, which is wonder. 

Wonder is the embrace of otherness. 

All that exists is both part of our self, and separate from ourselves. We live in this state of being part of the world, but misunderstanding our place within it. There is infinitely more misunderstanding in this world than there is understanding. Understanding is complicated and fragile, an unbroken chain hardly communicated but easy to misinterpret. The exhaust of this process creates even more misunderstanding than even understanding can overcome. 

But that isn't to say the balance between understanding and misunderstanding, between wonder and misery, is a losing proposition, or that it is futile. Simple understandings allow for the avoidance of great misunderstandings, making even a small amount of understanding in an ever growing sea of misunderstanding all the more powerful in teaching one to sail those waters. 

Wonder cures misunderstanding by making it possible to discover understanding. 

Understanding is the acceptance of otherness. 

Notice I didn't say, acceptance of what is ""true,"" or, ""correct,"" or, ""inevitable."" To say one knows what is true is itself a misunderstanding. It's possible to understand how something works, and from that abstract understanding, avoid significant misery. But it's also possible that understanding is true in most situations but fails to explain or comport with the situation in another. Only direct experience and wonder can reveal otherwise hidden understanding. Until then, to act otherwise is to invite misery.

In this way, we are constantly being challenged to accept our own limits and accept that we do not know all things. 

We are a part of all things, but we do not understand them. To reduce the gap between ourselves and all things is to embrace what it is beyond us as if it were a part of us. 

This means nothing is so good it doesn't have some flaw. Nothing is so bad it doesn't have some use.

What some may forbid because it is disgusting or repulsive hides the truth available within it, allowing misery the opportunity to spring from it. 

What some may forbid because it is holy, good, and sacred, may harbor the worst misunderstandings of all, and misery can and will spring from it. 

Misery is disease. 

Misery is a pulled muscle.

Misery is addiction. 

Misery is cruelty. 

Misery is rejection. 

Misery is starvation. 

Misery is war.

Misery is boredom. 

Misery is the absence of understanding. For if we understood, we could learn to overcome these things in advance of them ever becoming such a problem, and accept our place within that relationship. 

Life has no obvious goal. Some may agree or disagree. But this much is clear to me: a life well lived is a life free from misery and lived with a moderate amount of joy. 

There is misery in the absence of joy, and this is obviously terrible. 

There is joy in the presence of misery, which is slightly better. 

There is joy in the absence of misery, and that is obviously preferable. 

If we live life fleeing from misery, then we have failed to accept it and wonder about it, which causes misunderstanding, which is the origin of all misery. To embrace joy is to embrace misery and come to understand it by exploring its ins and outs. To reduce the misery in the self and in others, although it may stall joy or even diminish it, eventually the understanding pays for itself. 

We may be wrong? 

Maybe we seek understanding all our lives and never come closer to it. Perhaps that is the wager of faith. To bet on wonder instead of looking away, choosing to believe in the power of wonder even in the absence of evidence, in an attempt to let go of misunderstanding and embrace other ways. 

My claim is that wonder cures misunderstanding, which reduces misery, and leads to a better life wherein suffering is lessened and the joy of discovery uplifts us all.

No other philosophy or idea seems to undo that faith. The more I try to disprove it, the more miserable I become. The less I live it, the less I wish to live that way, and I see in others the folly of my actions reflected in the cause of more misery. Every lie, every rejection, every lazy and undisciplined choice made from a place of misunderstanding only makes me and those I interact with more miserable. 

Failing to live up to this ideal, though, is not a source of ridicule. I'd consider that another misunderstanding. We don't understand what we don't understand. And we can't say we understand until we can live it. 

Because understanding is accepting what is, not what we believe it to be. Understanding is doing, not talking about it. The truth is what happens, not what we think. Only when we can produce a prediction can we say we truly understand. Saying otherwise is the greatest misunderstanding of all. 

It may feel right to mock someone for not seeing this way. But we see them. We are no different. Only our misunderstanding separates one mind from knowing another as we would know ourselves. 

What do we do with this revelation? 

Seek wonder. 

Inspire others to seek wonder, too.

Know being correct is no good unless it leads to further wonder. 

Understand misery at its source so it plagues us no longer.

Live this way, so that those who also misunderstand may be inspired to wonder about it themselves. If we find ourselves straying from it, remember to wonder why, least the misery reminds us."

1,2024-01-08,CMV: Israel’s Strategy is a direct attack to Iran that may start a global war. Israel needs to be stopped independently if they are right or wrong.,u/godintraining,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/191k459/cmv_israels_strategy_is_a_direct_attack_to_iran/,changemyview,"The Middle East is a geopolitical hotspot, and I'm increasingly convinced that Israel's current actions could be a prelude to a direct strike on Iran, potentially backed by the U.S. This strategy, however, could draw in other global powers like Russia and China, leading to an even larger conflict. Here's my take, but I'm open to different perspectives and insights.

**Israel's Recent Actions and the Proxy Wars**

Israel's military response to the October 7 Hamas attack, the Israelian heavy response in Gaza and the assassination of Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut indicate a shift towards more aggressive tactics.

This, coupled with the tensions in Lebanon with Hezbollah and the Red Sea blockade, suggests a broader strategy that goes beyond Hamas and targets Iran-backed groups.

**Iran: The Primary Adversary**

The intensity of Israel’s actions points towards Iran as the primary adversary. With IDF preparing for prolonged conflict, it seems Israel is gearing up for something beyond regional skirmishes.

This could potentially be a direct total war against Iran. An Iranian opposition leader, Vahid Beheshti, recently addressed the Knesset Israel Victory Caucus, urging Israel not to be afraid to attack bases in Iran. This shows that there are elements within the Iranian opposition that support Israeli action against the Iranian regime. 

**Iran’s Position and Response**

Contrastingly, Iran seems to be avoiding direct confrontation. Their strategy might be to continue supporting proxy conflicts, undermining Israel’s global standing without engaging in an all-out war that could be devastating for them. Iran has no interest in escalating the situation but Irael keeps poking the bear. 

**The Role of the U.S**

The U.S. has historically been a strong ally of Israel. Their potential support, whether diplomatic, political, or military, could be a crucial factor in Israel’s decision to target Iran directly. This support could embolden Israel in taking such a drastic step

**Russia's Involvement**

Russia, already in direct confrontation with the West, has been a key ally of Iran. If Israel attacks Iran, it could escalate tensions with Russia, pulling them more directly into the conflict. This involvement could be in various forms, ranging from diplomatic support to military aid for Iran.

**China's Potential Role**

China's global strategic interests, especially in the Middle East, cannot be overlooked. Their response to a conflict involving Iran would be critical, considering their energy needs and the Belt and Road Initiative. China might engage in diplomatic efforts to maintain regional stability or could be drawn into the conflict if their interests are threatened.

**The view to be challenged**

The crux of my view, and the aspect I’m most eager to have challenged, revolves around a global perspective. Regardless of how one perceives Israel’s role - whether as an actor in an existential war for its survival or otherwise - I pose this contentious question: Should Israel be stopped for the greater global good, irrespective of the costs?

This is a complex and morally challenging question. It weighs the national interests and security concerns of one nation against the potential for a larger, possibly global conflict. It’s a dilemma of prioritizing immediate regional stability versus long-term global peace.

What are your thoughts on this? Is the notion of stopping Israel, regardless of the consequences, a viable or necessary approach for maintaining global stability and peace? Or does it oversimplify a deeply intricate geopolitical situation?

**TL;DR**: I'm discussing Israel's recent aggressive military strategies, suggesting they might be preparing for a direct attack on Iran, potentially backed by the U.S. This could escalate into a broader conflict involving global powers like Russia and China. The controversial point for debate: Should the international community intervene to stop Israel for the sake of global stability, regardless of the interests of Israel? Looking for diverse viewpoints on this complex issue."

245,2024-01-08,CMV: Unrealized Gains Should not be Taxed,u/amortized-poultry,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/191lm0r/cmv_unrealized_gains_should_not_be_taxed/,changemyview,"I've seen a lot of posts related to Unrealized Gains and how billionaires don't pay taxes on them, despite having many billions/trillions of dollars in Unrealized Gains. A lot of people have responded to this by calling for Unrealized Gains to be taxed to ""close the loophole"" so to speak.

I disagree, and I am going to give two reasons why before I open up the floor to opinions in favor of such a tax.

1. Capital gains are calculated on virtually anything and everything if sold, per [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/tax topics/tc409). This includes your home and other personal items. To add a tax to Unrealized Gains in general would add a tremendous burden on basically anybody who owns property. This isn't a burden when only realized gains are taxed because you only need to make the calculation once, instead of once a year, and most people don't need to make a calculation at all for most things that might otherwise qualify. 

To CMV on this point, I would like to know how this burden would be reduced, especially for non-billionaires.

2. Capital gains are theoretical, and largely uncertain before they are realized. By dollar amount, most Unrealized Gains are likely in marketable securities such as stocks and bonds, so we have to consider whether the quoted value is actually what a person would get if they sold all their stocks at once. For most of us the answer is yes, but for billionaires in particular, the answer is going to be no, because of the quantity of shares involved.

As far as I'm aware, the price of a stock is quoted as the mid-point between the highest price someone is bidding without having a successful purchase yet, and the lowest point someone is asking for that has not been sold yet. In both cases, there is a limited and finite amount of shares that each person is willing to buy or sell. 

To give an extreme and probably unrealistic example of what this means, imagine someone is looking to buy 10 shares of a stock for $10, and someone is looking to sell 10 shares of a stock for $100. The stock would show a value of $55, despite the fact that no one is currently willing to pay that amount for it. Let's say someone needs a bunch of cash and decides to sell 100 shares at market price. The first 10 shares would be sold at $10. Let's say the next 10 shares were sold at $9, the 10 after that at $8, and so on until the last 10 are sold for $1.

Actual sale proceeds: $550.

Assumed value of the same shares under Unrealized Gains tax: $5,500. (100 shares * $55 quoted value).

It the average cost on those shares was $5.50. Actual gains would be $0.00, whereas Unrealized Gains would be $4,950.

As a result of this, I don't believe there is any way to tax unrealized gains (even if limited to billionaires) without massively destabilizing the markets.

To CMV on this point, I believe I'd have to see a rational method of calculating unrealized gains that can be universally applied and that does not have the pitfalls I mentioned. I suppose I would also be willing to CMV if shown that I'm mistaken about these pitfalls, but I'm not sure I'm expecting much on that front."

And now, with the advent of ChatGPT and the like, it's even more obvious.

I mean, today it's still in its infant stage, but I am sure that within the next 100 years at most we will have created a mind just as, if not more impressive than the human one. No God needed.

And I would say the human mind is way more complex and amazing than the body, which I am sure if we applied ourselves could also be created by humans, immune system and all.

And if those are true, who says the whole universe demands a God to exist. Maybe in 100 years we'll learn something new that will make us say, ""wow, it's not really that big of a deal. It's just math, science and logic, after all.""

1,2024-01-08,"CMV: If ""From the river to the sea"" is antisemitic, then so is virtually every pro-Palestine chant",u/GoSouthCourt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/191sgb2/cmv_if_from_the_river_to_the_sea_is_antisemitic/,changemyview,"The main reason people give for why ""From the river to the sea"" is antisemitic is that it appears in the [Hamas charter](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-2017-document-full):

> Hamas rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea. However, without compromising its rejection of the Zionist entity and without relinquishing any Palestinian rights, Hamas considers the establishment of a fully sovereign and independent Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital along the lines of the 4th of June 1967, with the return of the refugees and the displaced to their homes from which they were expelled, to be a formula of national consensus.

If the chant is antisemitic by virtue of association with Hamas, then every other pro-Palestine chant is too because practically all of them advocate for the same position - a free Palestine bounded by the Green Line and a liberation of Palestinians in Israel. 

Some other common justifications for why the chant is antisemitic are

* It's original translation is ""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be Arab/Islamic"". I agree that this version is antisemitic as it rejects the self-determination of Jews, but I cannot find any notable Palestinian organisations using this version or advocating this position.

* It was started by the PLO, which was an extremist organisation when they started chanting it. The thing is, nearly all the chants we hear can be associated with the PLO because they were the primary force for Palestinian liberation for decades. There is no difference between ""From the river to the sea"" and other chants in this regard, so if the former is antisemitic, the latter is as well.

I'd like to hear what makes this chant any different from chants like ""Free Free Palestine"" or ""No justice, No peace!"""

1,2024-01-08,"CMV: It's a bad idea to suggest a specific idea for a date/hangout, especially if you don't know the other person well.",u/CEO_Of_Rejection_99,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/191v0d5/cmv_its_a_bad_idea_to_suggest_a_specific_idea_for/,changemyview,"I listen to a lot of creepypasta stories/scary stories, and often the author mentions a specific activity with their friends/partner, such as getting drinks, staying at each other's houses, etc. However, I am very hesitant to mention such specific activities and instead just a generic lunch/coffee. This is for a few reasons.

I feel that I would be boxing the other person in by suggesting the activity. What if they don't want to do the activity? Then I fear they will deny the entire offer to hangout, rather than still offering to hang out but wanting to do a different activity. What if they don't want to, say, go swimming at the pool, or be in someone else's apartment to play board games? I fear that will give people the following impression: ""Hey! CEO_Of_Rejection wants me to do THIS SPECIFIC ACTIVITY instead of what I want to do! He's boxing me in!!!"" This leads me to my next point:

I fear that some of my preferred activities would be too logistically challenging for the other person and myself. What if I want to suggest swimming? It requires more logistical roadblocks to overcome than lunch. The other person has necessary materials to prepare (bring a bathing suit, change of clothes, sunscreen, towel, etc.) on top of having to change into different outfits. That's a lot of logistics! If it's a trip to the beach/local springs/lake/river/etc., that means a way of somehow getting to the destination (I don't have a car of my own), on top of the usual materials you have to prepare (swimwear, change of clothes, etc.) as well as signing any forms/money for the fee to enter the destination. If I want to go to a theme park, I need a way to go to the theme park (and possibly getting stuck in traffic on the highway in the process), prepare changes of clothes, and shell out lots of money for expensive theme park tickets. What if people are unwilling to go through all of that? And for what, getting to know one another? I feel that literally anything other than a lunch/coffee at a typical food place would be too logistically complicated. Even if the other person does say yes, there could be a logistical oversight/lack of communication that causes the entire carefully planned process to break down.

This may sound silly, but why shell through lots of money and time for... getting to know someone better? Something I could do when I see them in my classes/clubs/organizations?

Another fear that's keeping me from planning these hangouts (I know this may be loosely related) is... who to invite. Let's say I have 10 friends, and I want to have a group hangout. I can't bring all 10 because that's too many, so I invite friends 1, 2, 3, and 4. But why these four specifically? Why not any of friends 5-10? what if I hear 5 complaining that I didn't invite them? Well, as much as I might like friend 5, I might be leaning more towards friends 1-4, albeit by a very slim margin. Now let's say I like friend 6 and want to pursue a relationship with them, so I invite them to coffee. What if friend 6 complains: ""CEO_Of_Rejection has 10 friends, so why the hell did he choose ME if he could have chosen the other nine?"" Or what if friend 5, or friend 7 come around and suspect I like friend 6 and want to pursue a relationship with them, and either act all pissy about it or try to play with my feelings? I really disliked it when people excluded me from activities at an early age and I don't want to become any of the people who excluded me, so I simply resorting to not planning any activities at all that may include some people and exclude others.

I also don't feel qualified enough to organize these outings. Lack of a car aside (which limits my options for mobility), I've also struggled with forming connections and therefore don't have much of a motive to organize such activities such as beach/springs trips, dinners, and sleepovers. I've also never had a girlfriend, so I don't feel qualified to take any girl out on fancy dinner dates and the like.

An experience that has scared me away from planning such outings comes to mind: A few years ago some classmates of mine told me about a beach trip they were planning during spring break and even showed me where they would be staying. I assumed this was an invitation, so I asked my parents to drive to our beach house there. I them messaged them trying to organize a meetup, but they never responded. Since then I didn't feel that it was worth trying to plan such events.

This is why I usually just resort to a generic lunch/coffee and literally just saying ""hang out"" if I want to hang out with the other person. They require very little time preparation, logistics, and time commitment, and therefore little to no logistical oversights. Literally all we have to do is set aside an hour or two of time, go to said food place, order, and eat.

Here's why I'm changing this view: I feel that a lot of my friends are planning things that are more than just lunches. People dressing up together for Halloween. One of my friends got married (and had to shell out thousands for the wedding) and I think is going to another country with her new husband for a honeymoon. I want to expand my options for a friendly hangout/date that is more than a simple lunch/coffee while also not carrying too much pressure on another person.

If Congress held a secret act of Congress while they all dressed in dark robes and signed the bill to make wearing baseball hats illegal and didn't bother to publish it and they waited until after they had a bunch of video on tape wearing baseball hats and published the law and then the retroactively arrested all these people who wore hats after the date of the signing people would be up in arms rightfully because these people could not have reasonably known about the law.



Problem is is that there is no way to actually separate the above scenario from everyday scenario is where the law has actually been published this is because the law is massive.


In order for a defender of the ignorance of the law is no excuse position to get off the ground with his claim he would have to show that it's reasonable to insist that everyone have the same level of law knowledge is as lawyer.


Even then it's actually worse for the ignorance of the law is no excuse party because lawyers tend to specialize.


There are very few if any lawyers who literally know the whole of the law and are equally skilled in all departments.

The traditional excuse for the ignorance is no excuse people is to say that if ignorance of the law were allowed as a defense people could be willfully ignorant.

But I answer back so what?


The things that matter you could not possibly be ignorant of like murder.


No one could possibly think to themselves I'm feeling a little bit peckish I better kill and eat the next human I see because it's intuitively obvious that if everyone was allowed to just kill anyone for any reason nobody would be safe and that someone would band together to prevent this from happening.




Similarly simple cases of straightforward theft you could not be plausibly ignorant of.


I can't just steal your stuff and make it mine for the jollies.



The only things that you would be plausibly having to worry about people being ignorant of are things that are very obscure in the first place and would not likely have a high chance of occurring.


For example if you can't kill an eagle to protect your dog it's quite possible that you don't realize this as this is an exception to wild animal rules.


How often does this happen that I get the opportunity to shoot a bald eagle because it's attacking my dog?



Moreover it would not be an unreasonable requirement that's nigh and possible to prove for a prosecutor to begin prosecuting people for crimes they're claiming to be ignorant of.


For example:

""I didn't know speeding was illegal.""


Lawyer  ""According to your report card from high school you took a driver's ed class""

""I must have been asleep""

Lawyer ""speeding would have been addressed continuously throughout that class and the idea that you somehow managed to sleep at exactly the right time every day is implausible you're guilty as heck""


Lastly I think the final reason that should be formalized that ignorance of the law should be allowed as a defense is it kind of already is at least if you're a police officer.


Police officers don't get prosecuted for kidnapping if they invent a law by accident.

For example:

If a police officer arrest someone for ""holding a boxing event without a permit""and that law is actually about punching people for sport and the person being arrested was actually holding a boxing event in the sense that it was a competition to put objects in boxes that officer has arrested someone on the basis of a law that literally does not exist.


And yet he's considered unprosecutable precisely because of his honest mistake."

Unfortunately, they have a platform for their hate and have large scale support in their hateful analogy. 

The defenders of this view I assume would say well there are 20k dead in Gaza. But waging a retaliation war is very different to systematically putting an ethnic group in the gas chambers while trying to conquer the continent.

This notion of an illegitimate president is more on our mind's as Americans than ever.

Now, Donald Trump is under a criminal investigation that his party deems unjust. From this scenario alone, I do not see how either party will concede the election. Once the election happens, Donald Trump and his followers will claim it was a rigged election like the last one and will confidently stand their ground that they hold the majority of ""valid"" votes. Meanwhile, Joe Biden will claim that Trump is a criminal who has no right to run for presidency and was taken of the ballot of many states, thus he would be a criminal president. 

to put it simply I am very worried and concerned about this. in either case, people will take to the streets to fight for their president who they think was legitimately elected and would despise the criminal that the opposing party fights for. I would be interested in an open discussion about this, is this something you are concerned about? Do you think one side might be easier to concede than the other? What would you do if the man that you personally thought was legally a criminal was elected as president of the united states? Is one side just gonna suck it up and go about their day, or will they not be able to put up with it any longer after the last 2 elections? if anyone has unique insights on this or just some personal thoughts I would be more than interested in hearing them.

It’s just a load of caffeine and other supplements/chemicals that some gym goers use because they can’t get motivated otherwise. There’s no actual reason to take pre workout outside of being more likely to have to shit because of the caffeine content.

EDIT: I’ll concede that some things just simply ~work~ for people, and pre workout is one of those things. Consider my view changed. If it works, it works. I never intended to shit on people for using it and I apologize if my post came across that way."

67,2024-01-08,CMV: Beyond Scared Straight was the worst troubled teen prevention program and should never been on TV,u/Kpatmckenzie,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/191z1nh/cmv_beyond_scared_straight_was_the_worst_troubled/,changemyview,"Some of you may have heard of the TV Beyond Scared Straight for those who’ve never heard of the show I’ll explain what is it about. Basically it was a show where bad kids or troubled teens would be sent to their local prison by their parents. On the prison they would see the harsh realities of the prison life where they’d meet inmates and guards in hopes that It would guide them to a better path. 

While the goal is noble the execution is just downright Abhorrent and I will explain why. Basically the majority of ‘at risk teens’ who go to the correctional facilities aren’t even that bad. Their actions are completely blown out of proportion by their parents and the show to make them seem they are the scum of the earth. There was a child named Shaun aged 14 and was sent to the scared straight program because he was fighting and getting suspended in school. That’s actually very mild compared to actual teens who are committing crimes, many of the children who went on the show need proper guidance. 

Another reason why I think the show is bad is because the guards and inmates tend to act like complete bullies to the children. They tend to get in their faces, scream, shout and get physical to them and if pushed the kids will fight back. There was an instance where a female guard straight up told a girl to hit if she wanted to and the girl hit attempted it. So in response the girl was swarmed by multiple guards and she’s arrested but let back on the show.

In addition to this Beyond Scared Straight can be quite traumatising for some of the teens as guards and inmates are verbally abusing the children and being shown the harsh realities it could leave them scared for years to come."

Thor Love and thunder Ant Man Quanamanium and Secret Invasion really destroyed the general audiences desire to see more marvel movies. 

I also don't the Marvels is a particularly ""woke"" movie sure the leads are all women and the villain is a woman but does it have a feminist message or anything particularly to say about the female experience? 

Not really maybe there is that line about ""black girl magic"" but other than that nothing in the movie seemed very offensive to the average male movie goer.

If you contrast that with Barbie that has a explicitly feminist message and said the word ""patriarchy"" which obviously should turn off antifeminist viewers despite all that it was a success.

Now I see disney hiring a basically unknown female feminist female director to make a new star wars movie and I can't help but think they are trying to copy barbies success. Who knows maybe it will fail but I don't think disney is going to blame female leads or minorites for its failures.

1,2024-01-08,CMV: Mass Market Marijuana Advertisements Should not be Legal.,u/PuritanSettler1620,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/191zrbj/cmv_mass_market_marijuana_advertisements_should/,changemyview,"Marijuana was recently legalized in Massachusetts, where I live, and has also been recently legalized in in increasing number of other states across the United States, and around the world. What has frustrated me most about its legalization has been the sudden ubiquity of advertisements for marijuana across the state. From billboards to radio to posters on trash cans suddenly these ads are everywhere and inescapable. 

I am sure the people running these marijuana companies know what they are doing and as such as I am sure these ads work to some extent. This troubles me because I do not feel marijuana and the industry around it are particularly beneficial to our society. 

When legalization was sold to the public the main argument, I heard was that legalizing the marijuana industry would allow existing the existing marijuana industry to become subject to legal regulations and taxed, preventing many of the harmful effects of the war on drugs which had failed to prevent the proliferation of marijuana in any real way.  While I am receptive to that argument and feel it has merit, I worry this advertising blitz could in fact expand the marijuana industry to new customers and make it more difficult for those attempting to quit to do so. 

The effective ban on mass market advertisements for cigarettes was a historic success reducing smoking levels [from around 40% to 10%](https://news.gallup.com/poll/509720/cigarette-smoking-rate-steady-near-historical-low.aspx). A clear triumph for public health and societal wellbeing. I worry by allowing marijuana to be advertised so heavily another public health issue could be created.

Marijuana when smoked can due serious harm to the [respiratory system](https://www.wsj.com/articles/marijuana-may-hurt-smokers-more-than-cigarettes-alone-11668517007?mod=hp_lead_pos11), and marijuana is linked to [developmental issues](https://www.cdc.gov/marijuana/health-effects/brain-health.html), [increased risk of schizophrenia](https://psychcentral.com/schizophrenia/link-between-cannabis-and-schizophrenia), and [increased vehicle deaths.](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/06/health/marijuana-traffic-accidents-wellness/index.html) Further, by creating another great vice industry I worry it will be another case of large corporations preying on the addictions of the economically disadvantaged for enormous personal gain. 

Marijuana's harmful effects are often compared to alcohols, and I feel this comparison is apt. However, I feel the ubiquity of alcohol advertising is also harmful.

While I will admit the war on drugs did not accomplish its goals and caused significant harm I feel there is no reason marijuana advertisements should be permitted, though I have not heard any arguments on this subject so I could be convinced if I were to hear something especially persuasive. "

Probably the biggest point resides in the ""Male Loneliness Epidemic."" It's pretty common knowledge now that more men are lonely and a higher percentage aren't having sex or engaging in dating than previous generations.

First of all, if you actually look at the statistics, women's loneliness levels are also skyrocketing. So already, an issue that seems to be affecting both sexes, the majority or even all of its burden and blame are being placed on men.

Feminists and left-leaning people will argue that the reason men are lonely is because women are now more liberated, and do not have to tolerate poor behavior from men they previously had to. I find this interesting on multiple fronts, which I'd like to explain further:  
1.	We know this loneliness issue is affecting both men and women (some statistics are showing women are being affected even worse), so why then are women lonely? Are they also engaging in poor behavior and treating men like shit? I doubt it, and I doubt that any feminist would agree either. The reality is societal issues at large are what is preventing either sex from engaging with one another.  
2.	But let's follow up on this further, because many people genuinely believe (regardless of being feminist or left-leaning) that lonely people are that way because they DESERVE to be, which is really the ultimate point feminists and liberals are getting at: men are more lonely now because they DESERVE to be. 

This belief, which is inherently rooted in fundamental attribution error to begin with, (you can look it up) has caused the groups of people who feel this way to say things like ""Hey Relative\_Injury\_7724, you're only lonely because you watch Andrew Tate."" Yeah sure, use a guy who's not even that popular to explain why me and the other large percentage of men are lonely, makes perfect sense. Never watched a video of that guy in my life.

""Hey Relative\_Injury\_7724, you're only lonely because you probably treat women like shit, or view them for only sex, or don't think they should have rights."" I've had a loving relationship with my mother my whole life, never voted for the big orange dumbass, and as a budding physician, I don't appreciate the assumption that I would ever be against women's freedom, including medical.   
So it's obvious leftism, feminism, and anyone who believes being lonely is 100% due to a person's own defect in character, are not adequate places for men to turn to in our society. I'll tell you I'm lonely, I'll ask for help, and all you people will do is compare me to an andrew tate watcher or assume I'm an incel. All nuance left the left a long time ago I guess.  
  


  
But wait, does that mean I can now turn to the other side of society, conservatives and the right, for help with me issues? NO, lmaoo, absolutely the fuck I can't! Because this side of society has just as much contempt and just as much hatred for young men in my position. 

""Hey Relative\_Injury\_7724, you're only lonely because you chose to put yourself in debt by becoming a doctor, and as a conservative I think anyone who takes out any kind of debt at all is fucking stupid."" Sure, so I should've just given up on my dreams of becoming a doctor just to make money and get laid, that makes perfect sense. How about designing a society where anybody can pursue becoming a healthcare professional without crippling them for 8 years as a result? Just a thought. Seems like this is just an excuse to say you don't believe poor people should become doctors, which is a laughable belief.

Or they'll go ""Hey Relative\_Injury\_7724, you're only lonely because you aren't based or redpilled enough, you should've spent your youth looksmaxxing and going on as many dates as possible instead of studying to become a doctor."" Genuinely I don’t understand this argument. I should have not needed to make myself an accessory to women to not be lonely. I should’ve been able to be my own person, and pursue what I wanted to pursue in life, and not be told “Fuck you for pursuing that, you should’ve been dedicating all your attention on women instead.” Again, when you break it down, it’s an utterly ridiculous argument.

&#x200B;

  
What I am seeing is this: You have a bunch of young men who were all told the same things. To work hard, to pay attention in school, to go to college, to be a good person, to treat women with respect, to believe in ourselves and our capabilities, and to love ourselves. Like me, we were told this would be good enough for love, this would be good enough for a house and nice things, and that this would be good enough for stability and happiness, only to find out later in life in our 20s, when we are expected to have all this stuff, that no, actually, it’s not good enough at all. We should’ve just magically known better despite being raised to think this way our whole childhood and adolescence.

It's ridiculous to me, and I already know the #1 response I’m going to get is “you aren’t entitled to anyone’s love,” as if that was ever my argument. Society was also never entitled to lying to be about what actually mattered. Society was never entitled to teaching me to be a good person and to love myself only for that not to matter. Society was not entitled to convincing me I’d be fine if I worked hard to become a doctor because that’s any accomplishment, only for me to be terrified for the next 10 years of my life how I’m going to be able to afford anything on a Resident’s salary. At least I have some future to look forward to as a doctor, maybe, but imagine all the other men in my boat stuck in a 9-5, or unable to move upwards socially because of their circumstances, or who got a college degree and still can’t find a job. They have even more reason to be angry and upset for society perpetuating that big lie, than I do. 

When you have a large group of men, and women, who are incredibly lonely and not well-off, after doing everything right, after doing everything that society told us to do, what reason do we have to think this is our fault? What reason do we have to think this isn’t society’s issue to blame?  
  
You blame us for being lonely, when there was a global pandemic just a few years ago.

You blame us for being lonely, when we had to deal with Donald Trump for 4 years and a conveyor belt thereafter of incompetent immoral politicians as our country’s leadership.

You blame us for being lonely, when we can’t afford anything, whether we’re working a 9-5 or studying to be a doctor.   
  
You blame us for being lonely, then do shit like ban abortion to try to save your declining birthrates.  
  
How can you not fucking see the problem isn’t us, it’s the environment I’m expected to maintain and keep perpetuating, it’s society’s for ever thinking any of these fucking issues were my burden to bare, it’s society’s for teaching me one thing, and then berating me and calling me worthless when that one thing doesn’t get me what I’m expected to have.

Having children is the most selfish thing a person can do. The only reason to have a child is for your own selfish happiness.  
I know this belief is rather extreme and even edgy, but as a person who grew up in a Christian household the fear that hell exists is very strong in my mind, even if I don't actively believe in Christianity. By Christian standards it is pretty much impossible not to go to hell, and so when you have a child you have to put them through life knowing there is the possibility that they will go to hell. Of course this might be a little nonsensical especially if you're a Christian since you believe you are destined to go to heaven. Aside from the theological debate, I still think it is pretty selfish to have a child since it's pretty much impossible to be a perfect parent. And I understand you don't have to be, but I feel like when you bring a person into this world it is your responsibility to give everything possible to them.  
  
My mental health hasn't been in a good place for a while, so this might be a bit biased. But I truly have never had a moment that has made me feel glad to be alive. I feel as though a moment like that is impossible when you think whether that moment is worth going to hell for. Aside from that I don't really think its possible to truly be happy for most people. You spend most of your life working and it seems like most marriages are unhappy. It might be because I am not able to feel happiness right now (I'm working on it with my psychiatrist) but I can't imagine a world where I'll selfishly condone a child to existence for my own satisfaction."

Muslims as a group are extremely homophobic. They also repress religious freedom as many Muslim nations have laws against blasphemy and apostasy, and support the genocide of Jewish people via the eradication of the Israeli state. Islam is an extremely dangerous religion and dislike of it is extremely valid and rational, thus making Islamophobia as a concept not real."

If anything, the upbringing that they raised their kids was even more focused on instilling a certain message or agenda of the parents' preference in the kids' minds than anything the schools did.

While it could be, there’s no reason why we should assume this. If anything, it’s incel-ish to assume that any short guy can just “overcome” their height and find a partner. Some people will just likely never find partners in life. That’s the reality. We know that women very often refuse to date men shorter than them, which is their right, but that’s also the reason short men can’t find dates, not because of their “personality.”

I also agree that short men should do the things that we tell everyone to do, such as going out, being social, and just generally being a fun person to be around. But it’s not like they’ll get dates because of it; rather it’s for their own self enrichment and because being a fun person is a good thing whether you can find that person or not. 

The one “tip” I think is acceptable is that if you’re at the taller end of the height range in the OP, then it’s reasonable to maybe ask someone to consider moving to an area with shorter women within their country. Outside of that, let’s try to stop gaslighting short men into thinking their dating problems are their fault and accept that it is simply a result of standing eye to eye with the likes of Bruno Mars, Kevin Hart, and in more extreme cases Danny DeVito."

And one of my biggest pet peeves on both sides is how they justify their policy goals with rare/fringe cases. In the case of the left, they use the cases of preteen girls being raped and having to travel for abortions to induce emotions to stir up support for what they actually want, which is abortion available on demand up to birth. Of course, most people tend to lean against abortion on demand (or at the very least, think it's morally wrong), so leftists very rarely ever openly advocate for abortion on demand. They have to keep winning over moderates, and to do that, they have to invoke emotions and make their policy seem like the safer bet. In the case of the right, they use the rare cases of drag queens sexually harassing underage minors, or rare cases of kids undergoing sex change medication or surgery. The actual thing they're fighting is the LGBTQ community in general, but they know that being blatant about it will alienate moderate voters. So they use extreme cases which acts as a dog whistle for their socially conservative base.

 I could go on and on about examples, but you get the point. Instead of arguing on core policy, both sides are playing proxy war with fringe cases. I believe this is disingenuous but also morally wrong. Stop using victims of unfortunate and life changing circumstances to advance your agenda which reaches far beyond the narrow circumstance you're invoking.

1,2024-01-08,CMV: Apologies are pointless in the eyes of today's society— Both the person apologizing and the person receiving hold no value for apologies.,u/Arya-Ender,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1922rxc/cmv_apologies_are_pointless_in_the_eyes_of_todays/,changemyview,"When we are young, we are taught to apologize when we have wronged or hurt someone. As a child, we are expected to accept the apology and move on. As we get older, we learn that you don't always have to forgive someone when you recieve an apology— Something that every person has the right to.

I've been on both ends— The receiver and the apologizer, and I've grown to realize that apologies are pointless. People nowadays don't hold any value for apologies. That's not to say they are the one and only solution to fixing a problem, because it certainly is not. Apologies are meant to repair what damage it can, and the rest is fixed depending on how much the person you hurt wants to be fixed between you two.

I'll address what people usually think of first when they talk about apologizing— Some people aren't genuine when they apologize and only do so for selfish reasons. An apology itself should be selfless and not about you. At some point, people decided that apologies were going to be used as the easy way out because they think it would fix everything. There are people who send apologies that are shallow and almost ""force"" the affected person(s) to respond or accept. Sometimes they aren't even apologizing at all and are downright blaming the people they have hurt. The person apologizing obviously places no value in it. It's just for self gain at that point. They don't know how to put aside their ego to actually be remorseful or empathetic. If you badly want it to help fix at least a tiny portion of the situation that occurred, mean it. How hard is it to lower your pride, suck it up, and just hey— ""Hey, I'm sorry for hurting you"" without any clutter and excuses also being thrown into the mix. How hard is it for people to just acknowledge they are wrong? It's no surprise that apologies are rendered as useless for those affected— Completely, utterly useless and even more painful to the person receiving the apology.

But it goes both ways— Because of people like that, people who genuinely are sorry about things they have done cannot apologize properly because people are quick to dismiss their apology as selfish and ingenuine. Again, people have every right not to accept an apology. However, people tend to think a certain way when they've been wronged— If they do not recieve an apology, they think the person isn't sorry or remorseful. However, if an apology is given, they will criticize it instead of accepting it. I will reiterate again, people have every right to reject an apology. But why be so bent up on expecting one if you're not even going to accept it at all? Or if you're just going to criticize it and accuse the person of ingenuity? If you aren't satisfied with it, let the person know. Work it out from there, but spreading it around for other people to see just because you don't like it isn't it.You either accept or don't— If you want to criticize the person, keep it to yourself.

I understand that it can be difficult for people to determine what's genuine and what's not. I understand if people don't want to forgive because they have been hurt so much. I am aware some people genuinely think they are right about certain arguments. In my opinion, apologies can be effective if we learn to properly communicate with one another and become less selfish and more empathetic. But if we can't strive for any of that, an apology will continue to be pointless.

Because neither the person apologizing or the person receiving the apology hold any value for them.

For those of you who do think apologies hold value, please help me understand why!

TL;DR: Apologies hold no value or the person apologizing and/or the person receiving the apology. People are selfish and only apologize to make themselves feel better or use it as an easy fix. On the other hand, people who demand an apology may also simultaneously criticize people of ingenuity, even if they apologize with the best of intentions. Because neither side can compromise, apologies are practically pointless."

There are flight logs of passengers on Epstein's private plane and there are court transcripts of lawsuits involving Epstein and associates. The flight logs are the more incriminating of the two.

[Bill Clinton and Donald Trump used the plane for travel, but not to the island.](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-flights-jeffrey-epstein-jet-lolita-express-1857109) It seems more likely they were involved in garden variety corruption, accepting free trips from Epstein in exchange for favors or to meet with wealthy donors.

Names mentioned in the court documents are just that: mentions. It doesn't mean they were a plaintiff or defendant or witness. You can't conclude anything at all from a name simply appearing. You'd have to read the details to understand how they were involved, if at all. George Lucas was only mentioned in [a question to which the answer was no](https://nypost.com/2024/01/04/news/all-the-a-listers-named-in-the-new-jeffrey-epstein-documents/).

That honesty would also cause issues in pre existing relationships and that could snowball into admitting potentially insecurities and validation seeking behavior.

Obviously there are genuine creeps who make people feel uneasy when they approach or look at them because of what they're wearing. But I think the none creepy attention and interactions feed into the want to dress or act a certain way. 

That same picture of an outfit that showed extra skin is now a dating profile picture with certain body parts more exposed because it attracts attention from the general mass which can then be widdled down to the actual attention the person was looking for.

I do believe that there are some who wear what they want just for their own vanity. But I think more people do it for attention than really admit it.

Israel Announces 'Complete Siege' of Gaza: No Electricity, Food, Water https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-gallant-announces-complete-siege-gaza-no-electricity-food-fuel-2023-10?amp

For a population of 2.3 million

Standard of evidence: **reasonable basis to believe**

Criminal code:

In 1948, the United Nations Genocide Convention defined genocide as any of five ""acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". These five acts were: killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, **imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group,** preventing births, and forcibly transferring children out of the group. Victims are targeted because of their real or perceived membership of a group, not randomly.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant says he has ordered a **“complete siege**” of the Gaza Strip, as Israel fights the Hamas terror group.

“I have ordered a **complete siege** on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,” Gallant says following an assessment at the IDF Southern Command in Beersheba.

“We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly, human animals will be treated accordingly. There will be no electricity and no water, there will be only destruction.”

Who are the “human animals?”

Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Rabbi Eli Ben Dahan: (2013) Palestinians ""are beasts, they are not human.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Israel's Arab neighbors: (2016) ""We must defend ourselves against the wild beasts.""

Israeli PM: Bennett, said “I’ve killed lots of Arabs in my life – and there’s no problem with that""

Note the members of the war cabinet spouting off genocidal intentions. 

Naftali Bennett in an interview 'we were here when you were still swinging on trees' - he referred to Arabs as monkeys.""

Who decides? The ICC? No, 

Nope, they’re there to prosecute individuals for their role in atrocities, not play referee in international affairs. 

So who?

The ICJ, the UN’s highest court. 

Craig Mokhiber Top UN Human Rights lawyer and:

**”textbook case of genocide”**

>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has once again sounded the alarm on the dire humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip, lamenting that four out of “five of the hungriest people anywhere in the world are in Gaza.”

What do the academics have to say?

Omer Bartov is an Israeli-born historian. He is the Samuel Pisar Professor of Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Brown University

“**Clear Intention of Ethnic Cleansing""**

Ernesto Verdeja the executive director of the Institute for the Study of Genocide and Notre Dame professor

“I think there’s no doubt the IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) have carried out widespread war crimes and crimes against humanity. I think it is very difficult to take seriously the IDF’s claim of considering **proportionality**. I think a lot of it hinges on things like indiscriminate bombing and air strikes, the fact that they put Gaza under siege, restricting access to food to water to electricity, medical aid. That they’ve used weapons that are banned in international law.”

Raz Segal, associate professor of holocaust and genocide studies at Stockton University in New Jersey, said there are ""dozens of pieces of evidence that show intent to destroy,"" per the UN convention.

""Israeli leaders and senior army officers have done exactly what they said. So Gaza today, particularly the north but not only the north, is rubble,"" said Segal.

""We're talking about, indeed, conditions calculated to bring about the destruction of the group.""

Now, you're probably wondering what makes me have any right to say this. The fact is, I'm currently attending high school. I have multiple points that go beyond the idea that school teaches you stuff that isn't helpful.

Firstly, the man who first made homework, Roberto Nevelis, originally created it as a punishment for students who wouldn't listen in his lectures. Nowadays, this punishment has become a normal day practice.

Secondly, it is rumored that Frederick J. Kelly, the creator of standardized testing, said it is too cruel to be used and should be abandoned. If the creator of something is telling you how awful it is, that should be a clear sign that something is wrong.

Lastly, the most commonly stated but most true point is that school treats every student the same. They treat every student as if they learn the exact same way, ignoring their uniqueness. Some classes claim you are original, yet they teach the same thing for every class and every student.

In my personal account with my school, they may say they like creativity, but most of our creative programs lose funding so they can fund football. That is my biggest problem."

I'm not convinced that constantly talking about our feelings is actually good for us, individually or socially. It feels like we're slowly creating a society of neurotic crybabies that cease to function when confronted with the most minor of challenges.

People need to be robust, especially nowadays when life can be uncertain. By all means, it's great to explore your own psychology and to understand what makes you tick, for better and for worse, but don't end up held hostage to it."

But personally i think that after a few hundred years humanity would be better off 

The reason I bring this up is the fact that the population is getting to big for the planet and I suppose you could argue that the planet cold hold x amount of people but I have a question for you if there is for example 3 times the amount of humans on earth how would quality of life be affected. You might argue by then we will have more infrastructure but what various quality of life things we take for granted for example cows we would need three times the cows do you know how that would affect the planet realistically a lot of products such as meat and other animal byproducts would be far more expensive not to mention various vegan substitutes that are far more inefficient to produce such as almond milk and other such things

My point is not really some people have better genes than others but more that children should be a privilege and that if you want one you should meet certain conditions such as a stable healthy mind no genetic defects and a stable income.

Hell the entire reason i bring this up is from looking at the quality of life in the 40k universe and even in Star Wars imagine living in some city where you don’t even see the sun eating the same rations everyday for your whole life doesn’t sound pleasant does it.

Realistically I know that no nation could enforce these policies or want to for various reasons such as protests smaller population means less soldiers but still I just can’t help but worry about the path humanity is going down I mean hell I remember  hearing stories about guys who dropped out of high school to work at a gas station and they bought their own house nowadays you would have to work for decades if you wanted to do that."

The culture of dating apps has established itself in such a way that men have arisen as the unequivocal losers in this game, basically like playing a football game where you start being down by multiple scores and it's already the final quarter of the game. 

We all know the statistics: men get about [1 or 2 matches a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/11btxok/men_how_many_matches_do_you_get_a_day/?rdt=52564), across all dating apps. That's going to be roughly equal to the number of LIKES they get since most men are liking the vast majority of profiles they see, a strategy they are probably justified in using since there's no point in being selective with so little working in one's favor. Women, on the other hand, get [hundreds of likes a month](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/163amr9/how_many_matches_for_women/?rdt=42121), all of which can translate into a match if they so choose. If I conservatively pick the number as 200 matches a month, that means women are having ONE HUNDRED TIMES THE SUCCESS THAT MEN ARE HAVING. One. Hundred.

That's clearly a losing game for men. So why should we continue to participate? Clearly it is in the best interests of men to collectively agree to stop using dating apps, to delete each and every one of them from our phones and, I dunno, at the very least force us to meet people the old-fashioned way, by meeting people at bars, getting set up with a friend of a friend, asking out your cute coworker, etc. These options are all on the table right now, obviously, but a lot of women aren't even leaving themselves open to the opportunity because they know they've got their ace-in-the-hole on a dating app somewhere. So why risk things with your coworker or do the socially awkward thing of approaching that dude at the bar when you can just rely on these dating apps to do the guesswork for you on whether the dude is even available and if he's interested in you?

It's a losing game for men and we men should collectively agree to stop using dating apps completely. Keep in mind that my viewpoint is not so concerned with how FEASIBLE it is to suddenly get all men to stop using dating apps; it's more about what I think would happen if we could snap our fingers and make it happen. But also, I don't consider it to be completely NON-feasible, since generally it is easier to not do something than it is to do something, right? If I can do my part to do my fellow men a favor, of course I will do that, and I think this move right here is in our best interests.

They were absolutely brutal against the Chinese community, massacring tens of thousands of us, torturing more, and forcing women and girls into sex labour. I recall talking to my grandaunts and granduncles about the 3 years and 8 months the Japanese were here and they still hold a significant disdain towards Japan and Japanese even today. They would sometimes refuse to buy a product just because it's Japanese, or not welcome Japanese guests to their house. I think that this sentiment is fairly common amongst many East Asians and South East Asians elders, especially Chinese and Koreans. I found myself empathizing with her position, even though I firmly believe that bigotry is morally wrong.

I also recently came across Mia Schem's interview, a hostage captured by Hamas and now free. She said, ""There are no innocent civilians in Gaza"". My first response was disgust at another attempt at dehumanisation, but I realised that she was sexually assaulted while in captivity, and that traumatic experience is what shaped her comments. It will, of course, be different if an Israeli politician says the same thing, because that rhetoric will likely be used to inflict further violence on Palestinians.

I came to realise that when someone has gone through something traumatic, it's unreasonable to expect them to assess a situation rationally. A Titanic survivor may think that ships are never safe to board again. We know it's untrue but we can't blame them for thinking that way. Similarly, we can hold the position that bigotry is immoral in a vacuum and not blame those who have undergone extreme trauma for being bigoted.

There are, of course, boundaries. While bigotry can be justified, violence in the name of bigotry is not. If Mia Schem stabs an Israeli Arab, that's just as wrong as a racist stabbing someone else. My grandaunts can't just punch every Japanese she sees just because of what their country did to her 80 years ago."

This is also what the US government has said in the UN- Hamas needs to go even if it means civilian suffering to ensure a new reality for both sides.

But then I read that there are almost a million settlers in the West Bank, a territory that is not Hamas but under a Palestinian Authority. Settlements are violations of international law and in this particular case they have no way to justify it. 

Concerningly, the rhetoric about Israel removing Hamas for a better reality on both sides doesn't make sense because Israel has not withdrawn its settlers from the West Bank so that they can facilitate a Palestinian state the moment Hamas has been booted. 

Like, there is no active conflict in the West Bank, why are they not withdrawing the settlers? This just invalidates any claim of removing Hamas being good for the Palestinians that the US have tried to push. They cannot both be removing Hamas on the Gaza side and then not removing the settlers on the West Bank side. 

I realize I may be missing something because it doesn't make sense for the settlers to both seemingly violate international law yet still not be removed or initiate the peace process at least there, so CMV. "

Free Will here refers to the predominant, protestant understanding of Free Will being ""the capacity to act in accordance with one's desires"" as I am arguing against a theodicy primarily held by protestant Christians (though there are also Catholics and Orthodox theologians who agree with the theodicy). This is the definition given by Martin Luther, Aquinas, Augustine, and many more that is subscribed to by *most* Christians, and by *nearly all* adherents to the Free Will Theodicy.

Theodicy is the attempt to reconcile an pan-omnic creator God with the existence of suffering and evil. Evil then refers to the collection of all moral and natural evils in this world. Moral evil refers to any human caused, chosen action that violates an established ethical principle that is accepted as true by the Moral Agent. Finally, Moral Agent refers to any sapient creature capable of understanding morality and the moral weight of their actions.

Now then, to analyse the Free Will Theodicy we must first *know* the argument. So what is the Free Will Theodicy. Simply put it is the argument that evil and suffering exists as a consequence of human Free Will and that God, as a moral proscription upon himself, will not violate human Free Will. Therefore, evil exists and continues to exist. You might already notice one of the many flaws in this argument in that it ignores entirely the existence of natural evils—those uncaused by human action. In addition it suggests that Adam and Eve were the first to commit a moral evil, a stance which I believe to be indefensible. Lastly, and most vitally, it ignores the capacity of God to create a world without evil without violating his moral proscription against interfering with Free Will under the definition of Free Will posed by theologians who defend this theodicy.

Now to address natural evils we, as a collective society, generally agree certain natural occurrences are bad and cause suffering and others are good and being joy. For example, nobody chooses to get cancer—least of all children—yet childhood cancer is still a horrible and saddening issue that affects us. No woman chooses to have a stillborn child or to be born incapable of bearing children (even if some women will not desire children or choose to adopt) yet these too still occur. Even greater still no city desires to be razed to the ground by a tornado or an earthquake, no man decides to die by a bird destroying a jets engine or lightning striking them as they run for shelter from the storm yet still these too happen. These are evils that do not occur because of the choices of Moral Agents. It is not the cause of Free Will and while there may exist a theodicy that addresses these things, Free Will does not.

Secondly, it assumes the moral culpability of Adam and Eve. They ate of the fruit and for doing so God punishes a creature for a violation of a clear moral proscription that he gave but—and this is central to the theodicy—does he punish them justly? Adam and Eve ate from the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil things and God himself laments this choice saying ""Behold! They have become like one of us **knowing of both good and evil!** What then should they eat of the Tree of Life?"" This is the central justification given by God himself for his punishment of the two humans. An acknowledgement that before eating of the fruit they were Non-Moral Agents and a *fear* that they should attain immortal life and become *equal* to God himself.

Now, should I punish my child for disobeying me when I tell them ""do not touch the stove, you will surely burn yourself"" if they then do just that? No. My child, being a young and naive individual who lacks the knowledge of why such a command is dangerous (even after being told why it is so) and the consequences of their actions, cannot be held morally culpable for acting in accordance to their understanding of morality and consequences. They cannot understand that disobeying a just command is immoral because they cannot grasp morality. Likewise, Adam and Eve exist in this same infantile understanding of morality and are equally inculpable of moral wrongdoing. Therefore they cannot have committed a moral evil, they cannot be the first evil. So then who was? God was. God, a being who is all knowing, fully grasps morality and the ethical considerations of his actions and still he chooses to punish two people who are morally inculpable of wrongdoing. A violation of the one universal moral proscription present in all cultures.

This argument is then strengthened scripturally when God makes the explicit claim in Isaiah 45:7 that ""I make the light and the darkness; I create peace and I create evil; I, your God, do all these things."" And while some may argue that the word means ""calamity"" and refers to natural disasters, as we have previously discussed, philosophically natal disasters are natural evils. Secondly the word can mean evil in the moral sense and in the Septuagint the authors decided to translate it using a word that is specific to moral evils, to actions undertaken by man. So for this I will argue that the intent was a claim of the creation of both moral and natural evils and there exists no rational argument for the passage being exclusive to one or the other.

Lastly we address necessity of evil in order to not violate Free Will. For this I need only a sentence. God creates a world in which nobody desires evil and natural evils and suffering do not exist. In doing so God eliminates natural evils and, as we *desire* not to do evil he has not violated our Free Will under the definition given by theologians. However to address the alternative definition of Free Will: that of the capacity to choose otherwise. God, a pan-omnic deity, is all knowing. You cannot choose otherwise under the framework of an atemporal, all-knowing Laplacian Daemon. He knows what I will choose. If he is ever wrong, he is not all-knowing. Therefore, I cannot choose otherwise and I lack Free Will."

Shopping mall ""cash back"" cards had been bout by a different company since old one filed bankruptcy. And users of old cards had to be re-registered.

Re-registration is a uninteresting, slow, and manual process, so I convinced head manager and the director to reward receptionists by offering them bonuses.

For each registration they'd be paid $1. I was shocked by the amount knowing there is just over 68.000 members with old unregistered cards. I thought they would be fighting over re-registering old members.
On top of that they got $100 mall gift cards.

Nope.

In pre-industrial societies, families would have many children in order to have a larger pool of labor helping the family and taking care of the elders in old age. High infant mortality also contributed to families churning out more kids. Likewise, in urban industrial societies prior to the creation of national insurance and pension schemes, it would be common to see families with many children in tiny, cramped apartments. The logic was similar: more labor to bring in more income and provide for the parents in old age.

However, after Bismarck introduced the pension system in Germany to counter rising socialist and Marxist influence among the working class, other countries followed suit. Over time, when people realized that the State would guarantee them an income in their old age, that incentivized the reduced need for many children. Rather than having many kids to support you as you got older, the State would now take on that responsibility. As such, birth rates declined and societies simply grew older.

The irony, of course, is that pension systems require a birth rate equal to or greater than replacement level in order to pay for themselves and function properly. Thus, the pension system at its root is contradictory and sowed the seeds of its own demise. If it were abolished, perhaps people would have more children in the hopes that the children would take care of them in the future."

You have to worry about keeping them charged and their battery life is unlikely to last through a long flight. They usually connect easily, but not always. And on top of it all they're 4-5 times as expensive as a decent set of wired earbuds, which never need charging, can't get separated, fit well in the ear due to the weight of the cable, and never have connectivity issues.

However, even though the news is on at 6,7-10, 12, 4-7, 11, they still feel like they're entitled to the other half of the schedule they're not on.

If I'm watching Price is Right, I don't care about what's going on in congress, what the fuck the president has to have a speech about, or what celebrity died. I've seen the news cut into the show I'm watching for the following frivolous reasons:

* A cop got killed in the line of duty
* A press conference after two firefighters died in the line of duty
* The death of a former POTUS/FLOTUS
* Death of a celebrity
* Celebrity trial verdicts
* The Phillies fired Charlie Manuel (are you FUCKING KIDDING ME)
* Domestic disturbance
* Death of a politician that's not a sitting mayor, governor, POTUS, VPOTUS, FL/GOTUS or SL/GOTUS

How vein do you have to be to cut into *Price is Right* because fucking Marlon Brando died? Tell me at noon, he'll still be dead by then.

The only reasons the news should cut into regularly scheduled programming include:

* Literal life and death situations (i.e. Tornado WARNING, terrorist attack)
* Death of the current mayor (of a major city, not a suburb), governor, POTUS, VPOTUS, FL/GOTUS or SL/GOTUS. In other words, if Mayor Cherelle Parker (Mayor of Philly) died, cut in. If the mayor of a suburb/outskirt of Philly died, tell us next news hour. 

If you're gonna cut in for a press conference because a politician did something humiliating, give us the cliffnotes version when it's your next news hour. Same goes with presidential speeches, trials, impeachment proceedings. From 11-12, Price is right is more important than what's going on in the outside world."

**Shared Responsibility**:     
  
Senators from both parties collectively contribute to the decision-making process. Each senator has a role in negotiating, compromising, and passing legislation. It is unfair to attribute blame to only one side when a shutdown occurs.  
  

**Diverse Interests**:   
    
Senators represent diverse constituencies with varying needs and opinions. Blaming one side oversimplifies the multitude of viewpoints and priorities that contribute to budgetary disagreements or legislative stalemates.
  
  
**Complex Decision-Making**:   
  
Government shutdowns are generally born from complex issues, intricate negotiations, and differing ideologies. It's seldom a single policy or decision but a culmination of various factors that lead to a shutdown, involving multiple senators from different backgrounds.  
  

**Bipartisan Cooperation**:   
    
The bottom line is that governing relies on *bipartisan cooperation*; it is irresponsible to blame colleagues ‘across the isle’ when a primary function of the  job relies on a persons ability to negotiate. 
    

**Accountability Across the Board**:   
  
Holding each individual senator accountable reinforces the shared responsibility of governing and allows individual members to be held accountable for their contribution to the failure."

1,2024-01-09,CMV: Polygamy marriages should be legal in the United States,u/ImperialClassic,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/192nu9v/cmv_polygamy_marriages_should_be_legal_in_the/,changemyview,"Polygamy marriages should be legal in the United States and the US government should allow polygamy marriages to be done legally. I’m using US laws, constitution, culture, religions, beliefs, history, etc, to come to my reasons and conclusions. I also ask questions but that’s my way to express what I believe.

The United States government doesn’t have a history of legislating marriage that much, but at same time, it kind of does. Even if it was very bare minimum, black and white sometimes. I believe the US constitution supports polygamy, a man or woman having multiple spouses, like it already supports a marriage between one man and one woman, by whatever age, religion, skin color, wealth, nationality, etc. Of course same gender or sex as well. And here’s the part I’ll mention, the US government allows you to legally marry regardless if you actually love the person or not. US government hardly legislated that, but they have legislated marriage (historically or not) by age, skin color, gender/sex, and I believe by family, as in I can’t marry a close blood relative, and of course how many people I can actually marry, which I’m arguing for. They also legislated sexual activity, tax law, welfare, healthcare, crime, etc in regards to legal marriage as well. 

Common law is something the US government and states established as the law of the land, from California to Maine. Each state has different marriage law history, but in 2023, we all ended up very similar, but that’s just US government legislating the country. Core tenants or the bare minimum of marriage is one adult and one adult, with one US citizen being involved, but why not more than two adults? 

Why can’t I, have two wives for example? American politicians and lawmakers have always argued the United States is the land of freedom, and to quote one of the first legal documents of US civilization, ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"". My happiness is connected to marriage, and I want to achieve the American dream with my wives. Owning a house for example, having kids, doing what any other American couples do, but just with one more person that’s legally recognized. 

Polygamy marriages is bare minimum of American marriage, because it will work no different to how monogamy marriages work. In marriages we love, we hate, we have kids, we have successes, we have failures, we divorce or separate, we become rich, we abuse, we die and leave our spouses behind what we owned, etc. I can have multiple kids, so why can’t I have multiple marriages partners at the same time? 

The US government doesn’t tell me I need to love my one wife, or live with her. I can cheat on her, neglect her, divorce her, etc. All legal, but if I just want to marry one more person, that’s not legal? 

I pay taxes to the US government, my wife pays taxes to the US government, why can’t I add one more person to my government recognized marriage? 

So this is what I believe, and I believe polygamy is American and should be allowed in the United States, change my mind?"

Yes, I do believe there are only two genders.  
  
And no, I won’t talk about “chromosomes” or “sex”. I am aware there are like, three sexes in the world \[female, male, and intersex (formally known as hermaphrodite but because people thought of it derogatory, they changed it to intersex)\].  
  
Transmen and transwomen identify as: female or male. Being “trans” is not a third gender. People may argue that being nonbinary is another gender, but I disagree because nonbinary is the lack of gender—you don’t identify with either. Hence why I don’t want to add nonbinary into the gender list. If you are genderfluid, you bounce back between identifying as female or male. See what’s common? Female or male. Two genders. If you’re intersex born with both genitals, you tend to fall under whether or not you feel like a woman or a man.  
  
Anything else like agender (not identifying as a particular gender) falls under the same categories (for example, for agender, nonbinary). Hence why I don’t count those as genders either—unnecessary labels that already exist, just reworded.  
  
The basic foundation of each “gender” is female or male, which is why I believe there’s only two genders (female or male)."

Dutch people (people of the Netherlands) are savers to the core. Some examples of Dutch stinginess - packing your own lunch instead of buying it at the cafeteria, driving cars that would be classified as ""beaters"" in America, not wasting food ever, hunting for bargains when shopping, and being thrifty in general. 

Without delving into the causes of thrift, I want to know whether this high level of thrift and high level of household savings is actually hurting the economy. In the long run, if you want your Zuckerbergs and Musks to succeed and create value, you must have a population that spends money freely. Alternatively, I wonder what would happen if Americans go all Dave Ramsey on personal finance, stop spending, start saving, buying only stuff that they NEED, and doing away with all the needless stuff like car detailing, for instance. I think it would be catastrophic for the economy, and that would cause a global recession. 

We need Americans to spend money on the things that would be considered ""extravagances"" in most developed countries. If not for the spenders, America, the countries that have invested heavily in America through pension funds and banks (Norway, Netherlands, Belgium etc.), and countries that are economically integrated with America, risk becoming like Japan - a country where the leaders have to beg people to spend money.

This endeavor gets a lot of hate from the US crowd and from what I see is rooted in racism and jealousy. 

To start there’s the jealousy aspect. Certain people like certain things so it’s a no brainer that if you have the resources you go to where the things you like are. If these people have the ability to go to a country where they find the women more attractive, what’s the issue? They aren’t doing any real harm to you except bruising your ego maybe. I think it’s seen as a personal attack on them as an individual so that’s where the hate initiates. 

Past that, all of the points I’ve heard against it are based on privilege or racism. Most commonly, I hear the argument that the only reason men would go overseas to find a woman is because they want a woman who is less educated, naive or poor. To me this is very racist because there’s this idea that because you don’t come from America, you’re inferior to Americans. It seems like they always assume that the outside of America, everyone lives in some hut with elementary school education with no other aspiration besides waiting for a person to gold dig on. 

Additionally, it comes from a place of privilege. In America we have a pretty good quality of life and it assumes that without these things no one would love you without wanting to take advantage. It also assumes the cultural norms that come with American privilege are the correct one. Maybe overseas different things are prioritized when it comes to love such as financial stability over looks. Is that such a problem especially since the American way doesn’t seem to be going to well.

Overall I don’t see any real problem with the “passport dating” thing. If someone can go outside the country to meet someone and find love, even if it’s not the traditional American stereotype of love, it’s not something that should be shamed"

I’m sure that someday the pendulum will swing back your way after Ryan Day is let go. Then you can start running your jibs again. In the mean time, deal with the lull. It’s less embarrassing than showing everybody that you are hurt by words…about football.

I’d even say that it’s the only reason they succeeded, though I realise I can’t prove that(that’s why it’s an opinion). I can only rely on what people who voted for the far right party in my country told me and they timing of all these movements coinciding with the border crisis in the south of the US and the refugee situation from the Middle East and North Africa in Europe. If you can give any counter examples of mainstream populist far right movements in the west that aren’t mainly focused on immigration I’d genuinely like to know."

Like at least the democrats who say voter id is ""racist"" have a small argument, but these people are str8 up illegals and have ZERO business voting untill they become Americans. California doesn't require voter ID so how the hell are they ensuring that everybody votes 1 time only, as well as only American citizens are voting? I know you have to provide name, signature, and address to vote in California, but these things are 10x easier to fake than a SSN lmao. An illegal could easily cross the border into San Diego, CA and then proceed to vote in the next election. All they would have to do is give a name, address, and signature which might not show up anywhere in the database and could just be explained by them ""voting for the first time"". It really seems like California has the least secure voting system, ugh. It's only common sense to assume that the illegals entering California would vote blue because the CA govt. is turning a blind eye and letting them into the state and country. I can't see how any illegal that comes into CA would be voting red, so how is this not just voter manipulation? Also last food for thought :

Since every American citizen pays federal taxes, wouldn't it be a better solution to just give a free ID card to every citizen with a voucher to renew the ID card 1 time for free per expiration date? This would bypass the poll tax which is unconstitutional. This would also negate the democrats minute argument of voter ID being racist to minorities or low income people?

35,2024-01-09,"CMV: Time management isn't a skill in the traditional sense, its something everyone needs to learn as they mature, and isn't dependent on personality types. Failure to manage your time is failure to mature.",u/9to5Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/192u77t/cmv_time_management_isnt_a_skill_in_the/,changemyview,"So, right off the bat, I want to address neurodivergent folks, because I have friends with ADHD and understand time management is very challenigng for them. This is for us NTs. 

So, a lot of people talk about time management **skills** and while its not wrong to say that there are things you can learn in order to manage your time better (set alarms, use a planner, tell other people your plans) I don't believe its a skill in that some people *lack* an aptitude for it, though some people may be more inclined towards time management. 

To be more precise, we can imagine skills on a spectrum, one side being skills that almost require a particular natural talent, like singing and having perfect pitch. The other side are skills that we all have, that we don't even think of as proper skills, like eating. (Please don't tell me there are ways to eat better, I am talking about the goal of nourishing yourself through food.) 

Time management is somewhere close to the ""skills we all have"" spectrum, but it does have to be learned in a more intentional way than something like eating or breathing. However, its not the case that a huge swatch of people are ""bad at time management"" they're just failing to mature and often letting others pick up the slack for them. I see this in relationships and in marriages. It's something that everyone needs, so if you aren't managing your own time either someone else is, or you're suffering the consequences without admitting you're the cause.

I do however think this is a harsh way to look at things, so I'd be interested in hearing counterpoints. "

Materialism states that entropy only remains the same or increases; that the world becomes more disordered over time. Naturally then we extrapolate this to be the heat death of the universe, the world unravelling into a formless state of nonsense and void of life. That being said when we look back at the past; at the start the most ordered it was clearly much less beautiful than it is now. Simply a ball of energy, there was no variation, degrees of freedom; just a ball of energy. As the universe expanded and it cooled, you would predict based on what you had seen previously nothing remarkable to happen. Merely for it to disperse disorderly; nothing meaningful could be predicted to happen. Yet we would notice clear new forms emerging as previously unnoticed laws took hold to produce more complex forms. The amount of beauty as these unfold producing even simple nuclei, which are only possible due to the beauty of such laws is unfathomable. Then we see new pheonema emerge again and again; stars form, they produce heavier nuclei, planets etc, single celled life even. Then into more complex life, up to us, then where we're heading now. All of these aren't even due to physical phenomena, they're due to the beauty of the laws that underpin these. A single slight change to even small numbers like constants for electromagnetism and instead we'd have seen matter be unable to form. It's due to this tacit beauty that we have this stable universe capable of giving us a rich conscious experience. Where even now we see beauty arise on the edge of complexity. As degrees of freedom increase we see new grander orders emerge from what was possible previously. It's not that the phenomena themselves are grandiose, but the universe in its self produces beauty at every stage of history of the universe. Probably also into the future, even for our progression as a physical creature evolutionarily, in civilisation, technology etc we've seen it in the past, so probably too the future. The confusing part of this to me is that some people say the opposite, that the world is devolving. Or that it is just inevitable. Sure what happens is inevitable owing to the laws; but the fact that our laws are beautiful and produce such complexity is not inevitable, it's a miracle. Which unfolds constantly and has done so far. Therefore to me this seems similar to mentalism, at the big bang it seems all dualities were made. Light and dark, space and form, etc. Within this there is no real need to fine balance electromagnetic constants etc, they simply are already balanced by the nature of minds. As the dao de Jing depiction of the Universe, or mind could be said to be. What is lacking is filled, what is full is emptied, they are just inevitable processes. I cannot really comment on exactly what a mind specifically would entail, as I don't think anyone really could define such a thing. But my premise is that in this final sense that is the only possible approach to the world being so beautiful. That it simply is inevitable. Similarly with consciousness, of course a mind is conscious, it has an experience, it would enjoy diverse, complex and rich experiences. Us being conscious could be said to be an illusion, or simply due to the firing of our brain. Yet the same could be said for robots, machines or AI, they could do the same computations. Even water in pipes could, that doesn't diminish what is felt and experienced, it's clearly at least to me feels qualitatively different and of a level above in value of merely those processes. I think atleast for me I couldn't convince myself otherwise and indeed that could be a part of the illusion. Yet I don't think it would be healthy or skillful to put effort into a pursuit of trying to align emotionally with that intellectual belief. Just like it's not healthy near death to fixate on it being the end; maybe it is, yet the psyche seems to prepare us by directing us to reflect on our lives. As if it won't end. Therefore what is healthy, what nature tells us is in its self an affirmation to me that is how it should be. We should embrace the illusion, if it is that and that is its own meaning. In this world that is dreamlike in its creation, to whatever end it presents us."
1,2024-01-09,CMV: Every act done by anyone in any possible scenario is done for personal benefit.,u/Even_Disk_2751,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/192xqsg/cmv_every_act_done_by_anyone_in_any_possible/,changemyview,"Please please please change my mind.

The past few weeks I’ve been developing a thought process, a really sad one. I looked it up to see if someone already invented it and it turns out someone did—it’s called Psychological Egoism. The whole premise is that every act someone does is done with intent of self benefit, no matter what. ‘The Good Place’ YouTube channel explains the surface pretty well. It’s the first thing that comes up when you search psychological egoism. 

They use the example of a mother and a child. How the true reason behind why the mother nurtures the child being a few. A few of which being that she won’t feel guilty in a society that says you should nurture your kids, the kid will look fond of her, other people won’t ostracize her, etc. 

What I’ve found is that everyone is equally selfish, as every act we do is for our own benefit. Even community service—you are doing it so you feel good about your self, and so others look fondly upon you, too.

This said, and sorry for going on so many separate tangents, but a person in society is looked at based upon how much value they do or could have to you. Think at a funeral, people say “he was such a good father”, or, “he was a great friend”. Telling people how much value he brought you, to make yourself feel good about yourself, and to make others believe that you hold value to them. The latter is kind of confusing—but they hold you in higher value because they saw you praising your (dead) friend, and boosting his social status and perceived value to everyone else, so they think that you could now potentially raise their social status. 

Having a conversation with someone is just a bunch of micro-transactions of things that are meant to boost your value. Ever try to make someone laugh? You are attempting to provide a “service” to another person in making them laugh. Making someone else laugh will increase how much value you have for them. And we want to have the highest amount of value possible. 

Dating is similar, too. Dating does multiple things. It quells your brain’s longing for a good emotion, which in this case is love, and at the same time increases both of your social status. When people see that you have a girlfriend, they see you as having a higher value to them now as you could potentially help them get one. Friendships are similar. It’s all symbiotic.

Why is your mother proud of you when you get a good grade or do well in a sport? Again, many things. One could be that her friends will find out and see her in higher value as they see how competent of a mother she is, she could also see it as you having higher value to her as you are now seen as more competent in providing to her. 

You can see it on social media, or really anywhere, all the time. People who have idols really just fanboy/girl over them because they provide value to them in entertaining them. Another thing could be, for example, a YouTube channel that gives things to the poor. We watch this guy and think he is selfless. We think he has value to us for we see he is capable of providing. We may even comment on that video something nice so we are associated with such views. 

But in reality the YouTube channel isn’t selfless at all, in fact, it’s just as selfish as the rest of us. The person valued the higher social value and possibly feeling good about himself over the money, so he did it. Every decision we make is a balance of what we hold to value of us.

Please prove me wrong, it makes me sad and I just can’t look at my family or friends the same. If everything is done for our individual benefit.

My phone is running at 5 seconds/frame right now and I am really out of my best mind so I will have to stop it there. Please ask any questions or arguments you have.

Stay safe y’all
See it feels disingenuous to say that because we now all know why I’m saying it😂

If somebody asks a question concerning things like raging or rage-quitting in video games, they often get downvoted and bashed, being told things like 'Stop playing the game lol' or 'You need some help.' But here's the thing, there is nothing wrong with having anger issues. It is not under the control of the person, and they shouldn't be shunned for it. In fact, ADHD comes with anger issues, although it is not well known because we don't want to admit that people with anger issues aren't villains who should be shamed, so we hide the phenomena called emotional dysregulation that is caused by ADHD. Something similar is RSD, or Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, basically meaning you fear rejection. This could be fearing the disapproval of others, but it can also appear in the form of being a bad sport. You don't want to lose, and you fear people with have a negative perception of you if you do. This is also another feature of ADHD. Knowing all of this, shouldn't we treat people suffering from anger issues with less toxicity?"

They were free to make those decisions, so the tax-payers shouldn't have to directly pay for the consequences. The business should pay for the consequences of those decisions, positive or negative. It just doesn't make sense to me, it's literally taking from the poor and giving it to the rich to keep them rich or make the rich richer.

And the fact that nobody can ever give consent to being brought into existence.

While I agree that in a few places on earth today it was never a better time to exist and be a human, existence is far from a rosy experience. The children would still be forced to conform to the culture and society they are born into, forced to conform to the views and values of their parents, forced to go through an education system that may be cruel and uncaring to their passions and needs, forced to interact with people that might be abusive or dismissive, only to grow up in an unfair and uncaring world and be forced to fend for themselves in a cruel unfair system based on exploitation. All the while your body decays, those you care about age and die, while you spend most of your time engaging in menial, unenjoyable labor. All of which can be exacerbated many times over if you are born with a disability or neurodivergence, or in something as banal as poverty or generational trauma.

I think that if we're being honest with ourselves, if we had the option to choose to not have existed in the first place, to never have been conscious, to never have to face the endless drudgery of staying alive, more people than we expect would choose that option. 

And do not compare my thought experiment to suicide or suicidal ideation, it is not the same. Once we exist we are programmed through instruct and culture to want to keep existing, we get attached to things in this world, we live for our family, our lovers and any others we care about, we don't want to abandon them, we don't want to die and experience death. Yet at the same time we might wish to have had the choice to never have experienced any of it. To go back to that time before we were born, when we were nothing and nothing was.

For as long as the human race existed, all the billions of people that have died and are alive today, the number one cause for all the pain, suffering, anguish, disease, war, discrimination, poverty, famine and loss, the cause was just being alive to experience it. All of it could have been avoided had they never been born to begin with.

And so, deciding to bring another person into existence, to me, is a massive overreach into that person's rights and self determination. A decision that many times is never even considered, or done from social pressure or just raw animalistic instinct. And I do not think that the joys of existing can ever make up for the drawbacks, especially when looking at humanity as a whole and all the horrible conditions most of humanity has been born into.

I think that the most ethical thing a human can do is to not force the burdens of existing onto someone else

In my personal experience, it was always something I did by choice (although for survival) and it helped me stay afloat until I figured something else out. It can reach a point where you feel bad about yourself but I think that depends mostly on your overall experience doing it. I got past that point and having sex for money really just feels like giving someone a massage nowadays.

Most of the dangers come from people who like I said, are preying on those who they know are vulnerable, and have little protection from the law because they themselves are involved in what is labeled as crime. There’s clients who can become possessive and try to hold a sw against their will, clients who coerce sw’s into drug use, guys who harass, manipulate, threaten, and overall abuse sw’s to pimp them out and take a chunk of their earnings.

I believe it stems from the fact that sw’s are labeled as criminals and can be punished for their acts, as well as the entitlement these men feel to be disrespectful and inconsiderate. Sw being illegal is enabling them to feel like they can just abuse and take advantage of people because in a way they are “punishing a criminal” , as well as taking away the fear of any consequences because the law does not protect the sw’s.

If sw was legalized, and maybe regulated, it would repel these abusers because the law would be protecting the sw’s as they are doing a perfectly legal job. Also there could be room for more resources for people who have gone into sw and find it difficult to get out. It could become an official industry that benefits a chunk of the population, and allows the workers to go in and out of it safely."

A lot of guys think LLMs are basically just pattern recognition software which spits out words in the correct order, and while they aren’t wrong, they fail to understand that most human beings don’t understand what this means, and even though the underlying tech might be simple, the average mind still perceives the tech to be something out of a sci-fi novel. 

When you couple this technology with modern graphic design, ie, you put a face and an advanced UI in front of an LLM, you basically have the ability to create what most users believe to be a really advanced virtual companion.

Companies like Replika are already growing at a massive pace, and in a few years time, there’s no reason that they won’t be able to create an absolutely perfect virtual companion that is exactly what their users want in a girlfriend. 

At that time, people are surely going to decide that they want to marry their AI significant others. I also recently saw a JRE episode with a neuro-scientist, and she goes deep into how AI bots are going to completely revamp human-AI interactions.

Assuming everything goes according to plan, it’s almost certain that human-AI marriages are going to become a thing, and to be honest I think that it’s going to have an overall net-positive effect on society, helping loneliness, and other similar silent epidemics.

Wherever you draw the line between Chicken and ""Animal that chickens evolved from"" does not matter, because wherever you draw the line, that predecessor will lay an egg that the first chicken will be born from. And thus ""chicken egg"" will have predated chickens."

I would argue a refusal to make such plans indicates greater maturity, while the making of such implies naivete.",u/Hoihe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1936ij9/cmv_a_frequently_cited_measure_of_maturity_in/,changemyview,"Hello!

I am a 26 year old, Hungarian graduate student in physical chemistry. This for me had been arrived at taking one-step at a time, with vague notions and wishes for the future that were constantly reassessed based on political news.  I remember that when I was 15 years old, we've had school psychologists try and assess our maturities by investigating whether we could make long-term plans, and how complex they were.

It was, more or less, stated that if you are only living one step into the future at a time - you have fallen behind in development.

I would like to argue against this on a few bases, and would like to be shown that either:

A) Well-trained psychologists DO take these confounding factors into consideration when casting judgement/making statistics  
B) The reasons I cited for why I think an informed inability to make long-term plans is actually a sign of developmental delay.

Anecdotally, from the end of upper elementary school (grade 6-8) I'd made a long-term plan that I want to leave my home country for political reasons. I am a gay, transgender woman and I did not feel safe in my country both socially, and in terms of my ruling party's messaging. I specifically chose Denmark at the time as they were often ridiculed for being  [homophobic slur] by peers and ""mentor figures."" Bohr also hailed from there and there is a decent tradition in theoretical physics/physical chemistry as a consequence.

However, given my motivations I would never share this with any school psychologist and so, I'd ended up presenting ""for reasons"" as for why I want to move to Denmark. I believe this may have been interpreted as a sign of whimsical immaturity. This plan ended up being dropped though, as Denmark's politics grew more hostile to people like me as they've shown a rise in right wing influence. 

Furthermore, in a more general sense - I believe it takes naivete to make complex plans of one's future as it is impossible to predict what curve balls life will throw at you even next month (car accident, assault, infection, recession, inflation, caretaker death), much less 5-10 years into the future. Case in point, people who had made complex plans of moving to UK had their entire futures squashed by Brexit, a highly improbable event, happening and nullifying all their preparatory work. 

Therefore, an adolescent replying to questions on their long-term plans with vague wishes over a complex detail demonstrates greater insight and maturity."

The entrance exams are objective - pure problem solving.  

If you say that women can't compete with these objective exams - you are saying that women are inherently less smart than men. If you argue that women are as smart as men, they shouldn't need a quota system to get into these colleges. 

After entering, each branch should have at least 20% women in every branch. This is BS too since when I see the scores in University examinations, women are overwhelmingly performing less than men when it comes to marks scored. 

Finally, there is a trend in my company where a set of people are complaining women aren't 50% of leadership positions. If you're inlet is skewed, why shouldn't leadership positions be? We have lesser female engineers. What's then the logic behind asking for 50% females in leadership positions? Not only does this undermine the actual achievers, it also makes leadership worse. It's really hard to work under someone who is way out of their depth or competence. Creates problems for everyone under them. But it's a huge taboo to say that ones female boss is an idiot - even though I can say that comfortably about my male bosses. 


I am all for solving these problems at their root cause. If women are faring worse in engineering competitives, I'm all for programs that encourage women and develop their competence in problem solving, math, physics, chemistry, spatial intelligence and verbal and non verbal reasoning. This forced percentage politics is not a good thing."

The dating world is changing in a way that puts women in a position of power over men. Women are also opting out in much higher numbers than men. This’ll create a scarcity in the dating market and will mean women have even more choosing power than they already do and only the hottest, best men will be able to experience romantic love or sex.

So I think we should start preparing young men now. There’s this weird thing that especially mothers do where they compliment their sons and tell them how handsome they are and how girls are going to like him, which if it isn’t true is weird as hell. I think this sets people up for failure and disappointment. That at least was the case for me. There’s also a societal focus that relationships and sex are milestones for men to achieve and that’s increasingly becoming not the case.

What I think should be done is from an early age, find the boys who will grow into romantically/sexually unsuccessful men and start telling them and training them up in ways to prevent them from fallin into darker rabbit holes. In my case, if you looked at me at 13, you would be able to tell I was going to grow into an ugly loser. I mean my bullies were able to pick up on it, so I don’t see why adults didn’t. I went through college without a single woman ever liking me.these things are telegraphed and not really suprises.

The arguments I am seeing against it:

The context of the post is the a teenage girl wanted to wear revealing clothing when going out in public. Mother supported daughters decision father didn't.

My problem with all of the responses in the comments and the responses of the mother and the daughter is that they are not based in reality. One of the top responses was something like (I bet this isn't applied to OP's sons, or I bet they wouldn't apply these same standards if it were a boy). 

But right off the bat this argument seems ridiculous to me, I was a teenager not long ago (less than 5 years ago) and I NEVER volunteered to walk around outside in an outfit with my ass hanging out. I also have never known another man who wanted to do so. So right off the bat this argument doesn't seem to actually apply like protesters seem to think it would. 

Hell worst case scenario most teenage boys dress like slobs but thats completely different from walking around exposing yourself. In other words its a false equivalency to say that a young man walking around in sweatpants and a hoodie is the same as a young woman walking around in booty shorts and a top that leaves nothing to the imagination.

Especially considering that we dont live in a perfect world and young women get kidnapped and sold into the sex trade all the time. Now if we lived in an ideal world where women were not harassed, r***ed, kidnapped, ect then i believe there would be no issue with young women dressing however they want. But we live in a cruel and harsh world, so i truly believe as of now its better to have this double standard to keep young women alive and safe.

Im not trying to come off as a bigot or a prude but women (especially younger women) are in far more danger when they go out into public then men... Some of them going around 2 steps from naked doesn't improve the situation."

For example, marble fountains, personalised number plates would be ‘new money’ possessions. The accepted use of ‘new money’ to describe ostentatious taste is degrading and suggests that the owner is overcompensating for not having generational wealth. The implicit suggestion is that people with ‘old money’ would be more tasteful and not feel the need to flaunt their money.

This is ironic, as it somewhat suggests that having generational wealth is more impressive than building ‘new’ wealth. It also suggests that ‘new money’ is looked down upon, compared to people born with money. Most of us would agree that it is more commendable to work for money, we don’t really question our use of them terms and whether we are subconsciously taught to view generational wealth as more admirable than new money."

They then kinda chuckled and agreed to the draw. They were later disqualified for this. This is caused a bit of a rift among the chess community, some have called it disrespectful, others don't care.
I truly cannot see a single thing wrong with it, and am baffled by the idea that its a bad thing. There is a well know draw called the Berlin, and this has been played countless times in competitive play. No one has ever batted an eye when this was played, so I dont see the difference? Does anyone have a different opinion? Why should they be disqualified just for agreeing to a draw before hand, and not playing some classical draw?"

Even though the support for 2SS in Palestine still remains at just over 30%, the surge in popularity of Hamas or armed struggle does not bode well for any peace process in the future. Those who oppose 2SS in Palestine will likely be more radicalised and more willing to derail any attempts at peace. This is without mentioning that the current situation has been described as a one state reality.

I think it's time to recognise that there is no realistic 2SS that Palestinians will actually accept, especially after Oct 7th. Israel will use the settlements to demand unrealistic concessions from the Palestinians, putting them at an in-passe. The international community need to recognise that and start thinking about 1SS.

I know that 1SS will likely be unpopular, especially amongst the Palestinians, but I think that if a just and fair 1SS is proposed, it may just change people's minds. 

I'd like to also note that most 1SS propositions are federation, confederacy or something similar. Palestinians and Israelis will still enjoy some level of autonomy and independence within their borders, including movement, but certain issues like security and diplomacy will be determined by a joined entity of some kind"
1,2024-01-10,Cmv: writing daily affirmations is ruining my career and social life,u/EnvironmentEven7328,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/193cqvo/cmv_writing_daily_affirmations_is_ruining_my/,changemyview,"I feel like everything i think and i do is based on a certain conformation bias. 

A year and a half ago I was offered to work in a team project, with my friends... I Liked to do sketches and paintings so they figured I could learn to paint on drywall construction as well. 

I was unemployed, I was desperate for any kind of  distraction because I was depressed about breaking up with my girlfriend. I broke up with her because I was unfaithful to her and I hated doing that to her so I left her without explaining the real reason because I believed she would hate me if I told her the truth.

 that's when the daily affirmations come to play, so my friend's idea of helping me with my feelings were to tell me to write daily Affirmations each month, 3 times everyday. which is basically forcing a conformation bias provoked belief on yourself. 

 if anyone would've suggested this to me 10 years ago I would laugh at their face but I was desperate. I wrote ""I am in the moment"" as a way for me to let go of my feelings about the past and focus on the job.

So in the second week of my first affirmation ""I'm in the moment"" I was still at that job with them and I thought I was doing okay considering it was barely the third time I was painting drywall. But one day I get called out for my inefficiency and lack of focus. 

And he kicks me out of the job, and I don't even get paid. So that forced me to finish a painting I have been dying to finish in my house's cieling.  So I thought to myself ohhh so that's what me being in moment must have meant. 

Because I was procrastinating the project that was close to my heart and prioritizing friendships over my own needs. So I finish that in a month even though I had been slacking off for a year before this affirmation. So that's why I thought this affirmation method could actually work.

So I kept writing things like, I'm passionate. I'm fine. I'm grateful. I believe. I'm the hero of my life. I'll focus on spirituality. I did this for 7 months. And things started to get better for a while I was focusing on my career again.

But now it has become an addiction, an obsession. It has caused me to betray the same person that thought me this method. He sued me because of something I made myself do. I had to get hospitalized in psych ward for this.

I'm almost over that breakup now but I've lost all my motivation in my career. And if I keep doing this I'll probably end up an outcast in society. I feel like everyone will believe it's off-putting to do this everyday and if they see me write this stuff they'll probably think twice before coming back to my cafe.

Not sure how this works.


change my view so I stop with this obsessive affirmation nonsense?

Or change my view in believing it's off-putting to others and a stupid thing to believe in?

.. I could go either way that is safer.  I'm leaning towards stopping this thing but it seems nearly impossible now.

In the context of constitutional changes or voting in relation to a specific topic, it would be more democratic for voters to be subject to a basic knowledge test regarding the objective background on the relevant subject matter and potential implications of the change. This would ensure that the voter has a base level understanding on what the vote is for, and the essential implications of their vote.

I am not saying feminism is outright going to opress monogamy but there something's they say that makes me concerned about the existence of monogamy. Let me define some terminology.

Traditional romantic courtship culture: idea of young people dating for the sole purpose of long term relationship or marriage as a young adult or adolescence. Sex is only seen as romantic activity between people who are in romantic relationship. 

Monogamy: Romantic relationship that is exclusive between two people. This could take form of an egalitarian relationship. Paternal certaintity is valued by both parties.

The reason why I am concerned about these cultural norms disappearing or minimized is due to me doom scrolling in the Internet. I found bunch of articles like from cosmopolitan, elite daily, bustle, New York times, the guardian and more advocating for hook up culture. 

I read that there are books like sex at dawn and origin of family, state and private property by Engles who said not only is polyamory natural but also paternal uncertainty is natural and sign of egalitarian or matriarchal society. There are other articles about tribal society that also makes similar claims. 

I know feminist would deflect all this by saying feminism is about fighting for free choose without judgment or stigma but that is not my concern here. I am more concerned about preserving and reproducing my culture. Why because I am attached to the culture I grew up with and would love it if others can enjoy it as well in the future. I believe people have right to attachments as long as those attachments don't violate human rights then it's ok."
7,2024-01-10,CMV: the very foundation of sexual orientation inherently involves a form of sexual objectification,u/Unusual-Double-2003,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/193e7te/cmv_the_very_foundation_of_sexual_orientation/,changemyview,"  
Sexual objectification is defined as treating a person solely as an object of sexual desire. This concept is surprisingly at the heart of how we understand sexual orientation. When someone identifies as heterosexual or homosexual, their primary indicator of attraction is fundamentally based on physical characteristics. This is objectification in its most straightforward form.  
  
Our sexual attractions are not within our control; they arise spontaneously. To deny this, to ignore the innate influence of our visual senses, is to make hollow statements. This attraction is not a conscious choice but an intrinsic part of our identity.  
  
While it's true that sexual attraction can develop over time for some, my focus here is on the initial, instinctive aspect of attraction that is predominantly physical.   
  
Take platonic friendships as an example. Deep bonds based on personality and emotional connections are common, yet in heterosexual contexts, these alone do not lead to sexual attraction. This illustrates that sexual attraction is fundamentally rooted in physical attributes – an initial objectification.  
  
Acknowledging the role of physical attributes in attraction should not be viewed as problematic or shallow. In the quest for romantic connections, physical appeal often serves as the initial catalyst. This instinctual part of human sexuality, our natural response to certain physical traits, often initiates deeper, more meaningful connections.  
  
Hence, when men or women are drawn to each other primarily for physical traits, this isn’t something to be condemned. It’s a fundamental aspect of human attraction. To deny this is to overlook an essential element of our nature. The more pressing conversation should be focused on how we develop deeper, more meaningful relationships from this initial physical attraction, rather than questioning the ethicality of the attraction itself."

It’s like they’re asking me not to think, and to just blindly accept things the way the hivemind and/or the individual person confronting me wants me to perceive life.

How about not, I’m gonna keep making assumptions anyway.

I get the basic principle: Judge everyone on an individual basis after you get to know them, don’t say your assumptions out loud until they’re confirmed or denied, don’t antagonize someone until you understand the situation.

It’s just to me “Don’t make assumptions” sounds so broad and misleading in that it discourages independent creative and predictive thought.

To me it just sounds stupid. It’s basic human nature to make assumptions, especially on ppl based off of 1st impressions. Doesn’t mean those 1st impressions are correct, but oftentimes they are more often then you’re wrong. It’s a survival mechanism. 

I think a better saying would be “Don’t say your assumptions out loud until you understand the situation for sure.”

“Don’t make assumptions” is easier and catchier to say. But it’s flat out wrong if you take it literally.

I see people without children having mental collapses over having to work more than 20 hours a week, I always wonder what they would be doing with that time if it weren’t for their jobs, usually it’s wasting hours away on pointless entertainment. 

The emotional immaturity most people have is astounding to me. Working with adults that act like teenagers makes me wonder how these people have made it as far as they have in life. People who hate their spouses  are the worst of this, refusing to put even slight work into their  relationships, then wondering why their spouses and themselves are miserable. 

Most people are morally, emotionally, financially, and mentally weak. I would love to have my view changed."

No other film or show has done more to promote interest in WWII history and honoring the legacy of those who fought it. The casting is also damn close to perfect. Sure, the show has its minor flaws (the Blithe factual error, the excessively harsh portrayal of Sobel, some liberties with exact details, etc.), but I think it nevertheless stands in a league completely of its own."

If all it takes to get labeled a DINO or RINO is to (even just occasionally) support something that the opposing party is putting forth, then party loyalists are in reality demanding that our cold political civil war continue forever. They'd rather support Team Red than Team Blue (even if Team Blue is actually putting forth *good* proposals - or vice versa).

So ""They shouldn't draft women because they shouldn't be drafting anyone"" is not going to change my mind.   
Main post: Ukraine has a draft, they're using it because they feel like they need to, they're facing manpower shortages and are trying to come up with ways to mitigate that shortage going forward. A lever that they could pull that would help although maybe not solve these shortages is to add women to the draft. 

I can not think of a good reason why they should not be doing this if they are indeed going to continue drafting people.   


I do think there should be exceptions for people with kids, so a single mother or father probably should not get drafted, a husband/wife with kids should only have one of those two parents be eligible for the draft and I think it's fine for those two people to decide amongst themselves which of the two that should be.   


I don't think that I need to keep going in this post, I think there's a clear problem that Ukraine has (manpower shortages) that they are attempted to solve unsuccessfully via a draft, they have pulled other levers that are available to them like raising the maximum age for men etc, the big lever that is left for them to pull is to make women eligible for the draft.

The global belief in inherent, eternal national rights to land is nothing but a myth.  
  
Just think about it: every country, no matter how peaceful, is essentially built on the premise of conquest.  
  
Let's take Norway as an example. Norway is seen as having a legitimate claim to its land due to historical settlement. But this perspective is a fiction. Just because Norwegian ancestors settled there first doesn't mean they, or their descendants, have an unending claim to this land.  
  
This isn't an indictment of specific nations or peoples, but a critique of the principle itself. Every piece of land we call a country was once uninhabited or belonged to someone else. History is a sequence of migrations, settlements, and conquests. To claim perpetual rights to land based on ancestral settlement oversimplifies and distorts history.  
  
The 'first-come, first-served' approach to land rights, or saying 'we were here first, so it's ours forever' is a simplistic and flawed argument. It ignores the fluid nature of human history and migration. It's a convenient narrative to justify current borders, but it doesn't hold up.  
  
My challenge to the foundation of national land claims is not an attempt to justify actions like colonialism or occupation, but to question the very concept of indigenous rights to land."

47,2024-01-10,"CMV: Multiple Sports are going through a crisis of officiating due to poorly written rules that are not meant to be enforced 100% of the time, leading to significant subjectivity in enforcement and outright mistakes",u/Pirat6662001,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/193jx75/cmv_multiple_sports_are_going_through_a_crisis_of/,changemyview,"I regularly watch NFL, Soccer, and NHL. Sometimes NBA and never MLB (so none of this is about baseball).

Currently multiple sports (especially NFL and Soccer) are going through a massive crisis of referring, with multiple season altering errors (especially important in Soccer due to promotion/relegation potentially killing a club). Those errors always happened, but they are more visible than ever with multiple camera angles, replays and even VAR (Video judge) and Mic recordings. 

Refs have also been caught in gambling scandals (NBA, with significant sign of a larger cover up), admitting to make up calls (NHL) and taking money from the owners of opposing teams (Soccer, Refs getting massive paychecks from Saudi Arabia).

Additionally we have advanced statistics on the refs now showing that many times there are personal grudges and biases potentially influencing the decisions:
NFL - Lions are 0-6 when Allen refs and are called for almost 2x the penalty yards in those games. The Lions record in that time is 35-30, and they lost 5 of the 6 by one score or less
NBA - Chris Paul is 3-17 In playoff games reffed by Scott Foster. Chris Paul is 76-73 total in the playoffs. So that’s 73-56 without foster, 3-17 with. There are other advanced stats showing that this isnt normal.
For Premier League Soccer there are advanced statistics that big 6-7 clubs have abnormally high number of decisions, cards and penalties go their way, more than accounted for by better play from better sides. (most articles and research i have seen suggests that the bias is mostly subconscious, recent exceptions with Saudi Arabia involved refs of course). 


There are multiple issues that led to this situation:
1) The rule books have been written in a different era, largely not accounting for being able review the film within millimeters in near real time during broadcast. Which fans can see effectively right away and call out mistakes. The rules were structured around the idea of Refs enforcing them effectively as needed to ""manage"" the game. (NHL and NBA both used ""managing the game"" as excuse for subjective enforcement during recent cases, which also makes their leagues ""entertainment"" and not ""sport"") The overall result is that leagues, officials, and even most fans arguing that rules can not be enforced 100% of the time, because that would make the game unplayable. Great example would be PI or holding in American football, which is called only a fraction of the time because every play has some that breaks the current rules. In soccer there are examples of two handed pushes of opposing players not being enforced (recently against Salah to put him offisde) , even though the rules clearly state thats a foul. 
2) Historically Government basically allowed leagues to do whatever they want with very little oversight. This has changed with first National Broadcasts and then Global Ones.
3) Sports Gambling was restricted or more underground in many countries (especially US). This has also changes recently. Which led to much bigger importance of consistently calling games and getting the calls right - people make or lose a lot of money based on this and the potential to rig certain results is much more lucrative.
4) Recent technology was implemented in very poor ways across many leagues. Specifically making only some things be reviewable, only at certain times or certain positions on the field. Some reviews are completely Refs decision, others are coaches challenge. The big mistake that both Soccer and NFL made is to make on-field Ref the chief decision maker and stick to the opinion that people on the field know best. This has continuously led to issues of on-field Refs missing issues and not initiating reviews even if everyone else saw that one is needed or video teams being hesitant to overturn bad calls.

Conclusion is - We need to fix our sports. Both, so they produce enjoyment instead of rage and to ensure a fair financial results on bets.

To fix we must:
Make Video refs the top decision makers, ideally on-field officials would only be there to actually manage the game, as in control the players, explain decisions and so on. Not make any decisions themselves since they are arguably in the worst position to do so.
Ref conversation to be fully recorded and released every time. This is crucial for transparency and to see the thought process. It would also make it much easier to fix any issues long term
Re-write the rules to specifically account for new and emergent technologies
Any decision that can be exactly measures should be done automatically by technology or not by refs. Good examples - ball being in or out (pretty much all sports, big problem in soccer recently), or spotting the ball in football so 1st downs arent just given because refs felt like it.
Any decisions that are more subjective like handball in Soccer, dangerous play or Pi/Holding in football need to be re-written to be as clear as possible and as playable as possible. For football that might mean that we accept that certain level of something like holding is acceptable, but it must be written into the rules and enforced.
Long term every sports governing body should see if Deep Learning AI makes sense for any of the rules and situations. It would take investment, but there is potential to remove subjectivity from some calls by using the same AI in all games. This is much more pie in the sky as even slight differences in positioning might trick deep learning system into producing significantly different result."

You would want as low of a number as possible because that would mean more money. $1million is a high benchmark but it's a perspective of what the rich make vs the working class who makes that money for the rich.

A teacher making $35,000/year doesn't sound great but there is a lot more perspective looking at 29years to make $1 million. That's basically an entire career and when you add taxes it's even longer. It also shows the difference between a ceo who might make 0.1years per million and their employees who make 10-20years per million.

If you are on social media, there are an increasing amount of people who are trying to feel persecuted for being poly, vast majority of the people engaging in this behavior happen to be white. This along with other sexuality focused movements is the next generation of white pity. 

Yes other races can be poly, and they also use openly being poly as a method to feel persecuted, but the vast majority of occasions of people using their sexuality to feel persecuted they happen to be white.

Why is this happening? It is simply people who have few things going on in their lives, and in a way to get attention or pity, they identify as something like poly to feel unique or superior to others. The desire to feel valid is the driving factir fir those viewpoints.

Polyamory does not need to be valid. It might not be valid, and that's fine. Not everything needs to be valid in order for you to enjoy it. There's no need to wrap your entire personality around your sexuality. I'm ace, and it's such a rarely discussed topic that I bring up, precisely because it's not something that I feel the need to bring up or find pity over as my sexuality is such a tiny part of my overall life. I don't make a big deal out of it when I'm teased by poly and others about the intricacies of being ace. It's not that big of a deal. They can live without trying to find pity over their sexualities.

Overall, a lot of white people identify as poly and other types of sexualities as a method of seeking some form of pity or being able to feel persecuted over something. Would love for my view to be changed,  "

With that there’s starting to be more accidents and many of them seem to be the bikers fault, specifically at intersections.

When crashes happen at these intersections it’s usually the bike crashing into the side of the car not the other way around. Even if this happens the car would be at fault because bikes in the lane have the right of way.

This doesn’t make sense to me because if I’m driving and turning right that requires me to slow down. If the biker is further back and maintains their speed (18-20mph) this means unless they are close to me I wouldn’t see them in my mirror. As I start turning my mirror view would turn *away* from the bike lane and my passenger window would turn towards it and by the time I would see them I’d be in the bike lane already and they would crash. This is in addition to me needing to monitor everything else.

Meanwhile a biker going the same way only has to look at the blinkers ahead and anticipate what’s going to happen and slow down/stop. So if they crash into the car that uses its blinker it’s their fault. There’s  the added risk of a car turning from the other lane as well so bikes should be prepared to yield for that as well.

There *are,* however, five cars with their lights on, burning gas, with their drivers browsing on their phones. You wait to see if any of them are leaving; no dice.

Ah yes St. Fauci.  The same guy who poo-pooed the lab leak theory, and actually went out of his way to quash serious discussion of it within the USG.  Surely it couldn’t be because he and his NIH buddies sent USG funding to the Wuhan lab to bypass US law that prohibits gain of function research on deadly pathogens.  So he and his coterie choose a research partner in the PRC, a country infamous for its abysmal safety and protocol standards, and whose government chronically conceals information and prevents transparency.  Fuck Fauci.  

The PRC bears the lion’s share of blame for the Covid pandemic, but the USG absolutely shares a level of complicity and all those involved need to be held accountable.  In a better era, he and his cronies would stand a much better chance of this-that is one major attribute that separated us from countries like the PRC in the first place.

1,2024-01-10,CMV: Music and art are not strictly subjective,u/Ripturd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/193p0o8/cmv_music_and_art_are_not_strictly_subjective/,changemyview,"To say that anything is strictly subjective is false for 3 essential reasons:


-It effectively shuts down conversation


-It denies any deep nuance of the subject


-It is a self-refuting paradox




	Take music for example. On point 1, If someone asserts that music, or an opinion about music, is subjective, they may not necessarily mean, but are still implying, that music is TOTALLY subjective. This concludes that anything anyone says or feels about music is subjective and not up for debate, effectively making any conversational response null and void.  It’s true that there is a subjective component to music, but the interplay between objectivity and subjectivity regarding music is lost if objectivity is outright denied.  Oftentimes people will say something is subjective as a way of ending the conversation, since thinking critically about it is too difficult or time consuming.


	For point 2, saying music is subjective ignores depth of knowledge and nuance. If music is entirely subjective it means that the objectivity is taken as a diametrical opposite of subjectivity. There can be no aspects of music which are objective. This is obviously false. A trained musician can qualify the “goodness” or “badness” of a performance based on things like articulation, dynamics, rhythm, timing, appropriate pitch/key, right or wrong notes for the piece, etc.


	On point 3, to imply that something IS subjective is to say that in all cases, one thing is the case. This is an absolute statement. From a surface perspective, it is self-refuting. It would be more accurate to say that there are aspects of music that are subjective. If one simply asserts “X is subjective”, they are stating their case absolutely. Saying “X can be subjective” is better.


	Ultimately, music, or any “subjective” idea or thing, always (absolutely) contains objective and subjective elements. Objectively, one can assess the instrumentational correctness, the timing, the accuracy of pitch, the cohesiveness of the band, and other things. Subjectively, one can state their preference for whether they like or dislike what they are hearing.


	To extend subjectivity beyond this can lead to a type of solipsistic paradox where I can say – subjectively, the music I like is good, and since music is ONLY subjective, then I may as well be the only one listening, and since my mind is the only one listening and subjectivity reigns supreme, only the music I like is objectively good. It’s a roundabout way to show the underlying objectivity inherent in blanket subjectivity (if everything is subjective then objectively anything goes). This is obviously unhelpful in determining the accuracy of the claim, so to deny subjectivity or objectivity is not only inaccurate but alludes to the notion that the speaker is mostly unfamiliar with the depth of the subject and the interconnectedness of both the subjective and objective aspects.


	Beyond understanding these two aspects, I think it may be more useful to develop an ideology where they are potentially treated as equally valid and inseparable, where we move past conversations of objectivity and subjectivity entirely and understand them to be wrapped up in something larger or more foundational. It’s true that music can be both objective and subjective, but since that IS true, it’s not worth arguing about which one takes precedence or which one is actual. A deeper understanding would already take for granted inherent subjectivity and objectivity, and further, would be interested more so in how these aspects enrich the experience one is having, rather than which one is valid.


	Pragmatism is the best approach we have today, but since pragmatism doesn’t say anything exclusive about subjectivity or objectivity, I propose we can call such thinking “pragmatic perspectivity”. Subjectivity and objectivity both fall under the concept of perspective, and pragmatism contends that most ideological topics are best viewed in terms of their practical use, and not necessarily as descriptors or representations of actual reality. Therefore, pragmatic perspectivity implies that subjectivity and objectivity are inherent in a perspective that is seeking to practically understand a thing or idea’s application.




Ultimately my point is that music and other art are both subjective and objective at the same time, and to the degree that it’s irrelevant to stake an argument on the premise that one takes precedence over the other."

What this means is that you shouldn't immediately seek revenge soon after the harm has been done. Here are the pros:

1. Now the nice reason for this is it allowed the person to make amends and also gives you time to assess the situation. Like imagine you get revenge the next day only for them to apologize and explain what happened. Well know you're the asshole right? 
2. But if this doesn't happen it also gives you the time to plan your revenge. Better plotting leads to a more satisfying and cathartic outcome
3. It gives them a chance to forget about the harm they did to you. These means when retribution arrives they probably have a few suspects but can't pinpoint you specifically. 

Then there's in small portions. What this means is not doing some grand gesture of revenge but instead doing multiple minor acts of revenge. 

1. They won't really think too much of it at the start and probably not look too deep into it
2. They won't know whether it's the same person, or multiple people
3. They won't know if or when the next one will come
4. You can do it at your convivence

Now I have tried multiple ways. I've tried turning the other cheek and being the bigger man but there's probably going to be some anger deep down depending on the amount of harm. I've tried the one act of revenge but usually it's not well thought out and there's a yearning for more. This way is the most satisfying and cathartic. It slowly destroys someone's sense of safety and makes them question who among them is the enemy. It also makes the revenge more proportional. It's very easy to go overboard in one action but if you're doing small actions you can stop when you feel you're equal.

I really challenge this view, because if you do research you’ll see how drastic the difference is between boys who grow up with fathers compared to boys who don’t.

Fatherless boys are:
• more likely to commit crimes
• more likely to go to prison
•more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol
•2x more likely to drop out of school

This is concrete evidence that shows this disparity. I promise you guys, “sigma males” on tiktok are nothing more than fingers on a keyboard. They do nothing of harm in real life and are literally not a threat to anyone, yet women think they’re the cause of things like rape, assault and extreme misogyny. The real problem is boys who have no father figure. Let’s be honest, most boys by the time they’re teenagers, and definitely by the time they hit puberty, are bigger, stronger and overall out power their mothers. If a boy really wants to disobey her, there is usually nothing stopping him from doing so. Fathers are 100% needed within a household and people seem to ignore it. I’m just tired of men being blamed for “influencing”, when in reality it’s the absence of men that causes the most damage. Btw I’m aware that men influence other men poorly, but it’s extent is not nearly as harmful as an absent father"
1,2024-01-10,cmv: Jordan Peterson is wrong about climate change.,u/Midnightsun24c,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/193rgmm/cmv_jordan_peterson_is_wrong_about_climate_change/,changemyview,"I'm going to use his most charitable and most (I think) widely sited argument against the current consensus on the issue of climate change. He makes many arguments some not even consistent with others but I'll leave it at one that seems to stick. It goes something like this:

We shouldn't transition to cleaner sources of energy or follow the current global action plans because it will hurt poor people and cause suffering, famine and/or death on a wide scale and the solution would be to (paraphrasing here) drill our way out of the situation by attempting to bring as many of the globally relative poor out of poverty as fast as possible because psychologically, they would begin to care more, therefore taking action to solve the issue by means of the free market. 

I think there are almost too many issues with this to address all at once. Why assume that anybody plans on people starving to solve the issue? Can we not solve or at least attempt to solve both issues at once? Does he really believe the people who are working on this think we should have to sacrifice people to save the world? I don't think this is a zero sum thing.   This is all aside from the point that he is affiliated with a right wing media outlet partially (initially at least) funded by fossil fuel billionaires. 

This issue derived from free market activity and it is in all of our interests to address but the powe/behavior dynamic of the individual consumer and the corporation is completely skewed.

 I'll admit my bias will show here, my understanding is that corporations despite having the same long term interests of everything not falling apart, look too short term in their goals and many industries such as natural gas/oil/coal have little to no independant short term incentive to stop or make cleaner the things they produce for profit. As an investor in public equity it seems like maximizing shareholder value is and always will be the number one priority aside from some government intervention. 

A whole other issue is the idea that relative wealth inequality would ever get better by giving these already established conglomerates free reign to get away with anything they wanted. It may create and spur some middle class activities for sure, but largely things would remain the same. The already advantaged will squeeze the profits, it will not be equitably distributed in third world countries. 

Another thing weird about this and JP is that he specifically defends the status quo on income inequality. Even if he's right, that the global poor would begin to care more if they held a better wealth base and quality of life, he has made IQ and hierarchical pareto distribution based arguments to fight against any change in the current distribution of wealth, his arguments seem to suggest that the free market is as fair and merit based as its ever going to get, and that it would be immoral for the working class to own a higher share of the global wealth.  

These things alone seem like enough to disregard this specific argument. He doesn't seem to actually care about workers rights or income inequality. Or climate change science. 

A quick view of the the arguments ranging from more carbon actually being good, to the models being wrong seems to all point to him not really caring at all one way or another. I speculate this has to do with being pulled into the conservative media sphere where there is a lot of good money in keeping things status quo yet not being unappealing by just being honest that the conservative view of climate change is not out of concern of majority of people, but of profits for the few."

Sure it can be annoying talking to boomers who seem to have no idea what things cost these days, and it's annoying that they always say ""no one wants to work these days"" when it's simply that many full time jobs won't even provide the ""picket fence"" lifestyle anymore and that dissolutions people, but the reality is that Boomers have nothing to do with it, or at least not 99.9%+ of them.

Several instances lead to our current inflation which Boomers were neither alive for or couldn't have even voted for if they were. Our mounting economic crisis was instigated by oligarchs, congressmen, public-private partnerships, and the MIC. This includes but is not limited to the 1913 Federal Reserve Act, The Great Depression, the Glass-Steagall Act, and then the 1970s shift to fiat currency. he Higher Education Act of 1965 is why the cost of university went so high. More recently we have Blackrock buying up residential real estate and jacking up prices. I'm not a historian but this is just the stuff off the top of my head -- there is much more going on here. 

All of these moves and more were purportedly designed to strengthen the economy and lead to prosperity but they have lead to downfall and thus more inflation in the long run. Now we have a giant unstoppable world wide banking cartel that can print money with near reckless abandon. Banks get all the bailouts they want yet hardworking people can't even get out of student loans via bankruptcy and they have to pay all their debts or suffer the consequences -- but a bank intentionally commits large scale financial crime and cripples the economy? Well, heres a sweet bail out for them, which almost no boomer or Gen Xer had any say in. 

Boomers didn't vote for any of this unless they are the Nth percent that became a congressman. Boomers also didn't allow manufacturing and other unskilled labor to go overseas. They didn't do any of this stuff which has resulted in many of the struggles for today's young adults. 

Most boomers just haplessly watched news and listened to the radio, believed whatever they were told, and then went about their day because they were practically all married with children -- and happy with their house and colorful American made vehicle. Most boomers had no idea that American prosperity was a house of cards built on warmongering and banking cartels, just as many people today still don't understand that. "

1. As Palestinians were dying in their 1000s in Syria, these people were no where to be seen.

2. They never advocate for a solution that will get implemented politically or in any other way, for example they will chant: ‘from the river to the sea’ or ‘globalise the intifada’ or ‘we don’t want two states, we want 48’

These are all chants that either advocate for the destruction of Israel or violence against Jews. This drives Jews to leave western countries and move to Israel or just shows support for terrorism.

All of this helps Israel, it strengthens their claim that Jews need their own state and pushes a solution that will never become a reality.

So my conclusion is, they don’t care about Palestinians, they just hate Israel."

Yes, Apple dominates a significant market share and has built a walled ecosystem to maximize profits, but isn’t that their right? Apple’s monopoly is not a stroke of luck but a result of creating highly desired products and offering an unparalleled user experience. This success stems from their talent, smart business strategies, and their role in revolutionizing technology as we know it today.

While I acknowledge that monopolies need regulation and anti-competitive behaviors must be monitored, I believe in the right of a company to maintain a monopoly if it results from genuine talent and consumer choice."

I'm pretty annoyed by this issue because people seem to take it for granted that when children in schools can't read,  it's somehow the school's fault.

There are many problems with this idea, and one critical statistic I want us to keep in mind is this:

>Approximately 40% of students across the nation cannot read at a basic level.  
>  
>Almost 70% of low-income **fourth grade students** cannot read at a basic level.

A typical fourth-grade student in America is 9-10 years old. [Most children learn to read by age 6 or 7](https://www.usnews.com/education/k12/articles/when-do-kids-learn-to-read).

This is because the parents teach their children to read, and this should be expected for any parent to do. The statistic above mentions ""low-income"" students as if the parents are excused from responsibility in teaching their children to read because they're poor.

No. You **make time** to teach your kids to read. I don't care if you work two or three jobs to make ends meet or whatever it is (who is raising your kids, by the way?). Anyway, if you have 15 minutes of free time in your day, you teach them to read. Or at the absolute least, you ensure that the person raising your kids in your stead is ensuring that they learn to read. This is basic stuff.

In short, it is not the school's responsibility to ensure that kids can read. That's the parents' job. This is shown by the fact shared above that most children learn to read at a young age, around 6 or 7. If we have 70% of low-income fourth graders who are illiterate, and 40% of students more broadly who can't read at a basic level, clearly we have an issue in the home. There is an issue with parenting going on here.

And yet politicians and pundits act like this is all the schools' fault, presumably because it's forbidden to dare to blame parents for anything, even when this is the obvious answer when you think about it for more than 5 seconds.

But hey, maybe I'm missing something. Change my view.

First of all, this controversy began with the music video where he twerks on the devil. This sounds pretty awful out of context, but it’s metaphorical. The entire music video is an allusion to the story of Adam and Eve, where he is sent to hell for being gay. 

Him dancing on satan is a symbol for him embracing his sexuality and rejecting the ideology that he must be ashamed it. The entire video is a response to Christian homophobia he’s experienced.

Everything he does is a *response* to radical Christians trying to shame him for his sexuality. The music video, ironically, completely went over people’s heads and he was flooded with comments telling him to turn to God and stop worshipping satan. His most recent stunt is a mockery of the idiotic nature of these Christians. 

In fact, it’s quite brilliant, because he’s making fun of how they completely failed to see the point.

The Middle East is pretty uniquely violent compared to its economic state. Despite the conception a lot of Ameticans have, the HDI or GDP per Capita of most Arab countries is only slightly lower than most Eruppean nations and many parts of the US. Of course there are a million factors, but inbreeding is something very unique. Bin Laden married his first cousin, then berrated the West for permitting homosexuality.

I don't think I need to cite anything linking inbreeding to violence, though I doubt that even exists. It is common knowledge it is linked with lower intelligence, which is linked to rates of impulsivity and violence.

It doesn't necessarily stop even with emigration. 55% of Pakistani-British are married to their first cousin.

This isn't imposing some negative cultural standard on them; it is (as much as anything) objectively in their best interest. The infant mortality rate in these places is off the charts, and cousin produced children are twice as likely to suffer from virtually every type of birth defect.

For people who think Islam is inherently violent: Indonesia is a majority Muslim nation, with little terrorism or violence; despite A LOT of Cold War violence, so people who blame US foreign policy for terrorism cant really explain why SE Asia doesn't have it.

The German Archives report of 1974 estimated **150,000** violent deaths of civilians in East-Central Europe during the 1945 military campaign.

The West German government statistical office issued a report in 1958 that put the number of civilians dead or missing in the expulsions (ethnic cleansing) and forced labor in the USSR at **2,225,000**. Most of missing or expelled or in forced labor died.

In short, the Allies were responsible for as many as **3 million** German civilian deaths in World War Two.

That means, the Allies killed as much as **3.75%** of the German population.

Islam says that Christians/Jews have to either convert, pay jizya (tax to remain in their belief system, jizya has to be so high that disbelievers will get humiliated by its sum) or be killed if the refuse the first two options (Quran 9:29). According to this ideology muslims should never greet Christians & Jews first and when they meet jews/christians on the street, they should force them on the narrowest part of the street (Sahih Muslim 2167 a). Islam also says that Atheists and apostates have to be killed (Sunan an-Nasa'i 4059, Sahih al-Bukhari 6922). Sex-slavery is also allowed in Islam (Quran 4:24) and Muslims are therefore allowed to take captive disbelieving women as sex-slaves, even if their husbands are still alive (Sunan Abi Dawud
2155). Mohammed himself had a sex slave too btw and gave advice how to properly rape them (Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959, Sahih al-Bukhari 2229). Islam also allows child marriages (Quran 65:4) and Mohammed himself married Aisha when she was 6 and raped her when she turned 9 years old (Sahih al-Bukhari
5134). According to Islam, women are less intelligent than men and their witness is less worth because of this reason (Sahih al-Bukhari 2658). These are just some of the horrible and barbaric aspects of this outdated religion and since Mohammeds teachings/doings and the Quran are supposed to be timeless and perfect, Muslims have to emulate all of that. ISIS did that and they represented real Islam actually. I don’t understand how western leftists and progressives overlook all these facts and always defend Islam while calling out legitimate criticism as ,,islamophobia“? Am I wrong for my view? Since i see no way how this ideology is compatible with western values, i want to see your views about this.

I’m sure there are a small percentage of these scenarios truly happening but there are way too many claims of political or celebrity figures being involved with pedo sex trafficking. There’s also a ton of media reports on massive amounts of sex trafficking happening in the U.S. 

Again I believe it does happen but not as much as people argue in my actual life and especially online. 

My opinion of this is actually just my faith in humanity. I absolutely don’t understand how someone could rape a person let alone a child. Being with someone who I don’t feel is attracted to me is an instant boner killer. I couldn’t imagine having to literally fight someone and in the case of trafficking, physically force them to travel. It just is crazy to me. 

When it comes to the pedo stuff, I know it happens but it can’t be that common. I’d say 99% of adults would just see a kid as a kid. You have to be extremely fucked to want to fiddle a kid. 

I feel like the majority of claims against political people is misinformation. Celebrities as well. At the end of the day these are still just people.

1,2024-01-11,CMV: Relationships should be fair,u/Yugoslav1945,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1941srx/cmv_relationships_should_be_fair/,changemyview,"These days, there is too much freedom given to human relationships that manipulation and deception have become more common and it has led to a growing number of lonely men and women. I as a lonely man with autism feel that this capitalist exploitation must be stopped and that all men and women deserve an opportunity to be together without being lonely ever again.

I believe in the idea that under a socialist society, there would be a safe haven for all lonely men and women called ""MAROF"" (Ministry of Marriages, Romantic Relationships, and Friendships). The MAROF would work in a way that it would offer protection and ensure healthy relationships among the working-class. With the major MAROF centers placed in big cities, the smaller ones, as well as suburban areas would have small offices called ""consultaries"" where they would offer advice regarding human relationships.

Consultaries work in a way that if a person were to request a friend or a partner, the consultary would contact the nearest MAROF building which would then perform a search for the most fitting individual who shares like-minded interests with the same person regardless of gender or sexuality. The said partner would be delivered free of charge and MAROF would give a month to determine the mental capability of the person to carry the friendship or relationship with their friend or partner.  
MAROF does not tolerate sexual abuse or any form of violence in human relationships and therefore MAROF has its own network of security called ""Forestalls"". Forestalls are the vanguard of the human relationships and intervene whenever something goes terrible or horrible such as someone being raped or someone being beaten up. Forestalls are to be placed next to consultaries and forestalls can be found within major MAROF buildings. They're basically the police stations but for protecting the human relationships and ensuring that no one breaks the law and does something horrifying to their friend or partner.

In general, love has become something that is paid for with a price in the market instead of kindness. The National Retail Federation in 2019 stated that up to 20 billion USD was spent on Valentine’s Day with an average person spending as much as 162 USD on Valentine’s Day products. What this says is that we couldn’t care less for the capitalist greed that prevails among our lustful minds. However, it is worth mentioning that we should not move towards radical sexualization but focus on a moderate and normal romantic day without capitalist interference or overt sexualization."

* If countries A and B don't burn fossil fuels, neither country will face any severe climate disasters.

* If country A burns fossil fuels but B doesn't, both countries will face climate catastrophe in 70 years but because A will be much richer than B due to the extra energy input, country A is better prepared against such a catastrophe.

From either country's perspective, it only makes sense to burn fossil fuels because climate change is a situation where losses are globalised but gains are localised. No country will have the economic incentive to meaningfully cut greenhouse emissions. As long as fossil fuels are more economical than or at least competitive with green alternatives, climate catastrophe will eventually come and the best play is to enrich yourself before it arrives at the expense of others.

My view is related to several policy positions I hold such as UBI, min. wage, etc. Changing this view would impact how I see those issues, so thanks in advance.

I will start by suggesting that ""living wage"" is regionally defined and unrelated to min. wage. 

Companies have been under fire for trimming payroll costs by reducing workers or adopting automation. For example, grocery stores that routinely have fewer cashiers and opt for increased number of self-checkout lanes. This is sometimes framed as ""greedy corporations can't afford (or refuse) to pay a living wage to their employees so they cut workers to increase the bottom line.""

I view this is an inaccurate portrayal of the motivation of a company. Companies, in most countries, are driven by the desires of their shareholders. More often than not, it is a profit motive. In order to make a profit, people have to buy their good or service. Finding the right mix of price, costs, supply, and demand leads to profit.

If a company, and by extension the shareholders, valued compensating employees a prevailing living wage they could, but that would affect the profit formula and upset the shareholders (investors), one way to do that would be to increase price. This would upset the consumer (in most cases) and reduce demand and reduce profit and upset the shareholders. I posit, consumers demand lower prices, shareholders demand higher profit, the variables left are quality of good or service (cost of goods) and labor costs. A company now has to choose between lowering cost of goods or labor cost. Companies should already have the lowest price for the quality of goods they are selling for their USP, so this is not as variable as it seems at face value. All that is left for a company is to tinker with the cost of labor. 

I will admit there may be cases where a company finds the right mix between price and wages that satisfies both consumers and shareholders (we see this in professional services and high cost consumable markets), but my view is more specifically for mass market offering. Additionally, trimming the cost of highly compensated employees is a non-starter, to me, simply because it results in a marginal increase in employee wages across the organization and without increasing margin proportionally to the loss.

I also understand the moral argument, but I generally see that as irrelevant because the framing of the objection would be framing the companies decision as immoral, when that is the point of the CMV."

1,2024-01-11,CMV: Modern dating in a Westernized society as a man with autism is an absolute nightmare.,u/Prudent-Reporter-400,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1948k37/cmv_modern_dating_in_a_westernized_society_as_a/,changemyview,"So before I elaborate further I just want to define the key term pivotal to this CMV. **Autism Spectrum Disorder** or **Autism** is a neurodevelopmental disability that affects a person's social, communication, and emotional functions. It affects about 1 in 56 children in the United States as of 2023 and it is becoming the fasting growing developmental disability in contemporary medicine. So, now that I mentioned the key term, is it how time to mention the problems that have been introduced to modern dating and how autism compounds this. Since 2010, concepts like #MeToo, dating apps, the rise in popularity of online porn, hookup culture (in my opinion, hookup culture has been around since the 1960s with the sexual revolution, but I digress), changing gender roles, and ghosting has made dating more unpleasant for all people but especially men in general. So many women on these dating apps get tons of likes and matches within an hour while *most* men had it much harder finding matches on dating apps. This wasn't a thing prior to the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. Being constantly rejected and ghosted on dating apps is bad for your mental health and we are seeing loneliness, and a general mental health epidemic among Gen Alpha, Gen Z, and Millenial men.

&#x200B;

Then, we have changing gender roles and hookup culture that skews romantic relationships towards sex and who is the best ""alpha male"" and ""alpha female"". Most people who use dating apps and are under the age of 40 in the US, Australia, UK, and Canada are primarily motivated with one night stands and hookups rather than long-term relationships. Personally, as someone who is sex-positive and center-left, it is none of my business what consenting adults do in private spaces nor is it my place to shame people for engaging in consensual sexual activity regardless of my religious beliefs. That said, this overt skew towards hookups rather than long-term relationships and marriages is really disheartening for someone who wants to have kids and be with a partner to old age (ideally). With so many young people into sexual relationships as early as the first date, these young and even older men would have to condition themselves to enjoy the dopamine and oxytocin rush of sexual activity rather than the bond associated with a long-term committed relationship. 

&#x200B;

I think frequent hookups and one night stands leads to men being emotionally unstable. Heck, there were some studies that had a causal link between men having multiple sexual partners and a significantly increased risk of suicide. Part of being in a relationship to feel secure and at ease with your partner, and while everyone values things differently, not being emotionally connected due to frequent hookups is bad for your mental health. Also we need to address the #MeToo movement. Now, I want to make it clear that I do not condone sexual assault and we need to make society a more welcoming place for sexual assault victims. That said, there are some evil women out there who can and do make false sexual assault or domestic violence accusations with the intent to ruin the life of their male partner. This concern and issue with trust besides your partner contracting an STI to you without your knowledge due to cheating or inadequate use of contraception is a reason why straight men in general choose to go the MGTOW way and stay away from romantic relationships due to fear of getting a serious STI, or a false rape/abuse accusation. 

&#x200B;

Now, while what I just mentioned is a huge pain for neurotypical men, for men with autism, these contemporary problems in dating can be so overwhelming that it's not uncommon for many high-functioning men with autism to be virgins who never dated up to their 50s. Men with autism, while there are variances in difficulties in communicating and socialization, in general have it much harder navigating these issues due to a lower level of executive function and the need to explicit clues in order to resolve issues. Many men with autism do not know what ghosting is and why its so commonplace until a friend tells them. Men with autism do not know how to navigate dating problems as well as neurotypical men because they need to be explicitly trained rather than having these skills as second nature. Also, people with autism usually are more vulnerable, trusting, and naive about the malice of others, which puts them at greater risk of manipulation in a relationship.

&#x200B;

Lastly, there are the dating preferences. There are just some women who will not date a person with autism because they do not want to deal with the baggage of dating a person with a disability. Now, I personally believe that people are entitled to their preferences and nobody owes anyone a relationship. Also, while dating preferences are technically discriminatory, because you are choosing a person abritraily due to perceived traits, I do not think these preferences are bigoted or ableist. Nobody should be shamed for not wanting to date a person with autism. However, on the other hand, it really sucks that a surprising number of women just do not want to date men like me because of a disability we have no control over and it feels so hurtful to be rejected for who you are.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Modern dating in the Westernized world sucks for everyone, but especially men. Changing social norms and increased pressure from hookup culture is having a negative effect on the psyche of men. Also, there are some women who make false abuse accusations that are very scary for men. Being a man with autism makes this scenario even worse because you are expected to know all of these social cues on your own and there are women who just do not want to date men with autism."

Terrible things will continue to happen, and international struggles will not skip a beat for any sort of piss poor demonstration.

For the rest of us, I'd like to start with a metaphor.

An animal that has its back against the wall and is being threatened will lash out with everything it has in order to save itself. Multiply that a thousand-fold if its children are being threatened as well.

I'd like to posit that this is how Israel will react if the war it started on Hamas as a retaliation for the October 7th massacre will be stopped before Hamas is eliminated, for example by the trial currently ongoing in Hague.

To Israel, it is currently fighting a war for its very survival. The reasons are numerous, but here are a few:

1. If Hamas is not eliminated they will continue firing rockets into Israel
2. If Hamas is not eliminated they will regroup and make another October 7th style attack on Israel
3. If Hamas is not eliminated the people living near the Gazan border will never be able to return home (who would live in a city where mass murder and rape happened, and where the people who did it are nearby plotting the next massacre?). We're talking about around 100k people.
4. If Hamas is not eliminated and the hostages are not returned no Israeli will ever feel safe again.
5. If Hamas is not eliminated then Israel will be seen as weak by its neighbors in the middle east, which will eventually lead to Israel being attacked.

These are legitimate fears that Israeli people have. You might agree or not, but it doesn't matter for this argument. This is what Israelis think and feel for the most part.

Now, if you tell Israel that it can't continue in its goal of eliminating Hamas, all these fears come true.

Have you heard of the idea, that if you've gotten punished anyway for a crime, even if you didn't do it, you might as well do it now, because you've already received the punishment?

If Israel has to continue the war in Gaza despite the world punishing it for committing ""genocide"", then I believe Israel might begin caring less about civilian casualties in order to accomplish its goal. 

Israel might try to speed up the war in order to finish it faster, meaning with less precision and more casualties. 

I really don't want to see this happening, but I fear this might be the result.

If the world really cares about the lives of innocent Palestinians, I think they need to start trying to understand why Israel is fighting in Gaza, what Israelis are really fearing, and see how they can help alleviate those fears.

1,2024-01-11,CMV: There is a double standard with respect to age gaps,u/Ok_Spell1407,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194afjy/cmv_there_is_a_double_standard_with_respect_to/,changemyview,"The socially acceptable age gap has narrowed in recent generations, mostly because of our improved understanding of the psychological dynamics of them. While it’s common to see married boomers and Gen Xers with 8-10 year age gaps, millennials and Gen Zs tend to see even a 4-5 year gap as too big to be normal, no matter the age. This is good, because while I can’t be bothered about how people live their lives, at least we’ve normalized close-in-age relationships and marriages. 

What bothers me though is the double standard when it comes to the genders involved. The stereotypical example is some trashy 19-20 year old with a 15-16 year old girlfriend. Society strongly frowns upon this and it can be illegal depending on the location or circumstances. Usually the guy in the relationship hasn’t had much success in dating, and also craves his youth back. The issue with that is that’s pretty much all he wants. The maturity gap is so big that there can’t possibly be a strong connection between them. The girl likewise usually craves something besides love too. She often craves adulthood. Her man will get her into adult circles and treat her like an adult. The problem is that she is NOT an adult and is basically getting her childhood stolen. These relationships hardly ever last, and breaking them off comes with the trauma of losing a big part of your childhood to a relationship in which you were being used.

Now let’s pretend the girl is the one who’s 19-20. I see this all the time. A freshman or sophomore girl in college getting with a sophomore or junior boy in high school. The boy is 15-16. I think this is equally immoral because the wants are the same. The girl in this situation is usually craving the middle school/early high school cute romance back. She enjoys bringing her cutie boyfriend along with her to college/ adult social circles. He loves the affection he’s getting from not just her, but her friends. This is wrong, because again, it makes the boy grow up faster than he should. They’re with each other for the wrong reasons. She wants youth and a cutie patutie and he wants to get himself in the 20 year old social scene. But how do people react to this? The girls friends think it’s soo cute. And the boys friends are impressed that he’s with an older girl. Unlike the girl who got with an older guy, people don’t see the boy as having been used. They see him as accomplished. But the result is still the same, a chunk of childhood lost because of a relationship that is almost certain to fail statistically speaking. I can say from observation that there were countless high school guys at my school who were popular and had honors grades but that all fell apart once they got in the college party scene through older girlfriends.

 I have yet to see any rational reason why society views these two situations so differently. It’s more based on stereotypes than actual real life results."
324,2024-01-11,CMV: It Should Be Illegal for Politicians to Tell Blatant Lies,u/VTHockey11,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194axin/cmv_it_should_be_illegal_for_politicians_to_tell/,changemyview,"This is Trump-inspired. I was just listening to Trump speaking to reporters not five minutes ago after coming out of his civil trial in New York where he has already been found guilty of massively inflating the value of many of his properties and holdings and they are determining what the punishment/fine should be. He stood in front of reporters and stated, time and again, that ""this was the new way Democrats were stealing the elections"" and repeatedly said that all of these trials and charges he is facing are being coordinated by Biden. 

I understand that the news media can rebut these claims and can follow-up his conferences with fact-checks, but I don't think that is sufficient as he is consistently allowed a megaphone in which he can state huge, incredibly damaging lies that hurt our country and there is no reprecussion for doing so. 

I do not believe that politicians should be held liable/that it should be illegal for them to tell lies in that for example, they say they will do ""X"" for their constituents but then that doesn't happen. What I mean is it should be illegal to make such incredibly damaging and damning claims when there is literally no evidence to support it. This is because the types of claims Trump is making are the type that can lead to true disarray, hatred, anger, and potentially even civil war if allowed to carry on unpunished. 

When Trump tells people that Biden is coordinating charges against him when there is literally no evidence of this his supporters believe it. And this type of claim is the type of claim that angers and infuriates his supporters. They truly believe that the election was stolen (even though he had many, many chances in court to prove his claims and failed in every single one) and they truly believe that Biden is somehow coordinating an effort to put Trump behind bars.

The simple fact is, Trump clearly was told by many, many individuals that there was no evidence of fraud in the election but he plowed forward with ""stolen"" claims anyways. He called the Georgia secretary of state and asked him to find just enough votes for him to win. He did all these things and there are consequences. He brought this upon himself, not Biden. 

Why shouldn't it be illegal for candidates to tell these types of lies? In a world where gaslighting the public leads to true national division, can we really continue to allow such dangerous lies to be legally okay? What is the end of this type of lying? Where does it lead? It can't lead anywhere good and it infuriates me that he is allowed to just straight-up lie without consequences.

I'm genuinely curious why it's okay for candidates to do this."

I’ve gotten more and more into politics each year and I’ve found that I lean more with left-wing ideas. But I don’t really understand conservatism especially from a historic perspective.

When I say that I mean I feel like we’re in this cycle where a controversial issue comes up, the left takes a position, the right takes the opposing view, time flies, legislation changes favoring the left, more time flies, we understand this as a social norm now, new issue comes up, the right completely disassociates from that last issue. I think the most recent one is gay marriage but, suffrage for virtually every group, climate change, social security and basically every hit button issue of the past i feel like are in the same boat. 

I say this not to insult, rather to learn more about the other side. Because as I am left leaning I don’t really abide by political tribalism. If someone can explain or enlighten me, I’d genuinely appreciate it.

Again, sorry if I come off as aggressive or abrasive.

1,2024-01-11,CMV: The creation of Israel was an attempt to commit genocide,u/wackypoodle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194csj3/cmv_the_creation_of_israel_was_an_attempt_to/,changemyview,"From 1881 to 1972, the Jewish people were subjected to wave upon wave of ethnic cleansing and genocide:

|1903–06|about 2,000 Jews murdered across Russia, Ukraine, Moldova|
|:-|:-|
|1915-17|250,000 Jews were exiled from their homes by the Russian army, maybe 100,000 of them died, while their British and French allies looked the other way|
|1917–20|up to 250,000 Jews across Russia and Ukraine were murdered by the Red and White armies|
|1933-45|up to 6 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis, while the British, Americans and Russians refused to bomb the railways and camps|
|1948-72|some 900,000 Jews were expelled from Arab and Muslim countries, with 650,000 moving to Israel|

In 1947, the United Nations voted to create the State of Israel. According to Albert Einstein in 1955, this ""state was internationally approved and recognized largely for the purposes of rescuing the renmant of the Jewish people from unspeakable horrors of persecution and oppression.""

In the same 1955 speech, Einstein said ""It is, therefore, a bitter paradox to find that a State which was destined to be a shelter for a martyred people is itself threatened by grave dangers to its own security. The universal conscience cannot be indifferent to such a peril.""

Some seven decades later, Israeli security is worse than it has ever been. Around 28,000 Israelis have died in wars and terrorism since 1948.

Israel is now hated and condemned throughout the world for defending itself after a horrific massacre in which 1,300 of its citizens were butchered, 200 were kidnapped, and 5,000 were wounded by radical religious fundamentalists.

In 1947, the world created another problem, the Palestinian Problem. Since then, the world has done very little to help them. The Jews - the victims of European hatred - were left to deal with the problem themselves.

Sure, Israel has received massive aid and weaponry, but we have been left to fight for our lives.

Moreover, over the decades, Israel's Arab neighbors, the Palestinians, and Islamist groups in Lebanon and elsewhere have also received massive aid from their allies, including very significant weaponry. Very little has been done by the world to prevent the arming of Palestinian militant groups.

In the wake of the resurgence of Jew hatred in the past 20 years (thanks to the Internet), and the intensely hateful rhetoric in recent months, it's clear hatred of Jews never went away. Christians and Muslims have hatred of Jews built into their religious dogmas, so what else should I expect?

I've now come to the realisation that the Jews were allowed to create the State of Israel not to save them but to finish them off.

In other words, the creation of Israel was an attempt to commit a final genocide against the Jews.

Before you guys post about Christianity and whatever: I am not a Christian and I am originally from a Muslim country. Please stop with the whataboutism, since I would rather live in a society where Christians are the majority than in an Islamic society. 

Islam is a deeply fascist and intolerant ideology which is not compatible with western societies. Islam says that Christians/Jews have to either convert, pay jizya (tax to remain in their belief system, jizya has to be so high that disbelievers will get humiliated by its sum) or be killed if the refuse the first two options (Quran 9:29). According to Islam, Muslims should not greet Christians/Jews first and if they confront them on the streets, they should force them on the narrowest part of the road (Sahih Muslim 2167 a). Islam also says that Atheists and apostates have to be killed (Sunan an-Nasa'i 4059, Sahih al-Bukhari 6922). Sex-slavery is also allowed in Islam (Quran 4:24) and Muslims are therefore allowed to take captive disbelieving women as sex-slaves, even if their husbands are still alive (Sunan Abi Dawud 2155). Mohammed himself had a sex slave too btw and gave advice how to properly rape them (Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959, Sahih al-Bukhari 2229). Islam also allows child marriages (Quran 65:4) and Mohammed himself married Aisha when she was 6 and raped her when she turned 9 years old (Sahih al-Bukhari 5134). Islam also states that women are less intelligent than men and that their witness is less worth because of that (Sahih al-Bukhari 2658). These are just some of the horrible and barbaric aspects of this outdated religion and since Mohammeds teachings/doings and the Quran are supposed to be timeless and perfect, Muslims have to emulate all of that. ISIS did that and they represented real Islam actually. I hope you western people wake up before it's too late, since showing tolerance towards intolerance is and will be a grave mistake. So how is my view potentially wrong, when my views are backed up by literal and undeniable Islamic teachings?"

However, after having my first kiss a few weeks ago with someone I truly felt a connection with, it made me want to write this post as a way of maybe finally putting all the potentially hindering thoughts and beliefs behind, the biggest of which is how I have nothing to be proud of myself in my life.

Let me give a bit of context on why I believe this.

1. I'm mildly autistic, have GAD and dysthymia, and I experienced a plethora of mistreatment/exclusion/betrayal in my adolescence and young adulthood due to my differences from others (differences that I certainly knew of but couldn't place a name on due to my parents hiding my diagnosis for 5 years after I was diagnosed at 14).
2. Although I was a part of the swimming team for most of high school, I never won any major individual awards to make me stand out from my peers.
3. I have no friend ""squad"" to do things with unlike most people my age. Just one-off friendships.
4. I'll be 25 in 3 months, and I only had my first kiss a few weeks ago. I'm still a virgin, while lots of other people my age are engaged/married to people they've been with since high school/undergrad.
5. I'm short (5'6.5""), overweight (working on it), balding (gonna travel to Turkey to fix this), in addition to the aforementioned autism.
6. I'm Canadian, but I attended a small community college for my undergrad, and although I am in a better known university for my master's, I'm only planning to study epidemiology for my PhD which is the best possible field I could think of transitioning out of nutrition sciences, but is obviously nothing compared to all the people around me becoming professions that will actually own nice cars and houses, and travel extensively.
7. Speaking of traveling, I feel as though I haven't traveled as much compared to so many other people my age including people I know and Youtubers. But to be transparent, I've traveled to 14 countries (some of which are my home country of Iran and 3 Caribbean resorts so they don't really count so let's just say 10). However, I still feel inferior cause I've never been to places like Hawaii, Australia, or any US national park at this age.
8. Going back to income, my family will never be anything more than middle-class, as will I.
9. I live in Toronto, which is honestly one of the most overpriced and overrated places in the world, especially considering that it offers nothing that Vancouver does, yet is almost as expensive.

So yeah, these are just some of the thoughts that I have in my mind, but I'm open to hearing your guys' counterpoints to this view of mine, or even your experiences that might help me to maybe not feel as bad as I have been feeling about these things for the longest time."

However, getting angry at this, TV or not, is unhinged and baseless.

More specifically, they treat overpourers like assholes and criminals who are literally stealing money out of the owners pockets. Couple examples:

1. ""Grandpa got run over by his grandkids."" The family who owned the bar fired two bartenders who were overpouring and it was very clear they had no idea they were overpouring and obviously not overpouring on purpose or with malice intended. Meanwhile, the grandkids (who owned the bar) were taking cash from the register, caught on camera, left and right. But they acted like the overpouring bartenders were the thieves. They're not thieves. Jon Taffer and his crew are bar experts, and this could have been a training/learning opportunity not utilized.
2. ""Don't tell the mom the bar is dead"" Shawn Ford, one of Jon Taffer's experts, comes into the guys bar and berates him for serving a 9% ABV beer in a Mason Jar and not a ""snifter,"" going on about how it's ""irresponsible"" and even having a full-on shit fit and breaking his glassware. Sorry, but it's not that fucking serious. If Shawn Ford came into my house and started breaking my shit, I'd drag him out by his man bun. Total douche move that nobody thinks is unhinged and wrong. He comes off as douchy and condescending by doing that."

This is more likely in europe because they are getting really good treatment compared to some other refugees from other countries so they are more likely to just stay and assimilate. The longer the war keeps going, the higher the chance of them not returning and assimilating

Second of all, aid is declining dramatically. US officials have stated that they would keep supporting Ukraine but not on the levels from 2022-2023. Decline in aid could have dramatic consequences for ukraine because they have gotten more aid in 2 years than the aid the USA gave the soviets in ww2(https://www.statista.com/chart/28489/ukrainian-military-humanitarian-and-financial-aid-donors/) so Ukraine is really depended on this aid. So the in the future aid to Ukraine will decline making it another reason why it will get worse for Ukraine if the war keeps going.

And lastly, ukraine as a country is on pause. Ukraine is in a war economy right now and can’t develop or grow economically because of this war."

Following the release of Aquaman 2, I couldn't help but notice a considerable number of people actively opting out of watching the movie due to the controversies surrounding actress Amber Heard and some decisions she made in her personal life. It raises an intriguing question about the intersection of personal behavior and professional careers.

In my view, making what could be considered as unwise choices in one's personal life should not automatically be a determining factor in their professional trajectory. After all, being flawed in personal matters does not necessarily correlate with one's abilities as an actor. I'm specifically referring to issues like infidelity and other personal matters that, while significant on a personal level, might not directly impact one's professional competence.

However, it's crucial to note that my perspective here is geared toward relatively ""smaller"" issues and doesn't extend to cases where an actor is involved in severe criminal activities, is a sex offender, or a ped*phile. In such cases, the line between personal and professional life becomes more complex and may rightfully influence public perception and professional opportunities."
0,2024-01-11,CMV: It's in America's interest to greatly scale back our partnership with Israel,u/jadacuddle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194f7t6/cmv_its_in_americas_interest_to_greatly_scale/,changemyview,"While our special relationship with Israel may have been sensible during the Cold War, I think it currently flies in the face of what is best for our country.

A lot of people like to claim that Israel is an extension of American interests in the Middle East, but the exact opposite is true. Israel uses our resources and weapons for their objectives, rather than the other way around. Our relationship is a textbook example of the tail wagging the dog. 

Israel’s bad relationship with Iran screws over our Middle East policy. They threw a fit when Obama attempted to ease tensions with the JCPOA. They got us to burn a ton of political capital to pull together the Abraham Accords.  They also constantly pressure us to engage in exercises that simulate a war with Iran, which ratchet up tensions and do nothing but draw us closer towards war.  

Our closeness also severely hurts our image in the Middle East. It’s a common view in the Arab world that Israel and America are joined at the hip, so whatever Israel does wrong can be blamed on America. Thus, we take the heat for West Bank settlements, for any war crimes Israel may commit, etc etc. Detaching ourselves from Israel would remove this albatross from around our neck and give us far more diplomatic flexibility.

The United States gives more foreign aid to Israel than to any other country (except for Ukraine, although that is something of an anomaly), even though Israel is now a prosperous country with the 17th highest GDP per capita in the world. Israel gets consistent diplomatic backing from Washington, which almost always takes Israel's side in regional disputes. Most importantly, however, these various elements of support are given nearly unconditionally. In other words, Israel gets American backing even when it does things the United States opposes, such as building settlements in the Occupied Territories. Israel's actions are rarely criticized by American officials, and certainly not by anyone aspiring to high office. The few steps we take to mold Israel’s actions, like sanctioning individual West Bank settlers, are incredibly light and accomplish nothing of significance. When they threatened us with unleashing their nuclear arsenal on the Middle East in the Yom Kippur war, we responded by…… giving them more aid.

Our partnership with Israel just doesn’t advance our interests in a way that sufficiently makes up for the damage they do. Our only overriding objective in the Middle East is to prevent any one state from getting an oil monopoly by dominating the Gulf, which is why we protect the Gulf monarchies from Iran and why we drove Saddam out of Kuwait. Israel has basically no effect on this goal. They’re located far away from the Gulf, have no assets deployed there, and have poor relations with the few Gulf states that recognize them at all. The UAE alone is far more essential to our mission in the Gulf than Israel ever has been.

In short, our relationship with Israel has numerous drawbacks and none of the upsides come close to making up for that deficit. I believe it would be more sensible to back away from them and instead have a normal and cordial relationship with the Israelis."

I am still not out. Only two people know this as of today. A close friend and my therapist. 


I have decided to not come out, until people stop caring. Whether it is the 'phobes or the LGBT community.


The reasons are these:


1) I will reduce my dating pool significantly. I don't want that. Personality-wise I barely fit in rn but for other reasons. Even in high school I was considered weird AF. I don't want more of that shit. 


2) Some of the stuff happening that are associated with pride and the LGBT are questionable. 


From crazies that go nude to parades, the people who post the most depressing shit on forums due to the discrimination they face, etc. 


Also, I am not sure if it's just me but many queer-oriented forums and spaces have a weird culture that I am not a fan of


Not everyone is like this sure. But I don't want to associate myself with something like this.


Besides. I can't choose who I like to fuck. Being proud of it is like being proud for having blue eyes or being white or black. It's not an achievement. 


I want zero association with this


3) The people on the internet and (potentially) friends or family saying ""how valid I am"" or even feel pity for me for the potential discrimination I'll face or something.


To me, being viewed as a victim is a greater insult than *actually being* one. I don't want that for myself.


All of these points converge to one thing: People give too much of a shit about sexuality. 


Wether it is celebrated or hated. I want neither celebration, nor hate obviously. I just want to be left alone and fuck whoever I want with no one caring.


In order to give you a delta the two need to be proven to me:


1) People won't stop caring about this in my lifetime. 


2) There's no need for such dedication from my part.


These things will change my view, since that'll mean that hiding (or at least being too neurotic about it) isn't worth it and there's no point."
158,2024-01-11,CMV: Young men aren't failing to date because they're misogynistic incels. They're failing to date because they're adjusting to growing pains.,u/Artistic-Stretch-439,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194g9su/cmv_young_men_arent_failing_to_date_because/,changemyview,"When I say this, keep in mind I'm talking about dating casually or seriously. Not relationships, but the act of getting another person either romantically or sexually interested in you. 

In the last 30 years, there's been a lot of change in the culture surrounding dating and relationships. [Young men are disproportionately single and disproportionately sexless in comparison to young women](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/08/for-valentines-day-5-facts-about-single-americans/). I think this is because Gen Z is the first generation to fully enter the dating scene in this new frontier that is unlike any other. The overwhelming majority of the time (in the West) men are the ones playing an active role in dating. Men pursue, have to learn to appeal to women, have to make themselves attractive and be chosen above all other men pursuing that specific woman. Dating is a skillset, a skillset that from the 1950s to the 2010s has been pretty consistent with not huge amounts of variation.

Now with Gen Z coming of age, I believe the dating world has been tossed on it's head for the new generation. As a result all dating advice we are receiving is typically outdated or so fresh that it is not tried and true. We're in a new frontier where your average woman could have 100+ different men who are interested in her on her phone. The internet has made it so that men are now no longer competing with just their local population, but even globally.  These are just a few of the struggles that exist now that didn't exist then.

I think that there's a prevailing opinion on reddit that men who struggle with dating do so because they're evil incel adjacent misogynists and I think this is just the ""Just World Fallacy"" coming out. I think that the majority of men are normal people with normal views. Even then, men who are bigots find love all the time as there's also a lot of both female bigots, and women who do not particularly mind bigotry.

I think the issue is simply growing pains. I mean, I can't go to my dad for dating advice. Hell, I can't even go to my older brothers. Their advice is all within a different context, a context so different it just can't work. The assumption that I and every man who struggles are just misogynists who want to hurt women implies that all men who are sexually and romantically successful are inherently good men which just isn't true."
1,2024-01-11,CMV: Reading smut in public or in front of children is just as disgusting as watching a porn video on mute in public or in front of children.,u/Mission-Medium-8591,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194gemb/cmv_reading_smut_in_public_or_in_front_of/,changemyview,"Tagged NSFW for obvious adult content.  Just as the title suggests, if you’re reading a “smut” book in public or around children, then you seriously need to reevaluate your morals.  

Yes, I also believe an addiction to smut books is the same as a porn addiction.  One of my family members decided to start a fun hobby of writing smut books and sharing some raunchy quotes on her public Instagram page.  She straight up deleted all pictures of her children from her page and replaced it all with smut quotes/pictures.  She even picks up extra work shifts where she admits to reading smut, and drops her kids off at my parents house then goes home and twerks in front of a fucking Christmas tree with smut quotes popping up in the video.

The fact that so many people openly admit to reading smut is just insane to me.  It would be no different but somehow much more frowned upon if I started posting about my favorite porn video scenes.

Do that shit in private but openly discussing it like that is messed up.  *ESPECIALLY* since I know this family member reads in front of her kids since her daughter wanted a kindle for Christmas so she could be like mommy…a kindle that she won from submitting into some smut giveaway that she posted to her Instagram…

Anyways.  That’s my view.  Feel free to prove me wrong."

He was suspended from the nba and he was even dropped by Nike the same company who uses child labour to make their products. 

Following this everyone supported both the NBA and Nike taking these actions. However I just think it’s odd that there is so much outcry over a players tweets when the billion dollar company sponsoring him and the NBA have been using child labor for years overseas despite it being illegal in America and clearly immoral. I’m not saying what Kyrie did was right because it wasn’t and it was hurtful to the Jewish community but I don’t believe one persons Twitter is a bigger problem then the NBA being sponsored by a company using child labor or Nike who is still using child Labor.

Cancel culture to me is just a way to tear down anyone famous or someone who makes a mistake or does something wrong. It’s not about justice for people being hurt etc it’s just a public shaming that forces said person to make a public apology. Not saying people shouldn’t have consequences for doing things but often times what people did is minuscule to the surrounding events or associated parties."

39,2024-01-11,CMV: It’s time to be more self reliant and form trusted communities. The world isn’t getting better anytime soon,u/C4rva,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194hhaw/cmv_its_time_to_be_more_self_reliant_and_form/,changemyview,"Firstly, I want to be wrong here. I don’t come to this conclusion easily or lightly.  

From my point of view the systems we rely on to survive are fundamentally broken.  I’ll start with things every human needs: shelter, water, food, and healthcare. 

Shelter:
Unhoused populations in the US continue to increase. Available housing is being purchased as investments at an alarming rate. More people are moving into cars, multigenerational housing, and literally camping.  My understanding is that our current approach to housing is if you can’t work and can’t produce you don’t deserve housing.  As corporations continue to purchases and build apartments we’ll see home ownership decline and essentially have a “company store” situation where most available housing is owned by corporations and any semblance of wealth is pumped out as profit to corporations. There will be little to no inventive to keep these apartments and housing safe and government representative are continually lobbied for less restrictive laws for landlords. 

Water:
Water is currently being massively overused and aquifers are being pumped entirely too fast. We’re already seeing land sinking due to this. (Norfolk Va) Some municipalities are starting to pump treated fresh water back into aquifers to prevent land sinkage. We have zero idea what level of microplastic we may be contaminating our aquifers with or what results that might have. Agriculture continues to use water in an unsustainable way for the feeding and watering of livestock. At no other time in our planet has water been contaminated with human generated chemicals that we have little understanding of how they may impact human health.  

Food:
Our food system is not sustainable. Agriculture is profit driven and has zero interest in either the health of the people eating the food or the impact it has on the environment. Our supply chain for food is dependent on fuel and transport. Any spike in fuel prices could easily make many foods unaffordable for many people.  Any major attack on US soil could rapidly impact food chain supply and absolutely plunge urban areas into shortages. Most people do not have enough food to survive a month long food shortage.  

Healthcare:
Healthcare is becoming entirely profit driven. As older practitioners retire and leave medicine we are losing knowledge and skill. They are  being replaced with alternatives such as  NPs getting online degrees and increasing patient loads. These options are cheaper for healthcare administrators. So this is the way it’s going to go. The industry is not motivated to provide good care, it’s motivated to provide profitable care. 

Even if you don’t agree with all of the above, I think we can agree that at least some of the above can be accepted as a premise.  Furthermore, I don’t see a future that does not include political instability in the next two years.  

If you made it through my thought vomit thusfar thank you. 

With the above acknowledged, I ask that you change my view that becoming self reliant and building small communities of trusted neighbors is necessary and we should start now. 

In an effort to minimize the above systemic failures, I think it’s time to start building small communities of self reliant people. I envision off grid sustainable homes and a network of people that each bring knowledge of medicine, farming, education, and other skill sets."

I sense that many people think systemic racism is the main cause or the root cause. 

I think we need to define what systemic racism is. The conservatives say it’s some law written where it intentionally targets a minority and i can’t think of one that exists today. The US had an awful history of racism and everyone agrees but at some point we need to put that behind us and move forward. 

Liberals like to point to trends that they see in society and they call it systemic racism. But these trends have many contributing factors. And yes racism is one of them but not the only one.

I think people who support this idea that the system is racist simply have the victim mentality. It would be naive to expect the world to be fair. One way or another those who are struggling need to find a way to better their quality of life. They can’t expect someone else to do it for them. I know this isn’t a popular opinion but it is reality."

1,2024-01-11,"CMV: People in Western countries have become less attractive on average, and it is bad for society",u/RaindropDripDropTop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194k6xv/cmv_people_in_western_countries_have_become_less/,changemyview,"Obviously there are still a ton of attractive people in Western countries, especially if you go to certain major cities. However, I'm speaking purely in terms of averages. This especially applies to North America, but it's an issue in Western countries in general. 

The biggest cause of this issue is obesity rates. In the US in particular, about 40% of the adult population are obese, and about 70% are either overweight or obese. I'm sorry, but having this many fat people lowers the average physical attractiveness of the population by a huge margin. I'm sure some people will argue that attraction is subjective, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, which are reasonable arguments on paper in an academic sense. But let's just be real, obesity is simply not attractive, and we all know it. 

Even if a person has average genetics, average face, relatively plain appearance, if they are relatively fit and healthy then they are still going to be pretty attractive looking (maybe not hot, but at least reasonably attractive). If you take that same person with average genetics and plain appearance, but they are 40 lbs overweight and above a certain body fat percentage, they are not going to be attractive. 

If you go to a city or country where people are generally healthy and fit, you will see so many people walking around who are average looking people genetically speaking, but they still look reasonably attractive. Then if you go to a place, let's say somewhere in the US, where most people are fat, then attractive people are much more uncommon to see. There are millions and millions of people in the US and other western countries who could be attractive, but it's hidden under large amounts of fat. 

Obesity is definitely the biggest cause of this, but I'm sure there are other causes. For example, I've seen people saying that average testosterone levels have declined in men, which definitely could be a factor. I'd say there are some other minor factors, such as modern fashion trends, e.g. things like tattoos, hair dye, piercings, counterculture clothing styles, unkempt beards and hairstyles, excessive make up, etc. becoming more common. 

In my opinion, this is bad for society. First of all, aesthetics are important. Things like beautiful architecture, art, and nature make a place have a better atmosphere to be in. The same things applies to people in public. It's just a better atmosphere to be in when you are surrounded by reasonably good looking people. I'm not saying everyone has to be a model, but even having average Joe's and plain Jane's being healthy and natural looking and presentable is much more preferable than what we have now. It's just better vibes. 

Second of all, this definitely affects the dating pool. There are so many young people today who complain about the modern dating scene and how it sucks, well I'm convinced that the biggest cause of this issue is that the dating pool generally isn't that great for young people today in Western countries. Obviously there are other factors like social media, but I am convinced that a huge part of this is that huge chunks of the population just don't want to date the people that are in their ""league."" I'm not singling any gender out either, this applies to both men and women."
482,2024-01-11,CMV: Men have to put much more effort into dating and relationships than women,u/Lazy-Pomegranate-448,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194krnl/cmv_men_have_to_put_much_more_effort_into_dating/,changemyview,"Ok, ok… I know some people here are mad already. But hear me out: I actually want to change my view.

There’s a lot of disgusting shit on the internet (and out in the world) talking about “women not belonging in politics” or someone being mad at women for not having sex with them. Hopefully we agree that’s all shitty.

So please don’t respond with “FeMiniSm EnDs WheN ThE cheCK GeTs tO tHe TaBLe”. I don’t want to hear that garbage.

Anyway, there’s a lot of expectations women have for men in a relationship. Men are supposed to make the first move, plan the date, and pick the location. You will also pay. This doesn’t stop (in my experience) when you’re going steady either, that’s just how it is.

There are also many expectations for a man to court a women: Putting himself behind her always, being a shoulder to lean on while staying emotionally stoic, and hell, even dying for her if something terrible happens.

The man is expected to display his romance in creative and challenging ways. Asking a girl to prom or proposing in a way that is acceptable and not lame takes effort. If you just ask you’re not gonna get a yes.

Now everyone has their job in this world and everyone has to work for what they want. That’s all fine and dandy.

But in contrast, to me it looks like women sit there and wait for a man to approach. Then on a date, she watches him to see if his behavior is good enough, without much regard to her own. She excepts gifts and favors without guilt, even expects them.

There are no expectations for her to do anything for a man except basic politeness (not that there should be any expectation). Women do not have to show much affection beyond intimacy. There are no grand displays or gestures they have to live up to (again, not that there should be any).

Women are judged much more on their appearance - I will concede that. I’m not convinced that alone is as much as the work guys need to put in though.

But like, obviously I’ve only lived my life as a dude. It’s is very possible I’m missing something and could be pretty biased. So I’d really like to hear the other side of it.

And again please no sexist bullsh*t. I know this is Reddit, but I’m tired of hearing people just insult women when I ask questions like this."

1,2024-01-11,CMV: A person that can think faster can run faster,u/MarshyBars,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194kwv3/cmv_a_person_that_can_think_faster_can_run_faster/,changemyview,"Introduction:

The assertion that a person who can think faster is also capable of running faster poses an interesting interplay between cognitive abilities and physical performance. The hypothesis suggests a direct correlation between the speed at which an individual processes information mentally and their ability to translate that into swift and efficient physical movements, particularly in activities like running. In this exploration, we'll delve into the various facets of this argument, considering both the theoretical and practical aspects of the relationship between cognitive processing speed and running speed.

Theoretical Framework:

At the core of this hypothesis is the notion that faster cognitive processing directly translates into quicker motor responses. If an individual can think at a rate twice as fast as another, it follows that their ability to send commands to the muscles, coordinate movements, and make split-second decisions during a run would be superior. This theoretical framework aligns with the idea that the brain acts as the central command center, orchestrating movements and responses based on the information it processes.

Examples of Cognitive Processing in Running:

To understand the practical implications of this hypothesis, let's consider examples of cognitive processing during running. A faster-thinking individual may exhibit the following advantages:

1. Quick Decision-Making: In a race, runners often encounter situations that demand rapid decision-making, such as navigating obstacles or responding to changes in the environment. A person with faster cognitive processing can make these decisions more swiftly, potentially gaining an edge in the race.
2. Enhanced Coordination: Running involves complex coordination between various muscle groups and joints. A faster-thinking individual may have superior motor control, enabling smoother and more efficient coordination of movements.
3. Adaptability to Dynamic Conditions: Races are dynamic, and unexpected events can occur. A person with faster cognitive processing may be better equipped to adapt to sudden changes, adjust their strategy, and maintain optimal speed in response to evolving race conditions.
4. Efficient Energy Management: Cognitive processing speed can influence an individual's ability to optimize energy usage during a race. Quicker decision-making can lead to more strategic pacing and resource allocation, potentially enhancing endurance and overall race performance.
5. Practical Considerations:

While the theoretical framework suggests a strong connection between cognitive processing speed and running speed, practical considerations introduce additional complexities. Physical factors such as muscle strength, cardiovascular fitness, and running technique are equally crucial in determining running speed. Moreover, the specific demands of different running disciplines (e.g., sprinting vs. long-distance running) may influence the degree to which cognitive processing speed contributes to overall performance.

For example, in sprinting, where races are short and explosive, the ability to make rapid decisions and execute quick movements plays a pivotal role. A sprinter with faster cognitive processing may have a competitive advantage in reacting to the starter's gun, making split-second decisions during the race, and maintaining optimal form.

However, in long-distance running, where endurance and pacing are paramount, cognitive processing speed may play a more nuanced role. While quick decision-making is still valuable, the sustained nature of these races places greater emphasis on factors like cardiovascular fitness, muscle endurance, and strategic pacing.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the relationship between cognitive processing speed and running speed is multifaceted. Theoretical considerations suggest a strong connection, with faster thinking potentially providing advantages in decision-making, coordination, and adaptability during a race. Practical examples, particularly in sprinting scenarios, support this hypothesis. However, it's crucial to recognize the intricate interplay between cognitive abilities and various physical factors that collectively determine an individual's running speed. The relationship is dynamic and context-dependent, highlighting the need for a holistic understanding of both cognitive and physical aspects in the realm of athletic performance."

Whatever their beliefs or assumptions, they are in some way objectively false.
2. People who have an ulterior motive for supporting Israel, such as attempting to trigger the Apocalypse by enabling a Jewish state in the Holy Land like Evangelicals believe, essentially using Israel to entrench US influence in the region, or being motivated by an antipathy toward Muslims.
3. Catholics who misinterpret church teaching and believe that we have to support Israel because Jews are our ""brothers.""

Usually, people who write things like that are young men in their 20s that are disappointed from their love life. As a man who was disappointed from m love life till my 28 years, I feel that I have to give an answer.

First of all, women are human beings. Women make mistakes, they have delusions, but they can also improve and fix themselves like any other human being. They are not neither superior nor inferior than a man. Sometimes dating in 20s may look too demanding, because humans in this age to not have experience and they have unrealistic standards. These unrealistic standards exist in both sides of the game (men, women or whatever) and they change as they become older, at least for the people who really try to improve themselves (if not, you should hope to not have any relation with them anyway). If somebody in their 20s is very demanding with some specific external feature for partner i.e. how nice body, or face (s)he have, it does not mean that this will lead them in a healthy relationship.

Now AI, may be a new revolution of our era. However, there are a lot of things that it cannot do, and probably it will never be able to do. For example, AI is a black box which means that when we use it to make research we lose the connection of input and output, since it is encoded in a completely non-linear function that does not have closed form. In some application this is not bad (especially in engineering). AI can pretend that have feelings, AI can pretend that it understands you, AI can pretend that it communicates with you, but deep inside we all now that it is just a lying machine. Nobody wants to have a relationship based on lies. Furthermore, AI does not take responsibilities. But there is another one very important feature that AI does not have and it will never be able to do: SEX. Yeah, you heard well. Humans will not reproduce if they just live their lie and they believe that the lie machines are their partners, and more importantly they will not have healthy sexual life and pleasure. Evolutionary robosexuals will erase. Therefore, it is funny to thing like that anyway.

Now let's come back to reality. Women and men are human beings. Usually the situation is not so horrible as they imagine. You do not need to be Elon Musk to attract some woman. It is good however if you have interests, be independent and have your own income, have a job, and to know how to behave so as to not be toxic. Sometimes the reason why we cannot be in a good relationship is not ""they"" but ""we"". Therefore, I think that it is possible that society (family and school) can teach their kids how to adapt, how to behave and how to have a successful professionally and mentally life. If you feel well with yourself, it is the first very important step. All these things are not some very high standards, they are things that you need to have in your life so as to survive anyway.

The last part is looks. I agree on the fact that looks are subjective. However, if you believe that they are not, and you think that you look like a goblin ( I am sure that not, but sometimes people think like that), then just try to find a normal woman and not Megan Fox or Miley Cirus.  "

My own short personal experience with religion as a whole. Why I think religion at its current scale do not have a place in modern society and finally what would most likely change my view.   


1. My own personal experience with religion 

First, my personal experience with religion is not without its ups and downs. I am raised in a non-religious household, but we do our fair share our tradition ceremonies more in the direction of family tradition rather than religious reasonings. I've went to religious camps over the school holidays as well and I found the experience to be fun and enjoyable. However, my disillusionment probably started during high school when I found out science teachers, friends, and authoritive figures not believing in commonly held scientific theories such as evolution and instead subscribing to what the religious teachings taught.

This is further amplified when I realised and started to take note how toxic and damaging religion is to the lives of the people surrounding me. Friends aren't able to read or watch or enjoy Harry Potter due to religious reasons, country's policy being backwards due to religious reasoning as opposed to humanity, and so on. (E.g. Same sex marriage not allowed on grounds that it is 'immoral' based on religious teachings ; sexist ideology permeating policies as well as family dynamics due to religions teachings)

2. Why I think religion at its current scale do not have a place in modern society 

I will first try and clarify what I meant by ""current scale"". What I mean is religion being institutionalize in many region, country and affecting many many policy decision making that impacts the lifes of thousands, if not millions of people world wide as opposed to making decisions based on research, logic, and trials. It is also fully embeded as an identity in many people's lives, for better or for worse. 

Organised religion, as a primary or a contributing factor has caused multiple wars, genocide, segregation and all kinds of atrocities in modern time, some may be on-going, some may be recovering. 

Millions of lives are made worse because of religion. 

I am not saying it has no benefit. It has true tangible benefit, at its best it provides a supportive community, saves lifes, rehabilitate people and made people's lifes better. However, these support is not without its alternative, and you may even argue that the alternative are better. Take alcoholism for example, religious community could successfully save someone, but a proper rehab with proper guidance as well as a professional may very well work better than religion. In a nut shell, religion at its worse is a 'convenient' excuse to divide humans into arbitary 'us' and 'them' causing conflicts, wars and suffering, at its best, it saves and helps people to find a place of belonging which has its alternative. 

I also acknowledge that conflicts could arise from other factors ranging from race, to nationalism, to economy and all kinds of other reason. However, I feel that religion is the one that is the most deadly and toxic because there is no arguing or winning against a holy text that is held as the 'truth'.   
For example, it probably takes a racist to befriend one or two person of a different race to see how misguided their ideas are. (E.g. [Daryl Davis](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544861933/how-one-man-convinced-200-ku-klux-klan-members-to-give-up-their-robes) befriending hundreds of KKK member and ultimately convincing that their ideology is flawed). On the other hand, how would you convince a religious extremist that they should not do bad stuff for whichever higher power they subscribe to? You are not even arguing against a flawed logic held by the believer, you are now having to argue against a higher power in the form of texts written thousands of years ago. This, in my opinion is also why so many dictators, in the past and present set themselves up as a divine being / 'chosen one' to shut out all dissenter. 

To add on, I think it would be acceptable if religions were at the scale of Astrology or something to that effect, they may have associations, organisations and so on and people that practice it may practice in peace, but they do not hold any major power or say that can influence millions of people to take radical actions.  


3. What would it take to change my view? 

While I did not provide many resources or research as to the objective pros and cons of religion, so I may definitely be biased due to my surrounding and personal beliefs. But I believe examples involving modern conflict arising primarily / secondarily due to religion more than illustrate my point on how it has negatively impacted millions of lives in modern day. 

I believe I will change my view about religion's role and justification of its existence in modern society if there were concrete evidence that religion as a whole has benefit ouweighing its drawbacks as well as that there are no alternatives aside for religion to achieve the same benefit.   
(As an analogy - Opioid is an extremely useful class of drugs to enable life saving procedures and help humanity, and there are no effective alternative, hence its existence is justified despite having caused destruction in many lives caused by substance adddiction; it can also be argued that the benefit outweighs the risk, as well as having the risk being controlled by smart policy and education.)

There's this idea that Asians are more on the feminine side—shy, cooperative, docile, and not really seen as ""macho."" But then again, Asian cultures are seen as competitive, self-reliant, hierarchical, and sometimes not so empathetic to minorities and the disadvantaged, which are basically masculine characteristics. Take the strict ""Tiger Mom"" style of parenting—it's all about discipline and rigor, and that's pretty masculine. So, are Asians feminine or masculine? Western perceptions of Asians seem contradictory and confusing."
5,2024-01-12,"CMV: Islam is not like other religions, the character of Muhammad is uniquely repugnant",u/MugaboWaNgai,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194q9gg/cmv_islam_is_not_like_other_religions_the/,changemyview,"Islam is a deeply troubled and intolerant ideology which is not compatible with modern progressive societies. 

Islam says that non-Muslims have to either convert, pay jizya (a tax to remain in their belief system, high enough that disbelievers will get humiliated by its sum) or be killed if the refuse the first two options (Quran 9:29). Polytheists aren’t guranteed such a choice so if you’re a neo-pagan you’re shut out of luck. 

According to Islam, Muslims should not greet non-Muslims first and if they confront them on the streets, they should force them on the narrowest part of the road (Sahih Muslim 2167 a). 

Islam also says that Atheists and apostates have to be killed (Sunan an-Nasa'i 4059, Sahih al-Bukhari 6922) so there’s no freedom of religion in Islam. Once you’re in you can leave only by death, like the mob. 

Sex-slavery is also allowed in Islam (Quran 4:24) and Muslims are therefore allowed to take captive disbelieving women as sex-slaves, even if their husbands are still alive (Sunan Abi Dawud 2155). Mohammed himself had a sex slave too btw and gave advice how to properly rape them (Sunan an-Nasa'i 3959, Sahih al-Bukhari 2229). This is why Islam has never had an organic anti-slavery movement. It was Western European power that FORCED anti-slavery onto the Islamic world as a condition for doing business and this fact asserts itself when groups like ISIS manage to become powerful in a region. Unlike Muhammad or Buddha there’s no way that slavery can be genuinely argued by a Muslim to be anti-Islamic when Muhammad engaged in it and the Quran clearly allows it.

Islam also allows child marriages (Quran 65:4) since Muhammad himself married Aisha when she was 6 and raped her when she turned 9 years old (Sahih al-Bukhari 5134). There are Muslims who deny that Aisha was nine and use convoluted argumentation to claim that she was 18 but those Muslims tend to be inconsistent since to deny the Hadiths where Aisha herself says she was 6 at marriage and 9 at consummation would require that you deny every other Hadith that has the same rating which would mean discarding the Hadiths entirely. Even today child marriages are taking place in the Arab-Islamic world justified by the example of Muhammad.

Islam also states that women are less intelligent than men and that their witness is less worth because of that (Sahih al-Bukhari 2658), with the vast majority of hells occupants also being women due to their argumentative nature. 

These are just some of the horrible and barbaric aspects of this outdated religion and since Muhammmad’s teachings/doings and the Quran are supposed to be timeless and perfect, Muslims have to emulate all of that. 

ISIS did that and their actions shocked the world. There’s not a single thing that ISIS did during their run that Muhammad didn’t do. When they ethnically cleansed Yazidis and turned the women into sex slaves, Muhammad did that with the Jews of khaibar and medina. When ISIs made people convert to Islam, pay a tax, or die? Muhammad did that too when he conquered Mecca and then gave the remaining Arab polytheists an ultimatum. Under Islam all morality is turned upside down and the immoral is called moral."
0,2024-01-12,CMV: I don't think women have any contribution to society besides producing men.,u/red_herring_69,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194qf1y/cmv_i_dont_think_women_have_any_contribution_to/,changemyview,"I can't think of any jobs which women can do but not men but there are a myriad of jobs where men have the natural advantage or are predominantly good at. At best there are gender-neutral jobs. Even in jobs traditionally associated with women, you'll find that the best in the field are usually men (eg, cooking - Sanjeev Kapoor). I think the only real reason men ever chase women is because of their sex drive otherwise there is not a single thing where a man feels like ""Ok I can't do this without a woman"" but women need men for their survival. They depend on men for their safety, are not naturally inclined towards highly stressful corporate jobs, and can't do any physically laborious tasks. Even during partner selection, the only thing 99% of the men care about is how hot the women is because they can't think of anything else that women bring to the table. What I mean to say is, that a society can continue to function without women but can't without men. I think their biggest contribution is in producing these men who actually do shit and maintain the impossible infrastructure that runs the world. Even worse, I think women only bring more problems to men's lives. They nag and belittle them, making them always feel like they aren't good enough but in reality, it's actually quite the opposite. In fact, I believe that if men didn't have such a strong sex drive or if it was not so normalised in society to marry and have kids, most men wouldn't even bother women. I also think that men enjoy life more with their homies than with women. I know all these might sound a bit misogynistic and biased and many people may bash me in the comments, but this is something that I have just concluded from practical experience. It's not like I hate women. I do believe they add beauty and glamour to the world, but they just don't seem to have any tangible contribution to the running of society. From a man's perspective, a woman is just a nice thing to have in life, not something he centres his life around but for women, their whole lives depend on men. I rest my case now!"

23,2024-01-12,CMV: The Controlled Substance Act consider potential for harm instead of potential for abuse,u/Newparadime,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/194rior/cmv_the_controlled_substance_act_consider/,changemyview,"The DEA currently scheduled drugs based on their potential for abuse. This opens up very circular reasoning for keeping currently scheduled drugs scheduled. The theory goes, that if a person is willing to risk criminal prosecution by using a scheduled drug, the drug *must* have a potential for abuse. Potential for abuse in this context is analogous to *potential to be an enjoyable experience*. By this logic, sugar can should be a controlled substance, because people continue to use it despite warnings from their doctors they are becoming diabetic.

Rather than potential for abuse, drugs should be evaluated on their potential to cause harm. Just because mushrooms are enjoyable for instance, does not mean that people will go to any length to obtain them. They are not habit forming, and are generally safe to use. Marijuana is in a similar boat. It's non-physically addictive, doesn't cause significant health issues (especially when ingested via methods other than smoking), etc."

Since the very basis that people put preexisting conditions on each other before coming into a relationship, I don’t think true love exists and I don’t see the point of coming into a relationship. You always hear about men and women cheating and divorcing because they are unsatisfied and more often than not the reasons are that they don’t get the partner they desired. Everyone always keeps on searching for the best they can find and god forbid, even if a beautiful woman decides to date an ugly or a not so well to do man, society will not always make the man feel as if he got better than what he deserved and the relationship will inevitably come to an end. Also, people rarely mutually love each other equally and usually one person is more invested in the other.

Thriving only occurs when basic needs are being met. My parents were low-income and my mom did not even speak English how is she going to help me? My nephew has a daughter they are low-income I can't judge them her mother was 16 when she gave birth. My nephew is in a union and is often gone for weeks at a time at a job site. He doing the best he can to provide financially. The mother works in a nursing home and works 16-hour shifts sometimes. They are poor but not poor enough to receive assistance from the government. I know a mother whose children's father was killed. She works three jobs to support her 4 kids. I believe it is also a lot easier to be a parent and be concerned about your kid's grades, When you are not worried about how are you going to make rent, how are you going to buy food, how are you going to pay for cellphone internet. I know a single mom who walks 35 mins to and from work every day. Walks to get her kids from daycare and the three-year-old walks every day even in the snow. You want me to blame these parents. I know for a fact my nephew's daughter qualifies for free tutoring. But to get the free tutoring you need a letter from her doctor requesting to get tested. Based on the test determines if you qualify for free tutoring I know she does because the school recommended her for special ed.

What this mean is that most of humanity will and do come across political discussions on social medias. The loudest voices that dominate all political discussions are made by terminally online extremists of both left and right-wing political spectrum. 

And how do most of humanity react to the self-destructive, self-hating, and purely garbage hot takes of these political extremists?

Nothing.

Despite being a minority of the total population of social media users, the voices of these terminally online extremists of both left and right-wing political spectrum managed to exert the most influence in the political discourses of social medias, and given how I previously said that humanity's daily lives do revolve around social medias, these extremist talking points do and will inevitably affect the political beliefs of people in real life.

The reason most of humanity do nothing when coming across the opinions of these left and right-wing political extremists is because **THEY DO AGREE WITH THESE EXTREMIST TALKING POINTS**. Most of humanity wholeheartedly agree with these extremist political opinions, but they are too cowardly to openly admit their supports, which is why they choose to silently acknowledge these political extremists by doing nothing.

In conclusion, via silent acknowledgement by doing nothing, most of humanity have political beliefs that perfectly align with the loudest political extremists minority of both Left and Right-wing political spectrum on social medias, which proves that humanity is an inherently self-destructive, self-hating, and morally bankrupt species of clowns.

3. Math contest. Math contest is an activity which you requires extensive brain usage. It causes sweats to the contestants https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6348733 , thus require physical exertion. It also require skills (Trivial, right?). There are some famous Math contests such as International Mathematical Olympaid (IMO). Some Math contests also give entertainment to others. MIT Integration Bee is a great example of this.

4. Competitive Cooking. It requires some form of body movement in order to cook a great meal for contest, thus it require physical exertion. It require skills, nobody can cook as great as Gordon Ramsay without extensive practices. Masterchef is good cooking competition. Cooking competitions can provide entertainment to others, some speculators can watch the whole cooking process.

To conclude, almost all competitions can be classified as a sport, only if it relies pure luck.

The reasons I think there is no chance for peace:  
1. Palestinian identity is based on the events of 1948/1967 - their claim remains that there is no right for a Jewish state in the land of Israel based on the demand for the “right of return”.  
2. Since October 7th, 72% of the Palestinians believe that \*\*Hamas' decision to launch the October 7 attack was correct,\*\*  and only 10% believe that \*\*Hamas committed atrocities.\*\* https://pcpsr.org/en/node/963

Intelligent people will know they aren’t well educated in that subject, while unintelligent people will assume that they know all there is to know. Another example is that intelligent people will openly admit that they are not informed enough to have an opinion on a certain subject, while intelligent people will form an opinion with whatever knowledge the have, large or small. I think this is a way to separate “book smarts” from intelligence. You can have a PhD and know that outside your field, you truly don’t know that much about the world as a whole, and you can be a high school drop out and be aware of the fact that you may not know much about topics outside of your lifestyle. This can be applied to patients who believe they know more than their doctors, and doctors who believe they know more about living with a condition than their patient. I believe that this measure can encompass most forms of intelligence within a single metric."

Of course I always think the position I’ve taken is the correct one (with the obvious exception of “I don’t know”) and so should everyone else, otherwise why would you hold that position? One important thing to note is that I’m actually very open to changing my opinion on a topic if an argument resonates with me, saying “I always think I’m right” doesn’t equate to “I’m never wrong” because the key word there is *think* which, in this context, is synonymous with “believe”.  I didn’t say “I *know* I’m always right” because that would imply I could never be wrong. But beliefs don’t work that way. 

To summarize, everyone should always think/believe they’re right, otherwise they shouldn’t hold the position that they do, but this only works if people acknowledge that they don’t know everything, and their positions are based on the information they know, meaning new information or even a new perspective can always challenge your position, and only formulate concrete opinions if they believe they have enough information on a topic to do so, otherwise defaulting to “I don’t know”."

They’re slow, want brains and don’t have much of a consciousness. If you get bit, you turn into one.
That being said, I feel as though it may be earlier to survive one than people make it out to be. When pictured, people usually think of a post apocalyptic world but I think we could go about life pretty normally.
For starters, if this disease eats away at the host like it portrays in some media’s, it’s going to eventually get rid of their ability to see, hear, touch and even bite meaning they’re not really all that dangerous. Even if it doesn’t, and it only starts to infect the dead the only real threat are really only people who have recently passed away as their body has not been corroded yet, and likely still have full functionality. But I feel like this doesn’t make things all that harder because everyone would steer clear of the zombie once it first becomes infected, hence creating less infected and making it easier to contain. Again, the zombie is slow so you have plenty of time to react.
Suppose there is a hoard anyways, they don’t have much of a consciousness and will probably just follow whatever noise they hear if that sense still remains. So we can just gather them up with a large radio or something. But if it doesn’t work as planned, then just stay inside. They probably won’t recall how to use a doorknob let alone have the strength to open it. So as long as the windows are fairly strong you should be fine. If this disease removes an individuals senses, why not the rest of them? Meaning all we have to do is wait it out from here. Of course, food is an issue, but assuming you are at home, in a grocery store or mall we could just ration it. If not, then growing micro greens whilst you wait for other bigger plants to grow could work due to how long we can go without food. After the majority of the zombies are either caught or decayed we can return to our normal life. Even if there are some left, people will be more wary of it, so much so we’ll likely have a set of instructions on how to avoid or deal with a zombie when we see one."

I often have discussions with people and similar themes always come up regarding country music history.

I don't want to lecture too much, but the foundation of country is rooted in folk, blues, bluegrass and mountain music.

Every decade, country music almost completely changes on what it was.

Every decade, people will claim ""real country"" music was the previous decade.

60's country music was a sellout to the purists with the addition of more drums and electric instruments.

90's country music was a sellout to the 60's and beyond.

Modern Zeitgeist country music now basically sounds like pop music with touches of classic rock and even hip-hop.

I've attended a few county shows that have more in common with AC/DC than Jonny Cash.

Decade to decade, the music itself has little resemblance to anything that presided it.

Rock music, electronic and hip-hop still has familiar lineage elements. Country music just seems like a freak mutation that keeps changing with a complete style makeover."

Even fewer if they duplicate emailed or online content. Content ranges from generic advertising, targeted advertising, donation begging, to actual scams.

""Junk Mail"" is an Advertising Lobby whitewashing term. My attic has junk. ""Trash Mail"" accurately describes the daily process of opening mailbox, immediately trashing 75% of it, then reviewing and trashing the remaining 25%. Yes, usually 0% of mail is kept.

Recently I've refused to waste time checking mail in favor of relatively controllable email. However letters still hold legal weight. Legal notices, city notifications, business notifications, old-school landlords, and more use mail. One day I'll probably miss something important and get in trouble. 

---

This is a broken unregulated system. [Modern people are drowning in notifications](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/health/teen-hundreds-of-phone-notifications-report-wellness/index.html). Letters specially should be a noteworthy event requiring careful reading of it's content. ""Gather around family we received a letter!""-level noteworthy. Modern day email, phone call, text, or push notifications must be included. This goal is only attainable if each communication is important. 

Any non-person-to-person communication (business, political, government) over any medium needs opt-in regulations 

* Zero communication allowed without opt-in - Advertising, car warranty scams, coupons, and other litter
* Opt-in default minimum communication - For example bills, critical service announcements, or appointments. No extraneous newsletters, coupons, or non-critical notifications are allowed
* Opt-in greater than once per week/month communication - To control otherwise functional companies doing ""maximum-minimum"" abuse for daily spam, throttle their ability to once a week or month. 
* Opt-in unlimited communication - How it is today
* USPS managed opt-out forms. Citizens need an easy method to change their option. USPS or private company could have 3 field website for consumers that notifies businesses for you as a legal notice. Businesses cannot be trusted to make an easy opt-out process, eg see canceling gym memberships. 

The fundamental laws that founded USPS and unregulated business communication 200+ years ago didn't expect billions of advertising letters sent far and wide for pennies, robots printing truckloads of mail at a time, nor digital communications. Modern problems require modern solutions. 

**FAQ**

**Opt-out instead**

Fundamentally nobody should have to opt-out of receiving trash. Lawmakers agreed by creating anti-trash-dumping laws. Distributing trash in city mailboxes should not be exempt.

Industry site https://www.dmachoice.org are pay to opt out and themselves estimate 80% effective. Serial renters must re-opt-out every move + deal with the previous tenant's opt-in trash. 

Changing businesses, or ""voting with your wallet"", just because of trash mail is inconvenient to unreasonable like your electric company, closest hospital, bank, or other important services. 

**First amendment concerns**

The first amendment provides a right to speak but not to be heard. 
Here the citizen is controlling communication. The government is merely enforcing the citizen's decisions, not making decisions themselves.

**Advertising and Coupons benefits businesses** 

Great! Advertise the benefits inside participating businesses. Such a valuable service will sell itself with stacks of opt-in forms. Just like every other industry. 

**USPS survives off of trash mail**

Consider the environment's resources consumed every year to manufacture the letter, transport between manufacturers then to USPS, delivery to your mailbox, consumer evaluates for 0.2 seconds, then transport to recycle center or likely city dump. Doing this as effectively a make-work jobs program is a poor excuse.

Other countries may have solved this problem. Other revenue sources exist. ""Last mile"" delivery is becoming competitive. Trash mail is not the only solution. 

**Businesses will switch to email and apps to avoid regulation**

This CMV focuses on USPS letter mail. 

As mentioned above this regulation should extend to electronic communications which is also [drowning in notifications](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/health/teen-hundreds-of-phone-notifications-report-wellness/index.html). ""Communication"" must be broadly defined enough to adapt to new methods without an act of congress every time. 
This isn't unprecedented. [CAN-SPAM Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003) has theoretically regulated email for 20+ years."

Some years ago, I used to play a lot of Street Fighter (Street Fighter V specifically).  I got to the point where I started going to tournaments and played it way more than anything considered just a hobby.  I got that thought into my mind that I could win some tournaments and make some money and go from there.

In the meantime, my body suffered and I got super out of shape, I wasn't social with anyone but my geeky friends, I was single of course, and I even started to develop a slight temper for whenever I would lose.

Life circumstances changed when I decided to move overseas, and when I got to a place where the internet was no longer good enough to consistently play these games seriously, they sort of faded from my life.  I do still enjoy playing them (I log onto SF6 now and then), but it feels like on top of personal changes, the minute competitve games like this disappeared from life, everything improved dramatically.  I made all the personal changes that mattered and now I don't miss the scene behind these games or the lifestyle behind them at all.

I know gamers are an easy target, but watching from a distance, I can see now why communities like the fighting game community, Super Smash Bros. and League of Legends scene are reviled.  They encourage people to waste hours of their life on something that takes away from the rest of their life, causing people to sacrifice opporunities like love, friends, physical and mental health, other hobbies, experiences, etc.

My brother, who is much younger than me, still participates in these kind of game scenes just seeing his reaction to losing a game of LoL makes me never want to touch games like that again.

Yes, I know there is a lot of positive to these games, and I'm not advocating that anyone shouldn't play them.  I love video games and I think there is a lot of positive they can provide to someone's life.  

Competitive games, however, are a different story.  For all accolades and prize money, it seems the price they enact on your personal life is absolutely not worth it."

In my experience, when I interact with locals, I sometimes encounter individuals who, upon hearing my accent, attempt to imitate it. This usually happens in a lighthearted manner, but it has made me ponder about the broader implications of accent imitation. 

I understand that accents can be a unique and integral part of one's cultural identity. Hence, when someone mimics my English accent, it feels like a trivialization of my background, albeit in a less aggressive form. However, what puzzles me is the disparity in societal reactions when it comes to mimicking accents from different regions. 

If I were to meet someone from India, China, Mexico, or any other non-Western country and replicated their accent directly to them, it would likely be perceived as disrespectful or even racist. This double standard intrigues me. Is it because English accents, particularly from the UK, are often associated with a certain level of prestige or desirability in popular culture? Or is there a deeper, perhaps historical or socio-political reason that makes the mimicry of certain accents more socially acceptable than others?

I'm genuinely curious and open to changing my view. What am I missing in understanding why these situations are perceived so differently?"

Exchange those terms with ""White Person Syndrome"" ""Black Person syndrome"" and people will be losing their shit calling it a Racist term. isn't it the same like calling a black person the N word mocking them for their lips, mocking asians for their mono eyelids, mocking whites for their pale skin, mocking redheads calling them gingers, mocking jews for their noses.. never mind body shaming, how is it different being a racist? with Body shaming, you can actually change your body by diet and exercise, with dick size you're forever stuck with it, like your skin color. so is it really body shaming or deep rooted racism. food for thought."
1,2024-01-13,cmv: Ai art is not entirely bad,u/Redditor00002,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/195kj5q/cmv_ai_art_is_not_entirely_bad/,changemyview,"First, I want to clarify that I do not think Al art should replace human made art. I do not think Al (as it currently is) is capable of creating something comparable to human art. And I understand why it is largely considered unethical to train the Al without the consent of the original artists.

That being said, I can't bring myself to hate the Al art technology. As somebody who loves technology, I can't help but see all the potential the technology behind Al art has.

I mean, programs like photoshop or video editors have been using Al technology for ages to assist with different tasks, and Al technology becoming better will only make these tools more useful. I think there will definently be ways that the current technology behind 'Al art' could be used as a tool to assist artists in streamlining certain tasks. And even Al image generation, if done right, could potentially be a useful tool in future without taking work away from real artists.

I think Al technology has a lot of potential to improve a ton of things in every field, and even in our daily lives at some point down the line.

Of course none of this will happen before we take into consideration a ton of ethical considerations and impose regulations on the usage of Al technology."

I’m referring to the further left people, not centre left. I was just thinking about this today.

On the left there’s often this over arching sense of having to “be a decent human being”. Follow these moral rules, “because that’s what a decent human being would do”. 

First problem you run into: people trying to out “decent human being” each other, “I’m MORE of a decent human being cos I do X while you don’t” 

Second problem you run into: if your sense of moral correctness is the only thing that you’ve got going well for you in life, you can start to get way over invested emotionally into it. If someone challenges your morals in any way, you burst in aggression, because if you were wrong on your morality, that’s the only power and control you had over something, gone. And that’s extremely upsetting! Having your entire identity and control over your life shattered 




The title would have been too long to include this, but everything I’ve said applies to far right wingers too, but their sense of power comes not from morality but a sense of tribalism/belonging. 


tldr; leftists attach themselves to moral superiority, rightists attach themselves to tribalism, because in many cases these are the only sources of power, control and meaning these people have in their lives."

I don’t disagree with this part at all. There is no reason the woman should take the man’s name and not the other way around. However, when naming your kids I feel you should choose one, or the other. It’s not so bad now when they are only double-barreled, but what happens in a generation when 2 double-barreled parents have a child, do we have 4 names? And a generation later 8? Do the parents compromise and drop 1 of their names each, then what was the point in the first place? Again, I’m entirely understanding of the desire to remove the tradition of women having to take their husbands name - but I do not think double barreled names make any sense in the long run."

Further, the interest capitalizes into the principal which compounds the problem. 

It doesn’t make sense that payments made towards the loan are applied to interest prior to principal, because the principal investment is what is used to generate the interest returns. One could not make the interest income without investing into some sort of asset in which the asset then generates the profit/value of the interest. 

If interest is the combination of opportunity cost and risk, then once the principal amount is paid off, how is the initial loan offerer assuming risk? It ought to be the case that the value of the principal has already been recognized and cannot grow in value. The profit would still need to be paid off (interest) but it cannot grow further. Assets aside from land and human capital are subject to depreciation, so the model of a principal investment as an asset that cannot depreciate (but does carry risk in the form of default) is incorrect. 

The strongest counter argument I can think of is that money is fungible and that one cannot differentiate between the dollar that generated the revenue and the one that was the initial investment. The consequence of this is that capitalization should occur instantly and not on a schedule.

I’m sure there are other arguments against this and would love to hear them! The poverty trap created by debt is such a looming problem that I think it’s important to find a relief solution/better model to explore, so CMV!"

Just background on myself incase anyone wants to try no true Scotsman on my or anything like that.

I'm approaching 40. Have kids who share my love of games. First console was an NES when I was 5, I've always had a console since. Today I have a gaming PC, a Steam Deck, and a Nintendo Switch.

Lately I have been playing Overwatch, Pokemon, New Zelda, Dragon Quest, and I've been digging into a lot of old JRPG's (pixel remasters, Dragon Quest, Super Mario RPG Remake, etc). I've been heavily into WoW in the past (like, into months of playtime), played dozens of JRPGs, remember N64 Mario Party and wrestling games, etc. I think I fit into the category of ""Gamer"" pretty darn well. Always down to play the latest streamer games with friends too (Lethal Company, Among Us, Phasmophobia, Fall Guys, etc).

**The Problem**

I want to start by saying I am not at all saying I love all modern changes in the gaming market. I also know people are allowed to complain.

But what I have found on reddit, in comment threads on all gaming news articles, inside gaming media itself, and among my friends is a crippling, debilitating, bitter, depressing RAGE.

Nothing is good enough. No company is good enough. Everything you are excited about must cater EXCLUSIVLEY to you in exactly the way you wish, or it is Satan's Spawn and f you for enjoying it.

Scarlet and Violet come out and don't have AAA graphics. OK? Don't buy it. Do I need friends who haven't played it shitting on me when I am excited about a new mon? Does the subreddit need to be brigaded with people who don't own the game and just want to shit talk it?

CP2077 comes out and I have fun, no bugs, and they offer extended refunds to anyone who does. I'll sound like a broken record, but \*don't play it if you don't like it\*. Why do people need to act like the game personally knee capped their grandma?

Overwatch goes FTP and ups skin prices a ton. It's shiny pixels, it's not pay to win. Don't give me crap about new heroes ""Sure, I can instantly play the heroes in a number of modes, and I can unlock for free, but what if I want to be in the meta, without playing the game at all, in competitive?"" What?? Don't buy the skins. Or stop playing the game. The only legit gripe here is that OW 1 disappeared. Funny enough, CS2 comes out and removes the only mode I ever played, Arms Race, and I get shit on because the Gamer Hive Mind decides that was a shitty game mode, so THAT is OK, but 6v6 going away in OW is again personally offensive to people.

People converge on takes in this community, the edgier the better. You won't give $$ to companies that put out games that have bugs on platforms you don't use, but you'll give views and Patreon subs to people who bitch about games. Do gamers even like games, or is complaining about them #1 now?

And, every time this happens, the publisher makes absolute bank. No one is crying because they went to reddit and people were mean (except, you know, underpaid devs who worked thousands of hours to bring you this just to get shit on). We're only hurting other gamers.

The only logical thing to do is vote with your wallet, and, IMHO, STFU. If Ford makes a new truck and it sucks, I won't buy it. I won't tell my friend he is a POS for buying it, then go onto Ford forums and say they are an evil company destroying my childhood. Why is disrupting fan communities, when you are not a fan, even a thing? Everyone would be happier and healthier playing what they love, being happy when their friends are happy, and living life. These are *games*.

**TL;DR.** 

I think it comes down to this: The community is going to play/talk about X. You feel you need to play X to not be ""left out,"" But ""X"" has some issue. So you decide X owes you, personally, changes, so you can not be left out. Or, you choose to not be left out by actively hating on the game, so you are a ""part of"" the moment by being a hater. The result is a circlejerk of hate. Positive comments are met with ""WHY YOU DEFENDING A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR COMPANY"" or ""YOU BUYING THIS SHIT IS THE PROBLEM!!"" A ""community"" literally frothing at the mouth to insult its members. Who is having fun in these communities, exactly?

But, am I wrong? Are these people fighting the good fight and stopping bad practices? Are they snapping gamers who have entered the Matrix out of it?"

Most recently, I've been using a Pixel 4a 5G for the past 3 years which has had a headphone jack. Now that my phone is starting to act up, I've decided that it's time to purchase a new one. However, the number of phones that still have a headphone jack is decreasing significantly. The only phone that still has a headphone jack that meets my other requirements is the ASUS Zenphone 10. That phone is fine, but I like having a variety of options to choose from, not just picking the only one available for me.

My reluctance to step away from headphone jacks is just because of my bad item management. I consistently lose earbuds, and so I only buy the 10 dollar ones to replace my headphone whenever I lose them. Knowing this, I know that I would also lose any dongle that I would buy that would allow me to use my current pair of earbuds. I have the same problem with the two pairs of Bluetooth earbuds that I bought, I lost both of them after a month each. I don't want to continue to spend money purchasing new wireless earbuds, and I know that I will invariably lose the earbuds pair that comes with a new phone. 

Despite all this, I really want my views to be changed. I don't want to be stuck picking up the only phone that might still have a headphone jack. Please change my view!"

Impacts of climate change include rising sea levels, destabilization of existing climates, glaciers and ice territories melting, floods and an increase in natural disasters. 

None of the impacts of climate change are a fundemental threat to humans existence as a species or life on earth in general by a long shot. Also it's not all bad, destabilization of existing climates is a churn, churns are messy but the new meta might be better in some ways. For example climate change is causing more arid areas to green due to increased CO2 (which plants like). When talking about steps to curb emissions I believe it's important to keep these factors in mind so we don't do more harm then good with overzealous ""the sky is falling"" voting/policies. 

Also we do have the technology to reverse climate change to some degree, the reason we haven't used it is because the impacts of climate change aren't worth the risk of using it. Remember how I said the extra heat energy between the earths surface and the edge of the atmosphere is the main issue? Well we can reduce that in a very simple way. Using nuclear expolisives (or explosives of similar yield) we could launch enough dust into the atmosphere to partially blot out the sun reducing the amount of heat energy entering earth. If we get the math picture perfect we could somewhat reverse climate change with no major side effects. That is a really big if though, if we screw it up it could become a threat to life on earth as we know it, which is precisely why we haven't seriously considered it given how compared to that threat climate change is very manageable."

Necessary context: I have thousands of hours in multiple types of competitive games and I have been entering tournaments for years. Most of my experience comes in the form of Street Fighter and Super Smash Bros tournaments, with some StarCraft and Rocket League mixed in.  
  
Here is the CMV:  
  
Both of these avenues require a ton of dedication and hard work, but I simply think it would be harder to succeed becoming a large youtuber because ironically, there is much more competition on youtube. Making something creative and entertaining enough to become a youtuber worth consistent 1 Million view videos requires you to learn a large variety of different skills and develop them to a competent level, and a good amount of luck as well.  
  
With competitive gaming, I believe that developing a single skill and progressing through clearly defined ranks is much more straight forward and arguably more simple than figuring out how to make creative content that people can genuinely enjoy and engage with.  
  
When you are developing with something skill based, once you reach a basic level of competency and overcome that first hurdle in the ""Dunning-Kruger Effect"", that it is much easier and more straight forward to see and realize what you are doing wrong and how to progress forward. It's much easier to ""brute force"" through skill progression.  
  
I feel with content creation, you are simply shooting fish in a barrel and you have to continue trying different things constantly until something finally sticks, and that could take years of consistent effort. More years of effort than becoming a top player would take, anyway.  
  
I've never played League of Legends. I think if I started today and dedicated all of my free time toward it, I could become the highest rank in the game, Challenger, within a year.

If it is by birth or naturalization ( including marriage). 2nd generation may have been born externally but may retain some aspects of the home nation via their parents. 3rd generation emigrants are now more the citizens of their ""home"" nation than their great-grandparents nation. They have no direct link to their ""home"" nation and so must have no privileges or rights as citizens. 

Furthermore amorphous groups such as ""African-Americans"" should have no recognition within any African state as they aren't African. They are American and because of the internal racial politics of the US has been labelled as such. If there is a crisis in America it is not the responsibility of African states to take in African- Americans. Just as it's not Irelands to Irish-Americans or Italy, Italian- Americans 

They may take in refugees, under local laws but not give ""privileges"""
1,2024-01-13,CMV: Sleep is death.,u/CatoticNeutral,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/195wu7p/cmv_sleep_is_death/,changemyview,"My reasoning: This started when I was thinking about teleporters. There's some discussion that the classic sci-fi teleporter that disassembles someone's atoms and reassembles them somewhere else is actually unethical, since it functionally kills someone by disintegration and then clones them. This got me thinking about possible real life equivalents. For example, when someone goes under for surgery. Their brain is turned off by anesthetic, then some part of them is taken apart and put back together, then they wake up. To the patient, no time passed. Then I started thinking about other, more common causes for loss of consciousness, such as sleep. I thought of all of these things a long time ago, and I must have been in better mental health back then because I managed to dismiss the concept and continue my life as normal, but recently the theory has returned to my mind, probably after discussing teleporters with someone over discord. For the past few days I have woken up each morning with the suspicion that none of my memories are truly my own and that I have a 16 hour clock until oblivion. Obviously, I have lost a lot of sleep over this, which doesn't help with the anxiety.

Here's a few arguments I have gathered myself already, as I am desperate to prove myself wrong. I consider most of these arguments to be sound enough, at least in combination, and I hope that they deter anyone who reads this post from falling victim to this veritable cognitohazard of a theory the way I have, however they have failed to beat my personal anxiety on the subject:

1. It's completely unprovable, like those theories that the universe was created yesterday or that everything is a simulation. Thus there's no point in worrying about it. (Unlike the teleporter situation. If you disassemble someone's atoms they're obviously dead. Furthermore, if you have technology that can instantly assemble perfect copies of people anywhere within a certain range, why are you using it just to teleport them? Why destroy the original? Why not populate the cosmos with clones of Earth's greatest minds, or create organs for transplants or for use in testing to find a cure for cancer or something? Why not use the same concept with inanimate objects to aid in construction or to print food? That's getting off topic though.)

2. The popular explanation for why we can't remember the moment that we go to sleep is simply because our brain doesn't store memories during that time. On top of that, there is brain activity during that stage of sleep. I think. I'm not a neuroscientist and I forgot where I read most of this.

3. [This post on the Lucid Dreaming subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/xlnvrn/i_managed_to_stay_conscious_from_the_moment_i/) If this post and its comments can be trusted, it seems as if some people, with effort, have experienced and remembered the transition from being awake to sleeping that you normally forget, which would sort of prove that the stream of consciousness isn't cut off. (I say ""sort of prove"" since it's just anecdotal evidence, but it's not like there's many ways to get stronger evidence on this topic.) I know that it's possible to remember part of a dream or forget it entirely, so I'm not too skeptical of the idea of someone managing to remember the start of a dream."

That’s why I’m posting here and not offmychest or something similar. 

This is genuinely a thought I’ve held for a while given what I personally understand about the economy and I never understood why so many people think we’d be better off with less billionaires. 

*If we didn’t have billionaires* the government would be the ONLY source of mass investment into billion dollar projects. Does this sound like a democracy? 

It’s because of billionaires that so many decent to good companies have been bought and turned into amazing companies, which *drive prices down* and allow normal people like me and you to receive goods and services more conveniently. 

How many of you have a Walmart near by, but choose to exclusively shop at a mom and pop shop? A fraction. That’s because business owners with less capital simply can’t afford to offer competitive prices. 

Recently moved to San Diego and literally half of everyone here drives a Tesla. That’s because Elon Musk was rich enough to buy Tesla and invest $100s of millions into it so that they can afford to mass produce luxury EVs at reasonable prices. 

The list goes on. A huge portion of the goods and services we all enjoy were only made possible because some super rich person decided it’s something worth investing an absurd amount of money into. 

Without that avenue, we’d have to depend solely on the government to fund these projects. Not exactly Mr. Reliable, not to mention it’s US who fund the government so they’d likely just raise our taxes. Is that what anti-billionaire folk want? 🤔

If I understand correctly, the main argument from that eat the rich crowd is exploitation of labor or something. That’s just capitalism, if you can’t provide a unique skill and you’re easily replaceable, you’re not gonna earn much nor do you deserve much. Now I do believe everyone should at least have a liveable wage, but not only do I not believe it’s the fault of billionaires that we don’t, but I also don’t think simply “eating the rich” will even come remotely close to resolving that. I think it will actually worsen it for many of the reasons I’ve argued in this post; higher prices, higher taxes for all."
1,2024-01-13,"CMV: ""Mass Incarceration"" is not a thing.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/196208f/cmv_mass_incarceration_is_not_a_thing/,changemyview,"The way some people talk about ""mass incarceration"" is in terms that make it seem like some kind of Orwellian crackdown where police are making arrests and courts are imprisoning people en masse without justification like some kind of dystopian state.

But aren't these criminals being arrested and processed in accordance with the laws of the United States? I know it's cool to hate the police but I'm pretty sure cops aren't just making up crimes and arresting people for them, and certainly not to the point where it creates a system where this is the norm.

Similarly, I see no reason to believe that the court system, with all our checks and balances, is imprisoning people en masse without justification.

In fact, it seems to be the case that only a [tiny fraction](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/14/fewer-than-1-of-defendants-in-federal-criminal-cases-were-acquitted-in-2022/) of criminal defendants actually go to *trial*, much less are sentenced to imprisonment.

>In fiscal year 2022, only 290 of 71,954 defendants in federal criminal cases – about 0.4% – went to trial and were acquitted, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the latest available statistics from the federal judiciary. Another 1,379 went to trial and were found guilty (1.9%).  
  
The overwhelming majority of defendants in federal criminal cases that year did not go to trial at all. About nine-in-ten (89.5%) pleaded guilty, while another 8.2% had their case dismissed at some point in the judicial process, according to the data from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.

You might say that people are imprisoned to make money for private prisons. But according to this ostensibly anti-""mass incarceration"" article, only [7% of criminals are held in private prisons](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2023.html).

So just those two facts alone seem to suggest strongly that we don't really have a problem with mass incarceration. Not at all.

1,2024-01-13,CMV: Selling development rights to preserve farmland is short sited and destroys future generation business viability,u/EnvironmentalType257,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1962xb2/cmv_selling_development_rights_to_preserve/,changemyview,"In my part of the US there’s a huge focus on farmers or landowners selling their development rights to land preservation organizations. The government encourages it as a way of preserving farmland, often touting it as the “only option” for farms to survive. The program basically works where a farmer sells development rights for a one time cash payment. They still own the land but no longer own the right so sell it for development or subdivide it, etc. The amount of money involved in these transactions is rarely more than a couple hundred thousand dollars on land that frequently has market values in the millions of dollars. The development right payout is rarely enough to do more than build a single barn or purchase a single tractor. 

While this sounds good on paper, I see it problematic in four main ways:

1. It destroys the asset value of the land and hinders the farmers ability to use the asset as collateral for lending. Farmland appraisers look at different use options when valuing the property, and in areas where development pressure are strong the loss of development rights limits the appraisal to its agricultural production potential only. Since farming is so capital intensive, most farm business rely on debt financing to survive. A farm without development rights is hindered in their borrowing potential.

2. Generational transfer and farm family growth becomes difficult to impossible. For hundreds of years farms have carved out small pieces of land to build a house for the younger generations. Family farms need a means to keep family involved, and the overlap between parents working years and adult children’s working years is typically 40 to 50 years. Farms that don’t already have housing for multiple generations end up hand tied.

3. In disaster scenarios like multiple drought years back to back, devastating weather, barn fires, etc the ability to divide out and sell a small parcel of land could mean the difference between bankruptcy or survival for a family farm. Loss of development rights means this is no longer an option.

4. The whole concept is relatively new and nobody knows what’s going to happen decades down the road with the organization that ends up owning the development rights, or even worse its blind trust that a bad actor doesn’t weasel a legal path to acquire those rights and force the farm owners off of their own property."

The way they bypass juries allows for selective enforcement of unpopular laws against vulnerable populations, where jury nullification would otherwise keep prosecutors in check.

The increase in workload for prosecutors if plea deals were eliminated would be a benefit, as it would force them to only pursue cases which are actually important and which have solid evidence rather than attempting to scare people into taking plea deals for cases which have poor evidence.

Things that would change my view:

Evidence that plea deals provide some benefit to society other than lower cost to manage the courts and prosecutors office (which I consider insubstantial) or evidence that that additional cost would actually be more substantial than the social cost of mass incarceration and reduced right to a fair trial."

- Misleading pricing model: The negotiation-based pricing of car dealerships is a relic in today’s market, where straightforward and transparent pricing is the norm, such as in consumer electronics. The complex, often opaque negotiation process in car buying, rife with hidden fees, contrasts sharply with the simplicity and clarity in pricing of products like iPhones. This outdated model not only fosters consumer distrust but also enables potentially unethical sales practices.

- Car dealership harms innovation: You would think if manufacturers have someone taking care of the sales, they can sit back and keep building better cars. Nope, dealerships contribute to a noticeable delay in automotive technological advancements. The primary example is the infotainment systems that are always ugly, outdated looking, user-unfriendly. And why something so low-tech like the dash cameras are yet to be made standard? In other industry like tech, consumer feedback rapidly influences product upgrades. With automotive, the buffer between manufacturer and consumer caused by dealership stifles this critical feedback loop.

- Inefficient land use: The substantial land footprint of car dealerships in urban areas seems disproportionate to their contribution to community value or efficient land use. This in turn create limitation in consumer choice, confined to the dealership’s inventory onsite.

- Local establishment not capable of world-class professionalism: The varied customer experience at car dealerships stems from their local nature, which often lacks uniform corporate standards. This results in disparities in staff training and service quality, leading to a customer experience that’s hit or miss.

- Ethical concern for the whole industry: this one is from my personal experience so take it with a grain of salt but the auto sale industry is linked to a culture that is unethical and discriminatory. It takes a certain character to survive in this environment, so count yourself lucky if you don’t have to work with these people to make a living. The high-pressure environment of car dealerships has attracted the most dishonest, conservative, racist, and misogynistic people you will ever met.

- Political lobbying distort the market: Car manufacturers are barred by many state law from selling direct to consumers. Auto dealerships have evolved into powerful lobbying entities, influencing policies to maintain their market position. This protectionism contradicts free market principles. Imagine Apple being barred from selling their phones directly to consumer. Now, if the Apple Store can coexist along side third-party distributors, car dealerships should also face the same natural competition from manufacturer retail store and service centers. This will allow consumer preference and efficiency to determine a dealership’s survival and relevance.

Most people will inevitably be exposed to the loudest minority of terminally online political extremists spewing the most morally bankrupt of political opinions.  And what do most people do?

Nothing.

The apathy, silence, and submissiveness of most people in the face of such political extremism from both ends of the political spectrum proved that most of humanity is quietly complicit with these terminally online political extremists. They wholeheartedly agree to both ends of political extremism, they are simply too afraid to publicly voice out their agreement

So, what is the truth?

The truth is that the loudest online political extremism do accurately reflect human nature, proving that humanity is inherently hedonistic, self-hating, self-destructive, and blatantly evil."

In my view, it should be banned as a single woman, to go to a clinic and inseminate yourself, conveiving a child via sperm donor and raising the child as a single. parent.

Either you find another person to raise the child with both parents or you just dont get the child.

If you want to get a child as a single person, adopt one.

The reason im making this post was because i had a discussion with a woman who saw nothing wrong with her being as a single person and inseminating herself, bringing the child to this world without second parent. Her arguments:

-its better than hooking up with random person and getting pregnant.

-its better than having disfunctional marriage and be divorced along the way.

-adopting children is more constly than inseminating yourself


So from what i can understand, it is completely ethical and normal to do so and as she said, majority of women dont find that disgusting at all.

I do not say single people dont have a right to have children. But saying that sentence is delusional in its own. Of course they cant have children. They are single. Now its possible to be single and have a child.


Then she argued about men being abusers, deadbeats, alcoholics and it would be better for her to do it that way and for many other women.

Then i send her this link
 https://www.fixfamilycourts.com/single-mother-home-statistics/


Stating that majority of the rapists, abusers, juveniles and criminals come from single mother homes and she didn't reply. 


I really want to see everyones view on this.

Having a child as a single person taking out if the equation the everything that comes with it.

1,2024-01-14,"CMV: in the clash between Patrick Stewart and James Corden at the Glamour awards, Patrick Stewart was definitely way more in the wrong",u/Janewaymaster,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/196e6zb/cmv_in_the_clash_between_patrick_stewart_and/,changemyview,"Let's dig up some ancient history that done and put away. The two below have already made up ages ago, but I wanna do the CMV anyways. 
In 2010, Corden was hosting the Glamour Women of the Year awards. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIBUWqSTp90&t=42s

Patrick Stewart for some reason was tearing into him. Starting off by accusing him of ""'looking around as if you would rather be anywhere in the world but here'.""

James Corden I think handled this rather decently, where he defended himself, apologized if it seemed that way, and made a joke that allowed both of them to save face and move on. 

But for some reason Patrick Stewart then gets super personal and cruel saying things like

> 'From where I was, I could see your belly and that was from right at the back of the room.'

Which was not said in a joking way, and clearly Stewart's ego was hurt and he was lashing out 

Then afterwards Stewart says 

>""Do you want one more? ""If you fancy one of the Jonas Brothers, cover your belly.""

So on top of the nasty fat jokes, he tops it with a ""haha you're gay"" joke.

So in summary Patrick Stewart was rude for several reasons 

1. Interrupting an award show to criticize the host, who has an already difficult job. He may be in his own head because he is thinking about the other million things he has to do or be prepared for later in the show. Even if there is some feedback you want to give, give it after the show, don't publicly embarrass them 
2. Even after receiving an apology which as per point #1 think was overly generous, he still digs into him by making a nasty fat joke.
3. After insulting Corden and fat people in general in the process he decides to insult Corden by implying he's gay, and by using ""being gay"" as an insult, thus insulting gay people in the process 

Whenever this topic comes up, people always tend to criticize Corden and easily forgive Stewart, even though on paper Corden didn't do anything wrong, and Stewart started the whole thing and wouldn't drop it. 

The only reason this didn't keep escalating is because after the stupid Jonas brother gay fat joke, Corden held his tongue and became the better man by not retaliating. 

The only thing I could think of that Corden did wrong was stand close to him at the podium and asking him where the punchline is. But I mean, he also has some self-respect, how many stupid, weak and nasty jokes and criticisms would you take before you start to stand up for yourself. And Corden didn't go nasty or so personal as Stewart did. All he did was criticize Stewart's actions. Stewart criticized him for his personal characteristics that is weight and joking about his sexual orientation."

Throughout human history, different civilizations and tribal groups have been in a constant battle amongst each other for territory and resources. 

The stronger tribe with better warriors annihilated the weaker tribe, and took the territory and resources of the land for themselves. 

The colonisation era was simply a period of time where highly advanced tribes travelled the world conquering militarily far inferior ones. 

This is not something they are obliged to apologise for. Weak tribes that can’t protect their land and resources and get colonised, are not entitled to safety and security. The only thing I can say is better luck in the next life. 

Weak tribes are not owed anything. Descendants of weak tribes are not owed anything. If you have military power, you are entitled to do whatever you want with it until/if someone stops you. 


Anyway. Open to changing my view here, I’m affixed to the idea of power, he who wields it is entitled to do so as they please."

We humans are diverse in: our beliefs, physical appearances, culture e.t.c and yet we depend on each other for a lot of things hence we ultimately have to interact and live with each other despite our differences.

The best way to learn to live with other people is by doing everyday things together e.g going to school together, working together, because this allows friendships to form, dispel prejudices e.t.c

**Long version:**

So I was born in Kenya and I lived most of my life there and I just recently immigrated to Germany. I used to think that only Kenya's politicians use ethnicity to get votes and I was surprised to see that even in liberal democracies like the U.S. and Germany there are these types of politicians.

For example in the U.S there is a lot of talk about the black vote, hispanic vote and the evangelical vote, the white vote e.t.c. 

The school I went to in Nairobi (the capital city) was multi-ethnic/multi-religious meaning I interacted a lot with people from different faiths, people who spoke different languages from mine and people who had different cultural practices. My best friend was from a different ethnicity, and when I was in university I even dated a muslim girl. 

By the time I became an adult I had already accepted that people were the same even though they looked different, had different beliefs and culture, and I am not the only one, most people that went to the same type of schools that I did, ended up having the same world view. Such that Politicians who use tribalism to get votes had a hard time getting votes from us. 

This is however not the case for all people in my country, lots of people went to school in less diverse places and these people are duped by politicians a lot in to voting against their own interest.

Now back to the west, let's take the US for example some white voters vote for Republicans even though they would be better served by democrats e.g in terms of minimum wage, greater access to health care benefits and good working conditions all because of race based issues."

Poverty is the lowest it’s ever been. Abuse is at the lowest level it’s ever been, and so are murders. They are all extremely low compared to the past. 

People are happier than they’ve ever been at any point in history, and are the most social than at any point in human history. 

People drink less, smoke less and do less risky things. 

Mental health issues are decreasing now that the pandemic is over, and everyone is doing exceptionally well.

1,2024-01-14,CMV: Israel is currently committing genocide in Gaza,u/stephen_kennys_LHCB,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/196ioqi/cmv_israel_is_currently_committing_genocide_in/,changemyview,"Firstly, I’m only discussing events since October 7th. Many will say that Israel has been committing genocide since before that point, but I’m not sure that this is as clear-cut as events post-October 7th. But I’m open to being convinced otherwise. Also, I am already aware of how bad Hamas are, so no need to bring that up. As evil and genocidal as they are, this is not an excuse for Israel’s actions. 

#Definition

I’m going to use the 1948 UN Genocide Convention’s definition of genocide in this post. The UN is often accurately criticised for being unfairly anti-Israel, but that doesn’t make their definition invalid. That wasn’t the case in 1948, and there is nothing anti-Israel about the definition itself, which is used by the EU and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, two institutions which are very pro-Israel. If you disagree with this definition, please explain why and provide an alternative one, and get in touch with the Holocaust Museum to tell them they’re wrong about what is and isn’t genocide. 

The definition is as follows:

>Genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic or religious group, as such:

>(a) Killing members of the group;

>(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

>(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its
physical destruction in whole or in part;

>(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

>(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

So there’s two components to this definition; act and intent. Only one of the acts is necessary to be committed for genocide to occur. 

#Genocidal Acts

Since October 7th, Israel has undeniably been committing the first three acts in Gaza. They have killed tens of thousands of Gazans, including thousands of children. They have caused serious bodily or mental harm to much more than that amount. And, through actions like cutting off fuel, food, water etc and restricting the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, they have deliberately inflicted on Gazans conditions that could lead to the destruction of their group. The other two acts, I don’t think that what Israel has been doing could be characterised as meeting these descriptions. 

#Genocidal Intent

Now, hopefully everything I’ve said thus far we can all agree on. Most pro-Israel people will say that the sole reason such acts have been committed is to eradicate Hamas, which is certainly a valid and moral goal. But the rhetoric that has repeatedly been espoused by Israeli leadership since October 7th says otherwise. 

They say that all Palestinians are responsible for October 7th, and when this is combined with the dehumanising and uncompromisingly brutal descriptions of Hamas, and the calls to completely and utterly destroy Hamas and Gaza, I believe that, by attempting to equivocate all Gazans with Hamas, they are clearly expressing an intent to destroy, in whole or in part, the national, ethnic or religious group that is Palestinians in Gaza. Even assuming they also have the intent of destroying Hamas, this does not negate the intent I have illustrated above. 

You can find nine pages worth of this rhetoric, which is still not exhaustive, in [South Africa’s ICJ suit of Israel](https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/192/192-20231228-app-01-00-en.pdf), starting from page 59. If you wish to discuss South Africa’s motives behind the suit, or the merits of their case, please find or make your own thread. I am not endorsing it, it is simply a good collection of the type of rhetoric I am discussing. This is the kind of thing they are willing to say in public. Imagine what they say privately. 

#Conclusion

Israel clearly commits genocidal acts, and has genocidal intentions too. This combination of genocidal act and genocidal intent makes their actions in Gaza a clear case of genocide."
76,2024-01-14,CMV: anyone who's serious about sustainability should change to a plant-based diet,u/James_Fortis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/196irbd/cmv_anyone_whos_serious_about_sustainability/,changemyview,"  
Studies have shown the best way for us to reduce deforestation, land use, fresh water use, eutrophication, and biodiversity loss is to change from omnivore diets to plant-based diets.  This is because animal agriculture is the leading driver of all of these factors, and switching to a plant-based diet can reduce them by as much as 75% (example source [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00795-w), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00343-4), [3](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216)).  Per the FAO, animal agriculture also emits more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector.  
  
We need to protect what is left of our biodiversity and change the way we interact with the environment. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) states we've lost an estimated [69%](https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/) of wild animals in the past 50 years, with losses as high as 94% in places like Latin America.  We've already changed the world so much that [96%](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1711842115) of mammalian biomass is now humans and our livestock.  
  
One of the most common rebuttals to the above is a plant-based diet isn't healthy, and therefore isn't a viable solution for sustainability.  In fact, it can be a major improvement over what many in the west are currently eating.  My country (USA) gets 150-200% of the protein we require and only [5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124841/) hit the recommended minimum daily fiber intake.  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the largest nutritional body in the world with over 112,000 experts, and [its position](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/) is a plant-based diet is healthy for all stages of life and can reduce the chances of getting the top chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers.  I say this to focus the discussion around other topics that are much more likely to change my view.

Corporations and governments won't lead the charge alone against the status quo, so it's important that we as consumers take responsibility at the same time.

The dominant diets in developed nations are based on societal and behavioral norms, but are far from optimal.  It's true that diet is a personal choice, so I hold it is better to choose a diet that is much more sustainable than what we're currently eating.

But now with the hamas-Israel war there is lots of discussion on wether it is genocide or no. so I’m gonna give my arguments why Russia is NOT commiting genocide in Ukraine.

The ukranian military deaths greatly outnumber deaths of Ukranian civilians. This is actually really rare in modern war as we can see in the israel- Hamas war where most deaths are woman and childeren and not militants. Ukraine has lost 10k civilians since the start of the war(source: https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2023/09/ukraine-civilian-casualty-update-24-september-2023)  wich is very low compared to other war like in Gaza where 20k civilians died in 3 months. If Russia was actually trying to genocide ukranians the civilians deaths would be higher than the military deaths. So these stories of russia targeting civilians are simply fake.

In the regions Russia has captured Russia has been rebuilding the region for example in mariupol where the rebuilding of civilians houses has restarted if Russia wanted all the ukranians genocided why would they rebuild the regions?

So I’m curious on the arguments the people that think russia commiting genocide have and maybe change my mind."

Why would doctors conduct this completely unnecessary procedure? It doesnt matter if the parents are religious. No doctor should say yes to mutilating a body unless the baby clearly needs it done medically

I believe doctors should not do elective surgeries on children when the child literally has no say in the matter. I can imagine some elective surgeries should be allowed on children if the child has a strong desire to do so. However babies can not consent.

Not only that, it’s almost certain that no child would strongly desire genital mutilation. And even if they strongly desired it, the doctor should still think twice about executing on such a surgery. 

This is a barbaric norm and absolutely unacceptable even if the child’s parents are religious."
225,2024-01-14,"CMV: Racial preference settings on dating apps are a good thing, and even if you believe having racial preferences is racist or discriminatory they're still a good thing.",u/yayayawhat_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/196nmot/cmv_racial_preference_settings_on_dating_apps_are/,changemyview,"For context, I'm a ""person of color"" myself so part of this does come from my personal experience with dating apps and the likes.  

I see a lot of people opposing race filters/preference settings on dating apps because it's ""racist"" that you only want to date within your race, or only want to date specific races.   

The fact that I disagree with this aside (this isn't what the CMV post is for so please don't try to CMV on me thinking racial preferences are *not* racist), I think that the existence of people who only want to date certain races regardless of the ethics of said preference just makes it *more important* that racial preferences exist on dating apps - not for *their* benefit, *but for the benefit of everyone else.* Why? Because everyone else won't be wasting swipes/likes on people who automatically write them off because of their race/ethnicity.  

I'm a brown guy but I'm open to dating outside of my race - but a lot of women I know, even ones I'm friends with, say they probably wouldn't date a brown guy. So on dating apps without ethnic preferences, I'm always worrying that I'm wasting my swipes/likes on people who are not even going to consider me regardless of how good my profile, prompts and photos are, and that I could've used that like on someone who may actually be interested in me. But without an ethnic filter that would hide the profiles of anyone who isn't interested in me based on my race, I have no clue if I'm wasting swipes or not.      

Adding an ethnic filter wouldn't just make it so that their experience on these apps would be better, it would also make **my** experience and the experience of everyone who *doesn't* have a racial dating preference better, because they will not be wasting swipes on people with preferences they don't fit, and those people will also not feel inconvenienced by getting likes from people who they are not attracted to. It's a win-win for everyone.  

The only ""argument"" I've seen when this point has been brought up is that it can make people with strict ethnic preferences ""rethink"" those preferences if they see someone they find attractive of an ethnicity they wouldn't usually date. But I think this is pretty unlikely and it's honestly kind of naive to think a dating app would change someone's preferences this heavily, and it shouldn't be a dating app's responsibility or obligation to do this or attempt to do it anyways. And again it inconveniences *everyone* because people of other races waste swipes on people who aren't interested in them, and that person is also having to swipe left on a bunch of extra people they're not interested in as well.  

So to conclude, yeah, even if you believe having an ethnic preference for dating is wrong, evil and racist, allowing them to filter out ethnicities they don't want to date *helps* those ethnicities because they are not going to be wasting their likes (most dating apps limit the amount of likes you have without paying) on people who are automatically not going to be interested in them because of their race, and gives them more likes to use on people who are at least open to dating them."

1,2024-01-14,Cmv: Africa is as impoverished/underdeveloped as it is due to corruption/poor leadership. Not the slave trade or colonialism,u/FerdinandvonAegir124,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/196rbpm/cmv_africa_is_as_impoverishedunderdeveloped_as_it/,changemyview,"When one compares maps of the slave trade, to the most impoverished regions of Africa there is very little overlap. 
The slave trade most impacted the countries of Angola, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Ghana, and Guinea Bissau. Yet when one looks at a map, the only country in the 20 poorest is Togo. 
Togo has been the victim of political instability, and due to its restrictive economy wavering costs for goods leading to its impoverishment
As horrible as the slave trade, one cannot blame it for Africas problems centuries later.

On to colonialism

In the mid 1800s the “scramble for Africa” occurred, in which to gain materials for industrialization almost all of Africa was colonized. The only exception to this was Ethiopia, and Ethiopia at the of being colonized by the Italians was arguably the most underdeveloped country in the world. They were literally countering tanks with arrows. where as the colonized parts of Africa although not terribly developed, at least showed a certain level of growth. 
The countries that were the most recently independent (Egypt, Botswana, South Africa, Zambia, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, Morocco Tanzania, and Namibia) have the highest standards of living/highest development index compared to countries such as Sudan/Congo who gained independence sooner.
So a correlation can be formed that in the long term colonization actually helped African countries economically, despite the horrible atrocities committed by some European powers. (Leapold ii, British rule of South Africa)

Finally, most other countries that were subjected to colonization during the same era are generally fairing much better today than the average African country. For example most of South America, and the independent Satellite states of the former Soviet Union are doing much better economically/human rights. This is what leaves me to believe that Africas problems are a result of its own poor leadership and corruption, not the fault of  Europeans in decades/centuries past"

1,2024-01-14,CMV: The second amendment says nothing directly about owning or carrying a gun,u/Keith502,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/196vy0b/cmv_the_second_amendment_says_nothing_directly/,changemyview,"The Supreme Court has established in *DC v Heller* that the second amendment guarantees an individual right to own a gun, and that the primary original purpose of the amendment was self-defense.  And this interpretation has carried over into later rulings such as *McDonald v Chicago* and *NYSRPA v Bruen*.  This decision was based largely upon the interpretation that the language ""to keep and bear arms"" means ""to own and carry weapons"".  People largely come to this conclusion through a simple analysis involving the basic dictionary definitions of some of the words in the amendment.  The main operative terms in the amendment are “keep arms” and “bear arms”; “keep” is understood to mean “own”, and “bear” is defined as “carry”, and “arms” means “weapons”; thus, to “keep arms” means to “own weapons”, and to “bear arms” means to “carry weapons”.  This all seems logical enough at first glance.  But I believe that this analysis is incorrect, and the second amendment actually says nothing, directly speaking, about either the owning or the carrying of guns.  
  
The second amendment should not guarantee an unqualified right to access weapons because the very concept of ""weapons"" does not technically exist in the language. The word ""arms"", as it appears in the amendment, is not a noun, but is actually a component of the phrasal verbs ""keep arms"" and ""bear arms"". In other words, to say that to ""bear arms"" is all about carrying weapons is like saying that the phrasal verb ""bear fruit"" is all about carrying apples, oranges, and bananas.  The word ""fruit"" does not actually exist as a noun in the phrase ""bear fruit""; it is nothing more than an integral component of the phrasal verb that it comprises.  The same is true of ""bear arms""; the word ""arms"" is nothing more than a component of its phrasal verb.  And the phrasal verb “bear arms” is an intransitive verb, meaning a verb that has no direct object to its action.  Thus, the language of the amendment does not actually involve the people's right to *possess* a piece of property, but it involves the people's right to *do* something.  
  
Not only is the grammar of the second amendment interpreted incorrectly, but the very meaning of the terminology is also misinterpreted.  The term “bear arms” does not literally refer to carrying weapons; if you were to look at the usage of the phrase in any historical document, it will be clear that it means much more than simply carrying weapons.  For example, there are many arms provisions from the Founding era which include a clause that exempts people from militia duty who had conscientious scruples against bearing arms.  But if “bear arms” only meant carrying a gun, it would make no sense for someone to have conscientious scruples regarding merely carrying a gun.  The term must naturally signify something more than that.  Furthermore, the phrase “bear arms” is in the same family as a phrase like ""take arms"" or “take up arms”.  Take this sentence, for example: ""In response to the military invasion by Russia, the people of Ukraine were forced to take arms"".  Does ""take arms"" here mean that the Ukrainians went to a gun shop and took a gun and then just went back home and did nothing else?  Or does it mean that the Ukrainians armed themselves and then began to fight?  Most would agree that the true meaning is the latter; hence ""take arms"" is not a literal term but an idiomatic expression, signifying something different from its literal denotation.  It so happens that “bear arms"" is in the same family as ""take arms"".  They both come from the same etymological root, a family of military-related phrases translated from the Latin.  Some examples include “take arms”, which is a translation of the Latin phrase *arma capere*, ""to lay down one's arms"" is a translation of the phrase *arma ponere*, and ""bear arms"" comes from the phrase *arma ferre*.  These are all well-established idiomatic expressions within Anglo-Saxon history.  “Take arms” does not literally refer to taking arms, but instead refers to the act of arming oneself and then proceeding to begin to fight.  To ""lay down one's arms"" does not mean to literally put your weapons down; it essentiallly means to disarm and stop fighting.  Similar is true of the phrase ""bear arms"": it does not mean to simply carry a weapon, but essentially to carry a weapon and fight.  In other words, it means ""to engage in armed combat.""  Thus, it is incorrect to officially interpret the second amendment as protecting one’s right to carry a gun in public.  
  
Also, to ""keep arms"" did not actually mean ""own weapons"", as many people think.  The term instead referred to the keeping of weapons in one's custody.  Historical documents did not typically use the term ""keep arms"" to refer to gun possession in the broad sense; instead the term was typically used in the narrower context of keeping a weapon handy in preparation for some distinct purpose, such as militia duty, self-defense, hunting, etc.  Thus, while it is possible to both own arms and keep arms, they are by no means synonymous.  For example, let’s say you own a gun, and it’s the only gun you have.  You have a friend who is scared that someone is coming after him, so you let your friend borrow your gun temporarily for protection.  This would mean that as of right now, your friend keeps arms, and you don’t.  As you can see, owning a weapon and “keeping arms” are two distinctly different concepts.  Thus, it is incorrect to officially interpret the second amendment as protecting one’s right to own a gun.  
  
All this being said, the phrase “to keep and bear arms” is not referring to an unqualified individual right to own and carry weapons, but is actually simply referring to the basic functions of militia service: to keep weapons in one’s custody in preparation for future hostilities, and then to engage in armed combat.  Militia duty was not an action performed by a distinct military organization, but rather was a common civic duty of the people at the time of the framing, somewhat analogous to jury duty today.  Therefore, the phrase “the right of the people to keep and bear arms” is not at all referring to the American people’s right to simply own guns and carry them around for civilian purposes; it is instead referring to the American people’s right to do their civic duty to fight in the militia, and to be appropriately equipped for that duty.  
  
My discussion here is not about whether Americans should have a statute that protects their right to own weapons of self-defense, because theoretically another amendment or act could be passed by Congress to codify that very thing, if need be.  Nor am I concerned here about the implications of the 14th amendment on the second amendment.  My concern here is whether the second amendment itself *actually* says what the Supreme Court and gun owners think it says.  

Because the language and grammar of the second amendment does not literally have anything to do with the owning and carrying of guns, it’s my understanding that it should not have this legal effect when applied in government.  But maybe I’m wrong, and a statute that begins by talking about a militia defending the state’s security actually has nothing to do with a militia defending the state’s security, and instead it’s all about the right to own a gun so you can shoot beer cans in your backyard or something.  What do you think?  Am I wrong about this?

Another thing that bothers me are episodes where the other three boys have a major part to play, but not Kenny (looking at you, Season 20).


So here are the changes that I would to like to see. First, a good way to encourage writers to make him more talkative would be to have subtitles appear when he engages in muffled speaking so that we better understand what he is saying, the audience can do a lot reading. Or if we want to be a little more radical, we can abandon muffled speaking altogether and have him talk in an intelligible manner. Second, it would also be nice to have a season dedicated to him and his family, since there was Season 6, where he was dead.

The music is good (if very repetitive), and the games level design for the most part is good.

But to the negatives 

The bosses: none of them are remotely interesting and are painfully easy (even final bowser). Most of them can be defeated in under 5 seconds by a decent player. For example Morton/Roy who you can defeat before they reach the wall.

The level design: is repetitive: aside from the occasional unique theming (sawmill, forest of illusion, somewhat Choco land) feels largely the same.
There’s way too many water levels in the first half of the game (up to the forest of illusion) and being water levels they are miserable.

Little innovation: compared to Mario 3 this game doesn’t really innovate much. The only thing the game really added were secret exits, and the cape feather. It removed so much of what made 3 unique. It tones down the power ups until we’re left with just 5 (cape feather, fire flower, super mushroom, star, and the p-balloon) of which only 3 of them are used often enough to leave an impact. It also removed the card games, out of level items (hammer, anchor, warps, map encounters and the Powerup select)

Did not take advantage of leap from Nes-Snes:  although this game could not have been played on the nes, with little downgrading it could have readily fit on that system. This is in comparison to sonic 1 which would have needed *massive* downgrading to work on the master system (yes I know a demake exists and it’s borderline unrecognizable). Mario world of downgraded would have likely been easily recognizable if downgraded due to it not taking advantage of the snes the same way Sonic 1 took advantage of the genesis 

Finally, the castle levels: this is more of a personal thing than anything but I’ve always found them absolutely miserable. Although none are terribly long they force slow navigation making them take an eternity and forcing you to replay long slow section over again if you die.

1,2024-01-14,"CMV: If one chooses to be a hateful person, one should just own that rather than use religion as a fig leaf.",u/aphroditex,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/196zlqe/cmv_if_one_chooses_to_be_a_hateful_person_one/,changemyview,"“I’m a Christian and this is why I hate….”

While one will almost never find that exact verbiage from people, there are far too many who use their religion as justification for being hateful people. 

That messaging comes from other religions as well, but this is the most prominent example in the Anglosphere, so I will focus on that. 

That messaging comes from so many hateful preachers that claim that queer folks are wrong, that claim that certain political figures they disagree with are possessed, that claim they need to up the hate because that’s what Jesus would want? 

Nevermind that the base teaching of that nobody was to treat all with respect as one would wish to be respected, with nice branches into calling out and mocking hypocrisy from the allegedly pious for whom being better than thou is an act to get social cred rather than a reflection of their connection to their chosen deity. 

Nevermind that guy hung out with outcasts and socioeconomically depressed persons, showing concern for how the sick, the orphan, the widow, the powerless were treated. 

Nevermind that the words they are reading are almost certainly a biased translation of a biased translation, which lets them tilt the meaning how they want to. (Example of this: it is linguistically correct to take the Hebrew and the Greek phrase that is translated as “son of man” and instead translate it as “child of humanity.” That change alone takes out a bias that is anti-woman from JC’s words that was not there.) 

Hate, fear, and anger are easy to weaponize, and these hateful preachers are using those weapons for their own benefits. 

PastorArrested is full of these kinds of fire and brimstone style preachers who are arrested and charged for child sexual abuse, and it is freaking disturbing to observe, predictably as the tides, that the faithful close ranks around the pastor that did such monstrous things to a child, though cult psychology easily explains why this happens. 

Thing is, people don’t just fall into places that have hateful ideologies. Even those who grow up in such religious environments can, and often do, choose to leave that hatefulness behind. That seems to indicate it’s not the religion that makes one hate, but that one hates which directs to that religion. 

Hate needs to build edifices of untruths, tortured logic, leaps of unreasoning to justify itself. So much work that one needs to put in to be hateful. 

To not hate just requires seeing the other as one sees oneself. Super freaking lazy. 

But I know I’m probably wrong in this, and I would like to see the other perspective since in any religion, there are always adherents who choose to not hate despite hateful messaging, and there are always adherents that choose to hate despite messaging that is free of hate. 

Example of the former would be the parishioners of the megachurch pastors claiming a certain orange man that lies, cheats, and steals as a good man who instead are Ridin’ with Biden, and an example of the latter are the Catholics that are upset at Pope Francis for giving a few millimetres to queer folks."

First of all I feel like this is kind of a privileged take that some people have without actually living in an area with a large homeless population.

Well I live in a town with an obscene homeless population, one of the largest in America. 

Anti homeless architecture does not reflect how hard a city is trying to help their homeless people. Some cities are super neglectful and others aren’t. But regardless, the architecture itself isn’t the problem. I know that my city puts tons of money into homeless shelters and rehabilitation, and that the people who sleep on the public benches are likely addicted to drugs or got kicked out for some other reason. I agree 100% that it’s the city’s responsibility to aid the homeless.

But getting angry at anti homeless architecture seems to imply that these public benches were made for homeless people to sleep on…up until recently, it was impossible to walk around downtown without passing a homeless person on almost every corner, and most of them smelled very strongly of feces. But we’ve begun to implement anti homeless architecture and the changes to our downtown have been unbelievable. We can actually sit on the public benches now, there’s so much less litter everywhere, and the entire downtown area is just so much more vibrant and welcoming. I’m not saying that I don’t care about the homeless people, but there’s a time and place."

It happened because the girl expressed interest in him, and he wanted to see if he could develop feelings for her, but he made it clear from the start that he was waiting for his ex, which is me. The girl was fine with waiting, but they didn't last long, and my ex decided to end things between them because he wanted to reach out to me. 

Now, I've checked the girl's TikTok account, and I see her reposted videos expressing insecurity, feeling like she's not enough for someone to stay, even though she's still willing to wait.

You are an adult, you should be able to peel a fucking orange without needing someone else to do it for you, unless you’re sick or disabled. This whole princess treatment and needing men to do every single thing for a woman in a relationship just shows that despite most women saying they are ‘independent and can do things by themselves’ just out themselves to be lazy people when they need to rely on their boyfriends to do extremely simple things. 

If you are a strong independent person, why do you need somebody else to do a menial task for you?

Most things that happen to us are beyond our control and we're forced to deal with them no matter what if we don't want to die. The universe spontaneously happened with nothing preceding it and non-suicidal people who have shitty lives just have to bide their time until they're dead. 

Even good people have life-altering shitty things happen to them out of the blue which can shift their life in to constant suffering such as a terminal illness like cancer or they lose their jobs and become homeless. The list goes on. 

And suffering is a given. We hurt other people and animals to stay alive which is part of nearly every species. The idea of having to hurt of kill someone or something just to merely survive another day feels dystopian to me.

It's about the deep-rooted connections between Taiwan and China, the extensive influence of the U.S. in Taiwan, and why reducing tensions with China might not just be possible, but could be the most beneficial path for Taiwan's future, but US may want to avoid that this ever happens. 

**Taiwan and China: A Bond Beyond Politics**
Let's start by acknowledging the profound commonalities between Taiwan and China. They share not just a language and ethnic roots but also cultural traditions and historical narratives that go back centuries. These ties are not superficial; they are embedded in the everyday lives of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. From family connections that span the divide to shared festivals, cuisine, and art forms, the cultural and social fabric linking Taiwan and China is intricate and deeply woven.

**The U.S. in Taiwan: More Than Just an Ally**
The role of the U.S. in Taiwan extends far beyond superficial diplomatic support. It's a deep-seated presence that permeates Taiwan's political, military, and even cultural spheres. The U.S. has been a key player in shaping Taiwan's defense strategies, evidenced by significant arms sales and military training programs. This military cooperation is complemented by strong political ties, with U.S. policies and perspectives having considerable influence on Taiwan's international stance.

Moreover, American cultural influences are palpable in Taiwan, from education and media to consumer habits. This cultural penetration is part of a broader American strategy to maintain influence in a region increasingly dominated by Chinese power.

Looking at history, the U.S. has a track record of interventions that have had mixed outcomes. In South America, instances like the 1973 Chilean coup d’état against Allende and the Contra War in Nicaragua in the 1980s are examples of U.S. involvement in regime change for geopolitical gains. In the Middle East, the U.S. played a pivotal role in the 1953 Iranian coup d’état and the Iraq War in 2003, interventions justified by various reasons but ultimately serving broader strategic interests. Similar patterns can be observed in Africa and even Europe, where U.S. policies and actions have significantly influenced political dynamics.

**Why Easing Tensions with China Might Be Taiwan's Best Bet**
The prevailing narrative often paints a picture of inevitable conflict between Taiwan and China. However, considering their shared cultural and economic ties, a scenario where tensions ease isn't just possible; it could be incredibly beneficial for both Taiwan and China.

Reducing tensions would open doors to heightened economic collaboration, leveraging the vast market and resources that mainland China offers. It could also lead to a more stable and peaceful regional environment, which is crucial for Taiwan's long-term economic and social development.

**The Potential Dilemma for Taiwan**
However, this move towards closer ties with China could be perceived unfavorably by the U.S., given its strategic interests in countering Chinese influence. The U.S. might view such a rapprochement as a weakening of its position in the Asia-Pacific region. Taiwan, therefore, finds itself at a crossroads, needing to balance its historical and cultural affinity with China against the political and military backing it receives from the U.S.

**Conclusion: Charting a Path Forward**
For Taiwan, charting a path toward lessening tensions with China while maintaining a degree of autonomy from both Chinese and American influence could be the key to securing its future. This approach would require nuanced diplomacy, leveraging Taiwan's unique cultural and economic position. Ultimately, the goal should be for Taiwan to assert itself as a distinct entity, capable of making sovereign decisions that best serve the interests of its people, free from the overbearing influence of both neighboring giants. 

In the hypothetical and unfortunate event of a war between the U.S. and China, with Taiwan hosting U.S. military personnel , the scenario for Taiwan could be grim. Let's paint a picture of this situation.

In a conflict, these bases turn Taiwan into a bulls-eye for Chinese military action. It's not just about strategy; it's symbolic. Taiwan becomes a visible extension of U.S. military power, exacerbating its risk of becoming a major battleground. 

Now, think about the economic fallout. Taiwan's economy, especially its crown jewel - the semiconductor industry, gets hit hard. Wars disrupt everything – supply chains break down, production grinds to a halt, and foreign investors run for the hills. The economic backbone of Taiwan, which took decades to build, could crumble in a matter of days.

But it's the human cost that's most heartbreaking. Civilian casualties, families torn apart, cities possibly in ruins. The Taiwanese people, caught in the crossfire of superpowers, would face a humanitarian crisis of unimaginable proportions.

Politically, Taiwan could end up in no man's land. In the eyes of many countries, it might be seen as a proxy battleground for U.S.-China tensions, leading to political isolation. Even if China were to lose heavily the conflict, the Taiwan we know today - prosperous, vibrant, and forward-moving - could be a shadow of its former self, struggling to rebuild from the ashes of war.

All the progress Taiwan has made, its economic achievements, its democratic society, could be set back by decades. It's a stark reminder of the delicate balance Taiwan must maintain in its relationships with these global giants.

**TLDR: Taiwan, stuck between a rock and a hard place, should consider distancing itself militarily from both China and the U.S, and try their best to get economically closer to China. 

Why? The shared cultural and historical bonds with China offer a path to economic and political harmony, potentially more beneficial than being a strategic pawn in U.S. geopolitics.

The U.S., with a history of political manipulations (think Chile 1973, Iran 1953, Iraq 2003), might not be the most reliable ally for Taiwan's long-term autonomy and prosperity. Could Taiwan's best move be seeking a middle path, leveraging its unique position and asserting true self-governance amidst these two global powers? 

This is not just about diplomacy; it's about Taiwan's survival as a sovereign entity.**

I invite you to challenge my perspective on the tangible, enduring benefits for Taiwan in aligning more closely with the United States. Let's set aside any notions of superpower shaming; this is about realpolitik and hard truths. In a world where every great power acts in its own interest, what is the benefit for Taiwan?"

The anti-AI art crowd will typically argue that AI art is unoriginal or “steals” art. The pro-AI art crowd knows this isn’t *technically* true, and will typically leverage the fact that diffusion models run inference in an already interpreted and compressed latent space, the model has no access to training data during inference, the models used to are too small to compress the original training data, do not contain mechanisms to explicitly store the training data and can generate trillions of times more unique images than was found in the original training set. They might further leverage the fact this attack is only present on a small minority of current generative methods, with some other generative approaches having the generator not even seeing the original artwork ever.

This argument is technically correct, although it’s missing the point. Artists spend hours, years trying to improve themselves and struggling through mental and emotional fatigue to create an image their proud of. They might feel inferior, they feel insecure, and they often feel left behind. The lack of empathy and sympathy toward their struggle and what they view as disenchantment by large corporations is very real and I think in that sense by referring to it as AI “art” we are disenfranchising the very real and very personal mental and emotional struggle along with the artistic journey of millions of artists.

I think the fundamental differences in these arguments stem from technical accuracy, which is focused on by pro-AI; seen with arguments on how AI art technically doesn’t steal art. And human impact, which is focused on by anti-ai showing how it disenfranchises some artists. The disagreement I think isn’t weather the technology can make art, it’s if the technology should. Instead of the argument boiling down to “is AI art inherently bad?” I think the argument should boil down to essentially “should AI art exist?” Or “does it provide a net benefit?”

To change my view: you’d either need to provide evidence that the average artist has a deeper understanding of AI technology than presented, AI itself inherently steals art by it’s technical processes or my understanding of the arguments brought forth by both sides are incorrect. I would also be swayed by alternative convincing arguments. Thanks!"

The attack itself was clearly of a terrorist nature (attacking civilians, burning children alive, raping women and much more nightmare material) but what struck me just as much was the celebrations in Gaza to the attacks, including the parading of naked corpses of Israelis. I find it hard to believe that Hamas's actions don't represent the people of Gaza, when death is so widely celebrated like that.

In my opinion, it is ridiculous to say that approval ratings so high don't represent a population, I'd say that even approval ratings as high as 40% are highly representative so this survey is well within a reasonable margin of error.

A pedestrian being hit by a car going 35 MPH is five times more likely to die than if they were hit by a car going 20 MPH.

It’s already been proven that raising speed limits leads directly to increased automobile deaths, and lowering speed limits reduces them.

While pedestrian crashes will be fatal more likely than not at 45 MPH, I don’t think I could ever sway anyone into thinking that we should all only ever drive under 30 MPH.

But the fact that anyone ever feels the need to drive faster than a cheetah for tens of minutes at a time is completely beyond me. The fact that 70 MPH is *standard* highway speed is absolutely baffling— nearly all car-on-car collisions are fatal at such extreme speeds.

45 MPH is more than fast enough. That’s as fast as a horse without a rider. You’re already outspeeding 99% of wildlife for an extended period of time— how much more could you possibly want?"

Having diametrically opposing, yet equally militant, ideologies at the center of all political discussions greatly weakens our democracy by discouraging active engagement from the majority — this prevents us from discussing equitable solutions to issues that impact all citizens equally."

Many vegans argue that it's so hypocritical that so many people say they love animals but continue to eat them that results in an industry that creates a horrible quality of life for livestock. Logically, I agree with them. I love my cat. I love my parents dog. But honestly I don't think it's fair for me to say I love animals in general when I can't give up meat to help contribute to a better quality of life for them. I've seen Dominion and a few other docs that show how awful the industry is... and while it upset me, I just couldn't give up meat. I have cut back on red meat and pork and try to only shop for poultry now for environmental reasons, and grown chickens and turkeys kind of disgust me so I feel zero guilt about eat them. 

I'd like this view changed because I do want to believe I'm an animal lover but I really can't reconcile that with the fact that I partake in the meat industry. "

I realise this has something to do with climate change, though i really don't understand enough of the consequences - sure the weather is more extreme and unpredictable, though this phenomenon im talking about is neither - it just moved seasons to later.

To cmv either explain to me why the phenomenon is temporary (and if we fix it, our seasons will align with the existing calendar), or show me a recent study on this topic that can disprove it.

1,2024-01-15,Cmv: i dont think that there is anything wrong with sex-based abortions,u/Designer_Comment_791,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/197hlr6/cmv_i_dont_think_that_there_is_anything_wrong/,changemyview,"So im pro-choice and for me personally, i think it’s fine if someone has an abortion because they dont want a child of that sex. 

Ive seen alot of people say that they are pro choice but against this (which is fine). 

The reason i think this is because say for example if someone really didn’t want a child of a certain sex (ie alot of non western countries dont want daughters/ prefer sons over daughters. And we’ve seen what happened in places like india and china) then their “options” are 
- abortion 
- killing the baby after it is born 
- adoption 
- leaving the baby on the streets or in a landfill (yes it happens) 
-  having the kid and abusing them/ neglecting them/ not treating them as well as any potential siblings of the opposite gender, etc
- and actually taking care of them properly with the love they deserve (which doesn’t seem likely to happen) 

And out of all these options, abortion just seems like the most “sane”/ “humane” thing to do especially for people who are so dead set on not wanting one gender. 



I feel bad for thinking this was and do want to change my view. 

And before anyone mentions it in the comments. Yes, ik that kids are not collectables and it shouldn’t matter the sec and if the parents care this much then they shouldn’t be having kids in the first place. I agree. But there’s no way to regulate that and once again, 3rd world countries."

TL:DR ~


“If god created the universe, then who created god? Why is it such a jump that the big bang happened and all this came from nothing, if you still can’t explain where god came from?

1,2024-01-15,CMV: Pornography should be illegal and warrant harsh prison sentences for everyone involved.,u/nighttimesmoker21,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/197j0vd/cmv_pornography_should_be_illegal_and_warrant/,changemyview,"Pornography and the pornographic industry as a whole is extremely damaging towards society, especially towards youth. I would like to show some of my points supporting this view.

1 - It creates wrong views about sexuality, especially violent views. It leads to more sexual assaults and rapes, and leads to more sexual violence as a whole. Porn users are usually more likely to commit violent crimes and sexual crimes, and even if they're not prone to violence, it can cause addiction and lead to an unproductive life. All in all, the consumption of pornography leads to violence and crime towards women and other groups.

2 - It damages the mind of children, while it targets most vulnerable people. A lot of children will be exposed to pornography, which will lead to traumas, leading them to become sex offenders or becoming more prone to being assaulted themselves. At the same time, the porn industry targets desperate women, who would never do porn if they had the financial means to live well. Most women in porn turn to substances to be able to function, leading to addiction and more crime in society.

3 - It also makes people less likely to marry and create families, which leads to a low birth rate, which leads to the generations aging too much. This effect is visible in many developed nations, like in Europe.

As punishment for violating these laws, I believe that all people involved in the production and distribution of porn, like directors and owners of porn companies should go to prison for the rest of their lives, in order to safeguard society from their evil product. It would serve as a deterrant.

As for performers, they should go to prison for many decades and be labeled sex offenders when they leave, so they cannot create content that could harm society or children, and it would make them think twice before creating porn. All adult consumers who possess porn should also undergo mandatory treatments of sex addiction, pay huge fines, do community service and be registered as sex offenders. We must punish consumers, so the demand for porn dries up and all the illegal activity.

In sum, I believe pornography damages society, so it should be illegal and carry harsh punishments for offenders."

For example during the 1920s ALL women were supposed to get the right to vote, but this isn’t true for all women. Women of color had to fight for dozens of years by themselves to get the same rights their white female counterparts had received decades ago. 

Now I understand this example was almost a century ago and you might think they might have changed and evolved to become a more equitable and inclusive movement, but they really haven’t.
The MeToo movement is a perfect example of this, the movement despite being founded by a black women still silences women of color’s voices and capitalizes / ignores their trauma. I have genuinely not seen one woman of color highlighted in the MeToo movement and it’s really sad.

The overturn of Roe v. Wade and the reaction from the feminist movement is also another example of the how hierarchical and stratified the movement is despite claiming to be about “equality”. Black women have this highest abortion rates in the US yet they have the littlest say when it comes to abortion rights.

The next example is not pertaining to women it’s about men and the treatment of them within the movement. Men are way to demonized and generalized by feminist. To many of y’all have adopted this kill all men/man eater persona and it’s really disturbing because when you behave like that and simultaneously call yourself a feminist you are conflating the 2 ideologies making the movement look bad and contributing to men’s adversity to the movement. My first introduction to the movement was when I was like 11 or 12, I went on twitter just hangout and was met with #KillAllMen which affected my perception of feminism. I understand misandry is entirely reactionary and it is not and will NEVER be as bad as misogyny but that does not make it ok. I see misandrist on the internet and I can’t help but feel bad for them because due to their past traumas they feel the need to act like this to cope.

The crux of my argument is despite the textbook definition of feminism being about equality, in practice it never really is both historically and in present times. So why do feminists claim equality and support a movement that as built as this pseudo trick down economy where all the rights and the resources go to the white women at the top while the rest of us at the bottom have to fight 10x harder? Which may I add is the same way the patriarchy they allegedly hate is structured? I believe you guys stand for equality, the problem is that equality does not extend to everyone."

    For starters, I myself study International Relations, I understand the need for a state, a military and why the social contract exists as man’s deal with the state to provide security in exchange for giving up certain things. I would consider my stances to align with left-liberal economics. I originally aligned myself as a social democrat viewing the trade off for higher taxations as valid because I am being given public institutions that are provided to me such as healthcare, education (even though that goes away the moment I leave college) and welfare. It sounds great in the beginning I am paying what I will be receiving later on, I viewed those who advocated for lowering taxes in general as not so empathetic seeing it as a way to not provide enough funds for welfare programs. 

   However as I’ve gotten a bit older and though I still am a student in college and don’t have any income, I do have money for myself. I realized that I didn’t want to pay for other’s people services through a portion of the money I had, just the money I had I knew part of this was going away for social services that I myself won’t use barring public roads and maintaining them. 

  I rarely get sick myself, sure I get an annual check up but it’s ineffective for me to have part of my money go to something I know isn’t being given to me. Yes I know countries with Universal Healthcare have private healthcare systems, yes I know that these countries have private everything in general, I am not some ignorant fear-mongering saying social programs= Stalinist Russia. But taxing people a lot of money for stuff that they won’t even receive back just because some people in society benefit isn’t exactly the utopia a lot of people envision. 

 I am not saying there shouldn’t be public institutions or welfare. I myself benefit from this - I went to a public K-12, I got free lunch, my mother was on SNAP until I was 14, my college is free mostly due to FAFSA etc. however I understand why people oppose such ideas of wealth redistribution if you’re working hard and being taxed 1/3rd of your income for social programs that won’t benefit you whatsoever, if you were ultra-wealthy I get the high taxation since you can enjoy the fruit of your labour and privileges of being wealthy, but their income isn’t even taxable since they get their money from stocks.
 
 Also why should part of my income be going to funding public schools that will have drug problems and aren’t generally doing good? I went to a public school, well it was a charter school but there were still problems with drug use and school fights.

 Also usually those countries that do have higher taxation tends to mean less social mobility because my income is taken away more. However this doesn’t mean that their economy is bad or that people aren’t getting the “middle class experience” just that in Europe there is less disposable income than in the United States."

Could I please have your help on 

* changing my brother's view that covid vaccine is unsafe. If you were to change my brother's view, I would be grateful if you could please provide explanation as to why these scientists/researchers/doctors are wrong - their coming from prestigious universities is a credibility that I can't refute; OR,
* changing my view (my view is that covid vaccine is safe) if it is now proven to be unsafe as per the link I provided below.

A bit of context: I coerced my brother who is immunocompromised to take the covid vaccine as I believed it was safe then and was the right choice in case we get covid; very unfortunately however, he had vaccine injury (myocarditis) and was bed-ridden for over a year. I am, of course, very guilty about this and did believe for a while that the covid vaccine was unsafe from the information that my bother shared with me.

The latest information my brother shared with me is from a Japanese press conference, claiming that the covid vaccine is very unsafe and causes thousands of side effects. The article provides a short 10 min highlight video and a full hour long video with English subtitles.

From the press conference, Professor Emeritus Masanori Fukushima of Kyoto University states that ""Thousands of papers have reported side effects after vaccination, affecting every possible aspect of human pathology – from ophthalmology to psychiatry"". He also says ""For example, the age-adjusted mortality rate for leukemia has increased. And there are significant findings for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and so on"".

[https://www.aussie17.com/p/japan-vaccine-study-groups-press](https://www.aussie17.com/p/japan-vaccine-study-groups-press)

>On January 11, 2024, in Japan, the Vaccine Issues Study Group convened a press conference to reveal the critical and worrisome findings of their initial six-month investigations into the side effects of vaccines. The results, as presented by a panel of esteemed medical experts, have been nothing short of alarming, drawing particular attention to a wide range of medical concerns, from cancer to neurological disorders.  
  
Professor Emeritus Masanori Fukushima of Kyoto University urgently addressed the diverse array of side effects uncovered by their study. “A systematic review of the literature has unveiled some shocking information,"" he stated, setting a grave tone from the outset. ""Thousands of papers have reported side effects after vaccination, affecting every possible aspect of human pathology – from ophthalmology to psychiatry."" Noting the broad scope of these findings, he highlighted that ""This kind of reporting on drug side effects or the like is unprecedented.""  
  
Providing more specifics, Professor Fukushima mentioned significant spikes in certain conditions following vaccination campaigns, ""For example, the age-adjusted mortality rate for leukemia has increased. And there are significant findings for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and so on,"" pointing to serious implications for critical illness due to vaccines, which is unlike anything previously documented.  
  
The press conference did not shy away from discussing the suppression of such information. ""Japanese doctors are trying hard, but they face various obstructions,"" Professor Fukushima remarked, shedding light on the undercurrents of medical censorship that have stonewalled professional discourse around the vaccination issues.  
  
On brain-related adverse events, the evidence was equally disturbing, with Professor Fukushima expressing, ""mental disorders, psychiatric symptoms, depression, mania, anxiety, came up in abundance, but it's endless."" He emphasized that the sheer volume and variety of neurological issues raised in response to the vaccines were unforeseeable, ""So this is just a part of it.""  
  
Speaking out about the implications of these findings, Professor Yasufumi Murakami from Tokyo University of Science did not mince words regarding the responsibility to halt the use of vaccines based on their adverse effects. ""It's very clear what happens when you administer a toxic gene to a human. There are cases that occur within one or two weeks after injection, but there are also many cases that appear after one or two years,"" he specified, indicating the long-term risks involved with vaccine-induced conditions.  
  
The novelty of the immune response to the vaccine was also a major point of discussion, with Professor Murakami highlighting that ""with the current messenger-type vaccines, a significant amount of IgG4 is being induced,"" which defies the expectations for a normal vaccine response and could interfere with immune functions.  
  
Professor Masayasu Inoue, Emeritus Professor at Osaka City University School of Medicine, reaffirmed the gravity and the unforeseen nature of these issues. ""It is unprecedented in human history for a single vaccine to have this much literature out on it,"" he said. Such a statement draws attention to the historically unparalleled level of concern and scrutiny the vaccines have attracted.  
  
Wrapping up the discourse with a sobering critique, Professor Masanori Fukushima emphasized the indiscriminate dissemination of mRNA vaccines throughout the body. “It doesn’t know where to go. If it goes into the bloodstream, it goes to the brain, liver, and kidneys,"" he explained, painting a picture of potential systemic vulnerability widely overlooked by the public and professionals alike.  
  
Fukushima then addressed the superficial level of understanding that has been guiding the current vaccine narrative. “With fragments of such knowledge, they exaggerate things and think they can go with this,"" he remarked, hinting at a misplaced confidence among authorities who promote the vaccines as safe and effective based on an incomplete grasp of the facts.  
  
Calling for a foundational review of biological understanding, he stated, “So, honestly, they need to go back and redo from middle school biology to high school and university entrance exams."" This stark advice implied that those at the helm of decision-making lacked the necessary biological insight to comprehend the full spectrum of vaccine implications.  
  
He succinctly summed up the situation by acknowledging the nascent state of modern medicine, ""As I mentioned earlier, medicine is still immature."" This final note served as a cautionary reminder that the medical field must adopt a more circumspect and knowledge-driven approach in its dealings with new and emerging medical technologies like mRNA.

When that’s said, I really want someone to change my perspective of them. I feel bad for finding them super unattractive and I downgrades a person looks solely based on for example a visible mark on their face."

>On January 11, 2024, in Japan, the Vaccine Issues Study Group convened a press conference to reveal the critical and worrisome findings of their initial six-month investigations into the side effects of vaccines. The results, as presented by a panel of esteemed medical experts, have been nothing short of alarming, drawing particular attention to a wide range of medical concerns, from cancer to neurological disorders.  
  
Professor Emeritus Masanori Fukushima of Kyoto University urgently addressed the diverse array of side effects uncovered by their study. “A systematic review of the literature has unveiled some shocking information,"" he stated, setting a grave tone from the outset. ""Thousands of papers have reported side effects after vaccination, affecting every possible aspect of human pathology – from ophthalmology to psychiatry."" Noting the broad scope of these findings, he highlighted that ""This kind of reporting on drug side effects or the like is unprecedented.""  
  
Providing more specifics, Professor Fukushima mentioned significant spikes in certain conditions following vaccination campaigns, ""For example, the age-adjusted mortality rate for leukemia has increased. And there are significant findings for breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and so on,"" pointing to serious implications for critical illness due to vaccines, which is unlike anything previously documented.  
  
The press conference did not shy away from discussing the suppression of such information. ""Japanese doctors are trying hard, but they face various obstructions,"" Professor Fukushima remarked, shedding light on the undercurrents of medical censorship that have stonewalled professional discourse around the vaccination issues.  
  
On brain-related adverse events, the evidence was equally disturbing, with Professor Fukushima expressing, ""mental disorders, psychiatric symptoms, depression, mania, anxiety, came up in abundance, but it's endless."" He emphasized that the sheer volume and variety of neurological issues raised in response to the vaccines were unforeseeable, ""So this is just a part of it.""  
  
Speaking out about the implications of these findings, Professor Yasufumi Murakami from Tokyo University of Science did not mince words regarding the responsibility to halt the use of vaccines based on their adverse effects. ""It's very clear what happens when you administer a toxic gene to a human. There are cases that occur within one or two weeks after injection, but there are also many cases that appear after one or two years,"" he specified, indicating the long-term risks involved with vaccine-induced conditions.  
  
The novelty of the immune response to the vaccine was also a major point of discussion, with Professor Murakami highlighting that ""with the current messenger-type vaccines, a significant amount of IgG4 is being induced,"" which defies the expectations for a normal vaccine response and could interfere with immune functions.  
  
Professor Masayasu Inoue, Emeritus Professor at Osaka City University School of Medicine, reaffirmed the gravity and the unforeseen nature of these issues. ""It is unprecedented in human history for a single vaccine to have this much literature out on it,"" he said. Such a statement draws attention to the historically unparalleled level of concern and scrutiny the vaccines have attracted.  
  
Wrapping up the discourse with a sobering critique, Professor Masanori Fukushima emphasized the indiscriminate dissemination of mRNA vaccines throughout the body. “It doesn’t know where to go. If it goes into the bloodstream, it goes to the brain, liver, and kidneys,"" he explained, painting a picture of potential systemic vulnerability widely overlooked by the public and professionals alike.  
  
Fukushima then addressed the superficial level of understanding that has been guiding the current vaccine narrative. “With fragments of such knowledge, they exaggerate things and think they can go with this,"" he remarked, hinting at a misplaced confidence among authorities who promote the vaccines as safe and effective based on an incomplete grasp of the facts.  
  
Calling for a foundational review of biological understanding, he stated, “So, honestly, they need to go back and redo from middle school biology to high school and university entrance exams."" This stark advice implied that those at the helm of decision-making lacked the necessary biological insight to comprehend the full spectrum of vaccine implications.  
  
He succinctly summed up the situation by acknowledging the nascent state of modern medicine, ""As I mentioned earlier, medicine is still immature."" This final note served as a cautionary reminder that the medical field must adopt a more circumspect and knowledge-driven approach in its dealings with new and emerging medical technologies like mRNA.

107,2024-01-15,CMV: Most arguments against Batman are stupid,u/DarkMayhem666,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/197rnne/cmv_most_arguments_against_batman_are_stupid/,changemyview,"I feel like most arguments against Batman are stupid. For example, ""he's a white billionaire that beats up poor people."" Okay, for one, Batman beats up other white billionaires too, Penguin, and the other crime bosses that he goes against are white billionaires, and they actively poison Gotham and do more damage to the poor in Gotham with their criminal organizations, and the street thugs Batman beats up are actively trying to hurt and kill other people; it's kind of his job to stop them. Bruce Wayne actually does help Gotham with his wealth; that's what all his non-profit organizations are for, and he treats and pays all his employees very nicely. That's why I kind of cringed at the line in The Flash (2022) movie when Batman had the lasso of truth. I get that it was supposed to be a joke, but it didn't make sense to me because Bruce Wayne does a bunch of stuff for Gotham with his wealth, but let's be honest, no one wants to see a Batman story where the entire story is Bruce Wayne at non-profits and doing stuff with his wealth to help Gotham. A lot of people want to see Batman in the Batmobile fighting crime, and I don't know why this argument gets used against Batman and not any other billionaire superhero. 

I also don't think it makes sense for Thomas Wayne to be corrupt. The Wayne family comes from old money. Thomas inherits his wealth, so for him to be a crime boss makes no sense. I could understand if he wasn't a billionaire and went through exploitative, corrupt means to get his billions, but he didn't. Thomas Wayne wasn't the CEO of Wayne Enterprise; he was the owner and maybe a CEO in a figurehead type of way, but he was a surgeon first and foremost, so it doesn't make sense for him to be corrupt. I have also heard the argument that Batman glorifies billionaires and that we shouldn't like Batman because he glorifies rich people. This doesn't make any sense to me at all. Like I said, why does this only apply to Batman and no other billionaire hero? Also, Bruce Wayne didn't do anything; he was born into a rich family and inherited their wealth. That is, he didn't do anything wrong. And if Batman wasn't a billionaire, then his story wouldn't make sense. People would ask, ""How does a regular person leave town at 17, train for a bunch of years, come back, and be able to afford all these suits, gadgets, and cars?"" 

  
I'm pretty sure Bruce donates his wealth a lot more than any other rich superhero like Iron Man, Green Arrow, et cetera. Another argument that doesn't make sense to me is ""He recruits children!"" Every single superhero has recruited a child. Bucky was a literal child in the comics, and Captain America brought him along to fight Nazis in World War II. Every member of the Justice League has a kid sidekick, and before you say, ""Well, they have powers,"" it doesn't matter if a child is put in active danger; it doesn't matter if they have powers or not. The last time I checked, the Teen Titans were kids fighting grown adult villains, and the Titans can still die. I don't know why these arguments get used against Batman, and no one else. I feel like these arguments are stupid, and the people who use them don't know anything about Batman. I feel like these people have seen clips of Batman from movies and TV shows and think they know everything about characters, and I really don't understand why these arguments only get used against Batman and not any other rich superhero.

Most people on the fringes of society aren’t the pigeon lady from home alone 2, secret normal person that just happens to look like they smell like cat piss, they’re mentally ill, they ramble incessantly or incoherently, and are usually crawling with some sort of parasite(s). 

Most of them don’t want to listen to you, they don’t want to quit drugs, they don’t want go to a shelter where they get piss tested and have curfews. So much is contingent upon the willpower of person you’re trying to help. You can give them all the help you can but unless *they* truly want to get clean/get off the street there’s nothing you can do. 

And that gets frustrating and ultimately leads to burnout. 

Care for the mentally ill and elderly is equally tough because no matter what way you slice it wiping the hairy, puckered asshole of 85 year old combative dementia patient is never going to be fun. Its not work that you need a degree for but it needs doing no matter what. And no boy/girl dreams of growing up and doing that for a living. Take it from me, my sister has done it for 10 years at a nursing home and it sucks no matter what. 

Some people say it’s a shame we put our elderly into places like that but my aunt once had to help with her dad’s (my grandfather) catheter by adjusting it for him and she told my mom she was deeply disturbed and felt a profound sense of violation at doing it. 

And I can relate to do that. We foist these jobs on other people because they’re unrewarding and mentally draining. I know people will say it’s matter of compensation but look at countries trying to raise their fertility rates. We have examples of numerous governments passing incentives to try and get young couples to have children. This is one of most quintessentially human things to do, with a partner you love and even with cash benefits being dangled in front of peoples faces you can’t get them to reproduce. 

I don’t see why throwing more cash at something like counseling will make it any less appealing."

No supplements needed, no averse health effects- on the contrary!  I was surprised to find that as soon as I went vegan 7 years ago, I would never get sick again!  While everyone around me gets sick a lot- headaches, stomach issues, colds, flu, you name it.  I mean, I knew as well as anyone else that greens, beans, veggies, fruits nuts and grains are healthier than meat, eggs and cheese, but I honestly did not know to what EXTENT it would affect (effect?) my body.  It is so crazy.  I hardly tell anyone this, but me and my sister need like 4-5 hours of sleep as vegans.  I feel they will feel I am lying just to sell them something.  I honestly have no idea.  It's like some kind of crazy genetic class buff or something.

I’m struggling with a terrible birth experience in Japan. There were a lot of factors at play but mainly, there has to be measurable decreased vitals to baby or mom to necessitate a c-section and I had a terrible midwife. I was asked to push for 8 hours then left with the baby stuck in the birth canal. I was requesting a surgery they could not would not give me. 

Culturally it can be normal to leave a mother to labor for an extensive amount of time and avoid surgery. No access to epidural. I was at a small clinic. But Japanese friends have stated my midwife’s choices were not normal. Anyway. 

Since then, I’ve returned to my home country but I’ve found it really difficult to listen to Japanese and watch foreign films or anime as I’ve always liked. I can’t look at photos of our time there. My husband wants to eat recipes Ive learned from living there but I can’t stomach it. And honestly I’ve been dealing with a lot of feelings. I’ve been avoiding friends I made and it makes me sad. 

I loved the experience of living there and miss it daily but at the same time I bitterly resent the way I was treated during those 3 days and the care afterward.

A slice of pizza checks all the boxes for a reasonable side: not too filling, cheap, delicious before/between bites/after a main course, easy to prepare, can easily be portable if need be and it’s mainly carbohydrates.

1,2024-01-16,CMV: the secret of attracting women,u/ovinam,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/197y3tw/cmv_the_secret_of_attracting_women/,changemyview,"Early on in college I got a very hard life lesson, that came with a lot of character development upsides: getting cheated on. 
Because of this I took years to be alone and learn.
 I know this works bc after moving to a big city, I had 3 (organically met) girls advance within the FIRST month of moving there with no friends. I can’t speak for all looks and personalities tho. 

There’s a common phenomenon where girls start to like you bc you already have a gf. IMO this is bc of the aura you exude. Not bc you’re uninterested per se, but since you have someone already, you are emotionally unavailable and thus unattainable. Welcome the attraction. 
I inadvertently achieved the same thing by being emotionally unavailable as a result of being cheated on. 

Of course there is way more to it, but I’d say these are the biggest things. Some of this is mixed w how you should go about things when initially meeting, and also when you’ve known each other for some time. Plausible deniability is key, and a good way to do this is for the end goal to be friendship, not sex. 

Step 1: don’t be a simp 

Simp can mean many things, for me it’s small things such as if she’s saying her fav cereal is x brand, yours is somehow all of a sudden the same brand.
Believe it or not, women love banter. You could never do that if you agree w everything she says. 
You can also simp with body language. Take the guy groveled at her feet for example. Girls like nice cordial guys, but not nice guys. 

Step 2: shut up and listen 

It’s cool to talk about yourself when asked, or mention relatable things after she’s FINISHED talking, but dude, stop trying to brag about yourself and for the love of god let her finish her sentence before even a single word is muttered from you. 
Interrupting people in general is a good way to grow disdain. Also don’t try to fix her problems for her, usually she wants someone to hear her straighten her thoughts out or to be a “girls girl”

Step 2.2: communication 

when you are listening COMMUNICATE WITH BODY LANGUAGE. 
Firstly, this is a good way to filter yourself out of the competition. If she’s looking at you, meh could be anything.  if you start to notice she’s looking at you a lot, hold eye contact with her. It will feel very uncomfortable at first, but at the very least 3 seconds. Ive had many tell me that this invoked some sort of questioning, and it’s a good way to differentiate yourself since the average male cannot hold eye contact with pretty women. 
Multiple times of the long eye contact, then it’s safer to assume she’s interested. 
There is a book called how to communicate effectively (?) that goes more in depth about eye contact with poi. 
If you are directly talking to her, especially one on one, the number one way to exude confidence (even if your body’s posture says otherwise) is through keeping strong eye contact. 

When you do talk, your number one priority is to get her to talk more and for you to listen more. 
Do this initially by asking a thought provoking question (stay away from yes or no questions, but depending on how talkative the person is, yes or no will be just fine as long as it’s not basic small talk) 
When she asks you questions, this is the time to show your personality. Never talk down on people (def not your ex), and don’t shit talk unless you want to be the girls girl gossip buddy.  Also don’t be the first to bring up an ex. 
For me , being funny works. IMO I’m funny bc I’m brutally honest and stand on business. Most the laughs come from the banter. If you are concrete with your opinions and don’t simp, good banter will come. 

Face your body language toward her direction 

Step 3: subconsciously show interest by mirroring

Imagine you’re grumpy , I’m sure you’d rather talk to someone chill and not someone super loud, energetic, and up in your face. 
IMO the vibe you exude is the vibe you prefer to be with. Use that to your advantage. If she’s happy go lucky, I hope you are too. 


Step 4: play the long game with no one in particular 

If you’re here reading this, chances are you won’t have this work overnight. This was how to get different women to be attracted to you, but it may not be your crush. You’ll just have to be okay with that.


Recent anecdotal proof:
The other day my friends left my number for our server. 3 days later we’re on an 11 hour date, and she kept saying “wait what date is this, I feel like I’ve known you for a long time”, and I also had to keep asking her to not try to make out with me in public.

I should also mention I have been on multiple first dates that lasted more than 10+ hours , which to me seems very not normal 

Yes I am single, but that’s because my dream girl is overseas (she was a 12+ hour date)

A civilised person does not verbalise this stereotype or mock the person about it, but having preconceived INITIAL ideas is perfectly healthy and natural.

Think about it. You’re an animal, an ape. Back in caveman days, your goal was to avoid danger. If your cave tribe meets a tiger three times and each time the tiger behaves aggressively and kills a tribe member, you form a stereotype about tigers (the animal that looks like that, is dangerous, and will kill my cave people or given the opportunity) 

Therefore in future you will avoid animals that look like the tiger. This is a healthy stereotype to have, it’s literally saving your life. 

In civilised society, we judge people on their character, NOT their initial presentation, HOWEVER, I firmly believe those initial stereotypes are a safety instinct we evolved as apes in the wild, and see nothing wrong with them *as an initial response*

I am almost totally an atheist now, I just cannot come to terms with the fact that God might exist afterall, even though I often want to.  There is a lingering sense of meaninglessness and nihilism everyday, staring up at the cosmos and thinking that it's all random and realising that there may be no higher power behind it all, that there's no benevolent being standing by me in times of distress, is deeply harrowing and lonely. The fact that I'm left in the midst of this absurd and uncertain existence to deal with my suffering myself, and there's no one to help alleviate it, feels painful and very hopeless, to say the least.

Looking at LOOKS first:

1. What is the purpose of sexual attraction? To mate with someone and spread your genes 

2. What do looks have to do with this process? Let’s say a human is deformed, big nose, small jaw, weird looking eyes, small chin, hunched spine etc etc or whatever, ie *how someone looks* immediately tells you if something is physically wrong with them. If you have GOOD genes, the idea is when your body develops, it will develop correctly, and no deformities etc will occur. Since the deformities ARE there, one can deduce the genes were sub-optimal. 

3. From 2., we can conclude that visually inspecting someone’s looks is a very fast way to *roughly* determine the health of their genes, and  so, the health of your babies genes if you mate with them. 


Looking at PERSONALITY next: 

1. What is the purpose of platonic (non sexual) attraction? To bond socially with family members and fellow humans in your community, as per our nature as social primates, our health and wellbeing depends on behavioural mechanisms that encourage bonding with others and forming cooperative relationships with them 

2. What does personality have to do with platonic attraction? A compatible personality will be exciting and enjoyable for someone to experience, they will be excited to be your pal, and form a friendship, see 1. 

3. From 2. We can conclude platonic attraction serves a very valuable role in the formation of cooperative human groups and societies and family units. 




WHY DO SEXUAL AND PLATONIC ATTRACTION NEED TO BE SEPARATED? 
This is just my opinion, but I think it’s unhealthy to mix the two.

Open to expanding my view and learning new perspectives about this."
26,2024-01-16,cmv:Biryanj should be the national dish of India.,u/AdTrick7283,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198217x/cmvbiryanj_should_be_the_national_dish_of_india/,changemyview,"In my opinion, biryani should be the national dish of India.

My 1st reason is that it is universally loved by all Indians, and no state can really 'possess' it like how Odisha 'possesses' rasugulla and West Bengal 'possesses' fuchka. This means that every single state of India has their own variety of biryani. Therefore, almost every Indian has the opportunity to try biryani, since it is therefore, widespread everywhere as well. This means that there won't be jealousy from any other state similar how Odisha and West Bengal fight over roshgollas and rasugullas and manner of debate over the origins of pani puri, fushka, and golgappa are from. Moreso, biryani has many different varieties, designed for a plethora of different Indians who are used to the taste to different dishes.

My 2nd reason is that biryani has so many different varieties and flavours! You may say that most of them are similar in taste, but let me prove you wrong via a simple comparision of the Bengali biryani and the Hyderabadi biryani. The Bengali biriyani has potatos and eggs in them, along with a few herbs and nuts, which gives it a rather sweet and refreshing taste! However, the southern-born Hyderabadi biryani has an abundance of spices in them, which results in it having, you guessed it, a rather spicy and umami taste! No 2 dishes can be more different than one being sweet and refreshing, and the other being spicy and umami! However, both of them are a type of biryani. The only difference is that the former originated in West Bengal and the latter in Telengana. This shows the vast plethora of tastes that will be respected if biryani becomes the national dish of India!

My 3rd reason is that biryani is a balanced diet in itself. A balanced diet comprises of 6 main components; with only 5 being found in solid food, which biryani is; proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, minerals and water. The 1st component, protein, is found in biryani via basmati rice. The 2nd component, carbohydrates, is found in biryani via potatoes, herbs, etc. The 3rd compinent, lipids, can be found in biryani via fish, chicken, mutton, etc. The 4th component, vitamins, are found in biryani via carrots, herbs, etc. The 5th component, minerals can be found in biryani via eggs.

These reasons are the reasons why I believe biryani should be India's national dish."

This is the case no matter how good looking he is. 

Not having sex in person as much makes sense as there is more risks for women as well as an orgasm gap. But gay couples have far more sex than lesbian couples, and way more porn is being consumed by men. Even make strip clubs are for gay men, with women only going there to have a laugh.

One could argue that most porn is catered to men, but what kind of porn would be catered to women? It won't be physically attractive men alone whereas for men a mere picture is enough for him to potentially pay for it.

Even on NSFW subreddits pretty much every girl there is only using it as a form of OF promo. In comment sections about this topic, I've seen women say ""most men don't do it for me"" or even downright say they're straight but prefer the way women look. No straight man would ever say that the other way around.

Dating apps also back this up, the ratio on there is like 80/20 and the women on there are incredibly picky, I could match with a gay man easier than a woman and there are a lot more women out there in the world.

There is a personal experience element here too, I've worked on myself tremendously over the last 2 years and I can only ever attract gay men (I don't look gay either, I'm traditionally masculine if you know what I mean). It's really disheartening and makes me feel worthless and unwanted. Makes me wish I was either a woman or gay. Sure, I'd love to be appreciated for who I am, but I want to be appreciated physically too. It hurts. So please, change my view, hit me with some cold hard facts. Thank you."

If I had a partner who had sex with a new partner protected once a month from 18 to 25 that would be 84 partners. Is that high? Yes. Would I care? No. Why would I? As long as she is sexually satisfied by me there’s no issue. Every arguement revolves around “it makes me feel uncomfortable”. That’s a you problem.

Tournament of Americas
Barcelona '92

It becomes obviously clear that the other competition is so poor, it makes some some games look sludgey. For whatever reason, international basketball didn't make player height a high priority. There is a visual absurdity watching a 6'1 player go up against David Robinson.

From all testimonies, the Dream Team had its most intense practices against college teams and each other. By the time to tournament started, all that stops. I don't believe they ever seriously practiced ever again. Reports being that Michael Jordan played golf every single day up until game time.

Watching the games, a lot of the players break traditional NBA form and just start throwing the ball around the court like a football.

Again, watching the games... the absurdity being they blew teams out 40-70 points, but if they actually took the games serious, they *could* have been 100 points differences.

A few exceptions.

Charles Barkley played 100%
Christan Laettner (with limited time) seemed very focused.
Jordan and Pippen had the Kukoc game where they busted his ass.

Employees who are held to arbitrary standards often feel the need to manipulate or cut corners to hit the benchmark…or risk their financial security.   
     
That is a terrible principle to introduce into the domain of prosecutions. 
  
Prosecutorial KPIs can lead to perverse incentives and unintended consequences for prosecutors who are pressured to manipulate or distort their decisions and actions to meet arbitrary targets. They undermine the professional judgment and discretion of prosecutors, who have to balance multiple factors and interests in each case.   
  
This isn’t to say prosecutors should be free from criticism but I’m incredibly skeptical of how the data can be used across the table by:  
- the state when determining budgets     
- politicians who can cherry pick from the data to convey a (false) narrative   
- the media who can also cherry pick data to present a manufactured narrative  
- advocacy groups who can distort the data as a fundraising tool  
  
Prosecutor jobs aren’t being filled.   
  
The lack of a strong budget already leads to poor outcomes for alleged criminals and victims.      
  
An additional headache of the job isn’t going to get new grads in the pipeline to fill prosecutor roles when private practice is already significantly more financially rewarding"

People will list many salient issues of today (many of which predate capitalism), link it to capitalism (which, given the pervasiveness of an economic system in any society, is very easy to do with any topic), and then conclude saying that a socialist system wouldn't do this. And I always feel that its glossed over that socialist states didn't solve many of these problems. Too little time goes to discussing what went wrong for the socialist states within their own boundaries. 

The arguments I've heard stem from the idea that these states failed because of isolation and sabotage by capitalist states, which isn't wrong, but downplays any notion that the systems themselves were flawed. I'd argue just as importantly, it ignores the fact that it implies the only way to get a ""real"" stable socialist system would be to have >20 simultaneous successful revolutions/radical reform movements without any of them failing to: overthrow capitalism; create a stable state; not fall to corruption, and have them all agree with each other enough to form a trade bloc that can actually withstand isolation. Those arguments imply to me that even the first step of a successful socialist world is so blindingly optimistic that I have to wonder whether I've missed something. 

If I assume that I haven't missed something, then the only thing I can conclude is that socialism's allure only comes from correctly identifying issues in our world, pointing out that capitalism can't answer them, then substituting in socialism without explaining why we should believe socialism would actually do it better, similar to how some people will point out elements of our reality that science can't explain and substitute in their religion without actually explaining how that evidence directly points to said religion.

1,2024-01-16,CMV: Regular sponges are not sanitary for cleaning dishes,u/sscruuples,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198751v/cmv_regular_sponges_are_not_sanitary_for_cleaning/,changemyview,"I'll start by saying I don't own a dishwasher. All dishes have to be hand-washed. My roommate accumulates a lot of dishes daily. She uses multiple mugs a day and cooks at least one meal at home daily so there are dishes in the sink and often a full sink of only her dishes every day. She does not like silicone sponges and only uses regular sponges. She says she ""doesn't know how to use"" a silicone sponge to wash them properly (like what?).

She'll fill each dish with water so they're sitting in pooled water, food scraps, and just nastiness. Then she uses hot water and a regular sponge to wash them and sets them on the rack to dry. I've read many studies that hot water is also less sanitary so this grosses me out.

I'm admittedly a bit of a germ-a-phobe. I rewash every dish before use bc of her nasty dishwashing practices and I'm tired of it. Other roommate and I use only an antibacterial-handled scrub brush and I bought silicone sponges for messy roommmate to use on her dishes.

We've had countless conversations with her about the dishes and she goes through phases where the situation is a tiny bit better, but she refuses to wash with anything other than a regular sponge, and they always sit for at least 8 hours in water (morning during the work day and often overnight).

I dump the dirty water and add a bit of soap and fresh water to her dishes daily when they're just sitting in the sink bc it's less nasty than sitting in dirty ass water. At least it's soapy.

I've lived with both these roommates for 3 years and track record shows I need to just deal or move out (I love the other roommate and the apartment sm so not going to happen) or convince other roomie for us to kick messy out and get a different third. Constant conversations and ""reminders"" lead to no changes. She was an only child growing up and has ADHD so that could be the deal but we sort of think she may be high-functioning on the spectrum bc she has a lot of ""quirks"" that are really difficult to deal with and talking with her about it leads to no change.

The regular sponges are the biggest hang-up for me. They're so nasty. We occasionally throw them out so that she has to purchase a new one when it goes too long (she's never sanitized them). It's affecting my mental health bc I find myself annoyed a lot. And having to wash a dish every time before use and every time after use is a waste of water, soap, and my time. Tired of it.

Regular *non-silicone* sponges are unsanitary and it grosses me tf out. CMV."

Men are held to higher beauty standards than women because most women don't think men are attractive while men tend to be more forgiving critics of women. 

You also have to consider what makes a man and what makes a woman attractive. If you're a woman you essentially can be attractive in one or two ways. Either you're skinny and have long hair or you are thick, have wide hips and large brea\*ts. These things can be actually improved by having a higher body fat percentage even. Sure, you can be a fit woman but you don't have to be to be considered conventionally attractive to most men, in fact a lot of men don't even like fit women at all.

If you're a man? There's only one way to be considered physically attractive to women, be muscular and have a six pack. That is really the only way to get dates and matches. Now, this is achievable and possible of course. However, it takes months and sometimes up to a year of consistent weight training, calisthenics and dieting to get to that level. It is not as simple as being skinny, wearing nice outfits and having nice hair. Or being thick and having a curvy shape. BOTH of which can be achieved without spending a day in the gym. To be fit and muscular, you HAVE to workout and eat clean, that takes mental and physical strength. Most people underestimate how much work that takes. This is why I believe it takes more work for a man to be considered physically attractive than it does a woman. "
1,2024-01-16,CMV: Committing a crime against a vulnerable victim is not inherently worse.,u/acvdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198832m/cmv_committing_a_crime_against_a_vulnerable/,changemyview,"I feel like instinctually it feels worse when a crime is committed against a vulnerable person like a child, disabled or elderly person, but I can't square that logically in a way that I can articulate. That is, I'm having a hard time coming up with a logical reason explaining why we all tend to have a visceral reaction that makes crimes against the extremely vulnerable feel worse.

I can think of a few reasons why we could say this, but I feel like they all fail when examined critically:

1. Vulnerable people have higher worth/rights. I don't feel like this makes sense. Liberal tradition holds that all people have equal rights. While certain crimes, such as the murder of a child could be argued to be worse because of the amount of expected years remaining, nobody ever says ""well that old guy getting murdered isn't a big deal because he probably would've croaked on his own in a couple years anyway.""
2. It is easier to commit the crime. Difficulty of committing a crime is not really a pretext for how bad a crime is. In general, the criminal justice system tends to actually punish people worse for more difficult to commit crimes. If you steal an unattended phone of a table in a restaurant, you'll probably get a lighter sentence than if you managed to wrestle it out of the hands of a Navy SEAL. Crime isn't an RPG where you get more XP for committing more difficult crimes with the same net result. In general, my observation is that society tends to look down on crimes of opportunity (i.e. low difficulty crimes) less than those that are plotted and overcome obstacles, until you reach some arbitrary point of vulnerability, and then we get the visceral heinous crime reaction, which I don't think makes sense.
3. The victim is defenseless. Almost all experts, police, etc. will advise you that resisting a crime is usually unwise if compliance/retreat is possible and you have a reasonable suspicion that you will survive. If we believed this, we would logically treat all crime like a spectrum based on the ""difficulty level"" of the victim, which we don't. People don't say, ""that guy successfully mugged a concealed-carrying, heavyweight MMA fighter, so fair play to him."" We generally don't consider a crime against, e.g. an overweight 55 year old man any worse than one against a healthy 25 year old man, but we would consider a crime against someone in a wheelchair to be in the heinous crime against vulnerable victim category, but it's really like comparing an NFL team to a D3 college team vs. a high school team - neither one has a fighting chance. Realistically, most people, even if not vulnerable enough for the crime to cause a visceral reaction due to their vulnerability, don't really have a decent chance of physically resisting a crime by a healthy young man, and shouldn't be expected to do so. 1. Similarly to #2, overcoming difficulty to successfully commit a crime doesn't change the impact of the crime on the victim. Yet, when a certain level of vulnerability is reached, it somehow feels worse for a way that I can't articulate, and I'm not sure that makes logical sense. 
4. A vulnerable victim would experience greater trauma or impact from the crime. This one makes sense in certain circumstances, but I don't think it applies across the board. Sure, robbing an elderly pensioner *could* cause significantly greater hardship than a person in the prime of their career, but that's not always the case. The impact of the crime is far more complex than some kind of relationship to the victim's vulnerability.

So to CMV, you'll need to articulate a logical reason why we get this feeling that crime against vulnerable people is worse, explain why my logic above is wrong, or list another reason that I overlooked.

Note: There are clearly some crimes, such as statutory rape, that can by definition only be committed against a vulnerable victim, so citing those is not going to CMV, as I'm only talking about equivalent acts that we see as worse because of who the victim is."

Listening to the ICJ presentation by South Africa is absolutely harrowing. No one with a conscience can possibly defend or wave away the atrocities that are happening in Gaza. 

The case is incredibly strong but for one crucial element: intent. South Africa presented a mountain of compelling evidence about the genocidal language and attitudes permeating Israeli society, media, government and military, but intent in genocide is an incredibly high bar that I don’t believe has yet been demonstrated, despite the widespread attitudes that very clearly exist to that end in Israel. 

For me, it comes down to intent in command decisions. There is strong inference that soldiers on the ground are taking words of government leaders (Bibi: Amalek, Bougie: no innocent civilians, and others), but the preponderance of evidence still points to this war being a stew of crimes against humanity and war crimes, with *the aim* of eradicating Hamas while *not caring at all* how many innocent Palestinians die. 

We still don’t have enough information to conclude that this war is being prosecuted with the intent to *destroy* the people of Gaza for its own sake. (Though I believe we do have enough evidence, in the form of reporting on private conversations in government about reducing the number of Palestinians in Gaza through exodus after the war, of ethnic cleansing)

The conditions that have (deliberately) been created in Gaza are genocidal, and Israel’s actions amount to genocide in all but name, but that name is important. I think as more information emerges in the months/years to come, we may well see evidence of acts of genocide on the ground by the IDF (judging by near non-existent rules of engagement as highlighted by the murder of unarmed hostages waving a white flag), but at this point I don’t think we’ve seen that evidence yet."

I am mostly talking about front page subs IE r/Europe, r/worldnews etc. It really is mostly site-wide, but smaller subs are not as regulated so that's fair enough. I'm not going to post any links, because literally every post concerning Russia is like this.

For starters - I am ethnically Russian, meaning that it's my native language, I have strong ties to the culture, and I would identify as one, if I had to choose a single nationality. 

I was born in grew up in the Baltics, and only visited Russia a couple of times for work.

I do not condone the horrific war Russia wages in any way, and wish Ukraine the best of luck and hope for the West's continued support. My heart goes out to Ukraine's needless suffering and to it's stalwart defenders.


However, the things that people are allowed to say without getting banned (ie it's condoned) about Russia and Russians on this website are insane, often straight up genocidal, saying things like All Russians are x, Russians and their country need to be completely destroyed and any russian people driven out of ""civilized"" countries. Etc. etc.


I have not seen such amounts of directed hate towards a national/ethnic group being allowed. Anything similar said about Jewish/Black/LGBT/any other people has always resulted in a warning/ban/deletion.

I have seen people such as I say things like ""Hey, maybe we shouldn't go to pride marches with strap-ons and with our genitalia exposed, it makes us look bad."" Only to be immediately met with a barrage of ""You are a fake queer and a pick-me, you don't belong here."" 

As much as I wanted to believe this to be an isolated incident, but again and again I saw more and more instances of people getting lambasted and shunned because their views were critical to the most mild degree. 

And it is infuriating to me because a community that should be banding together in the face of legal discrimination is instead buying into the exact narratives they are trying to fight and fighting anyone who tries to remain level-headed and disagree. 

Does anyone feel that I see this wrongfully, with good reason? I don't want to be xenophobic. "

1,2024-01-16,CMV: Israel is a colonial power,u/mdosai_33,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198albm/cmv_israel_is_a_colonial_power/,changemyview,"A colony traditionally means that a foreign body encroaches on another people's land in pursuit of domination either by controlling (exploitation colonization) or replacing (settler colonization) the indigenous inhabitants.   


When Theodor Herzl started the call for the modern zionist movement in 1896 to establish a national homeland for the jews in Palestine, jews at that time constituted a very small minority in Palestine. Jewish immigration started to increase after the movement and their number was estimated at 56,000 in 1918. The immigration specifically skyrocketed after Balfour declaration in 1917 that by 1939, the Jewish population had increased to 445,000. [Source](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-206581/)  


So, it is an obvious case of settler colonization that can't be refuted but some people may argue that if the settler is the true indigenous population then it is not colonization. This can be refuted by:  


1) Even if modern-day palestenians started to settle in the region after the jews that doesn't mean that they aren't indigenous; I don't know what makes you indigenous more than living continuously in the same area for about 2000 years. By that same logic, modern-day americans have no place in America because they are the descendants of europeans who invaded the region 300 years ago when the land belonged to the indigenous amirican population.  


2) The plot twist, but an obvious thing, is that genetically palestinians are direct descendants of the ancient Israelites; they are jews who converted to christianity and then converted to islam. They are more ethnically israelites than most large jewish groups especailly askenazi jews whose europian ancestory is more than 50% while palestinian muslims have arab ancestory of only 20 to 30%. It is more striking when in comparison, palestinian muslims are more genetically close to askinazi jews than Saudi arabs, but yemenite jews are more arab than palestinian muslims. [Source](https://x.com/MiroCyo/status/1712258026881921287?s=20): ""mega analysis of several research papers of dna material of several sources  compiled into an open source database summarized in this thread"".  


In light of these facts and logical assumptions, there is no way to state that the jews have a distinctive or better claim to the land of palestine more than palestinians EXCEPT if:   
  
1) You strongly sympathize with the jews because of the holaucost in europe and their long prosecution there; which is very good and healthy thing to do but what have this to do with the palestinians? They werent the ones to persecute them in europe, so they dont have to attone for the mistakes and atrocities of europeans with their land and lives. If someone owes to compensate them then they should be europeans specifically germans. Why didn't they give them a piece of their land to build a Jewish-majority state?  
  
2) You dont view palestinians as equal humans and thus you think it is okay to take away their rights to solve the jewish problem of europe without europeans being affected that much; a “small” price to pay for salvation.  
  
From what I see recently it seems that the latter option is more adopted; because if you (european and americans) sympithised with the jews, then the ceturies old persecution of jews that climaxed in their genocide in europe wouldnt have happened in the first place and you would have accepted them in you countries instead of easing and encouriging their immigration to the middle east from europe.   
  
So, are there other option or pov that can change this view?

1,2024-01-16,CMV: There ARE only 2 genders,u/SnooPets5219,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198aoeq/cmv_there_are_only_2_genders/,changemyview,"Before I say anything let me get this out of the way. Biologically, homosapiens at the genetic level can only either be XY (Male) or XX (Female). In rare cases there are homosapiens that experience 'intersex' where they are born with or without parts that are traditionally found in homosapiens with either XX or XY chromosomes. They can even have XXY chromosomes. However this does not mean there is a third biological sex as it is simply a mix between Male and Female Homosapiens or an absence of some typical male or female homosapien genetic  characteristics

With that being said, ""gender"" Is a social construct its not found in nature but, at the genetic level, XY and XX chromosomes still exist and there is a difference which we typically differentiate by the names ""man"" ""woman"" ""male"" ""female"" ""girl"" ""boy"" which I breifly mentioned above. The premise of ""there are only 2 genders"" comes from the fact that gender is based around and stems from the male and female (XY AND XX) sexes. So therefore there can only be 2 genders. This does not, however mean that there can only be 2 genders period. As I said gender is a social construct, social constructs change over time, if in the far future a 3rd sex appears in homosapiens which is neither male nor female or a mix between both and is entirely separate then there will be 3 genders. But as of now, in present day and for the future there can only be and will only be 2 genders.

Gender identifiers are slightly different than gender. Whilst there are only 2 genders this does not mean someone cannot identify as something other than these 2. For example a female born with XX chromosomes can identify as a male if they want to or vice versa, genderfluid, a person who feels they lean more towards one side than the other and changes constantly or even just non binary, feeling like you don't necessarily fit within the given binary gender system. But these are identifiers, not genders. And notice how they're all based around the presence OR absence of male and female. 

No gender identifier is based on something other than male and/or female or neither. At a biological level you can have XY or XX chromosomes but not feel like your gender identity fits with your genetics. This is where transgender comes in. This is a transition, but not a gender. 

At the biological level if a man goes through gender dysphoria and wants to start taking hormones replacement therapy, dressing the way many females are expected to dress in society stereotypically and getting plastic surgery and it makes them feel better go for it, but biologically they are still a man, it's out of respect we call them how they identify (gender identity) a female. This ""man"" is now a woman but only socially not biologically. Pronouns typically match the gender identity but this post isn't about pronouns.

People out there argue that there is ""at least 3 genders"" or there are more genders but when confronted with the question they can never answer. 

I was on another post a while back which asked ""how many genders are there?"" Somebody replied, ""how many colours are there? That's your answer"" and someone underneath that replied ""think of gender as colours, even within the typical colours (ROYGBIV) these are just the most common colours that we agree upon, that doesn't mean something like vermillion (bright-red orange shade) isn't a colour. There are genders out there that we don't commonly see or agree upon but they do exist""

And also I don't want to hear something silly like ""biological males are based on females and vice versa because they both share an X chromosomes so therefore there is only 1 gender by your logic"" it Is the presence OR absence of the Y chromosome that determines the biological sex. The SRY decides if an embryo is male or female if an embryo lacks a Y gene then they are biologically female.

778,2024-01-16,CMV: Someone with multiple felony allegations and multiple bankruptcies has no business running the United States,u/snakebitin22,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198b4dc/cmv_someone_with_multiple_felony_allegations_and/,changemyview,"Let's just think about this in the context of how we approach the basic rules of society.  Let's just try for a moment to apply those same rules to the leading candidate for the Republican party.  
  
Employment:  
In source \[1\], I have provided the official guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which states the following:  
  
""Apply the same standards to everyone, regardless of their race, national origin, color, sex, religion, disability, genetic information (including family medical history), or age (40 or older). For example, if you don't reject applicants of one ethnicity with certain financial histories or criminal records, you can't reject applicants of other ethnicities because they have the same or similar financial histories or criminal records.""  
  
Starting from this point, the rhetoric surrounding the current Republican front runner has been that they have not been treated fairly with regard to the 91 felony allegations and their history of multiple bankruptcy filings.  Not to mention, this candidate has been convicted of financial fraud in the State of New York and is currently waiting for sentencing on that case.  They have been convicted of sexual assault and defamation and are awaiting sentencing on the civil defamation suit on that case.  Let's remove the ""Presidential Candidate"" label from the equation, and examine this person fairly within the context of the quote and see how they would fare against any other person if things were truly being fairly applied within the rule of law:  
  
I have interviewed and hired hundreds of candidates in my career.  If a candidate applied for a role on my team and if their only fault were the bankruptcies, I'd be willing to hear their story and try to understand what they overcame to be sitting in front of me to make their case to be on my team.  However, having this many pending criminal charges in addition to the bankruptcies is a clear indication of an overall behavior pattern that is beyond problematic.  This screams to me in giant red letters STAY AWAY.  
  
You, the community, are interviewing this person for the most important job in the United States right now.  These criminal charges are his background check.  It is not coming back clean.  These felony accusations are what we refer to in the industry as a ""red flag"".  
  
Housing:  
In source \[2\], I have provide the official guidance from the Federal Trade Commission which states the following:  
  
""You order an applicant’s criminal history report from a CRA. Because the report shows that the applicant has a felony conviction, you deny the rental application.    
  
You must give the applicant an adverse action notice because the report is a consumer report and it influenced your decision to deny the application.""  
  
The applicant here is the current front runner for the Repulican party, who is currently accused of 91 felony charges.  This same applicant has been convicted of financial fraud in the State of New York as reported in \[3\] in September 2023 by CSMonitor, known for being one of the least biased, most factual news sites according to \[4\].  Based on the information we know about the Republican front runner, he would not even clear a housing background check for most landlords.  He does not even qualify to rent a home in many circumstances in this country.  Should he qualify to live in the White House?  
  
Fairness:  
I hear so much about fairness, and the ""two tiered justice system"".  I hear so much about how this candidate is being unfairly persecuted and how he's a good person getting a bad rap.  Then, I watch actual good, hard working people who do far less than this person has get treated far worse by his own supporters.    
  
Let me ask all of the managers and landlords who are TRUMP supporters out there something:  
  
If you're willing to proudly say you support Donald J. Trump as the next president of the United States of America, then are you willing to let a felon rent your home?  Are you willing to hire a felon into your business?  Are you willing to let someone with a bankruptcy rent from you?  
  
Because if you just answered no to any of the above, and you go vote for Donald Trump, where is that ""two tiers of justice"" really?  He is not being held to the same standard as the rest of us, that is certainly true.    
  
Think about this, especially his supporters.  If any of you did a tiny fraction of what he did, the barriers to every day life for you would be immense.  You would not be able to easily find a place to live.  You would not be able to secure good employment.  If all things are supposed to be equal, and if all of us are supposed to have equal rights under the law, which has been clearly provided, then it is clear that the Republican front runner does not qualify.  He is applying for the job of President of United States.  He must be held to the same standards that we, as every day citizens are held to when we apply for jobs.  If we apply for a job, we must submit to background checks prior to starting our roles.  If we do not pass the background check, meaning that if we have any pending charges, or if we have any convictions, we are not eligible for the role in most cases.  This is especially true for positions that carry high risk, where the applicant must make critical decisions, or where the well being of human life is at stake.  The President is ALL OF THESE.  
  
Those of you who are in any position in your employment that participate in the hiring process know this.  I implore you to appeal to your better judgement and understard what you are dealing with.  
  
Those of you who are in the business of renting homes, you would run away from an applicant that had a tiny fraction of the issues that Trump has.  Again, as landlords, if you wouldn't rent your property to a tenant with the level of bankruptcies and criminal history that Trump has (if they weren't Trump), why on earth would you put them in the White House, if you owned that property?  Again, I implore you to appeal to your better judgement to understand what you are dealing with.  
  
I'll close on some final remarks.  We have been waiting since 2015 for Trump to redeem himself and for the crazy tweets, the vulgar language, the accusations, the character assasinations, and all of the drama to stop.  We've been living in this fantasy of ""if we just give him what he wants, he'll calm down and go away"" mentality.  That will never happen.  He's just going to want more.  He will never stop.  He has proven this over and over again.  If he is allowed to be in power again, this wanting more and more will take a dark turn when the ability to grab power within the government dries up.  He will turn on his own.  He has already shown you that he will do that.  Just go look at his Truth Social wall if you don't believe that.  If you don't think he won't come for your group, you are sadly mistaken.  He will.  Understand what you are dealing with.

Gun violence is a big problem and I am in favor of some laws to restrict certain weapons.

But in general I am opposed to any laws banning guns.

A few years ago I started getting death threats online to my private instagram. Legitimate threats along with threats to rape my sister. From multiple accounts.

I went to the police and they said they were just threats, they weren't actionable and most of the threats probably came from outside my city and there was nothing I could.

Eventually I bought a gun and learned how to use it safely. 

So far no one has come after me and the threats have been exclusively online. But when the police literally say there is nothing they can do to protect you it only makes sense that Americans are allowed to defend themselves."
33,2024-01-16,CMV: This study by Everytown makes a convincing case that gun control laws do reduce gun violence.,u/VanillaIsActuallyYum,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198bn25/cmv_this_study_by_everytown_makes_a_convincing/,changemyview,"A disclaimer: I'm not here to discuss the generalized argument about whether gun laws save lives. I am SPECIFICALLY centered on this source, and I will only respond to and discuss arguments about this source in particular. The only other sources I'm willing to entertain are sources that appear to study the exact same topic but came back with DIFFERENT results. Studies on unrelated topics are outside of the scope here.

Here's the study in question:

[https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/](https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/)

The findings of this study in particular are critical, as I believe that these findings make the strongest case I'm aware of that gun laws in the United States do indeed help to reduce gun violence. It also refutes the claim that ""no evidence suggests that gun laws reduce gun violence."" This study does exactly that, and I think it makes that case better than any other evidence I've seen out there. Simply put, anyone who wants to proceed with the claim that gun laws don't reduce gun violence needs to explain the findings of this study, full stop, or else they are being willfully dishonest.

Let me address a few criticisms I think I will find:

\- *The study was probably done by a biased institution*. Here's the thing: half of this data is verifiable by your own understanding of American politics, and the other half is just data that anyone can look up. This study makes a correlation between the strength of gun laws and the number of people who died due to gun violence. Regarding the former, the strength of gun laws, I firmly believe that anyone should be able to look at the states and how they are ranked in terms of how strict their gun laws are and realize that the classifications do indeed make sense. Blue states seem to have tighter restrictions. Red states don't. None of that is surprising. And the number of gun deaths? Well either a person was shot to death, or they weren't, right? So this isn't really subject to debate. The data was likely pulled from law enforcement records, so I feel like the only people who you could blame for messing up the data would be these law enforcement officers determining whether or not a person died because of a bullet wound. I just...don't see any real reason to think they'd massively screw that task up, ESPECIALLY not so that they could help some extraneous analysis done by Everytown.

\- *The data shows results for a single point in time, whereas the more interesting data is temporal.* That is true, but if you think about it, you can't really come up with a good reason for why a state that had a low amount of gun violence would suddenly start implementing a bunch of gun laws. If there's no danger to their state, then what's causing them to do this? It's just not a convincing angle in my mind.

\- *Correlation is not causation*. Sure, but I'm not calling this an iron-clad case by any means. But I am saying it is ""convincing"". If this were confounded by some other variable, you'd have to tell me what that variable is and how it could explain the correlation, and I have yet to hear of a convincing one that would completely blow this correlation up.

TL;DR: this source in particular is a cornerstone of the argument that gun laws do indeed lower gun violence, and I see no reason not to think that it demonstrates exactly that. CMV."

""If the police in the US are so corrupt, so violent and a more present threat then crime to alot of Americans why are we surrendering our firearms to them?"" 

Additionally.

""If the right wing, which primarily is where most firearms are owned/used, is adamantly opposed to disarming to the point of violence, why are we willing giving up our right to bear arms and/or opposed to owning more arms?

**Introduction**

The term ""apartheid"" has ignited intense debates surrounding Israel's treatment of the Palestinian population. I strongly believe Israel is an apartheid state, and many human rights organizations have said so in great detail including B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch (HRW), and Amnesty International.

[https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/)

[https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution)

[https://www.btselem.org/topic/apartheid](https://www.btselem.org/topic/apartheid)

**Quote from b'tselem**

**T**he Israeli regime enacts in all the territory it controls (Israeli sovereign territory, East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip) an apartheid regime. One organizing principle lies at the base of a wide array of Israeli policies: advancing and perpetuating the supremacy of one group – Jews – over another – Palestinians. B’Tselem rejects the perception of Israel as a democracy (inside the Green Line) that simultaneously upholds a temporary military occupation (beyond it). B’Tselem reached the conclusion that the bar for defining the Israeli regime as an apartheid regime has been met after considering the accumulation of policies and laws that Israel devised to entrench its control over Palestinians.

**Some main points**

1. &#x200B;

**Israeli Settlements and Land Displacement**: Collective evidence from B'Tselem, HRW, and Amnesty International provides damning accounts of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, exposing a deliberate strategy resulting in the displacement of Palestinian communities. The unequal distribution of resources and access to land not only violates international law but also perpetuates a system of segregation akin to the apartheid era in South Africa. The construction of settlements is a glaring testament to the entrenched discriminatory practices at play. Settlers KILL Palestinians with impunity and there is no legal recourse for palestinians. Western leaders pay lip service to 2 state solution by condemning settlers. But they never put any diplomatic pressure against the same. Extremist religious israelis There was something similar in South Africa 2. **Restrictions on Movement**: The pervasive network of checkpoints, barriers, and the separation barrier in the West Bank, meticulously detailed by B'Tselem, HRW, and Amnesty International, establishes a reality where Palestinian movement is severely restricted. This deliberate impediment to access essential services, education, and healthcare creates a segregated existence, reinforcing the apartheid narrative. The evidence points to a systematic effort to curtail the freedoms of the Palestinian population. It takes hours to travel for Palestinians for the same distance that an Israeli can make in 30 minutes because of checkpoints and walls.

3. **Discriminatory Policies in East Jerusalem**: Findings from B'Tselem, HRW, and Amnesty International regarding discriminatory policies in East Jerusalem leave no room for ambiguity. The systematic hurdles faced by Palestinian residents in obtaining building permits, coupled with the demolition of homes, highlight a clear pattern of discrimination. The differential treatment between Jewish and Palestinian communities in East Jerusalem mirrors the apartheid practices that the international community vehemently opposed in the past. The permits can be revoked without any legal recourse and Palestinians can lose their entire home. While ultra orthodox settler Israelis will take up their home. 4. **Unequal Legal Systems**: Please be not stupid enough to argue that the population of an occupied country will be treated fairly by the court systems of an occupying power. The collective revelation of separate legal systems for Israeli settlers and Palestinians in the West Bank, as outlined by B'Tselem, HRW, and Amnesty International, is a stark manifestation of institutionalized discrimination. The imposition of military law on Palestinians, while Israeli settlers fall under civil law, reinforces a hierarchical structure that inherently denies equal protection under the law. Such disparities are integral to the apartheid accusation.

Conclusion: In unequivocally supporting the assertion that Israel operates under an apartheid system, this essay draws upon the robust data provided by B'Tselem, HRW, and Amnesty International. The evidence of Israeli settlements, land displacement, restrictions on movement, discriminatory policies, and unequal legal systems paints a damning picture. While recognizing the complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is imperative to confront and challenge these practices for the sake of justice, equity, and a future built on principles of equality and human rights.

1,2024-01-16,CMV: The only thing that’s worse than buying clothes from fast fashion brands is judging people for shopping from fast fashion brands,u/Zealousideal_Weird_3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198dids/cmv_the_only_thing_thats_worse_than_buying/,changemyview,"I don't particularly agree with fast fashion, but I understand peoples reasons behind shopping from them and I think they should be respected:

The main reason people shop from fast fashion brands is because they are

1. affordable and 2) accessible

I feel that people who judge others for shopping in places like H&M, UNIQLO, Nike etc must come from an enormous place of privilege or haven't got bills to pay. 

I find the people who make these judgements are usually young and have the time to advocate for the planet which I fully respect and admire. I just dont think a lot of them have many adult responsibilities.

I was recently talking to a Gen Z who was very dissaproving when I told her that the only times I shop from fast fashion brands is when I need my basics replaced e.g: white/black/grey t-shirts, socks, jeans etc. She told me as if she had discovered sliced bread ""You can thrift you know!""

This didn't sit right with me and it made me wonder if she understands that some people don't have the time that is needed to find alternative options. In my opinion, when it comes to essentials, clothes need to be the right fit right and be brand new., especially when you plan to wear them multiple times a week.

P.S As I said, I don't agree with fast fashion because of how expoliatieve and harmful to the environment it is. But I do believe that people should respect people's decision to choose to shop from these places.

Extra points to mention:

* I disagree with overbuying and shopping for the sake it. However it is important to recognise that not everyone can afford alternative options.

*Adults who have full time jobs (in the office) don't have the free time to go thrifting or finding alternatives. Clothes shopping can be a total pain in the ass"

I was on /pol/ , which is an image board on 4chan.org (I’m not a fascist) and there was this thread where redditors said he would put the military on the streets on day one, pardon the January Sixthers and he would make life hell for minorities.

As a teenager I would have laughed you off even though I still hated Trump but after some time I’d like to be open minded. Don’t just say things. Give me proof. Use links, News stories, videos, or anything that proves you right.

What is especially disturbing is that Trump’s lawyer’s legal theories are that he could assassinate political rivals without any repercussions and he could be exempt from prosecution just for being president. The assassination part is something I’m not too sure was a loaded question which his lawyer was forced to answer because of the decorum of court. Trump being Hitler sounds ham-fisted, corny, and delusional at first because this is *America* but recent events have only made the screeching become louder than ever before so now I’m genuinely worried."

1,2024-01-16,CMV: It’s easier to date currently compared to the past,u/VenoVlade,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198ephn/cmv_its_easier_to_date_currently_compared_to_the/,changemyview,"I’ve seen quite a few arguments/complaints online about how modern men are very lonely and how it’s more difficult, statistically, to get into a relationship. I suspect these studies to be skewed towards city life and/or criminally online people, and I’d go as far as to say it’s easier to date for all genders.

This is why I think it’s easier to date compared to even 20-30 years ago:

1) The bar has fallen:

 the traditional/stereotype of partners has been dissolving and I don’t see conventional pairings as often. Women more and more are breadwinners, sexually liberated, independent, strong spirited. Men are being allowed to be more feminine, expressive, vulnerable. Not to say women have stopped being women or men have stopped being men. But there is a lot more flexibility to what kind of person you can be and what you can do, which opens up the dating pool.

2) Ugly ain’t ugly no more:

When I look at pictures/portraits/film of the last century, it’s tough. Lot of face cards being rejected. The only saving grace for the past is that they were in better physical shape. They were also starving and choking on smog 24/7 and it shows. 

Modern people are hot. They are healthier, less nutrient deficiency + curvy/more built, they are more well spoken with pretty good personalities. I might be a bit of a thot in this regard but I’d say 9/10 of women I see everyday I would make love to.

3) Personal experience: 

I’m not the best looking guy, and I was terrified I’d never lose my virginity. Then I got scared I wouldn’t even have a relationship. It was a rough couple years.

Then my friend nonchalantly told me to add one of the friends of a girl he was talking to. Had my first relationship within 2 weeks. Had a couple more before losing the V card.

Get to college, anxiety returns. Just put it to the side and hung out with a bunch of people and had fun cuz college. 4 relationships over the course of 5 years, and casual hookups. 

Girls have overwhelming been attractive with great personalities. They’ve always looked past my shortcomings and my confidence has gone up a lot over the years. 

Conclusion:

The narrative I see online doesn’t add up to the real world. People have become nicer, more open, and more eager to explore. I’m not a nice guy, not attractive, not rich. I’m just honest and talk to people.

I strongly believe I would’ve been a massive loser like 20-30 years ago. I feel like most of my friends have been in similar situations."

Younger women just don't know their self worth yet, so their base their confidence off male validation. This declines rapidly around 27 or so. You start to understand how cheap the currency of male approval is. You start to live for your own comfort and pleasure. Male validation is so incredibly hollow and pointless.  Pick-me's don't receive more respect, they receive more praise. Younger women aren't more agreeable they just lack courage and self confidence.

As we all know, the dark curtain of fascism was set to descend on America on January 6th, 2021.

We all watched as a mob tried to not only steal an election, but also attempted to auto coup the incumbent leader. 

Our President and his allies in Congress put a stop to this. 

The 2024 election looms, now, and we are once more threatened in our freedom, our security, our very way of life.

Joe Biden is the only person standing in the doorway, it could be argued, between our way of life, and fascism. 

He is doing it for us. 

One could make the argument that not even FDR did as much to make the world safe for democracy as Biden is. FDR helped to defeat Hitler, but Biden defeated a threat to our democracy that is right in our own country. Arguably only Lincoln, and Washington did similar.

To me, the word murderer means being extremely lacking in empathy and uncontrollable emotions and having no issue taking another humans life to benefit you in some way. Gyosy Rose is nothing like that, she was not happy to decide to want her mom dead, she was hesitant and not proud of the planning up until the day it happened, and she regrets it 100% today.

If anything, if I were put in a position where I was being abused and slowly killed by a family member, the police and doctors always believing the family member that everything is fine and not doing anything to go against them, me and I think anyone would have to decide for themselves the only way I will be free from abuse in this world is to kill this piece of shit in my life, no one else cares about me to lock her in prison. I wouldn't have any doubts or sympathy as it's reasonable to think I would absolutely hate that family member by that point. 

Many people say it's not fair that her mother was killed, she just had a mental disease and should have been in prison instead, but as someone with a mental illness I'm managing quite well (depression, anxiety) with medication, being mentally ill is no excuse. Yes it is difficult, but Gypsy Rose's mother never once had any self awareness to question her actions, that they aren't normal, that maybe I have an issue, I should look into it and get a diagnosis and help. That woman was evil, she cared more about feeling fulfilled by feeding her mental illness by abusing Gypsy and in a calculating way deceiving police and doctors, than she carer about getting help and getting better to spare Gypsy such severe abuse.

 I don't think someone this determined to refuse reflecting on themselves and seeking help for their mental disorder, and for decades continuing to slowly kill her daughter, I don't think someone like this deserves to live if the daughter suddenly decided killing you is the only way I can save myself."

I think this is an absurd outlook. Whether you adopt a dog from a reputable Korean meat farm rescue or from a local shelter, it doesn’t matter. A life saved is a life saved. And some countries don’t have as many resources to save dogs as Western shelters. 

Yes, it is ideal if you adopt from a shelter/rescue who uses the adoption fees effectively to help save more dogs. There are good and bad shelters everywhere, and dogs in need of homes in all of them. 

Some overseas shelters put a lot of time and effort into caring for their dogs and may have a hard time finding suitable adopters for difficult dogs. If someone from overseas, that’s still a net good. 

Dog adoptions are not the problem, so it’s pointless to attack someone for adopting a dog outside of your country. It’s better to put that time into donating to shelters or fighting backyard breeding and other issues that actually contribute to the issue of overcrowded shelters."

In combination to these factors, it is a stimulant that reduces appetite - studies that focus on cigarette smoker mortality try to adjust for cigarette smoking and weight by treating it as if someone would be of the same weight and of the same level of physical activity regardless of if they smoked - when that is simply not true between the above 2 effects and the natural stimulant effect of nicotine. 

Then there is the social aspect - smoking is largely a social activity, and those who partake in social activities and smoke live longer than those who are non social and live a ""healthier"" life

To put the child first, genuinely, means to do everything in one's power to raise them in a safe, stable and healthy environment, and definitely not in a politically and religiously tense zone.

So we come across new profiles every day, and I happed to come across this girl Riley Ferguson - she posted videos of a shocking display of domestic violence but dragged out her reasoning for why and who did it - she immediately started to accept tons of gifts and asked for a 5000 dollar horse back riding trip. 

Something about this seems off, I don’t think she’s telling the whole truth; she said her ex came over and broke all of her stuff and stole anything of value but he was also arrested..when people called her out for it she said he actually just put it all in his truck - this fight broke out after she asked him to pick her up a bunch of ingredients from the store to make a dinner to film for her page - maybe it’s just me but I would never ask an ex to do favors for me, they’re an ex for a reason - she then sort of gas lights him and tells him to calm down in a screen shot, it was worded in such a way it’s like she knew as she was typing it she was going to screen shot it for evidence… the police even asked her if he could say goodbye to the dogs they share but she said no - the police said they understood his side because they’re also guys and they know he loves her so much..she doesn’t appear to work other than being a “makeup artist” in rural Canada and knows a few trades…

Here’s the thing guys - I’m not trying to discredit Riley or her current situation but I know true domestic violence when I see it, my friend Ashley would come to my apartment with black eyes and bloody lips and she even had to move out of state. 

I’m not saying Riley is using this for attention, but it was how she was so quick to film immediately after the event and start asking all of her new followers for gifts and money and like I said she was even bold enough to use people’s sympathy for a horseback riding trip - it really raised up some red flags, my intuition told me that she’s used to asking for hand outs and this ex of hers did everything he could to support her but she didn’t want to be with him, but she still accepts his help no problem - and I’m sorry but that is blatantly leading someone on for your own personal gain and not allowing them to heal and move on - that’s why he broke all of her stuff (no excuses for that he should have just walked away, but some men invest so much into a woman..not saying she owes him a relationship - but she shouldn’t have continued asking him for things if she had no intention of being with him…

I think she’s just a user - asking her ex to buy her groceries then playing mental games with him to the point that the guy just looses it because he bought her so much stuff and tried to take care of her while she accepted the gifts but kept him at arms length

Does anyone know who the guy is? Or know her history? I feel terrible for him and the cops siding with him really says something…

Stay safe out there boys - women can be incredibly manipulative and play the victim when really all they see you as is an ATM machine..watch out for this girl and don’t send her anything unless you really feel it’s necessary - I’ve never seen an influencer get popular off of a domestic dispute..can someone else check it out and change my view on this?"

57,2024-01-17,"CMV: The real danger to our society does not come from extremist politics, but from journalists who exploit their narratives to make a lot of money.",u/lostident,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198wn3i/cmv_the_real_danger_to_our_society_does_not_come/,changemyview,"Hello dear community,  
  
I would like to start my argumentation with a quote often attributed to Voltaire:  
  
""To learn who rules over you, find out who you are not allowed to criticize.""  
  
This quote is often taken to convey the idea that those who suppress discussions and criticism are often the ones wielding oppressive power in society. When examining societal discourse, people often focus on criticizing the opposing political side, which is quite normal in a democracy.  
  
The issue, in my view, lies in the authority that sets the foundation for these discussions. While there are official sources directly from parliaments that accurately and neutrally document what has transpired, few individuals have the time to read through all of it. Instead, we rely on news media to filter out the (supposedly?) important information and present it to the reader. This wouldn't be a problem if the subsequently published news were not being reinterpreted by the author.  
  
The problem with online news media is that they are primarily financed through advertising rather than subscriptions and impulse purchases. A single click is the most valuable, and obtaining it is crucial. The risk of publishing a bad piece of news, not getting clicks, and consequently not earning advertising revenue is much greater than with print media, which employs a subscription model and still receives money upfront even if an editorial is not widely read. They would still receive the money if the magazine were bought at the kiosk because no one really reads the entire magazine before buying it.  
  
To maximize clicks on an article, news media must employ tactics to lure the online reader, who has a wide array of choices, to their own site. This is where the tricks come into play: emotional and sensational headlines get clicked more often than sober and neutral ones. However, not every event in our society is emotional and sensational. In fact, very few are. To present neutral news as sensational and emotional as possible without altering the truth, internet media resorts to some tricks:  
  
For example, in a city X, a person has died. Due to the stab wounds, it is suspected that the person was murdered with a knife, and the police are investigating for murder and have arrested some individuals, including a foreigner.  
  
The neutral headline would read:  
""Police Investigate Suspected Murder in City X""  
  
So far, so neutral. However, that's not brutal enough for the journalist, so let's add some brutality:  
""Police Investigate Bloodbath in City X""  
  
Do you see how the ""suspected"" can be dropped? Because the crime scene was full of blood, regardless of whether it was murder or not. If an foreigner is among the arrested individuals, let's add that:  
""Police Investigate Foreigner for Bloodbath in City X""  
  
Everything is still true. An investigation is ongoing against a foreigner, and there was a bloodbath. However, for the reader, it may appear as if the foreigner is the only arrest in the investigation. The reader is led to think that the foreigner caused the bloodbath because he is (apparently) the only one arrested. To perfect the reader's pre-judgment, let's leave out the investigation and simply pose the question:  
""Did a Foreigner Cause the Bloodbath in City X?""  
  
So, we avoid making a factual claim and instead ask a question.  
  
In my opinion, something fundamental needs to change in the news culture of the internet. Online news media have a financial incentive to divide society and post sensational news. Otherwise, we will approach the end of democracy with eyes wide open."

If Trump is able to turn any three of these states he will win and considering Biden is facing strong anti incumbency its would be logical to assume that Democrat voters might not be as enthusiastic as they were in 2020 moreover Republican ruled states have taken measures to limit the freedom and extent of mail in voting which was a big factor in Biden's victory."

On the flip side, we have a rich, powerful ~~white~~ orange man who, despite mountains of evidence in public already, is still somehow uncertain to even be getting a trial let alone go to jail. He openly challenges judges, breaks their rulings and orders, flaunts his wealth to buy the best lawyers that can get him off on technicalities, receives favorable rulings from judges he appointed looking for a shot at the SCOTUS from the Federalist Society, and we're here normalizing this like this is the way it's supposed to be.

Captalism and the justice system are two things that should never mix, and those who don't have the means to defend themselves from the state for petty things like selling weed to support their families shouldn't have to suffer while rich men get off for far worse. 

After sitting on a jury and seeing a man put his story in front of me for judgement, I saw from beginning to end how the process is probably SUPPOSED to work, but for all the cases that we might get right, there are still way too many that we get wrong. ""It's not perfect, but it works,"" as Barrack Obama put it, but how are we saying this works.

I also use ""multi-tier"" and not ""two-tier"" because the average middle class white person, like myself, has a far better shot of getting off on charges a poor black person might not, but I also, in no way, could afford the level of comfort or array of lawyers a president, athlete, corporation, or celebrity might.

What will have to happen to have me and many in America see how openly flawed the process is. How do we put the cat back in the bag after all the insanity we're about to endure for the coming year? "
1,2024-01-17,CMV: Freekicks in football (soccer) should not have a barrier if the distance is far enough.,u/agaminon22,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/198xunz/cmv_freekicks_in_football_soccer_should_not_have/,changemyview,"Freekicks are on average scored about  6% of the time. They are not great scoring chances, though they can be very spectacular. I think eliminating the barrier would help free kicks be better scoring chances with more options available. Currently, there are two ways to utilize a free kick: you use it for a cross, or you try to go over the wall. In the past you could sometimes go under the wall, but in the modern game there are players placed there so it can't happen. This makes free kicks pretty limited. 

Obviously, simply eliminating the barrier would make free kicks pretty overpowered especially if they're on the edge of the box. That'd incite players to fish for fouls around that area more often. The solution I think is to ony apply the rule when enough distance is in place. Currently, the barrier has to be set 9,15 meters away from the ball. I'd propose to only allow a barrier if it can be placed within the box. That would mean that close up freekicks would remain fair, but freekicks from longer range would be much more dangerous chances."

I think that it would be good to have more than just two opinions and in the digital age I think that's gonna be more than possible and it's gonna make the child's life more democratic if well planned and implemented.  
  
I think the subreddit r/AmItheAsshole inspiring because there you can see other people's opinions of someone's personal life and we're talking often 1000s of opinions. Imagine if there was an annual parental review or even a quarterly, monthly review of the child's psychological wellbeing which would then give the child to set up a review of the quality of his or her parents' parenting with 1000s of people being paid to participate in the verdict. If the verdict is that the parents have hurt the child then the child can have a 3rd parent paid for by the government who will have daily calls with the child to see how the child is getting on and also have their say in whether or not the child deserves to be lets say grounded. Then if the child's wellbeing approves in the next review, the parents will have a chance to be left to their own devices to maintain the same level of wellbeing for the child that there was with a 3rd parent involved.  
  
Take the 2nd paragraph with a pinch of salt though. The point of this post is that I'm very unsure about how safe it is to leave a child's life & development all in the hands of just two people and whether in the digital age we can have more healthy and diverse opinions. Because after all I think it's completely wrong that children are treated like property, I think the responsibility of the child's first 18 years go way beyond two individuals just because they had unprotected sex + 9 months of delivery."

I think this is very important to bring up because I think people and those on the left in particular underestimate a monopoly the left hold's on societies culture and how easily it can be for the wider society through that monopoly. 

the reason why this is important to my argument is because of the specific ideology that the people in these institutions or entertainment industries hold or at least use to their advantage is very harmful to society whether intentionally or unintentionally. the political ideology I'm talking about is critical theory and every other branch of critical theory like critical race theory or queer theory which was started by the frankfurt school, these ideologies are commonly held in the progressive left and I will explain why these ideologies are harmful to society. 

the main problem with these ideologies is that they commonly use the conflict theory from marxism and applying to race, gender, sex, and all other group defining traits that exist in western society and will then use an oppressor/oppressed dynamic to these but will use them far more commonly on race. concepts like white privilege or white people having an inherent privilege due to their race and the difference of outcomes between the races and always applying that to racism as a result, or wanting to get rid of ""whiteness"". these idea's are harmful to society and will cause only more division, since people on the left are generally too ignorant of what critical theory actually is people who participate in this ideology will just excuse it as talking about systemic racism or whatever will make no one to have a critical look at critical theory.

I believe that if states were left to their own devices to promote education and form standards that they believe is best for their population, we would not have the kind of mobility we have today.  A child who is succeeding in a New Mexico driven education environment, would see major damage if their parents were to get a job in Maine.    
This is also possible with the disparity in quality of education, but without a standard, I see it being exacerbated.  In my example, without the Dept of Education, New Mexico may prioritize a trades/agricultural type of curriculum that their students would thrive in, while Maine may focus on a STEM style of curriculum, which the New Mexico student may not be able to catch up to.  The opposite is true, where a child of Maine may not be able to catch up to an agriculturally driven curriculum.  

I also believe that states will have a much easier time of fudging their own stats to claim success while the constituency is left in the dark surrounding the pitfalls.  With a national standard, there are at least things we can point to across the spectrum of states that can be used to bolter ideas or initiatives.  Most importantly, we can establish different case laws around educational laws to ensure the historically disenfranchised are looked after.    
I don't see a huge benefit to dismantling the Dept of Ed aside from making it easier for state governments to trap, water down, or pigeon-hole, their students.    
This is not to say i'm please with the current federal regulations (No Child Left Behind), but I believe that education should remain a national standard.

Everyone is getting sick of them and their bullshit, including China and Russia. They silently gave the US and UK to strike the Houthis in Yemen after all. The Houthi's have been disrupting trade for months by attacking ships in the Red Sea regardless of ownership or where they are headed

Hezbollah have been threatening to open a front on Israel for months while also bombing the country.

The horrific attack of October 7th on Israel by Hamas, all the hostages they refuse to release, and continual human rights violations.

Iran also just directly attacked Pakistan for no good reason, resulting in two dead children. This, of course, got Pakistan pissed and made them recall all their Iranian ambassador.

Not to mention Iran wants to become a nuclear state (or bridge on the verge of being one) which is something almost no other country wants to nor will let happen.

Of course, since it is an election year, the U.S. is unlikely to attack directly on Iran. But you can poke the bear so much. And, hypothetically, if Iran were to kill an American citizen, they'd be damned fools to think the US wouldn't respond.

They are pissing everyone off and making it seem like the current Iranian regime's days are numbered within this year.

They help local competing firms that lobbied for the tariffs, but at the cost of the tax-payer and it is always a net negative.

It's even worse when a foreign nation subsidizes, and local government imposes a tariff. The foreign country is giving a discount to consumers and local government is denying it's people of this discount. Competing local companies won't be happy about it, but the extra spending money that local consumers will have from that discount will leave more money to be spent within the economy funded by the foreign country. Imagine Country A and B.

Senario 1
A: subsidizes steel
B: thanks for the discount!

People have more money to spend in other industries to take advantage of the discount. Locals in steel industry are free to do other productive things. The extra money from the discount creates more jobs for everyone locally.

Senario 2
A: Subsidizes steel
B: no no no, tariffs

Locals pay more for steel, discouraging manufacturing of steel products. There's less money for consumers to spend making the economy worse than doing nothing. 

The only reason I think protectionism is so popular is because it's hard to gather enough resources to lobby for the economy as a whole. It's much easier and beneficial for a company to lobby for anti-competitive policy that hurts the economy as a whole, but increases company profits.

Look at the economic success of Switzerland, and Singapore. Also Hong Kong before the handover, I'm assuming China has now ruined that, but I could be wrong.

I have read several articles arguing that we should defend Taiwan in the event of military invasion.

Examples:

https://time.com/6221072/why-protecting-taiwan-really-matters-to-the-u-s/

https://www.fpri.org/article/2023/03/american-power-and-the-defense-of-taiwan/

I think this would be a significant mistake for several reasons.

1.) A war between the United States and China could easily escalate into something terribly destructive. Both powers have nuclear weapons and the world’s strongest militaries. Millions of lives would be at risk from long-range bombers, drone strikes, cyber-espionage, and other irregular forms of warfare. While the United States may be physically safe from invasion, the damage could still be horrific.

If we’re to fight such a war, it should be over a threat to the United States or its treaty-obligated allies. Not Taiwan.

2. Taiwan can defend itself. It is a highly developed economy with a strong military and impressive stockpile of weapons provided by the United States. China will need to cross a strait and then land troops on a handful of defended beaches. Airborne operations would need to contend with SAMs and other air defenses. The balance of force may change in China’s favor eventually, but it’s still dubious whether an invasion would succeed.

3. Taiwan, while important, is not absolutely essential to the United States. I understand the criticality of semiconductor manufacturing. It’s not worth a third World War, which would impoverish us with far greater efficiency than loss of semiconductors - assuming we would completely lose access.

4. The idea that China will continue to invade other countries (if we do not stop them in Taiwan) does not seem realistic. China has been the world’s foremost power for centuries. In many ways, the ascendancy of other powers has been an aberration. Never have the Chinese sought to extend their domination beyond their immediate sphere.

History is no guarantee of the future. But I don’t think China has the ability to physically threaten the United States (outside of nuclear weapons or cyberwarfare). China may ascend to global hegemony, but as the United States demonstrated, that is not all it’s cracked up to be.

5. Our security umbrella is already vast. We have mutual defense agreements with many countries. I would argue we’re already overstretched as is without further commitments, and we can’t be sure of European material support.

6. China does have a legitimate claim to Taiwan. It wasn’t a province of imperial China for as long as, say, Gansu or Sichuan. However, it’s still been part of China for hundreds of years. A little over a third of Taiwan’s people favor closer relations with China, though of course most oppose closer political ties.

(https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/05/12/in-taiwan-views-of-mainland-china-mostly-negative/)

Now, I don’t mean to say that China’s claim overrides Taiwan’s sovereignty or the democratic will of its people. What I mean to say is that the CCP has been signaling all its existence that they will take Taiwan back. We basically guarantee a fight if we commit ourselves to Taiwan’s defense.



That said, I am open to changing my view firstly because on its face, allowing China to just seize Taiwan by coercion is a bad outcome. It may be the lesser of two evils, but it’s miserable for people in Taiwan who favor independence.

In addition, many Americans are in favor of defending Taiwan. There are probably reasons out there I missed.

(https://globalaffairs.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/2021%20Taiwan%20Brief.pdf). There is a case for intervention, and maybe I am missing a piece of the puzzle.

Addendum:

It is possible China will blockade the island to force its submission - I don’t think the United States should attempt to break a blockade militarily, either."

It does seem to be true that singleness among young men is particularly high right now, but the reasons for this are not what many dejected young men say they are.

Those in the so-called ""manosphere"" or the various ""pilled"" communities generally blame women for their singleness. They accuse women of ""hypergamy"", IE dating men of higher social status than themselves. They accuse women of having unrealistic standards and say most women will only date a man who is over 6 feet tall with an income above 100,000 dollars. Some end up just hating women in general. 

I do not think these people are correct. What I see is a generation of young men who, relative to previous generations, rarely go out of the house and rarely socialize with women in real life. So many young Gen Z men are socially and even physically under-developed because their primary sources of recreation and socialization have been virtual for their whole lives. When you talk to these young men in real life it is clear that they have not developed the social skills and hobbies necessary to interact normally and healthily with women they're attracted to. Moreover, the way these young men talk about women online makes it absolutely clear that they do not regularly interact with a variety of women in real life and do not have a realistic understanding of women.

To put it simply, most women are not interested in dating socially awkward and physically under-developed men who spend all day on the Internet. I think we can all understand that and accept it as normal.

How big is this problem really? Online, it's huge. In real life, I don't think it's all that serious. The great majority of these dejected young men eventually grow up, acquire real life jobs and hobbies, and learn to interact with women like human beings. Once they do that, they generally find women much more interested in them and live a perfectly normal life."
0,2024-01-17,CMV: sex outside of serious relationships lowers women’s value in the eyes of successful men and men who say they don’t care about a woman’s body count are either cuckolds or liars,u/nahmatenahnah,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1991sgv/cmv_sex_outside_of_serious_relationships_lowers/,changemyview,"Just a quick, personal definition of ‘successful men’ = men who have enough self respect and success where they have the ability to reject women who they deem unsuitable because they’re confident in their ability to attract someone who fits their criteria in the future. Basically, men that aren’t desperate.

So there’s two claims I make (Claim A and Claim B) and I’m fully ready for argue with anyone on this.

Claim A: sex outside of serious relationships lowers a woman’s value. It shows poor impulse control and decision making to be putting your health and well being at risk just because you’re horny. Women are at risk of pregnancy, they’re more likely to catch an STD, be SA’d or r*ped. To do this with men who didn’t have to earn your trust is low value behaviour. 

Additionally, majority of men also intrinsically put women in category of ‘relationship material’ or ‘casual only’. Most men who have the ability to choose and reject women will almost always pass up on such women due to these factors.



Claim B: men that say a woman’s body count doesn’t matter are either cuckolds or liars. And I’m not using ‘cuckold’ as an insult, I’m referring to men who get thrill and enjoyment from their partner having sex with other men.

My reasoning for this is very simple, almost every man that says they don’t care about a woman’s body count does their best to not ask their girlfriend/wife her body count. Even if they do know the number, they don’t ask about specific details about her previous sexual encounters. And even if they do know specific details about her previous sexual encounters, they wouldn’t want to watch a sex tape of her having sex with men in her past. Any man that does all this is a cuckold but most don’t, so when they claim that a woman’s body count doesn’t matter, they’re lying. It’s a turnoff for men that aren’t cuckolds."
1,2024-01-17,CMV: Israel is a colonial project,u/mdosai_33,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1992aro/cmv_israel_is_a_colonial_project/,changemyview,"A colony traditionally means that a foreign body encroaches on another people's land in pursuit of domination either by controlling (exploitation colonization) or replacing (settler colonization) the indigenous inhabitants.  
  
When Theodor Herzl started the call for the modern zionist movement in 1896 to establish a national homeland for the jews in Palestine, jews at that time constituted a very small minority in Palestine. Jewish immigration started to increase after the movement and their number was estimated at 56,000 in 1918. The immigration specifically skyrocketed after Balfour declaration in 1917 that by 1939, the Jewish population had increased to 445,000. [Source](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-206581/)  
  
So, it is an obvious case of settler colonization that can't be refuted but some people may argue that if the settler is the true indigenous population then it is not colonization. This can be refuted by:  
  
1) Even if modern-day palestenians started to settle in the region after the jews that doesn't mean that they aren't indigenous; I don't know what makes you indigenous more than living continuously in the same area for about 2000 years. By that same logic, modern-day americans have no place in America because they are the descendants of europeans who invaded the region 300 years ago when the land belonged to the indigenous amirican population.  
  
2) The plot twist, but an obvious thing, is that genetically palestinians are direct descendants of the ancient Israelites; they are jews who converted to christianity and then converted to islam. They are more ethnically israelites than most large jewish groups especailly askenazi jews whose europian ancestry is more than 50% while palestinian muslims have arab ancestory of only 20 to 30%. It is more striking when in comparison, palestinian muslims are more genetically close to askinazi jews than Saudi arabs, but yemenite jews are more arab than palestinian muslims. [Source](https://twitter.com/MiroCyo/status/1712258026881921287?s=20): (mega analysis of several research papers of dna material of several sources compiled into a database summarized in this thread).  
  
In light of these facts and logical assumptions, there is no way to state that the jews have a distinctive or better claim to the land of palestine more than palestinians EXCEPT if:  
  
1) You strongly sympathize with the jews because of the holaucost in europe and their long persecution there; which is very good and healthy thing to do but what have this to do with the palestinians? They werent the ones to persecute them in europe, so they dont have to atone for the mistakes and atrocities of europeans with their land and lives. If someone owes to compensate them then they should be europeans specifically germans. Why didn't they give them a piece of their land to build a Jewish-majority state?  
  
2) You dont view palestinians as equal humans and thus you think it is okay to take away their rights to solve the jewish problem of europe without europeans being affected that much; a “small” price to pay for salvation.  
  
From what I have seen recently it seems that most pro-israel westerners have the combination of both points with the emphasis on the dehumanization of palesteninans; because if you (european and americans) sympathized with the jews, then the centuries-old persecution of jews that climaxed in their genocide in europe wouldn't have happened in the first place and you would have accepted them in your countries instead of easing and encouraging their immigration to the middle east from europe even after the holocaust.  
  
So, are there other option or pov that can change this view?"

However I've been seeing so many tiktoks wnd reddit posts of servers saying if you can't pay 20 percent tip, you don't deserve to eat out.
Servers literally have the easiest job in the restaurant business, carrying plates and drinks to a table does not mean you get free money.

I also saw some reddit posts of servers getting paid 50 dollars or 70 dollars an hour which is 90000 dollars an year if you work 6 hours for 300 days an year. And it is as much money as a fresh new Cs graduate makes.

For all those who will attack me saying that servers don't get minimum wage. Many surveys have been conducted between servers and they actually do not want a fair wage for their work and would like to stick with the tip model so don't come at me with the victim mentality please.
Also I believe the other kitchen staff deserves the tips for actually creating my food instead of entitled servers who just bring it."

&#x200B;

Below are my responses for problems ""Population decline is bad"" supporters brings forward for declining population.

&#x200B;

Q. There would be lesser young people to support for the poor. 

 A. Isn't the whole point of technological improvement to produce more by using lesser and lesser amount of human labour, or 1 man producing for multiple people? In 200 years of scientific and technological progress do we still need two kids two support two parents?

&#x200B;

Q. Tax Payer will reduce increasing the burden on existing tex payers.

A. Taxes or more specifically Money doesn't run the economy, it is a facilitator for economy you don't need to eat money you need resources like food, in the USA less than 2% of people are involved in agriculture that means 1 person works enough to feed 50 people. Similarly you can check for any of the basic necessity how many persons one working person can harvest/serve for different resources.  

&#x200B;

Q. There would be lesser persons for science and development.

A. How many persons currently working for it? How many actually does anything useful? Ask any serious researcher the think they lack is funds not brain powers. The Random Geniuses that does the breakthroughs comes randomly throughout the history of mankind even when population is 100 million or when it is 8 Billion. R&D is not a factory where more labour equals more production.

&#x200B;

Q.  It is a bad thing because Ultra rich wants all the people to die.

A. Do you really thing the Billionaires want people to die?  What will they do with all the resources when there is no one below there feet to squash and feel powerful? Again money doesn't do shit in itself, it is a tool do dominate and feel good for yourself. You probably are richer than an medieval king, would you rather be yourself or a medieval king? or better let me send you to a planet with everything you could imagine right at your hand but no one else what will you do with all those resources?

&#x200B;

Q. Real estate market will Collapse, People will loose their investment if demand fall due to decreasing population.

A. ok so like the houses physically collapse? Does they loose any of their Utility? No? Great people can actually buy them and live in them without the worry of mortgage throughout their life. They Will actually be able to live in bigger and bigger space compared to smaller and smaller Apartments.

&#x200B;

Benefits of a declining Population,

&#x200B;

1. Less consumption of goods --> Lesser Pressure on environment for raw material, Lesser Pollution/Waste Products generated, Lesser greenhouse gases emitted --> Lesser climate change.
2. Less Population --> Lesser Requirement of farmland --> More people can eat organic food, More space for forest and Biodiversity.
3. Most of the modern Service industry is a pyramid where top 1% takes most of the money, the bottom layers does barely Survive.
4. Less People, more demand for them --> There would be more leverage for the working class who actually produces value to negotiate for better salary and not live in fear you could be kicked for any displeasure of the employer to replace with countless standing outside otherwise.
5. Lesser people --> Less layers in Hierarchy Pyramid, less percentage of people to lock down upon the people will Respect each other if they are of equal social standing."

Lets say you have an morbidly obesse fried who eats out of boredom, everytime you go out together and everytime he sees foor he buys and he eats, when he buy something he doesn't like he keep eating it because according to him ""food is food"" but he keep complaining about how wack it tastes while galping it down, hes the type of guy who would eat deep fried apple pie because again ""food is food"", would you say that this friend of yours has a good relationship with food? Absolutely fucking not, this is exactly how i view People with high body counts both men and women, having a big body count reveals a lot of things about you, firstly that you have absolutely no standards, nobody geniunly like 87 fucking people, thats almost 2 whole ass football teams, if you slept with that many people it means that a dude being tall or a chick having big boobs is enough to impress you and let them hit it.

Second thing a body count the size of a phonuber reveals about you is that you are emotionally immature, sex with the right person 100 times is better than sex with 100 strangers, if you constantly need new people to entertain you it just means that you are immature like a little kid who constanly need new toys to keep them from throwing a tumper tantrum, also you seriously didnt click with nobody out of those two fucking footvall teams, you obviously have some underline issues and you cant form a bond with people and you just view them as pleasure toys.

So when you say that you done with sleeping around and try to find someone to commit you you're surprised that your promiscuous past prevents you from finding  serious parner so you start shaming people who care about body count by calling them immature and saying the past is the past, what you dont understand is that the only reason People care about your body count is because it reveals that you're not suitable for being a long time partner because of all the emotional issues i mentioned, you say you changed but people know you're a ticking time bomb and youre eventually gonna ""slip up"" so they dont wanna waste their time fixing your broken ass."

Activitists, whether far left, far right, religious fundamentalist, extreme secularist, whatever, are virtually identical in terms of personality traits and their behaviors. Only their actual beliefs are different. Change my view.",u/wackypoodle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1994rb0/cmv_the_horseshoe_model_of_political_spectrum_is/,changemyview,"Activitists, whether of the far left, the far right, religious fundamentalist, or extreme secularist, whatever they believe, are virtually identical to each other in terms of personality traits (psychopathy, sociopathy, narcissistic personality, lack of human empathy, etc.) and their associated behaviors.

They're all driven by hatred, conflict, self-interest, and conserving the stability and integrity of their narrow social groups and friendship networks. 

This is why, for instance, such groups seem to irreparably splinter often. Dissent is viewed as negative because it damages social integrity of these groups, etc., and dissidents are expelled and sometimes killed as a warning to others.

For example:

All these groups accuse their opponents of hatred (often using highly emotional language and allegations) while using language and actions that are clearly hateful to their targets:

**Far left**:  Claim the right are racist against blacks, Muslims, etc. while being racist against Jews.

**Far right**:  Claim the left are racist against whites, while being racist again blacks, Muslims, Jews, etc.

They're all driven by hatred of different social groups:

**Far left**:  Hate the upper middle and upper classes for being wealthy, which is often an accident of birth.

**Far right**:  Use the poor to advance their agenda, which is a manifestation of contempt for the poor.

Only the actual beliefs these people and their respective groups express are different.

This is often described as the horseshoe of the political spectrum, but I prefer to view it instead as a horseshoe where the heels of the shoe overlap.

In other words, the horseshoe of the political spectrum overly focuses on political beliefs and underplays the personality and behavioral similiarities of the different extremists.

And the extremists are perfectly happy about this reality. They don't actually care what the other side says or does, because whatever their opponents say or do reinforces their own beliefs and friendship networks.

They don't care if the other side is listening to them because they are driven by conflict and the pleasure of being self-satisfied.

As such, if you're an extremist, no matter of what side you are, you have no right to expect freedom of speech. You should be expunged from society and social media.

Seeing these delusional morbidly obese people do mental gymnastics as a coping mechanism for their obesity makes me just want to train even harder.

It's pretty obvious that fat acceptance activists really hate their bodies if they have to go through so much effort to convince themselves and everyone else that they don't, which is an inspiring motivator to avoid getting fat. In fact, I would say fat acceptance advocates are a stronger motivating factor to encourage people to not get fat than fitness advocates are. Similar to how seeing crazy methheads are a motivator for not doing meth. 

The reason I am open to changing my view about this is that part of me thinks that if enough people buy into the bullshit and drink the kool-aid of fat acceptance, this could actually end up making the obesity epidemic worse.

1:) Ukraine is a relatively insignificant country in the scheme of the world. Although large in landmass it was just another Soviet Satellite state which has made the country insignificant and not worth starting a world war over 

2:) Ukraine itself is the most corrupt country in Europe (Yes it received a higher corruption dex than Belarus), and is “semi-democratic” in which corruption is rampant and honestly required to hold a position for long. Zelensky personifies this with his recent attempts to delay the election stating “now is not the time for elections”. Why should America support such a corrupt state who wants protection for nothing in return.

3:) the war is likely to go on for years, which would drain the US economies assets that would be better spent elsewhere such as in American healthcare/infrastructure. I don’t want my taxpayer money going halfway across the world to be spent in just another war

4:) the US has no moral obligation. Ukraines not part of the EU or NATO (and shouldn’t be). There is no obligation for the US to get involved in another war based on treaties/alliances

1,2024-01-17,"CMV: Millennials are the first ""digital natives""",u/9to5Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/199799q/cmv_millennials_are_the_first_digital_natives/,changemyview,"This was inspired by another post. 

Let me define digital native. Someone who:

1. Cannot remember their first interaction with a personal computer (meaning computers were around them as kids but they don't remember the first time they used one, similar to how one might not remember their first ice cream, or movie)
2. Owned a device with access to the internet as an early teen, or at any age that was ""the norm"" in their community. (This will have some socioeconomic and cultural factors, those don't apply, think: if smartphones are ubiquitous in a community, when do most parents let their kids have one) (Note: it's important that the individual themselves ""owned"" the device, it was not the family computer)
3. Participated in social media, internet chatrooms, and online gaming as early teens. 

Computers just started to show up in homes in the 1980s, and not at all widespread. Very few children in the 80s would've had their own computer.

Dial up became popular in the 90s, which is when accessing the internet at home became feasible for most people. Because of this, anyone born before 1981 (a common beginning year for millennials) would've been getting into their early teens just as ubiquitous internet was taking off (and that's for the youngest of Gen X). The iPhone was released in 2007, no Gen Xer would've been a child at this time. 

Friendster, often thought of as the first social network, was launched in 2002. Gen X was graduating from college. 

While there have been incredible breakthroughs since personal computing, the internet, and social media since the events I've cited here, I don't think there's been anything so revolutionary between millennials or Gen Z. (This isn't the point of my post, but feel free to share with me what revolutionary technologies that are of the same caliber as the internet and personal computing that has been developed since 2007) 

The real divide from a technology perspective is here: before and after home computing with access to internet. The millennial generation is the first to grow up with these technologies as if they're sewn into the fabric of the world, part of everyone's day to day.

1,2024-01-17,CMV: There is no such thing as a valid moral claim.,u/lolosity_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19989w3/cmv_there_is_no_such_thing_as_a_valid_moral_claim/,changemyview,"Firstly, I would like to outline what specifically my view is.

 I believe that the universe is nothing more than energy moving through spacetime being acted upon by the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces (plus some other stuff we haven't discovered yet but I digress). Consequently, one cannot make a logically valid moral claim. I define a moral claim as being a statement that says one ought to or should do something without giving a specified goal.

""One ought not to kill in order to stay out of prison"" is an example of an ought statement with a specified goal and therefore in my view, logically valid.

""One ought not to kill"" does not have a specified goal and is therefore not logically valid.

I think the closest one-word description of my view would be ""emotivism"" meaning I see any ought claim to just be an expression of one's like or dislike for a given event. This may just sound like an argument from incredulity but I simply don't see how an ought can be derived from an is.

Secondly, I'd like to quickly address a couple of common rebuttals to my argument.

There's the theological position that claims god to be the arbiter of morality. Why is god the arbiter of morality? Some may say that god knows of a sort of universal moral truth that humanity is unaware of, this doesn't hold up for me either. My main objection is that there is no evidence for this, even if we look at scripture. This also contradicts the idea of god's omnipotence and is in contradiction of the ""can't derive an is from an ought"" principle and creates a paradox of sorts.

There is also the utilitarian position that even if there is no universal moral truth, we can come to an agreement on what we ought to do. This agreement is said to be based on the common desire for the maximisation of pleasure and the minimisation of pain and that if everyone agrees that one thing is best, then it is incorrect to act otherwise as even you agree that that course of action is best. My issue with this is that people do not desire the maximisation of pleasure of all, just the maximisation of their own pleasure and this argument conflates the two.

This is my honest understanding of both arguments so if I've got anything wrong please correct me!

I'm looking for someone to either demonstrate that there is a flaw in my view, provide a more convincing version of the counterarguments I have described, or provide a completely different counterexample."

I just couldn’t understand why people connected so much with creatures that can’t really comprehend them. As I grew up,  I learnt that this actually is part of the appeal, but I still don’t like animals for a myriad of reasons like unpredictability, allergies, hygiene and more. 

When I brought this up to friends, they all seemed genuinely confused. Like they didn’t understand why I didn’t like animals. I brought up the reasons previously stated and they all came back with “oh but they are so cute and harmless” when I don’t feel that way. I would never hurt an animal even if I don’t like them but I’ve seen opinions that people who dislike animals are “red flags” and I just think that’s entirely untrue."
1,2024-01-17,"CMV: Disney is not losing money over being ""woke""",u/Enbie-or-Trans,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1999c5f/cmv_disney_is_not_losing_money_over_being_woke/,changemyview,"A common notion I've seen from people (almost entirely conservatives) is that Disney is starting to do badly over ""woke"" content in it's movies. I am a progressive so there's an understandable bias on both sides, but I do feel I'm less biased and emotionally invested in this idea. I have little emotional investment in Disney and I acknowledge right wing money is a lot more plentiful and influential than left wing money.  
  
I'm not a Disney fan myself so I haven't watched much from Disney recently. The last Disney thing I did was go to Disneyland Tokyo with right wing family members.  
  
I don't perceive Disney as progressive at all. Pretty much every progressive person I know who isn't an animator hates Disney, and have hated Disney long before any right ring backlash against Disney.  
  
My perception is the MCU is too complicated for people to catch up with. That's the main reason I never watched any MCU movie aside from Guardians of the Galaxy and 2008 Iron man. Disney also quite possibly has issues of attempting to appeal to everyone and appealing to nobody, but I'm not sure about that over my lack of knowledge.  
  
I have never seen anything to particularly suggest Disney has progressive messaging in its media. The only political messages I've heard of are the really generic non-message of Black Panther and the genocide defending message of live action Mulan. I guess a bit more for their small cartoons like Owl House, but I don't see anyone suggesting Owl House had any impact on Disney's revenue.

I know I will never understand their condition fully, but from what I know, all they experience in life is pain, so how can they equate that pain with suffering if they have never experienced any joy or any real life really. 

They are alive, but are they conscious? They just exist in a cubicle surrounded by other animals, so how can they be sad about their life? They will never cry over the free life they couldn't live. They just live...to die...without thinking about anything.

Their pain in turn brings meat to billions of people, which would feel bad about starving.

The only main issue I have with this is the huge methane emissions especially from cows which affect the entire planet, threatening all life. But other animals such as chickens don't have this problem. 

So please, change my view. I know I should feel something about the mass killing of factory animals, but my mind doesn't let me."
0,2024-01-17,CMV: There is nothing abnormal or unnatural about grown men (or women) being attracted by teenagers,u/Petite_Curious,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/199ac9v/cmv_there_is_nothing_abnormal_or_unnatural_about/,changemyview,"Before exposing my point I first need to state something clear : I am AGAINST adult people having romantic or sexual relationships with teenagers. When I say adult I'm not talking about some 19 or 20yo with a 17yo, I'm talking about grown adults like 25+ with people under 18. 

That being said, I can now explain my view on the subject. 

For millions or hundreds of thousands of years, humans reproduced once they were physically capable of doing so. Our hormones and instinct have evolved in a way that we are naturally drown towards people who are able to reproduce, no matter what age they are. In the history of humankind, the concepts of ""underage"" or of ""majority age"" are extremely new and humans were pretty much never forbidden to have sex based on age. Criterias like being physically able to bear a child or endure sexual activity may have played a role in the past but that's about it, and again, in the history of all humanity that's very recent.

The purpose of all living beings is to reproduce. Humans are able to fulfill that purpose once they reach puberty, which approximately starts between 9 and 13 if I'm not wrong. Once our hormones start to kick in, we naturally start being sexually aroused and physically attracted by other humans because of the will to reproduce. That is a very primary instinct that isn't based on age, so as gross as it may be, a 35yo that feels sexually attracted to a 14yo is just the ""victim"" of millions of years of evolution and the strong instinct of all living beings to reproduce. There is no distinction for our primary instinct that just wants to reproduce between a 15yo and a 25yo as they are both of pubescent age and capable of creating life. 

I am in no way talking about prebuscent children but only teenagers that reached puberty. 

Now, should people in the 21st century act upon these feelings with all the knowledge that we have today ? Obviously not, but I just wanted to state that these feelings are natural and part of being humans. Obviously humans are not like animals so we are able to control our urges and come to sense with what is good and what is not based on knowledge and intelligence, but we still have our heritage from millions of years with us. That heritage is our primitive instinct trying to preserve the survival of our species, and as disgusting as it may sound, that instinct doesn't distinguish between a 12yo and a 20yo.

I may change my view though, that's why I want to read what your thoughts are about the subject."

For instance, on topics of gender, I believe 99% of men and women would concede agreement on most things. Most men would agree that, yes, women are at a physical disadvantage because periods suck, childbirth sucks, women are weaker and likelier to be preyed upon, etc. - and most women would agree that men have a tougher time in dating, are likelier to be judged for being too short, face greater pressure to earn more, etc.

On topics of race, I believe 99% of people - of all races - would agree that yes, racism exists, but also agree that a lot of minorities' problems are self-inflicted, that affirmative action does in fact prop up certain categories of people at the expense of others, that white privilege is indeed a thing, etc.

On the topic of religion, I believe 99% of religious people and atheists would concede that, yes, the other side does have some points, such as the fact that if God exists, His existence is sure pretty invisible, almost like Him not being there at all, and that the Bible is indeed a book ripe for misquoting and misuse, etc. 

On the topic of politics, I believe that 99% of voters would agree - honestly - that yes, such-and-such a political party has this flaw and the other party has that flaw - if they could only set aside their biases and be honest.

I could go on and on - if I really were to expound on this, then this list would be 10,000 items long. But my point is - **nearly all of us agree, deep down, on nearly all things. It's just that we're too proud to admit it in public.**"

For instance, people who with mental health issues are vulnerable to abusive situations and partners who can easily take advantage of us to their liking. I've experienced and seen what this lack of discernment and healthy boundaries can cause. It can make it so we end in an abusive cycle with a narcissist who preys upon the victim's inability to fend for themselves, as their trauma and illness makes it easier to manipulate them and harder for them to leave the situation. Now, from the partner's perspective, a lot of people with trauma can end up becoming abusive towards their partner and not even realize until it's too late. If you’re not aware of your toxic tendencies you can easily become the abuser and cause havoc in your relationship. Mental health is not an excuse to be toxic towards others, specially your loved ones. So, I believe that unless you’re healthy or are have healed considerably your traumas and toxic behaviors, you should NOT be dating. "

Don’t get me wrong, i don’t mean to sound rude and I don’t mean this to start fights and I realize it can be a little more complicated for some of you (kids, spouse who want to watch things on different services and maybe without ads and on different screens, etc.), but I feel like one of the more popular things for people to do these days is complaining about the quantity of streaming services as if you have no choice but to keep paying for them.  

Even if you have kids or a spouse demanding to watch a particular show or movie on a streaming service, just unsubscribe from the one you currently pay for and make the next month your kid’s/spouse’s streaming service of choice so they can choose the shows they want to watch and on which streaming service.

Wealth inequality is at an all time high and there’s a significant amount of people today who are extremely angry and hopeless and easily radicalized.

I think this scenario revolves around the 2024 election. Why the election? A poll recently came out saying that a majority of Iowa Republican voters believe the 2020 elected from rigged. When people lose face in the election system, they might turn to alternative means of getting their candidate in power, as they already tried in 2021 with Jan 6.

I think Republican congressmen and states will refuse to accept the results of the election and stage a much more violent and extreme version of January 6, this will cause the country to split and chaos to ensue. If part of the military defects then it’ll be a full blown war. If not, then things could still get pretty violent in an insurgency. I don’t see any indication of this not happening since they refused to condemn the events of January 6 and have been continually escalating the rhetoric. 

Possible counter arguments I’ll address here:

-People are too comfortable - yes, most people are happy to be on their new iPhones and so on, but there’s a non-insignificant part of the population that is extremely angry and on the edge, it doesn’t take a huge group to cause chaos. There doesn’t need to be a huge economic downturn for this to occur, there wasn’t a huge recession before the U.S. civil war from 1860.

-There isn’t a clear geographic split like in 1860, right and left are mixed together. While this is true, there are still geographic divisions today. And even in 1860, a lot of people either wanted nothing to do with the war or actively sympathized with the other side, like copperheads. 

Again, I really hope this doesn’t happen and I hope you’ll convince me that I shouldn’t worry about this."

Disclaimer: I'm only talking about farm animals/animal agriculture as a whole(not just factory farming). I definitely think veganism can help lab animals and fur animals or any non farm animal industry.  
  
The reason why I say this is because the only way to get rid of animal agriculture is if people stop buying it because banning things don't work. However most people will continue to eat animal products because they don't care/can't control themselves. Not only that factory farming is a big industry and it's going to be really hard to put them out of business.  
  
Also most people who go vegan don't stay vegan. I know most of you guys are going to say ""but that's because they did it wrong"" but if they do it right ex vegans will always be a thing and since nobody knows what a correct vegan diet it than how do you expect people to do it right? Also it's hard to be vegan or any other non SAD diet in a society that follows the SAD diet. All I hear from the vegan movement is that veganism is safe and that a majority of population can be vegan as long as we educate them everything will be fine. No amount of education will prevent ex vegans they will either fall victim to societal pressure or get some type of health problem because they didn't eat properly.  
  
Another problem is that all the vegan junk food/lab grown meat is too expensive. It cost $9 for a piece of lab grown chicken, and plant based chicken cost $5 while regular chicken can cost $1. Who is going to pay extra money for protein when they can get it for $1. Before you say Wh@t aB0uT wH0Le f00D Pl@Nt B@5eD? WHOLE FOOD PLANT BASED IS NOT ENOUGH people want stuff that tastes like meat/has all the nutrients that meat has but they can't because it's too expensive. NOBODY WANTS TO LIVE OFF OF BEANS AND RICE. Also vegan junk food isn't bad for you if you eat it sometimes because there is iron, protein and B12 in it.  
  
Look I understand that we are having a crisis and veganism(or any plant favored diet) is necessary for help farm animals but it's never going to happen. Let's face it farm animal exploitation will never stop and the only thing we could do for them is to donate to animal charities and have more animal protection laws but those can only do so much."

1,2024-01-17,CMV: The ideal fertility rate is replacement level (2 children per woman),u/Radical_Libertarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/199havi/cmv_the_ideal_fertility_rate_is_replacement_level/,changemyview,"**Note that it’s perfectly possible for some women to have lots of children and others to be childless, and yet the overall fertility rate averages out to 2 children per woman. It’s not necessary for everyone to have an exact, specific number of children.**

That disclaimer said, I believe that replacement level fertility is the most ideal for a healthy population.

When fertility is below replacement, you have issues with an ageing population, which causes serious economic problems, as there is too high a ratio of retirees to workers.

But when fertility is above replacement, you can end up with a “youth bulge”, which is a strong risk factor for violence and instability. Pretty much all failed states today have large youth bulges.

Having the fertility rate at replacement level is the best outcome, because the population is stable indefinitely, neither growing nor shrinking, and the age structure is balanced, not too young or too old.

However, I don’t believe that governments can, or should, aim for a specific fertility rate. The only developed country with above replacement fertility is Israel, and this is the result of culture, not any pro-natalist policies, so I think fertility is not the role of the state.

In order to achieve replacement level fertility, there needs to be a cultural consensus that replacement level fertility is in fact the ideal fertility rate.

Right now in most developed countries, there is a cultural mistake to blame environmental issues caused by capitalism on “overpopulation”, when in reality we are harming the ecosystem regardless of our numbers, because of the corporate capture and lobbying in politics.

If someone can convince me that a higher or lower fertility rate is better, I’ll give you a delta. If someone can convince me that the fertility rate doesn’t matter at all, then I’ll give you a delta."

And the responses people offer are varied, particularly with people who said they aren't religious. Christians and muslims tend to have the exact same answer no matter what which is essentially ""god forbids it and we would be damned to hell."" 

Now the way I see it, every human \*needs\* a reason to live. Something that keeps them going. And this is where I think Christianity and Islam get it perfect because god is said to be infinite along with his punishment. So when a human being accepts god into their heart, an entity that always is, they can be rest assured knowing they will NEVER run out of hope. They are also fearful of his wrath if they disobey this one command god has. 

With secular people however, it seems like their reasons for not just giving up and calling it quits on life comes down to one thing that they like the most. It could be their kid, their pet, their friends, their curiosity to explore the world, video games, etc etc etc. But these reasons are all finite and so it gets me thinking... if one of these things that give secular people their reason for living vanishes, which they all do, does that mean they've lost their will to live? Do they have to find something else or do they feel empty for the remainder of their lives? 

I hope my opinion makes sense."

Are you comparing humans to chocolates? This whole analogy groups men as mere objects, and assumes we should treat them such. Here’s a reflection swap men with black people (i have to bring them up because it’s the only way for these double standard hypocrites to open their eyes) “it’s not ALL black people but always one in a crime! look at the pet capita crime statistics in America, of course statistics can justify my prejudice!”

And do yourself a favour im no talking about hate here NOT feelings of anger and frustration. It’s obviously fine to have feelings to frustration n due to past experiences but there’s a complete difference in hate and criticism.

1,2024-01-18,CMV: Religion increases psychosis.,u/One-Percentage-8946,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/199mxhh/cmv_religion_increases_psychosis/,changemyview,"My working definition of psychosis is a condition of the mind in which determining what is real and not real is difficult.

In this argument I’m defining “real” as a societal narrative with the most evidence.

Insofar as religion involves faith, definitionally, it increases the chance of psychosis.  Here is my argument:

Faith refers to the a line of thinking in which your conviction in something is higher than your evidence for something.  If we classify conviction and evidence with three levels, low/middle/high, we would say faith means having high conviction and low/middle evidence (or middle conviction and low evidence).

However, outside of religious contexts, it would be considered unjustified if your conviction in something and level of evidence for something were not in sync.  Low evidence means low conviction, middle evidence middle conviction, etc.  If someone strongly believed in Big Foot or that Drug A causes Bad Symptoms X,Y, and Z, we would require a strong level of evidence to match the conviction.  A strong belief with weak evidence would not be justified.  However, faith discourages the need for evidence because it allows for the presence of higher conviction despite lower evidence.

Teaching people that it is okay to have faith—to have a higher conviction in something despite a lower level of evidence—harms people’s ability to correctly asses the world around them.  It encourages this out-of-sync relationship between our inner world (conviction) and the external world (evidence).   

Succinctly, if reality is a narrative with the most evidence, and faith discourages the need for evidence, how can the faithful tell what is real?"

I am not really a fan of victimizing myself or my gender so I am genuinely open to have my view changed on this.

I'll keep my post short and just mention the aspects of relationships where I think women have it worse :

1. Reproductive coercion : Women face pressures or coercion related to reproductive choices, impacting their autonomy in family planning.
2. Menstrual stigma : Societal taboos around menstruation can contribute to shame and discomfort for women in relationships. There is almost no stigma around men having random boners.
3. Pregnancy challenges : Women sacrifice way more than men. Their body, their career (for a while), their mental health. Plus, they are the most vulnerable in the relationship : their partner could decide to leave them at anytime and they'd have to deal with the pregnancy alone. Not to mention women get attached (both literally and figuratively) to their babies from the start while men need more time to get attached, it's easier for men to leave.
4. Postpartum challenges : The physical and emotional toll of childbirth, coupled with societal expectations, create unique challenges for women after giving birth.
5. Body image : Women and men both face body expectations but women have the highest number of hindrances : premenstrual symptoms, hormones, pregnancy body. It all impact their self-confidence in relationships, making them vulnerable.
6. Unequal parenting and house-keeping expectations.
7. Sexual objectification : Women experience more objectification, leading to a focus on physical attributes rather than personal qualities in relationships.
8. Menopause stigma : Menopause is often seen as something bad and that affects women's self-esteem. People see it as a something that decrease a woman ""value"" and it affects women's well-being in relationships.
9. Age-related pressures : Women encounter societal expectations and stereotypes related to age, affecting their sense of self-worth in relationships.
10. Pressure to prioritize relationship over career.
11. Marriage pressure.
12. Judgment for singlehood.

I am a pretty avid fan, and love the mascot Orbit. Orbit is a certified G. Whilst the ex and I are not together (baseball had nothing to do with it), it does not mean that I should not switch teams.

342,2024-01-18,CMV: The Ontario Courts made the right decision in regards to Jordan Peterson,u/joalr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/199rvhl/cmv_the_ontario_courts_made_the_right_decision_in/,changemyview,"So just a note, I am not interested in making any sort of rule violation against rule B of this subreddit, nor am I looking to provoke others into making arguments on this topic.  While Peterson's personal views may be strongly associated with violations to rule B, and those views may have some relevance to this topic, the validity of his views are not relevant and need not be debated.  

For anyone who is unaware, Jordan Peterson was determined by the Ontario College of Psychologists to be in violation of the ethical code of conduct set out by Canadian Psychology Association.  These violations are in relation to statements he's made in public, including social media and public appearences and so, as a consequence, determined he must take coaching on social media communication.  

Jordan Peterson filed for judicial review, and the courts ruled in favour of the OCP, unanimously.  Peterson appealed, and has lost that appeal. 

You can read the initial court conclusions [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23924637-peterson-v-college-of-psychologists-of-ontario-_-superior-court-of-justice),  as the appeals court gave no reasoning.

There are a lot of people who are viewing this as a violation of his rights to free speech and see it as a specific attack on his views.  Again, ignoring the legitimacy of his views, I think the court decision is absolutely correct, and his ""punishment"" is beyond fair.  

First off, while Peterson is allowed to hold any view he likes, if he wishes to maintain association with the Ontario College of Psychologists, which is what a license indicates.  If he does not wish to maintain himself to the standards of the OCP, he can become a councellor without a license and practice by his own set of standards.  If he wants to maintain his license, and use it to lend himself credibility, he must live up to the standards set out by the OCP.  

Beyond that, he isn't even being punished for his views, but the manner in which he carries out his message.  The actual code of ethics violation is the very first rule of the Ethical Standards, section 2, as follows:

>Not engage publicly (e.g., in public statements, presentations, research reports, with primary clients or other contacts) in degrading comments about others, including demeaning jokes based on such characteristics as culture, nationality, ethnicity, colour, race, religion, sex, gender, or sexual orientation.

and as the court ruling points out, he has engaged in degredation of specific people on numerous accounts.

These includes jokes around suicide, referring to a city councellor as a “appalling self-righteous moralizing thing”, calling Eliot Page's physicaian a criminal, etc etc.  

Whether or not the underlying opinions Peterson has are valid opinions to hold, these sorts of statements are obviously violations to the code of conduct written above.

The OCP is well within their rights to maintain these standards, and ask anyone practice to hold to them.  

Further, there is a higher level of standard expected of Peterson if he wishes to use his accrediation to give himself credibility.  The court notes that Peterson changed the way in which he used his label, stating in 2020 that he ""opted not to advertise his title on his Twitter"".  By identifying himself as a ""clinical psychologist"", which did in 2022 on twitter, he is using his association to the OCP formally, and in doing so, their credibility as an organization is *also* being invoked. 

The courts determined that the OCP has every right to set their own standards and adhere to them.  While asking him to refrain his language could be an infringement on free expression if he were being arrested or fined by the government, this is an example of an organization creating their standards, and resting their association on those standards.  There is no obligation for any organization to maintain associiation and approval, even in a society with free expression."

I understand they come from Japan and follow a 5-7-5 syllable pattern. I couldn't understand how this could be considered poetry. Every haiku I've heard in English I have to parse out the syllables to make sure it follows the structure, and I've always thought of a neat novelty to follow the conventions, but it never had the feeling of poetry. 

I think the reason is because in Japanese *all syllables are the same length and strength*. It doesn't have the variations in syllables like English has. This means you could much more easily hear a ""beated out"" pattern of speech following 5-7-5 in Japanese than you could in English. 

I suppose a case could be made that if you formed a haiku in English using only words of the same syllable length, it would sound similar to a Japanese haiku, but I think it's just fundamentally foreign to the English language to the point where English can't form poetic sounding haikus."

I think a points and skill based system is the most ideal with some component of family reunification.

My argument is that having a significant minority (5-10% +) be Muslims is dangerous. The reason for this is multi-folded.

1. Muslims and the Islamic world is anti-western and particularly anti-American. Letting people in that actively despise you is very questionable and will only lead to a resentful population. The Islamic world always has enough resentful (real and imagined).

2. Europe shows that high levels of Muslim immigration is generally a net negative. British Pakistanis are a good example of this; the population is generally poorer, less educated, radicalized, welfare dependent and hostile. 

Pakistani grooming gangs are a notable example: 

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/quilliam-grooming-gangs-report-asian-abuse-rotherham-rochdale-newcastle-a8101941.html

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal

France is the European country with the highest portion of Muslim immigrants and many terror attacks including the recent Crepol stabbing attack shows that French Muslims are resentful and refuse to immigrate.

Sweden is another case where high level of Muslim
Immigration has led to formation of gangs and gang violence 

https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swedish-pm-says-integration-immigrants-has-failed-fueled-gang-crime-2022-04-28/

3. Focus should be on groups of people that integrate well and will contribute. Indian immigration  to the US, Canada and UK has been a massive success with many in these groups becoming very wealthy and contributing massively to respective societies.  
Nigerian Christian immigration has also been a success to the US. 


In the end: morally, economically and socially it doesn’t benefit western countries to have a large Muslim population that will be resentful, criminal, and prone to violence. 

That doesn’t mean that the west should be xenophobic, it should prioritize those that will integrate, embrace liberal and universal values and contribute positively to society. That is being reasonable."

Everytime i questioned people, it always came down to ignoring red flags. I also noticed, alot of people will marry the person in their head not their beds. Meaning, they have a different perception of the person even though the person never was like that. So they end up placing expectations on who the person is, when they never was like that.  Its like your romanticizing the person instead of accepting for who they are. Its like marrying a turtle thinking he can fly, then years later realize, he cant fly and get mad and say he switched up.

First, we must differentiate between options and will. 

Yes, everyone has pathes to choose from every single time they make a decision.

However, options are not reflective of free will.

This is because every single choice we make, how we process the world and what is in front of us, is influenced by everything that happened earlier.

This includes events that shaped our understanding of the world, but goes even deeper. We are who we are as a combination of nature and nurture. 

So how we decide and who we are, depends also on our genetics. Therefore, if your parents decided to have sex an hour layer, a different sperm would likely win the race (sperm cells are constantly dying and being replaced). 

This would give you a different genetic predisposition and you would automatically perceive the world differently. And you can say the same for every single event that happened before our birth. All of it had an effect on what finally became us.

So then, how could the local bum make the same choice as Cindy Lou from across the street? Will the thought even come to him? 

We have no free will, because we are limited and therefore so is our will.

We decide what we decide because we cannot decide differently.

Even if we decide to change to be better, that was not a free will choice, merely the product of whatever happened to you combined with your genetic predisposition."

I’d always been curious about Key West, since I know a lot of people who’ve been and I’ve never really been sure what to expect about it, though I’m a big fan of key lime pie. I recently had the opportunity to spend two nights in Key West, and found out what it was all about. I have to admit I’m fairly disappointed after the visit and feel like it’s kind of a place with the worst of New Orleans and the Caribbean, and not much redeeming.

It’s the worst of New Orleans in that Duval Street is a pretty clear lesser knockoff of Bourbon Street. Bourbon Street has a shitload of bars, clubs, etc., and is a gateway to the rest of the French Quarter. The street also has an energy and character about it, bodily fluids running down it and all. Duval Street has a handful of bars, a lot of tourist traps shops, and there isn’t much around it except for residential neighborhoods. The food also wasn’t anything close to on par with New Orleans or other cuisine tourist spots.

It’s the worst of the Caribbean in that it’s not really in the Caribbean, but it’s so far south that it prides itself on being tropical and the image it conjures is margaritas in the sand. In reality, almost no hotels/resorts are actually beachfront, and there aren’t many major beaches that you see driving around. Most hotels aren’t that distinguishable from any other hotel in a tourist destination, when a Caribbean resort is almost guaranteed to be on the beach, with a sprawling property with pools, restaurants, etc. I’m also a diver, and did a few dives while there. Key West sells itself as a diving destination up there with the premiere Caribbean diving spots (the Caymans, Bonaire, Cozumel, etc.), but that’s not the experience I had diving. The water was certainly colder than the Caribbean at the same time of year, the visibility was a lot worse, the currents were stronger than your typical Caribbean dive site, and I didn’t come out of the water impressed much by what I’d seen.

Help me find some positives about Key West, a way it’s not just a shitty Wish.com version of New Orleans crossed with the Caribbean, and something to go back for?"
1,2024-01-18,CMV: a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for genocide,u/dubious_unicorn,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/199yzwr/cmv_a_vote_for_joe_biden_is_a_vote_for_genocide/,changemyview,"I can't get the thought out of my head that a vote for Biden is a vote for genocide. I voted for him in 2020. He wasn't someone I was excited about, but Trump was actively working to destroy rights that are important to me and people I care about, so I went out and voted for Biden, and I was happy that he won.

But I don't know if I can do it again. Not because Biden hasn't delivered on his promises to forgive $10,000 of student debt or to make Roe ""the law of the land"" or to protect trans people. I'm disappointed about all of that. But mostly it's because I am abjectly *horrified* about what is happening in Gaza. A genocide is unfolding and Biden is endorsing it. He's funding it. He's bombing Yemen about it.

How can I live with myself if I cast a vote for someone who is supporting and funding a literal genocide? I'm really hoping somebody can help me with this, because I feel like I'm between a rock and a hard place. I don't want Trump to win. I'm queer and I have a uterus, so it's not in my own self-interest to vote for him, and that isn't what my CMV is about. But I don't think my conscience will allow me to cast a vote for genocide, either. I often justify my vote as ""harm reduction"" when I'm not thrilled about the Democratic candidate, but I really don't think I can make that argument in 2024. A LOT of harm is being done, and I don't think my conscience will allow me to endorse it with my vote. Can you change my view?"

127,2024-01-18,CMV: I don’t think a totalitarian regime can be enforced in the United States as it is in this point in time.,u/HungHeadsEmptyHearts,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/199zdti/cmv_i_dont_think_a_totalitarian_regime_can_be/,changemyview,"It’s a pretty common point of conversation in my social circle (we’re all liberals on the West Coast, but we have pretty diverse views in general). To preface, none of us are arguing that it absolutely cannot happen, but I’m not convinced that it can be enforced. I think that, even if, say, Jan 6 went differently, the United States wouldn’t become a dictatorship. 

I’m also not a polisci major, nor that involved in politics. Here is my reasoning, please educate me, show me why I should be more concerned:

1. “The constitution, without people agreeing to follow it, is meaningless. If the government decides to stop following it, nothing is stopping them.” Sure. But the same goes for an insurrection. An insurrection, without a body to support it, is baseless.

2. “It’s happened in history. All it requires is a small group of loyalists.” Maybe in the 19th century. People often cite Germany as an example. Few issues with this:

The same Germany that was going through the worst period of instability in its entire history? With a disarmed military and no economy? The US is not comparable.

We have the Internet. Everything is immediately accessible to the entire world with a tap. An insurrection would make national news instantly, and would appear on Reddit likely even before then. That’s a massive game-changer. People are informed. Information is everything.

There are states in the US larger than the entirety of Germany (and most totalitarian regimes for that matter). There are 50 states in total. The US is massive. How will your localized coup in DC affect people in LA?

3. “They can declare martial law and deploy the military.” This one is anecdotal for me. I am a servicemember. I’ve worked in a joint environment and a lot of airmen, seamen, Soldiers and marines for a little while now. People forget that there are people behind the uniform. The bulk of the force is below the age of 30. How are the same people who are by and large liberal-leaning or moderate going to shoot at Americans for a politician they, by and large, agree is useless at best? There are a few proud boys and tankies who slipped through the cracks, and a few people who just wanna see everything burn. But is that a good representation of the average servicemember? Absolutely not.

But hypothetically, say that a few infantry battalions here and there, somehow without falling apart and losing most of their people, join the insurrectionists. With what logistic support? The US military is an incredibly complex machine with a million tiny moving parts. It’s held together by gorilla glue and duct tape, which works maybe 70% of the time when everyone does their job. If someone doesn’t? Watch what happens. Who will pay them? Who will process the payments? All those benefits? Food and ammunition? You can’t use the military if you can’t compensate them, and if you’re going to make them shoot at Americans, you’d better offer a damn good alternative to the good deal we’re getting now.


That’s really it. Say Trump decides to be the next Hitler. With whose support? The Proud Boys? Lol. Across 50 states? People don’t realize what a massive logistical task that is. You really think a group of rednecks with ARs can accomplish that? You think most of those guys will get off their couch when the day comes? How many will turn tail the second they come face to face with a pissed off National Guard? They’re dollar tree revolutionaries with delusions of grandeur. They couldn’t even occupy a building for one day. That’s his master plan? That’s the best he can do?

I’m not convinced, but I’m not college-educated. I’m open to seeing why I’m wrong, and why I should be more worried about this guy. Because right now, he just looks like a toddler desperately flailing its arms for attention, not the Saddam Hussein of America."

I love FDS because this is where women stop virtue signaling and get REAL about dating and life. Is some of the content, “toxic?” Maybe, but you can’t deny that life is full of toxicities and at the very least they should be discussed.

The above post has testimonies from 25-50 women discussing how they used to purposely date uglier men under the presumption that handsome men are not trustworthy and less aesthetically fortunate men will treat them better.

However, most ppl will tell you that personality trumps looks at the end of the day, right?

So if personality is what matters, why do ppl apply  racial preferences to their dating life, if looks don’t matter that much?

Reddit is full of fear mongers pushing to have children with non-POC men so that their children will fit in better; is that not a characteristic of a “bad,” personality? 

Seems like an idiot judging skin color to me. Skin color is not a personality trait, but a big part in how a person looks. 

How can you have a racial preference yet be seeking a, “good,” personality? That’s because personality searching is a defense mechanism, as shown in the FDS post above. 

Ppl with low self-esteem want to prop up ppl with the same skin color thinking that their child will have an easier time in school and so that they’ll have an easier life in dating, etc. 

Proportional and symmetrical features are what’s attractive, and the goalposts are constantly moved when ppl of color fit the bill. Ppl are afraid to be openly attracted to the “opposite,” skin color."

I try to include everyone into my circle and am one of the last people to be unkind. I have a hard time even telling people off. I’m especially an advocate for those with autism (specifically the kind formerly known as “Asperger’s syndrome.” They are some of the smartest, coolest, and genuine people you will ever meet. And the way they’re treated, especially in their younger years, is sickening. Same for those with ADHD, OCD (which I myself suffer from, quite awfully might I add), and even Schizophrenia. But the thing all these people have in common is that they, for the most part, just don’t fit it in our current, heavily micromanagerial society. I guarantee most of the great artists, athletes, thinkers, politicians, leaders, writers and whatnot prior to the 20th century, or at least since Sigmund Freud’s psychological school grabbed a chokehold on humanity, fell under one of, if not a combination of those disorders.

But for some reason, “people” with Down syndrome disgust me. Like they’re so gross and ugly looking it’s physically painful to look at. If I had a child with DS, I really do not know if would truly be able to love it. I would never hurt it or anything, I just…couldn’t love it. But the worst part is, unlike people with autism (at least the milder forms), they can’t do ANYTHING but the simplest of tasks. And it’s fucking infuriating they’re called “differently abled.” No, someone with ADHD is differently abled. Not some March temperature IQ mutant potato that looks like someone put a face on a trash bag."
1,2024-01-18,"CMV: Instead of implementing quotas, society should focus on weeding out overtly racist executives and managers who purposely deny people opportunities because of their race and retraining executives and managers who show bias but don't display overt racism",u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19a02em/cmv_instead_of_implementing_quotas_society_should/,changemyview,"I understand the idea behind quotas. Historically x group was discriminated against so there are fewer of X group in Y area and we should fix that by adding more of X group to Y area. And when looking at it from a group perspective, they make perfect sense. 

I don't like quotas for a couple of reasons. 

First, because it seems like when there's a mismatch between the representation of a group in society- say group A is 24% of the population and group B is 55% of the population- and the representation of a group in say a pool of applicants, the individuals in the group that is underrepresented in the pool have a better chance of getting the job solely because they are part of that underrepresented group. 

Second, Quotas are not addressing the problem, they are countering it. If one group is overwhelmingly represented in a company because there is bias in favor of that group and against other groups and a bunch of managers of another group are added to the pool, the biased managers are still there. When those managers receive an application from somebody who is not part of their preferred group or are deciding who to promote, that bias will influence their decision. 

I think it would be far better to weed out the racism and the overt racists from the company instead and retrain managers who display a particular bias with their decisions (but aren't overtly racist.) The first step would be creating a welcoming company culture. The second step would be giving employees more tools to report racism. The third step- unfortunate but I don't see an alternative- would be analyzing managers hiring and promotion decisions. 

This is not perfect and there would be pitfalls, but at least every individual would have a similar chance of being hired/promoted regardless of their race. But I'm open to hearing other's thoughts and changing my view!"
151,2024-01-18,CMV: people who worry about the cleanliness of a bar of soap are misunderstanding (or ignoring) how soap works,u/AssaultedCracker,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19a06go/cmv_people_who_worry_about_the_cleanliness_of_a/,changemyview,"I've heard people talk about how they always wash their butts hole last, and that it's gross to wash in any different order. Or that it's gross to use another person's bar of soap. I've also heard the claim (from somebody who has been in prison) that any bar of soap that has touched the floor in prison would be discarded and shouldn't be used because a prison shower floor is so disgusting.

I think this is completely misguided. I'm no expert but from my reading on soap, when in contact with dirt and germs, the soap molecules thoroughly surround the dirt/germs and form tiny clusters which prevent them from attaching to anything else. These then just rinse off down the drain. Any grime that remains on a bar of soap after contact with your body, or any other surface, is encapsulated in this soap molecule clusters, and will immediately rinse off after contact with water. In the shower you are constantly being rinsed with water, so there should be no concern about how clean your bar of soap is.

Important note... I could see washcloths or loofahs being a different consideration here, when talking about the order of washing yourself. If you're applying the soap to your dirty body directly using a cloth, then maybe it could collect grime that you wouldn't want to rub on your face. I don't use a washcloth/loofah so this post is entirely focused on the bar of soap itself."

He has friends from school, but rarely sees them after school or on the weekends outside of school. I worry about the long-term effects on his social and emotional development as a person spending so much time online.

I'm in my late 40s, and grew up in a time before smartphones and online communities. In my experience in-person interactions benefited me greatly: getting a deeper understanding of friends through nonverbal cues, a sense of true connection with friends when you're just hanging out, and the opportunity for more meaningful conversations when there are fewer distractions around.

These things seem to be missing in my son's online interactions, which are often limited to in-game discussions about strategy, or even which game to play next, and then lack any in-depth (or even mundane talk) that happens naturally when you spend time together face-to-face. Also, he ends up meeting a variety of online-only friends and those relationships are more fleeting and never get that deep and real. I think spending more time with fewer, but real in person friends would be better for his social development. He'd have more opportunities to learn social skills - listening, empathy, resolving conflicts, social cues, etc.

I advocate for a much more balanced approach, ideally splitting his social time equally between online and offline. We already don't allow him to play games during the weekdays when school is on. And I'd do more to encourage and allow him and his friends to get together in person more."

I'm not saying systemic racism hurts white people more than black people or anything of the sort, I'm saying that if you happen to be white, it is in your enlightened self interest to oppose racism. Here are some examples of the systems of oppression also being bad for white people:

* Mass incareration is extremely expensive. The government spends tens of billions of dollars a year just to make the labor force smaller. Obviously only a fraction of this is black people being imprisoned due to racism, but it is one of the most concrete effects of systemic racism.
* Employment discrimination. Yes, it helps white people get slightly nicer jobs, but, again, there is currently a labor shortage and those costs are just passed to the (majority white) consumers.
* More broadly, the most historically racist parts of the US, the parts which had slavery and the Jim Crow south, are now the poorest parts of the country. Even the white people in these parts of the country are poor. This is circumstantial evidence that over the course of years, oppressing a large fraction of the population just makes everyone worse off."

But behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.

There seems to me that most people these days have no curiosity or patience to try and connect to others in a meaningful way. The biggest reason to interact with others is to be affirmed and seen, but not to see the other persons. All feeling and emotions are shallow and fleeting and built on unrealistic fantasies. 

To fall in love you have to be able to see other people as something other than a product to consume or a source of validation. To love you must be able to focus on someone other than yourself. We are constantly comparing everyone to everyone else and only the best is good enough.

There can be no acceptance of any negative feelings that may come from interacting with flesh and blood humans. The tolerance for any form of miscommunication or ""bad vibe"" is so incredibly low.

All of these shallow attitudes stems from narcissism, and narcissism is increasing in modern Western societies (some calls it an epidemic). We have a culture that promotes self-admiration, self-expression, and self-absorption at the expence of curiosity and intuition. The ego is to strong to accept the loss of control that comes with falling in love. The lack of empathy and the focus on the self make it impossible to build a healthy relationship that might lead to love.

But on a deeper level the fact of the matter is, the well is poisoned between peoples with white skin in America and peoples with black skin. No matter how many times you reference partnership during the Civil Rights Movement, the overall political climate in America is not one where a white person can say to someone black “hey you owe us x because of Y” black people are instantly going bristle at the perceived entitlement of the white person speaking.

This isn’t to say there aren’t Jews of color, Jewish-Black partnerships toward equity and racial justice or even that future collaborations are impossible. I don’t think divides are unbridgeable but they are very real and need to be acknowledged. Speaking of divides, I think progressive leftists and activists in the US need to acknowledge that Jewish patience is wearing thin. And while I’m not trying to speak for all Jews, from what I’ve seen, across the political spectrum, I think a lot of Jewish allies are increasingly disillusioned with the discourse coming from the Left and the perceived double standard applied to them. Take the most recent example where even mildly pro Jewish stances like that of Noah Schnapp, of Stranger Things fame, are rewarded with virulent antisemitism and patronizing “sit down and shut up white boy” talk from black and white activists on twitter and subs like r/fauxmoi. 

The divide is only going to grow and get worse over time the more they refuse to acknowledge it and the more they refuse to acknowledge that antisemitism is growing amongst young blacks and Latinos. October 7th will be a dark watershed moment for American Left and in 5 years they may turn around and wonder where all their Jewish support went.

As the name implies, civil wars are civil conflicts and should preferably be free from foreign intervention, ESPECIALLY direct military force or threats. The US armed and gave aid to the KMT, but that was not the problem. The problem came when the US directly militarily intervened, and even issued nuclear threats to a then non-nuclear country. 

For one, the communists were the vastly more popular and supported side in the Chinese civil war.Heavy taxes, a huge government debt, inflation, unemployment, and food shortages caused many, especially in the cities, to lose faith in the Nationalist government. [More important, few volunteered to join Chiang’s armies. Most soldiers were drafted against their will or even kidnapped by army “recruiting squads.” Soldiers were poorly trained, clothed, and fed. Officers enforced discipline by beating them. Some were roped together on marches to prevent them from deserting.](https://www.crf-usa.org/images/t2t/pdf/WhyDidCommunistsWinChineseRevolution.pdf)

Now moving on to nuclear threats, this shows just how in the wrong and morally corrupt the US was.

[In order to support the continued existence of the Republic of China government, the United States issued several nuclear threats against the People's Republic of China in the 1950s to force the evacuation of outlying islands and the cessation of attacks against Quemoy and Matsu.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_blackmail)

[There was ""no alternative but to conduct nuclear strikes deep into China as far north as Shanghai,"" the document said, paraphrasing General Nathan Twining, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time.](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/us-china-nuclear-strike-taiwan-1958-documents-daniel-ellsberg/)

We are talking about using nuclear weapons on potentially major civilian population centers in a non-nuclear country. How is this any better than what Russia threatened to do, and what the US called Russia out for doing? Why is this fact constantly glossed over when attempting to paint the PRC as the baddies? If anything, this fact alone should paint the US as just as bad as Russia as a threat to world peace. 

Replies to often seen rebuttals:

“But the CCP never controlled Taiwan”

True. The CCP was basically a band of bandits that didnt control ANYTHING period in the beginning. George Washington never controlled the 13 colonies in 1775. The British parliamentarians didnt own an inch of land, so is it the loyalists? The whole point of civil wars/revolutions is that one side probably didnt control much if anything. 

“But it ended 70 years ago”

In fact it did not. There is no treaty not armistice. It is still an ongoing civil war. Taiwan was also still doing incursions into the PRC until the late 80s. This is not to mention both governments claim to be in complete control and the rightful ruler of the other. This is laid out in both constitutions of both governments, where In [the Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan area and the Mainland area](https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=Q0010001), the following is stated:

""Taiwan Area"" refers to Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and any other area under the effective control of the Government. ""Mainland Area"" refers to the territory of the Republic of China outside the Taiwan Area. ""People of the Taiwan Area"" refers to the people who have household registrations in the Taiwan Area. ""People of the Mainland Area"" refers to the people who have household registrations in the Mainland Area. The implication is that wherever this law applies, is what the ROC government considers to be ""territory of the ROC outside of the Taiwan Area"". Currently the application of this law overlaps the entirety of the PRC, minus HK and Macau. 

This makes it seem very much that the matter is still very much a civil issue.

“But the Soviets helped CCP” 

The Soviets never threatened to nuke Nanking. Theres a difference between supplies and direct military intervention. Just look at Ukraine today. 

TLDR: How does the US convince itself and the west it is the good guy while having used military intervention and nuclear threats to continually prop up a vastly unpopular losing party to a civil war they should have had no say in in the first place?"
1,2024-01-18,"CMV: Having Star Wars episodes 7-9 star a woman harms the franchise on several levels, and this is not a misogynistic position.",u/Bubby_Doober,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19a6pcd/cmv_having_star_wars_episodes_79_star_a_woman/,changemyview,"**First of all, Star Wars is a franchise that primarily appeals to boys (and men who were boys who loved the franchise).** It's not essential that a franchise stars a male in order for it to appeal to boys, but it does appear to be essential that the franchise is predominantly about action and adventure to have fans that are primarily boys.

The appeal of a franchise type that has a largely male fanbase is maximized when a boy can play pretend via emulating a male, and look up to becoming the sort of male that the protagonist is. I can look back at playing on the playground, and when it came time to pretend being a Marvel hero no boys would pick being a female character despite having a plethora to choose from. 

I've concluded that having an action franchise star a male maximizes the extent to which a male will engage with the franchise, and thus having a male star maximizes financial engagement. It will sell more male costumes, as women tend to pick pretty or sexy costumes, and it will sell more toys, as male action toys sell better than female ones (and this sentence is ironclad fact as the sales figures have backed this up for decades). It's Rose Tico and even Rey that rots at Ollie's Bargain lot, not Finn or Kylo Ren. It's boys that run around hitting things with toy lightsabers and blasters, not girls. 

I am well aware that someone could dig up statistics that 50% of people who see action/adventure movies in theaters are women, but that's obviously a symptom of the fact that men tend to bring a date to a film. I find it impossible to believe that most Star Wars merch and even home video sales are made by women. To those women reading this who have a room full of Star Wars merch: you are the exception, not the rule. 

**Secondly, the first six Star Wars movies starred a male and thus it changes the trajectory of the story and it's themes by making the main character female. At the surface level Star Wars is about the hero's coming of age journey, which could apply to a woman, but there are inner level analysis to what Star Wars is about, specifically it is about a boy growing to deal with the positive or negative paths of masculinity itself.** Shall the boy choose positive masculinity and gain massive power yet use it only to secure the natural rights of people and protect his loved ones, or should he use his powerful masculine energy to force everyone to bend to his will and do whatever he wants? Essentially that is what ""patriarchy"" is about, having the power of monopolizing force, but violence itself, yet either using it to protect femininity (meaning using force to protect the growth and health of family generation), or using masculine power to destroy femininity (like installing a monolpolistic police state, such as proliferating male clones and killing younglings). You could argue that Rey has masculine powers, because she does, but the important thing about a theme is that it needs to reflect real life, and historically (and contemporaneously) the power and will to exert force is largely wielded by men. Men do not have the option to navigate life via the feminine power of creation, they cannot create babies by themselves, and typically do not pick feminine life paths. Historically men forge lives by brute force; men have predominantly been the laborers and warriors rather than the teachers and homemakers. It literally took tools built by men to equalize the male monopoly on force. If humanity still waged war with swords women couldn't stand a chance as a soldier. (And I should clarify that women should be allowed to take on whatever masculine roles they choose if they are so capable. I am simply illustrating that women typically aren't lining up for those roles).

**Finally, changing the protagonist to a female for the final three chapters of a saga is aesthetically opposed to the first six chapters**. I wouldn't want a Sailor Moon reboot with boys in sailor suits, or a Powerpuff Boys show, an Aliens movie starring a man, or a Hunger Games movie starring a boy. It simply doesn't make for ""aesthetic symmetry"" for lack of a better term. I'm having trouble articulating this point beyond that, the bottom line is that it simply doesn't make sense to me.  It simply doesn't look or feel right, it's like having a row of bookshelves where the last one is a different make and color. I can't actually articulate why the last bookshelf looks wrong, it just does, and I think most people would agree.

P.S. I think having a female protagonist for *Rogue One* or other spin-off movies is much more acceptable, because those movies do not have to live under the same themes, nor do they have to have aesthetic symmetry to six other movies. Also I am well aware of and a fan of Star Wars ""Legends"" protagonists like Mara Jade. There is simply less need for aesthetic symmetry once there are so many entries in the series."

There seems to be a disconnect over how politicians and law and regulation is overall started in the United states. Many people will give a pass to a person who voted for a politican who enacts a bad policy for their state country or city. It all starts origin wise with a vote by the people for a person or proposition to enact a law. 

For example the people in states like Texas and Idaho and other states with complete abortion bans (even the life of the mother is really just on paper) if you are a conservative person who has been voting republican your whole life and saw the extremist pro forced birth laws creep in your state year after year you can't be surprised by your state now post dobbs going full abortion ban. Many will say it's counter productive to do this as it could drive people away from changing their beliefs and voting for another person party or policy. But I believe that confronting someone with that fact that these polices that are enacted are in fact started by a vote. Many people feel that their votes are not causes for bad policy and can divorce their responsibility for their vote for harmful policy. Many ""left wing"" Podcasters claimed this about blaming Trump voters in 2016 by saying you couldn't blame them for voting for him. 

And so people don't think I'm leaning politically one way or another I think that way about a voter in the south side of Chicago who bemoans gang violence but won't vote for another alderman or state representative or voters who are upset about rising crime yet vote for people who support cashless bail or abolishing bail altogether."

1: Less arbitrary rules. People end up being more direct and show their ""Actual"" selves more often, it feels like your conversing with a bunch of real human beings and not just robots, like people will say things like ""Fuck this"" more often

2: More sense of a community, main subs feel more like hive minds then the community their supposed to be 

3: More off topic stuff. This doesn't really apply to every side sub but I think having more off-topic/variety stuff helps make an actual community 

Sorry if my thoughts are not getting across, I tried my best to explain them but am pretty bad at getting opinions across. Overall I think side subs are just better than main subs due to a multitude of reasons making people feel like people and an actual community grow, whereas main subs feels like a bunch of robots repeating the same things over and over and you have to tiptoe the line to not get your posts removed for some bullshit rule."

I believe an authoritarian government is not all negative (to an extent) I primarily cite media as a reason for why. Your phone, technology and everything you see in the modern day is tailored to show you something that will make you interact with it. Whether it is negative, positive, or neutral. Areas like China, (allegedly) have suppression over apps like TikTok, to only have educational content on the app and have limits. However, to argue against myself, ‘educational content’ is far more opinion based than fact based.

While I get the intention was for the answer to be 38 3/4, the answer as the question is written is 62

>Carlos painted 5/8 of each tile with blue paint. He painted 62 tiles. What is the total amount of tiles he painted blue?

Saying it’s 38 3/4 doesn’t make sense because it’s asking for the amount of tileS which was already stated, 62. If it asked the amount of tile(no S) then I could see 38 3/4 being a valid answer

For example Infinity Wars was good because it wrote Thanos to win and ended on that note, it left the audience speechless. Too many of these movies now follow the same formula and there’s no high stakes, no fear that the hero won’t win. For example in Quantumania Kang should’ve destroyed Ant-Man, you’ve already set up the multiverse so they could’ve easily brought him back (could you imagine the pop it would’ve received if it ended with Kang killing Ant-Man). So change my view that comic book movies need to start ending on a cliffhanger or with the bad guy winning instead of rushing through to an to ending."

None of matters, and I think that it will end in failure. I say because not only are pro-plant people going against the lobbyist, the ""pseudo"" scientist in favor of meat, and the cooperations of the industry, but you are fighting against human nature itself. you are fighting against several centuries and generations of cultures and ideologies of people eating lumps of animal tissues and fats. You are trying to upheave a global industry that is worth at least several millions of dollars. You are trying every combination of supplement and Vegetale to match the nutritional value of a slab of meat.

  
It's one thing to say how supposedly horrible meat is, it is another thing to actually make it happen. I feel that trying to end meat is like trying tear out and change the foundation of a house; I mean, you can do it, but it will destroy (or at least disrupt) everything on it in the process.

  
Also, I feel that those trying to end meat can act as bad as those who try to support it. At the very least, tearing down any pro-meat argument by calling it biases, corporate lies, or outright propaganda are not going to create change."

I was recently told off at work for discussing suicide and implying it’s a selfish act.

A colleague and I were having a (what I thought to be productive) conversation about suicide, regarding the importance of getting help, raising awareness and the effects it has on people. I understand it might not be the most appropriate place to have this conversation but A. It’s important to have these conversations in all aspects of life and B. my work is very relaxed and taboo subjects are often discussed. 

Part of our conversation I had said that id been effected by suicide around me, that I understand that they had no choice but I viewed it as unfair and possibly selfish.

I completely understand that suicide is not a choice, it’s done when there is no other choice. And so I’m not saying that the person is selfish but from a point of view from someone effected by it, it is a selfish act. I’m a big activist for suicide and mental health, I try to help as many people as I can and raise awareness.

The reason I feel like this is because I have had people around me die from suicide and it’s opened my eyes to the horrific effects it has on loved ones. It can completely ruin people’s lives, and I sometimes think “what if that I had done that to my mum?”. I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past but would never be close to going through with it as I would think about my mum and think, I could not put her through that heartbreak.

It’s important to have these discussions no matter where you are, even at work, and the reason I think this is because more conversations might help people struggling.

I don’t think that this is a bad opinion to have but the reaction I have had at work is making me question myself, am I a bad person for having this opinion? And so I would appreciate some insight and understand why this could be a bad opinion to have."

I have a master's degree in philosophy, and one of the things I struggled with most was separating the premises of someone's argument from the actual argument itself. Some folks who had studied logic as early as elementary school didn't have this same struggle, but it was something I was never exposed to. 

I think that unless you're fully aware of what the premises of the argument are (and have confirmed this with the person making the argument) then you should never challenge the premises of the argument, because then you end up talking past the other person. One premise of my argument here is that two or more people should engage in argument not to win, but to reach the truth, or at least as a consolation, learn more about the opposing side. When we simply look at an statement without separating it into parts, I think we're more likely to fall into trying to ""win"".

Here's an example: Some societies will benefit from global warming. Now, someone could attack the premise and say ""global warming isn't real"" Now the conversation has shifted to whether or not global warming is real, rather than if the argument works given the premise is true.

This is kind of nuts. Changing your face to look more like everyone else in pursuit of a beauty ideal (and those ideals change) makes me think people need therapy to help them feel comfortable in their skin more than they need to change themselves to fit the ideal.

I don’t think it’s “acceptance” to accept that people get plastic surgery to fit some societal ideal. Acceptance would be just accepting people as they are and not placing such an insane value on being “attractive” (a shifting goalpost tbh).


Edit to clarify point: 

I think I need to clarify - I am not saying it should be illegal, that people who get cosmetic surgery should be judged, or that they shouldn’t be allowed to get surgery.

I’m saying my view is that a lot of the demand for cosmetic procedures is inherently unhealthy and driven by social media and looking at images of ourselves more than we were ever meant to.

I am not referring to necessary plastic surgery to correct issues, fix real deformities or problems that would affect how someone is treated (that includes cosmetic surgeries!!) 

I am talking about young people on the internet trying to get buccal fat removal or double jaw surgery to meet an ideal they see on the internet. And then doing it again, and again, and again and still hating how they look."

That is complete bullshit and I’m finding it hard to be convinced otherwise. The only thing that changes is the level of tolerance you are willing to deal with for a certain person. 

For example, people always say your kids are someone who you love unconditionally. If your kid hit you over and over, you might excuse the behaviour. But if a stranger hits you over and over, they’re dead to you. These are two different levels of tolerance for love. (Extreme example coming up just to show a point). Now, let’s say your kid grows up to be a pedophile and an absolutely disgusting human. Majority of parents will disown them and no longer love them. Maybe there’s an argument that some parents still love their child after this. Those are people with extremely high tolerances and honestly probably some mental issues. But I can guarantee that there is something that could push those buttons and make the parents no longer love their child. Therefore love is always conditional but everyone has their own unique conditions."

1,2024-01-19,CMV: It's not okay to ask for advice about a potential love interest from another friend.,u/CEO_Of_Rejection_99,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19ato86/cmv_its_not_okay_to_ask_for_advice_about_a/,changemyview,"Yesterday during my session with my therapist, she said it's okay to ask a woman's friend's about them if I'm interested in them. For example, if I ask if the person is single, they may say ""Yes, she is single, she might be interested"" or ""No, she has a boyfriend, sorry"", for example.

However, I've been hesitant to do that and I like to treat crushes as a one-man, ""no one but yourself, trust no one"" job. This is for a few main reasons:

1. I feel that it would be putting my energy into the wrong thing. People say that you should talk to the woman DIRECTLY when pursuing a relationship. This means gauging her potential interest through social cues, stating your intentions/asking her on a date, etc. I think telling other people you like a woman carries the risk of them passing the knowledge to your love interest *before* you can state your feelings directly, which can show a lack of confidence. It would block direct communication of your feelings and thereby reduce the chances of a *clearly communicated* romantic relationship. Why spend time and energy trying to learn about a woman and communicate your interests *through* another person when you could use the same time and energy to ask her out, get to know her better, and gauge her interest via social cues? Why do all sorts of crowdsourcing and gathering enough information to write a research paper over... a simple crush? Something that plenty of people have and can handle with ease?

2. The woman's mutual friends aren't obligated to give me info about her. In fact, they may even give me the wrong info if they aren't comfortable giving me true information, which could screw me over in the long run. All of that could be avoided by cutting all the extra people out of the equation and talking to the woman directly.

3. I feel that it entirely misses the point of dating. If you want to establish a relationship, people say, state your intentions and ask her out. The question is not: ""Is she single?"" ""Does she have a boyfriend?"" The question is: ""How can I communicate my intentions and seeing if this person likes me back?"" Do I want to find out if a woman is *single*, or if I have relationship potential with said woman?

My hesitation comes from poor experiences in grade school. Two that come to mind are:

1. Senior year of HS. I liked a girl from band. Her friend posted on his Snapchat story responding to an anonymous comment. The comment asked ""Is [crush] single?"" to which he responded ""Yeah, go hit her up"". I commented on the post asking how I can do that. He didn't directly answer the question, and instead asked ""Did you ask that?"" The conversation didn't continue after that. A few weeks later, I heard the girl was dating the male friend in question. On his story, he responded to an anonymous comment asking ""Are you and [crush] dating?"" by confirming the statement.

2. Also senior year of HS. I tried pursuing a relationship with a girl from my class, and I admit I was not in the right in this situation because I didn't take signals of her not being interested, mistook friendliness for romantic attraction, and became distressed over not getting what I wanted. I asked several of my classmates if she was single, to which I got several different answers. Most of them just didn't know, some of them said she was single but not looking for a romantic partner, some of them said she had a boyfriend, and even one of them said she was flirting with a guy but I could somehow ""overtake"" him if I tried hard enough. One day I asked the girl ""are you dating someone"", to which she said no but it was an uncomfortable no. I admit this was a big mistake on my part. I strongly believe some of them told her I liked her. One day I messaged her asking about going to the beach during spring break with some of our peers, to which she said she would not be able to since she would be traveling out of the country. One day I was with some of her friends during the lunch break. They told me they knew I had a crush on her, so they tried videocalling her on my phone (it didn't go through), then asked what I would do if she had COVID (this was in 2020 right before quarantine), then dared me to sing a song about her. One of them also told me she would actually not be traveling out of the country and therefore could bring her on the beach trip. A few days later, the girl blocked me on my socials and the beach trip didn't happen due to quarantine. I was shocked because I felt that ""I did everything I was supposed to do, and I still got blocked.""

My trust in other people went down after that and since then I became scared of asking for advice about a specific person from my peers out of fear of being given the wrong information and fucked over as a result. 

However, I have begun making some effort to rebuild my trust with my peers in that sense. It was only recently in early 2023 that I opened up to a select few of my closest friends about a platonic obsession (squish) with a female friend, and after opening up to them I felt a million times better. Now I would like to further open myself up and feel more comfortable about telling my peers about romance.

But in saying this, I could point to lots of other studies that highlight how the consumption of goods like cigarettes and alcohol does too. I believe that a free and democratic society should allow citizens to make bad decisions (if they’re sound of mind), as long as the rights of other citizens aren’t curtailed.

I would argue that substances like alcohol have larger external costs to society than goods like steroids, and that few other people aside from the injectee are affected. 

The market for steroids already exists, and whilst the legalisation may make the existing market larger, if society has allowed goods like alcohol to be legal (even if it contributes to deaths via drunk driving etc and imposes more social costs) then steroids should be legal too."

According to the **Arab league** Arab Countries are: -

1. **Egypt** (My country)
2. Saudi Arabia 
3. Yemen 
4. Oman 
5. UAE
6. Bahrain 
7. Qatar 
8. Kuwait 
9. Iraq
10. Syria 
11. Jordan 
12. Palestine 
13. Lebanon 
14. Libya 
15. Sudan 
16. Somalia 
17. Djibouti 
18. Algeria 
19. Tunisia 
20. Morocco
21. Mauritania  
22. Comoros

And this is one of the biggest lies that I've ever been told. Because historically most of these countries are **conquered by Arabs** and they united the languages of all these countries and made the Arabic is the official language to all these countries.

# And classifying these countries and classifying us (Egyptians) as Arabs is so as ridiculous as classifying Niger and Cameroon as European nations because they speak the same European language (French).

And even countries like **Somalia**, Comoros, Mauritania and **Djibouti** most of its population **don't speak Arabic**. So I don't know why it's considered ""*an Arab State*""

Genetically and historically *Arabs are the descendants of Arab tribes in the Arabian Peninsula*, which are the countries 2 - 8 (Yemen & Gulf states). And what is more interesting about this fact even **genetically we are not Arabs.** 

The **National Geographic Genographic Project (NGGP)** conducted a *genetic analysis* all across Egypt and they discovered that only 17 percent of Egyptians are Arabs, while **68 percent of the indigenous population** is from North Africa, four percent are from Jewish ancestry, three percent are of East African origins, another three percent from Asia Minor and three percent are South European.  


[https://egyptindependent.com/dna-analysis-proves-egyptians-are-not-arabs/](https://egyptindependent.com/dna-analysis-proves-egyptians-are-not-arabs/) 

# And another article in the Gurdian said that Studies on modern Egyptian DNA support the view that neither Egyptian Muslims nor Copts are Arab. All the invasions that Egypt has experienced over millennia, including the Arab invasion, do not seem to account for more than 15% of modern Egyptians' ancestry. Which said that about 85% of Egyptians are descendants of the indigenous Ancient Egyptians.

[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/08/egyptian-arab-cultural-identity](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/08/egyptian-arab-cultural-identity) 

And I think these studies are different due to the difference in samples of the population of Egypt. Because **Egypt is a multiethnic country**. It has *Arabs in the western desert and Sinai, Amazigh in the Western Desert, and Nubians in the south, and the vast majority of the population is Egyptians in the Nile banks.* Which is very very very interesting! Because ancient **Egyptians inhabited the Delta and the valley thousands of years ago and still doing this in todays life.** 

And I'm 100% sure that if they take a DNA analysis of Egyptians in the Delta and the valley the **match ratio will increase to more than 90%.**

# And even we use some words in the Egyptian Arabic dialect that is rooted to the ancient Coptic language. E.g.: (ست) pronounced as: set, and it means a woman. It's a Coptic word! 

(**Miret**) which is a name here in Egypt that means a **beautiful woman.**

# And in terms of food, a common dish here in Egypt we tends to eat it in breakfast -which is fava beans-, it was common also in ancient Egypt. 

And many other wonderful things like that.

**The same thing applies to most to the ""Arab word""** 

**Moroccans , Algerians and Libyans are Amazigh**

**Sudanese are Kush** 

**Palestinians, Lebanese and some of Jordanians are Canaanites** 

and so on.

#  In terms of ethnicity, languages is not related to it.

#  In terms of ethnicity, the related things are genes.

# Egyptians are Arabic speakers, but not Arabs. Egyptians are Egyptians.

We belong to the ""Arab world"" (the middle east and north Africa) as we have same culture and the same language. As France belong to the EU due to their same culture and similar languages."

1,2024-01-20,CMV: the Call of Duty trickshotting community won’t be revived with MWIII… because the game sucks,u/ImperialClassic,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19bek5i/cmv_the_call_of_duty_trickshotting_community_wont/,changemyview,"I waited like 2 months to post this, but I had this opinion back during the beta of MWIII. I’m also posting this to Reddit because the sub supports a better format than Twitter for this topic, even though theres like no COD Trickshot community on Reddit, at least compared to twitter or discord. I added things to this post whenever I would think of something to support my view, so why it’s maybe long, but I waited 2 months to give a benefit of the doubt…. But MWIII sucks for trickshotting. 

When people say “revive” they think of how the community was back during the 2011-2016, but that’s not coming back. Like even if there is a revival, it will be different. My view it will never be as big during that era, even if video games, call of duty, the internet in general are bigger now, this aspect/community of gaming just can’t be sustained for various reasons to be on that level of 2011-2016. 

The most obvious reasons.. the games suck for trickshots and that includes MWIII. I think right now there’s a honey moon period because this new installment of call of duty is basically the first new type of game “old players” are experiencing. What I mean by old players is people who were around during the 2011-2016 era that barely played the jet pack CODs, and never played the new “boots on the ground” CODs, so basically 2016-2022 CODs. Like MWIII movements and mechanics are basically similar to the previous CODs since 2019, but since the old players never played those, MWIII might as well offer a fresh new experience for trickshotting. So that’s what I mean by honey moon period…. But the games still suck for trickshots. The main aspect that makes MWIII the best of these new type of CODs is the fact MW2 maps are part of the game. MW2, probably having the greatest maps for trickshots, but it might as well be a gimmick. As an old player, trickshots just don’t look good for MWIII and I know this will be the opinion many old players have but there’s still in the honey moon period. (Maybe nostalgia too)

Also old players are adults now and we all were teenager kids back then, so… this part of community won’t be the same, no revival, just honey moon. Many will go back to whatever adult lives they had before MWIII. Even if the best new COD for trickshots ever came out… this part of the community… is just grown up. 

Now for the new players, the new generation. Even though I’m not a part of this, I still have these views. Since MWIII is barely a good game for trickshotting, this new generation won’t be as big to develop, even compared to 2015-2016 standards. I am basing this on my remembering of black ops 3, which was quite big, but it didn’t dominate compared to classic MW2 and BO2, but I will acknowledge it was probably bigger than BO1, MW3, Ghost, and AW, even if many of the old famous players (during that time) will say BO1, MW3, and Ghost are better games for trickshots. The average player probably would have played BO3 more.  

There’s probably people reading this post that have no idea what the fuck I’m even talking about, but if you maybe familiar with call of duty, look up faze illcams 45, soaring in style 57, and red cams 2, then look up soaring in style - #justice and tell me as a neutral which looks better? I bet uncontacted tribes in Brazil will tell you the videos from 2014-2016 are better than the video from 2024 if shown 😂

Btw, I mentioned those specific videos because those were big trickshot montages from the newest COD at the times a few months after they came out, so I make sure it’s fair… because faze illcams 45 was barely peak BO2, because I remember many considered BO2 (and ghost) to look like shit when those games came out, but they evolved over time… but that won’t happen for MWIII. Honey period like I said, and people will just quit when they get bored rather than go back to MW2 and BO2, like so many did back then after they hated the newest COD. I’m also using top teams as my standards. 

Getting to that point, where are the teams?… oh shit many have came back, especially in that 2 month period I waited. I honestly didn’t expect this, but it’s good to acknowledge, BUT they might as well be totally new teams because the differences in old and new players. For old players, NE, Ice, Lucid, and Genesis are back!! (Many of the OG channels don’t even exist anymore) but at least they back… but does this mean anything for new players? New teams are new teams, but that “rival” aspect doesn’t mean that much actually. It’s just old players hyping on Twitter. Speaking of teams, where’s the team ladders? Back in the day, Just - Soar - Faze (this was a famous one but there was a whole dynamic and styles of teams). Community is built on fun, but it’s also build on progress and success. Is Soar still like top 3 based on actual trickshots? Lots of teams are going to be hyped based on past glory… glory from 10 years ago… 

This goes back to my regular point… MWIII just sucks. Every COD there’s people saying “this is the game” that will revive trickshoting, but it doesn’t happen because all the new games suck. They just look awful. We should have appreciated the jet pack CODs back then, because those even look better than the new CODs now. 

I wrote enough but setting up, 2box, FaZe not being FaZe, no scarce, fortnite, no team hierarchy, and other aspects of the 2011-2016 community is stuff I’m willing to elaborate on to change my views. At the end of the day, even if I think the game sucks, that doesn’t mean there can’t be a revival, so change my view?"

Why should we replace it? (Especially when it will piss a lot of people off for seemingly little reason). It’s one thing to play this other national anthem alongside, another to replace the old one.

Saw on here that they are replacing the National Anthem this year at the upcoming football games with the “Black National Anthem” (Lift Every Voice).

I’m very liberal, but this feels kind of weird to me. It’d be one thing to sing this alongside The National Anthem, but it feels way over the line to replace this.

I don’t feel a change like this is necessary because the National Anthem isn’t really even a problematic song. If anything, it’s a bit dull. But at any rate, it’s a tradition, and long traditions that don’t harm anyone or imply anything negative should be generally respected.

I don’t really like the Lift Every Voice song either, because of the religious implications of the song, which (in my opinion) actually add problematic layers to it (think pledge of allegiance). It also doesn’t feel like it’s significant culturally. Is it even significant to black people? Aren’t there other folk songs that are more significant to black people? I truly don’t know.

I don’t call many things virtue signaling, but this feels like very weird virtue signaling to me. I don’t quite understand the point. It seems like a change that will piss a lot of people off for very little reason. Not all traditions are bad, or imply systemic white supremacy."

Now, I support third parties. I'm a Libertarian and want the LP to win more seats in Congress, but I also understand that we are locked in an entrenched two party system. If third parties, like Libertarian, Green, Alliance, Forward, etc. Want to establish a serious voice in the nation's politics, they need to go beyond the local level, but stay reasonable. A presidential run will waste their funding, and those looking to run as independents or under third parties need to run at the state level.

I'm sure the vast majority of people in this thread would agree torture is immoral and unethical. This CMV is about the **effectiveness** of it.

The usual answer given to the question, ""Does torture work?"" is ""No, it doesn't, because people in pain will say anything and everything to make the pain stop."" This is the default line adhered to by nearly all torture opponents - that it never works because the information derived thereof is unreliable.

But I would argue that, in certain circumstances, torture *would* be effective - specifically, **if the torturer has a way to verify the information in real time.** For instance, if they are torturing someone to get the password to a computer or the combination to a safe, the subject would not be able to get away with lying, since the captors could instantly check to see if the passcode was, in fact, the correct one.

Obviously, such a situation would be comparatively rare. But it is not accurate to say that ""torture never works."" Under certain conditions, I'd imagine, it could very well work indeed. "

I definitely agree that there need to be regulations in place--AI shouldn't be able to claim it's another author, for example, but to raise a couple of counterpoints to what the anti-AI crowd thinks, I have a couple of questions. I have my own answers, but I'd like to see what other people think:  
1. How do we differentiate between a human studying other people's works and then using them to develop their own style and AI? and  
2. Should effort be a requirement for art? Is someone who's disabled less worthy of creating art than someone who's abled?  
Here are some of my thoughts:  
I think it's a bit of a turing test. If you can't tell the difference between an AI using other people's works as inspiration vs. a human, then it opens a whole can of worms to just say ""well AI doesn't have rights, because it's AI."" You also open things up to witchhunts where you're persecuting people because you think they might be using AI.  
I think we have to judge things based on results to a certain extent. If you generate a wholly-AI generated work, at least at this point, it's bound not to be as good as the work of someone who put actual effort in. But what if an author spends a lot of time with the AI, going back and forth with it about plot ideas, characters, etc.? What if the author guides the style of the AI based on the style of their own work? I think it has to be said that while society under capitalism assumes that effort is traded for money, that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. There are many devices that make our lives easier--wheelchairs, glasses, the printing press, technology that allows you to trace artwork, etc. Should these things be banned because they make labour easier?  
In the end, I think your ideas are your ideas, and using AI to help you improve upon those ideas is still going to result in different work than someone else. I think using AI is a very personal choice--akin to say, the choice between hand-drawn art and digital art. Do you ban digital art because it's ""easier"" than hand-drawn art? Or do you let people choose whether to engage with digital art? I think more choices are rarely a bad thing. 

All that being said, I'd like to think I'm a reasonable person, and am genuinely interested to see what people have to say on the topic.

During these arguments, without fail, if you go to the profile of people who claim “furry does not equal zoophile”, you can find them interacting with porn of anthropomorphic animals.

Men often have to jump through hoops in any given situation to show he is investing some means of resources whether that be time (converse/flirt), money (dates/gifts),  relationship (commitment/marriage ) regardless of his stature (looks, wealth, personality) he has to do a little song and dance (mating dance) to get any sex. 

Whereas for women, for the most part only have to ask for sex and the majority of men will not only entertain the request but might walk through broken glass to fulfill her desire. Now I understand for women it's not about wanting just sex but having sex with a desired ""quality"" partner , but sex is still a form of companionship, sex is considered a need in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and there are some very real mental and physical consequences for not obtaining physical affection and contact, look up ""touch starvation"".

That being said I'm aware that pornography isn't a healthy reflection of sex and that porn is a hyper accentuated product designed to illicit a quick and easy spike of dopamine and other feel good hormones when utilized for a sexual release. In many ways porn is comparable to fast/junk food it's empty and nutritiously dense, which is ultimately bad for your health but appeases a quick satiating effect to a hungry/starving person. Just like junk/fast food, porn is incredibly cheap and accessible. 

It has everything to do with affordability as much as it has to do with habits. Someone with a variety of options will go for quality while someone with little options will settle for the quantity of options afforded to them. 

Someone rich preaching the value of minimalism to impoverished people would seem outlandish. Someone with a refrigerator full of healthy food preaching healthy eating and dieting to a starving person is cruel. Someone young and beautiful professing the benefits of singledom to a lonesome elderly  person is ridiculous. It has everything to do with choice and women by and large have more choices sexually than men do on average. So...for women to ridicule men for taking the low hanging fruit that is porn when they have essentially a buffet is absurd. 

TLDR: Women have a monopoly on sex. Female sex is not equal to male sex, female sex costs more than male sex. Porn is a cheap substitution for sex (all sizzle no steak). Men take what they can afford.

Trigger warning - Talk about sexual harassment and assault

The first time I was sexually harassed that I remember was when I was 11 or 12. An older guy in his 50s kept groping me on the bus on my way back from school. After that there has been several instances of guys touching me in an indecent way throughout the years. This is not even counting the catcalling and being stared at that I have faced, just the physical molestations. I guess I am lucky in that I have not been sexually assaulted yet or had a bottle of acid thrown at my face, but that's about it. 

However I recently saw a post talking about women's issues where a guy asked in the comments ""what is your source which states that all women have actually been harassed at least once in their lives?"" And technically he is correct, because there has actually never been any study proving the statement that ""ALL adult women have been harassed in some way or form throughout their lives"".

It made me really curious about it, because after all it is very possible that I have likely been projecting my personal experiences on others. I don't think there has ever been a statistical study to prove this point but I have personally never met a woman who has not been harassed by the opposite gender. 

However, I want to be proven wrong. I want to get back my trust and hope in humanity. Tell me about personal stories that you know of your female friends and family who has never faced harm. Go ahead and CMV."
1,2024-01-20,CMV: a Trump dictatorship would be a bad thing for most people,u/RevolutionaryTone276,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19bmdhl/cmv_a_trump_dictatorship_would_be_a_bad_thing_for/,changemyview,"I’ve been hearing a lot of arguments from people saying that bc of the gridlock in Congress and polarization more generally, a Trump dictatorship would be good because he could actually get things done. They mention curbing inflation, universal healthcare, less woke media (which I personally don’t care about), more jobs, and using the military to stop crime domestically like in El Salvador. 

Personally I just don’t see it. To me it seems like democracy is an important societal feedback mechanism that allows for institutions like the judiciary and regulatory enforcement to function in a way that’s accountable to the greatest good. I know it doesn’t always work out that way and it slows things down, but it seems worth it to keep trying. 

Without democracy it seems like everything is likely to get worse including inequality and racism. I’m not too familiar with the day to day lives of most people in North Korea, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and China, but my understanding is that if you’re not an oligarch or party member, it’s not great."

This is supposed to mean that everyone gets what they need and no one is overworked. I have two problems with this philosophy.

1. How is need and ability determined and who sets these standards and applies them to society? I've never gotten a real answer for this, especially since a lot of communists are true to the original theory, which is an anarchist society, so there is no ruling government. The only answers I've gotten are ""common sense"", whatever that means in this context, and ""a community vote"" which also doesn't make sense in this context. Are we supposed to vote on the needs and abilities of EVERY PERSON in our community? How is this supposed to work? How do we avoid making hard workers carry society?

2. Needs and ability, what about wants? I don't need a guitar, but I want to have one. How is that accommodated? What about camping? How do I get the supplies? Who makes them? How can people get them? How does that work for things no one needs, but wants for recreation?"

Now im not really counting people that are stuck in cycles of abuse or manipulation since i think that deals with different psychological phenomenon than what I'm talking about. 
Im just talking about people who either want to give their partner restrictions or are constantly concerned when their s.o wants to hang with girls or guys.

I have to wonder, if you're spending so much energy ruminating over these things, about where your partner is going and who they're engaging with...what's the point is? It seems like more stress than its worth to be in a relationship where you're constantly worried that you're going to be left or cheated on.  And I cant help but think that, no matter how many restrictions you have, barring locking your s.o in a tiny jail cell, you cant really control if they're faithful to you or not. It has to be something they choose. 

I'd also rather someone make the choice to be faithful to me rather than me having to constantly monitor how faithful they are. Ultimately my view is that a relationship is something that should bring yall joy, comfort and the ability to grow in step with one another. A partnership should in the grand scheme make life easier. Not harder.

And sure leaving is easier said than done a lot of times. Again this post isnt about abusive relationships. But whats the point of staying with someone you dont think has the capability to be loyal to you? Idk I'd love to get others view points."

I think this is unfair and household expenses should be split equally between the partners. 

More often than not, the cases where one partner makes 4 to 5 times of monthly income of other partner works in a high stress job, working long hours, sacrificing mental and physical health . Even to reach at that job position where he/she can earn such high salary, the person had to maintain good scores academically throughout school, getting into best colleges and  obtaining post graduate degrees. 

How is it fair that a person after putting in so much of hard work is also expected to contribute more towards expenses? It appears that low earning partner can enjoy a decent enough life by simply paying minimum contribution towards expenses. Had this low earning partner been single, he/she would never have been able to afford the standard of life if not because of the extra contributions made by high earning partner. 

This line of thought doesn't consider emotional aspect of relationship. It simply says that contribution towards of expenses should be based on consumption and not incomes."

You hear these debates a lot across every major sport, but in my experience it's biggest in basketball circles. Someone says Steph Curry is the greatest or Lebron is the greatest, then someone else counters PFFT IF THEY PLAYED IN JORDAN'S ERA and goes on about the league being “soft now.” Then someone else chimes in that Wilt Chamberlain's stats will never be equaled. Then someone counters by saying “Wilt was playing against plumbers and mailmen.” Et cetera.  
I'm with the plumbers and mailmen crowd. I don't care how many titles Margaret Court won in the 60s and 70s; the level of competition then was far far lower than it is today. If we could somehow put peak Margaret Court up against peak Serena Williams, I think Serena would blow her away. If you had Wilt Chamberlain go 1-on-1 with Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokic, Mr. 100 points would look like a YMCA rec league bum.   
Who has more “natural talent” is hard to address, and not a question I'm interested in here. My position is simply that by and large, modern athletes are better at their sport than athletes from significantly long ago. “Top 25 all time” lists always include a good helping of names from the distant past; I think this is mostly due to nostalgia and hero worship. A truly objective list, based on nothing but “how good are they at the game/sport,” would almost always be dominated by modern practitioners. Because mostly, they are just better.  
People say it's not fair to compare across eras; I think it's totally fair and people just don't like the result. I think when folks protest such comparisons, what they are really saying is, “please don't do that because I want to keep thinking this old timer that I have long admired is the best, and if you compare them to the modern elite, it will be an unfavorable comparison.”

Nobody stumbles into the life of being a serial rapist. It’s not like some sexual assault cases where there’s some, if not nuance, then grey area. To be clear, the assault happening is unjustifiable and wrong no matter what, but the college frat boy who rapes a girl while she’s passed out at a party is different from a predator following a woman to her job, her gym, her house, waiting for a moment to kidnap her and get his rocks off. More time, planning, obsession and in some cases violence go into the latter type of offender.

The frat boy, in most cases I’ve seen, is opportunistic. They want sex. They’d prefer it consensually but if the girl is drunk and too fucked up to say “no” they’re fine with that too. Serial rapists however, they get off on the lack of consent. They get off on the resistance. They want the person to scream, fight and try and run. Domination is inextricably bound up with their sexual desire. 

Did anybody watch The Last of Us on HBO? Well, there’s a character just like that in the show. Someone that gets off on resistance. Someone like that can’t be reformed, retrained or redeemed. They’re wild dogs. And even if you could “tame” them, it’s still too risky in my opinion. A drunk who relapses will likely hurt themselves, either via alcohol poisoning or just your run-of-the-mill self-destruction of their lives. A junkie will likely be the same. Though the risk they betray a friend or family member and rob them for a quick fix is also a factor. They too are more likely to just OD and die.

A serial sex offender though? If they relapse someone is getting raped.

That risk is too much for me. Humans are animals, no? If an untrained/abused/mentally ill dog bites two or three kids, not matter how much their owners might love them, they’re getting put down for the benefit of society according to the state. Even if you could put them on meds or put them in a different environment there’s always the risk that down the line something could set them off and then it might not be a bitten kid you’re dealing with but a dead one. I feel like this is a happy medium for the criminal justice reformers and the tough-on-crime crowd. Because when the offender is “fixed”, we release them from prison free of the “urges” that would make them want to attack someone again, we save billions of dollars that would be otherwise spent on feeding and housing them, and the “law and order” crowd can sleep soundly knowing these guys are castrated and, though they’re free, will remain on a list for the rest of their lives.

I'm going to keep this short since it's night time here and most Redditors are probably sleep or inactive.  


Anyways, my take is that there is a massive difference between having an opinion on an issue, and being objectively wrong  


Most conservatives (for example) often use black people and the black communities in their political speeches, not knowing that they are objectively wrong.  


For example, you always hear republicans claim that systemic racism does not exist, and people who talk about it are just crying victim. They also throw around the word ""white guilt"" and ""white oppression"" every time you bring this up. I also notice this on reddit many times.  


Anyways, it is well documented in history the specific policies that were put into place to confine black individuals into poor neighborhoods, with poor education, unable to buy homes, etc. If you are going to argue against that, then it would be best to leave this thread, since you would just be proving my title correct.  


The other argument people try to use is point out that these policies are illegal now, making the historic point invalid. For those that think this, the best analogy is the monopoly analogy  


Let's say you and your friends were playing monopoly for the past 3 hours. If someone else joins you after that time, would it be fair? Sure, the rules are exactly the same. But you would inherently be at a massive advantage because you were able to go at the game for 3 hours before I was allowed to. This is also why you hear people talking about ""Equity""  


Anyways. Another example is that conservatives (and Asian Americans) try to compare the successfulness of asian American communities, to black communities, to create the false argument that the reason why they are more successful is because they ""work harder"", ""value education"", etc.  


This sounds fine at first, until you realize there are 3 things you are missing when you say this.  


1) Generally speaking, the way the immigration policy works, is that it favors individuals with higher education and higher income, meaning you would be at an advantage when you arrive  


2) The government also provides grants and business loans for said immigrants  


3) all immigrants were not put into the same system that oppressed certain groups of native born Americans.  


This entire 'model minority' thing is just a cheap way to discredit the struggles of the African American community  


**Anyways**  


I have typed for long enough so I'm going to put my conclusion here. As I explained in this post, all of these ""political stances"" are just results of plain ignorance and/or being uneducated about black history. I believe the best way to fix this solution is to educate people more, how about you  


By the way, to change my mind you must provide why my title or solution is flawed. Any attempt to discredit systemic racism would not work, because your take is objectively wrong.

However - if you are a known person or a public figure, are are always doxxed. People can see where you live, when you fly, and where you will be most days down to the minute.

I did an AMA on Reddit a while back and my post kept getting taken down until I had sufficiently doxxed myself into oblivion. At any given time during that period, my location was basically live broadcast on the internet (I started managing venues shortly after, and, you know how promotion works).

When I had to doxx like crazy, I was on federal probation and just spent a lot of time in federal prisons. Stupid reddit users tried to call my probation officer and all kinds of dumb shit (haters, losers). It didn't actually impact me at all, thankfully, but it really made me think: outside of swatting or something like a true serial killer / stalker, doxxing isn't the big deal people think it is.

Imagine if I happened to be Dwayne ""The Jungle"" Johnson, do you think I would join reddit as ""gamergurl778"" and try to hide my identity? Why?

The false sense of privacy people have stems from their inability to be notable or significant, in my opinion. Nobody has ever once questioned them and said ""oh, there is no way you are this person you are claiming you are"". Maybe they aren't comfortable with who they are and they wouldn't like people to find out. I am not sure what the psychology is behind it, but I equate it to people who are always worried about trying to ""patent"" and ""trademark"" their shitty ideas.

I can tell a bad idea right away when the person who came up with it thinks they are the only one to ever think of something and their primary concern is ""making sure nobody else can steal/copy the idea"". Your idea isn't that good, then. Your perception of the world at large are skewed and you may have a bit of megalomania if you honestly think some idea you shit out is more important to patent than actually execute. It also doesn't show much confidence that you think your idea is so easy anybody can steal it and that you wouldn't be the ""best"" at doing it... I have digressed a bit.

This is how I feel about doxxing. If I was Taylor Swift, what good would it do me to post online under some fake alias and try to ""hide my identity"" and ""protect my privacy""? You can look up all 8 of her houses and where she lives. Regardless of if she posts as swiftie987 or therealtrailerswift.

People from the internet are scary and shitty, yeah, but if you are a full grown adult pretending to be some amorphous and anonymous entity, that is your first issue right there. If you aren't in witness protection (or a minor), you shouldn't worry about people finding out who you are or even where you live.  It is an irrational fear. Or, to me, indicates people trying to hide something about themselves, for whatever reason.

If somebody is really looking, they will find you - no matter how many aliases you hide behind. Why live your life pretending to not be YOU for some false sense of privacy?

This goes triple for artists and such, because they are almost always on a schedule to appear certain places at certain times with the goal of getting as many people there as possible at once. What good would it do Skrillex to make dubstepfan01 user account and pretend to be a regular person? It wouldn't. So what good does it do any other person to become some other fictional representation of themselves?

Imagine your great, great grandchildren have the internet and want to look you up. There are GB of your old posts and images floating around, but they never think to search ""furrybear9897"" to figure out who you were online.

In this modern age of AI, if you aren't a verifiable flesh and blood person on the internet, what are you doing that a bot can't do?

I have been on the Internet since the 1990s. I had a thousand different names. If only I had consolidated into my real persona! Do not waste your time on such things, learn from my mistakes.

The schism and dichotomy is easy to see if you have been on both sides of the fence:

1.) People who aren't anybody don't want people to find out

2.) People who are somebody often have to go to great lengths to prove and validate their identity in various ways.


If I book a hotel as ""Leonardo DiCaprio"", the staff would think it was a joke or a scam until Titanic Boy himself showed up. 

Before you think you can ""CMV"" by somehow further doxxing me or harassing me, I have been odd probation a long time now. If angry reddit nerds couldn't impact my life by calling the feds on me, there is even less for me to worry about NOW, that I don't have that hanging over my head. Even now, my location is generally known by a large swath of people, especially if I do public appearances or shows. Any artist you can think of, you can look up and see who they really are and where they are from, etc.; 

You know who you can't look up? Somebody scared of being doxxed."

I’m the 20th century, there was a strife between the field of anthropology and the emergent field of human rights. The anthro side was culturally relativist, while the human rights side wanted to impose universal values to protect human dignity from a liberal perspective. Ultimately, the anthro side acquiesced to the human rights side, especially after WW2, acknowledging the need for liberal intervention at times of crisis. 

The modern nature of Western intervention has tarnished the reputation of how far this kind of intervention should go. We forced democracies across the globe not for the goal of liberal social and democratic values, but to stop the spread of communist ones, ultimately because the neoliberal goal was an economically liberal one (such as FDI’s). It was forced because it was all part of a global power and economic goal, not a social humanitarian one. 

Nowadays ideas of Western democratic intervention are met with heavy skepticism, but I believe this is because people are still not aware that a deliniation between liberal state intervention for the sake of humanitarian efforts and those for the sake of global economic order have yet to be made. The Western economies continue to pay African warlords for cobalt and lithium, the continue to pay Saudi Arabian nobility for oil who enslaved the majority of their population for oil. The West contributes to global instability and then acts suprised when many counties react by emigrating to the West in droves because they stand at the top of the global order. 

On the public level, political and corporate interests in the West have become deeply entwined with technological advancements. Solidarity is difficult to come by, and when it is it’s mass disorganisation is co-opted and taken advantage of by the state (eg BLM was commodified by the democratic party in the US and the Arab Spring co-opted by the Egyptian military gov following the ousting of Mubarak). People hardly feel that they have an individual voice, so they set themselves against each other. Often you might find two liberals with similar goals at each other’s throats on an internet forum over some semantic nuanced disagreement (the people are lacking individual expression). 

TLDR: Liberalism is applied only economically, creating massive disjunctures and unrest. It could be applied socially if the people willed it under their Western democracies, but we are being driven farther and farther from actionable solidarity through our increasing alienation."
205,2024-01-21,CMV: Anti-shoplifting measures like locking items in cases will hurt stores in the long run more than shoplifting ever could,u/dysfunctionz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19bwl2o/cmv_antishoplifting_measures_like_locking_items/,changemyview,"My local Target recently locked their entire section of mens' socks, t-shirts, and underwear in cases that require you to press a button to get employee assistance to get to any of the items. I assume this is to deter shoplifting. There are only a handful of employees on the floor at this entire store, compared to hundreds of people shopping there at any given time, and I wouldn't say that Target employees are especially motivated to provide customer service (and at minimum wage, I can't blame them). Pressing that button can mean waiting several minutes just to get handed a pair of socks.

Other chain stores like CVS and Walgreens have made similar changes in the last few years, I need to press a button and wait for one of the two people working at CVS to come to me to get a single tube of toothpaste. Why would anyone subject themselves to that when online shopping exists?

These stores may be losing a lot of money to shoplifting but I believe the approach they are taking will drive their customer base away entirely to the likes of Amazon (more so than has already happened), and will drive them out of business much faster than the shoplifting these measures are intended to prevent ever could."

Men were also never considered victims and not taken seriously as such. So it was a completely one-sided issue that was ubiquitously agreed upon to be morally reprehensible both by feminists and conservatives.  
  
But, this depended on the chivalrous tradition of men being expected to never hit a woman under any circumstances and that there was no such thing as an inter-gendered fair fight. That has since changed and the modern progressive belief is that male victims are equally victims.  
  
Consider that 44% of domestic violence are men, domestic violence is most common in lesbian couples and women are more likely to perpetrate murder and physical abuse against children than men. So considering this, it seems is that an issue that affects almost as many men as women and that in theory, more women are perpetrating due to disproportionate under-reporting, that it should not be considered a women's problem.  
  
Male domestic violence victims became a hot topic for Men's Advocates in the 2010's and feminists protested with them. But feminists tried to use it to their advantage to turn the blame on men by placing all the accountability for stigma and under-reporting on men. It kind of back-fired as they helped Men's Advocates expose a huge misconception about gender disparity in the crime.  
  
There is a contradiction in the attempt to eliminate the chivalry customs and portray women as disproportionate victims. Because if(and arguably) gender has nothing to do with the seriousness of perpetration of violence. Traditionally speaking, the list of seriousness in the perpetration would look something like this:

M-children, F-children, M-F, M-M, F-F, F-M.  
  
Many still consider the final to be laughable. From a neutral standpoint, one must acknowledge the nuances to come to a conclusion."

Probably the most unselfish reason would be to have so much love to give and being prepared to sacrifice a lot to ensure the child has the best upbringing possible but even then there is always a risk that the person you brought to life suffers tremendously or is born with a condition or a handicap. For those reasons alone i think it's hard to find rational arguments in favor of having a child. It is a bleak outlook i guess but in my view as long as there is a risk of suffering it is selfish to gamble with a whole life.

I'm generally talking about Titles II and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, though I'm sure there are other laws that apply to it both inside and outside the US, so I wanted to be a bit more general. I'd also like to make clear that I am a cisgender, heterosexual, white male, just to give a bit of context. I'm asking this in good faith.

&#x200B;

I don't understand the purpose of anti-discrimination legislation as it pertains to private businesses. When it pertains to the state or other public functions, at all levels, I totally understand it, because the government should not be allowed to discriminate based on race, color, religion, or any other such factors, which are generally considered protected classes. For private businesses, however, I don't understand the purpose. This is not me saying that discrimination is good - it's me saying that, as a black person, why would you ever want to patronize a business that is *legally obligated* to serve you, and that in any other circumstance would treat you worse than a white patron. This is just an example, of course.

&#x200B;

In a perfect world, there would be no racism and there would be no discrimination based on these protected classes, but we don't live in a perfect world, and it's important to realize that we can't legislate ourselves out of it. Why would you want to work for an employer that would refuse to hire you because of your race if the law didn't prohibit it? Do you really think that's going to be a healthy working environment with plenty of opportunities for advancement?

I want to see other people’s perspective. I just have a lil trauma. I was molested as a preteen and so my little sister when she was a toddler by my former step mom friend’s son.

 From my perspective I wouldn’t trust men other than the dad to change or bathe my kids. Due to having trauma. My mind is messed up where to point I would think men would sexualize a small child especially if it’s a girl when it comes to changing or bathing.

What trigger me to ask this; is that yesterday my friend (M) he babysitting his two toddler nieces and had to change both of their clothes including underwear as he was on the phone with me. I’m not picturing him as a pedophile but my mind was sucking into flashbacks .It sucks I have to deal with this mindset for the rest of my life.

1,2024-01-21,"CMV: Europe will be fine but in the U.S., there will be no way to avoid violence as AI and Robotics cause unemployment to rise to unprecedented levels in the coming decade",u/Sh4rtemis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19c6nd5/cmv_europe_will_be_fine_but_in_the_us_there_will/,changemyview,"I've been a big predictor of AI and Robotics replacing jobs for the last 10 years. I always said by 2030, cars and semi trucks would drive themselves, all stores would be self checkout, cleaning robots will replace janitors, construction would be done with huge 3d printers, and basically any kind of work would just require faaaaar less people. 

Socialism in the form of Universal Basic Income (supplied by heavy taxes on corporations that use machines to replace workers) is the only decent path forward. What else are we going to? Let people starve in the streets? Create fake jobs to pay people?

I think unemployment could rise to be as high as 25% between 2030 and 2040. The AI/robotics take over is just waiting on one thing: the prices of robotics to go down so that replacing fast food workers with a conveyor belt (similar to a car factory) is more profitable than the current human model (for the record, I don't expect fully automated places until 2040+ but if labor is reduced across the board by even 25%, we are going to be in trouble).

Europe will pivot fine because they are closer to socialism than we are. 

In the U. S. though, boomers and conservatives are going to resist UBI with their very lives. Most boomers are retired anyways and will heavily resent the idea of people being able to ""retire"" at 18 while they had to work their asses for 40+ years to ""earn the right to quit working"". 

We will require the boomer vote over the next 10 years in order for democrats to get 60% of the Senate to agree to a UBI bill, which is a fat chance. 

Our social safety systems will collapse because boomers will never vote to increase funding for ""handouts"". 

Many of us will lose our houses and everything we own. 

Except for our guns 

We won't just starve to death on the streets. Many of us will start robbing places for food or even shelter. 

I could imagine some having so much resentment that they open fire with an assault rifle on a crowd of who as they perceive as being rich people. 

I myself, if I have nothing left to lose and I think I'm going to starve on the streets, I may be more inclined to take out people who I believe are responsible for voting my life away. Or at least to secure resources for myself and my family. 

There will be HUGE clashes of tens of thousands of armed (but not trained) people agaist police, swat, national guard, and probably even the military. Until boomers and conservatives finally give in and vote for politicians that will switch our society to socialism, millions will die in the violence that ensues because our dysfunctional government allows for the tyranny of the minority. 

The only way to avoid any of this is to start building in UBI systems now before our puny social safety nets start collapsing from the incoming high unemployment levels. And whenever I suggest this now to my boomer parents (who actually haven't voted republican since Bush), they scoff at it. If conservative democrats aren't even for it, we got no chance. 

You won't be able to CMV by arguing that automation won't send unemployment skyrocketing by 2030. You'll need to argue based on how you think our government will react. Maybe the president can declare martial law and use the military to get food, water, and shelter to the tens of millions that will be displaced. 

Looking at the political landscape now, I have 0 hope anything will get done until after millions have started dying. 

With that said, I do think we will come out of this as a stronger society. A society where you don't have to work for basic needs is one humans have never experienced before and I think it could be transcendent for our species. We will get to focus on living our lives and doing the things we want, not what we have to do. 

Getting there will be bloody though. Please CMV, I hate this belief but cannot find any evidence to the contrary."

In short, humans can delay gratification with complex, unprecedented rationales and outcomes in mind. We can imagine something that has never existed and purposefully create and endure stress, confusion, and/or tension in order to manifest that thing (art, engineering, synthetics, fitness goals).

However, our hypermediated realities that promise both the essentials and luxuries of life at the click of a button have made this special endurance skill much less valued. We value immediacy, ""my own truth"", detachment, argumentation... I would argue these values do not incorporate much long-term strategizing and encourage us to discount patient analysis and contemplation. We are more likely to give up in the face of difficulty, and these values often misalign with basic integrity. 

We seem to have collectively drifted away from valuing patience and hope, both of which help us use endurance and patience for manifestation. But we are training ourselves to be less hopeful and less patient in the face of tension/challenge. We see to expect ease and comfort as a given. 

Some examples: socially isolating ourselves in bubbles trains us to be less tolerant and enduring of unfamiliar perspectives. AI creating sentences for us makes us less tolerant to basic mental efforts. All types of conveniences make us less tolerant to physical exertion. 

The result appears to be that we have forgotten a fundamental part of our nature:  purposely and strategically enduring mental and physical discomfort for the sake of an imagined outcome may be our most valuable and unique skill."

I will divide this post into 3 categories. **preliminary data**, **my belief**, and **education**.   


*Disclaimer*: this will be a long post, so please come with an open mind and read all sections before going to the comments section. Even though I will respond, it will be slightly annoying if someone says something that I already covered in my post.  


**Preliminary Data**  
Firstly, there is a massive difference between having an opinion on an issue and being objectively wrong. Many conservatives use black people and the black communities in their political speeches, not knowing that they are objectively wrong.  Good examples of this are the claims that systemic racism does not exist, and people who talk about it are crying victim. They throw it alongside ""white guilt"" and ""white oppression"". Another thing that conservatives (and Asian Americans) try to do, is compare the successfulness of each community to create the false argument that the reason why asians are more successful is because they ""work harder"", ""value education"" etc.  


**My Belief**  
The reason why I believe that people often give hurtful, objectively wrong takes on the black community, is because they are uneducated on black history. Most of the arguments people use against systemic racism (for example), could easily be disproven by bringing out a history book and understanding the events of the past.  


I believe that black history month is a necessity. I believe that even though we celebrate black history month every year, clearly it's not effective because people do not understand the basic principles of black history. I believe that if we were to educate more people about black history, these uneducated racist beliefs would be removed. As of right now, I have a lot of faith and believe that this is a great solution. I believe that most people use black history month as a celebration, while ignoring what it stands for. Widespread Ignorance and Uneducated Perspectives Fuel Misguided Beliefs.  


**Education**  
This final section of my post is going to give arguments against the commonly held beliefs noted in the ('Preliminary Data') sections.  


# For those that deny systemic racism

It is well documented in history the specific policies that were put into place to confine black individuals into poor neighborhoods, with poor education, unable to buy homes, etc. Redlining and 'Separate but equal' are the first things that come into mind. If you are going to deny this fact, I will tolerate you, however keep in mind that you are proving my original title to be correct.

Anyways, the other argument that people make is to say that these policies are illegal now. Even though the policies are illegal, the impact it had was not only severe, but still prevalent. To understand why, we have the monopoly analogy.  


Let's say that you and your friends were playing monopoly for the past 3 hours. If someone else joins you after that time, would it be fair? Sure, the rules are exactly the same. But you would inherently be at a massive advantage because you were able to play the game for 3 hours before I was allowed to.   


Keep in mind, this analogy also explains equity pretty well. If I was given some sort of perk to help me catch up, I am not being 'against you'. I am not 'discriminating' against you. It was an attempt to make it more fair for everyone on the board.  


# For those that believe in the African American / Asian American success comparison and ""model minority"".

Conservatives and Asian Americans try to compare the successfulness of asian American communities to black communities, to create the false narrative that the reason why they are more successful is because they ""work harder"", ""value education"", etc.  


This sounds good at first, until you realize there are 3 massive advantages they have by default.  


1. Generally speaking, the way the us immigration policy works, is that it favors individuals with higher education and higher income, meaning they are more likely to already be at an advantage when they come here. This article explains it very well: [https://blogs.voanews.com/all-about-america/2016/04/11/why-asian-americans-are-the-most-educated-group-in-america/](https://blogs.voanews.com/all-about-america/2016/04/11/why-asian-americans-are-the-most-educated-group-in-america/)
2. The government also provides grants, business loans, and opportunities for said immigrants. Traditionally, African Americans have been denied these opportunities
3. immigrants in general did not have to face the same systemic issues that certain native-born groups did.

This entire 'model minority' thing is just a cheap way to discredit the struggles of the African American community.  


# African American Schooling

I will keep this section short because I have been typing for long enough.  


[https://www.floridabrightfutures.gov/](https://www.floridabrightfutures.gov/)

  
Someone tried to argue that this policy gives free education for everyone native born in Florida. The requirements:  


3.5 weighted GPA or better  
at least 1290 on the SAT  
and 100 hours of logged community service  


First on the SAT: [https://www.jbhe.com/features/53\_SAT.html](https://www.jbhe.com/features/53_SAT.html)

Clearly, one of the main factors in explaining the SAT racial gap is that black students almost across the board are not being adequately schooled to perform well on the SAT and similar tests. Public schools in many neighborhoods with large black populations are underfunded, inadequately staffed, and ill equipped to provide the same quality of secondary education that is offered in predominantly white suburban school districts.  
A major reason for the SAT racial gap appears to be explained by the fact that black students who take the SAT have not followed the same academic track as white students. It is true that 97 percent of both blacks and whites who take the SAT have studied algebra in high school. But in higher level mathematics courses such as trigonometry and calculus, whites hold a very large lead. In 2006, 47 percent of white SAT test takers had taken trigonometry in high school compared to 36 percent of black test takers. Some 30 percent of white test takers had taken calculus in high school. Only 15 percent of black students had taken calculus, one half as many as whites. Thirty-three percent of white SAT test takers had taken   


There is a lot more, but you get the point  


**Conclusion**

Anyways. Now that you have everything laid out, the preliminary, my belief, and the education. CMV!

By also observing relationships where there is an  huge income, usually combineded with an absurd age gap ( 20+ years), I believe there's no consent when someone dependes finanacially (can't provide for themselves) if their partner dissapperead.

They also don't have a will of themselfs: can't dress a certain way if their partners say so, can't go certian places if their partners say so, can't eat, sleep or deny sexual advances if their partner give them silent treatments, withdraw affection, money, etc.

Emotional depedency also blurs the line of consent for me."

2,2024-01-21,CMV: It would best for all sentient life if humans naturally went extinct,u/rustedoxygen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19c7n4p/cmv_it_would_best_for_all_sentient_life_if_humans/,changemyview,"Firstly, I believe that because humans’ theoretical evolution mostly happened at random, it could have easily been any other singly branch on the evolution tree that became as complex as us. Therefore just because we are given higher awareness/intelligence doesn’t mean we inherently hold higher value over any other kinds of sentient life.

Then, we have the overwhelming arguments that humans have higher capacities for evil than most sentient life. We can conceptualize future events, not just us doing them, but what other people/things might do, which allows us an advantage to scheme, perform multilateral manipulation of others, and with enough mindfulness, limit the vulnerableness and unawareness that gets most other less intelligent species killed or extinct. We typically have direct responsibility for our acts of insidious nature because we are self-aware enough to know what role our actions take in others’ lives, using empathy. On the animals side, we may not fully know if other animals possess this empathy or not when doing things like capturing/stalking prey, but we know for the most part that most don’t communicate with a language that tells others they know what they’re doing, which is where the harm of conscious insidious behavior spreads.

Therefore, due to the exponentially higher amount of self-aware evil that humans knowingly commit, I believe it would be moral for humans to take a step back on the Darwin ladder and become extinct to stop the torture that has been inflicted on other animals in the name of “we got to be the first species to be much smarter than you”. I believe this sentiment biased against non-humans, who like I said, I don’t believe has lesser inherent value than humans. If we were to go extinct, that doesn’t end all future intelligent life, and my hope is that the digital and ecological footprint left by humans would be a warning call for the next species that evolves to be self-aware, and if there is no next species, there’s still no moral right or wrong coming from this that I can think of. Can anyone change my view?"

I'm hoping to engage in some respectful conversation, I genuinely do want to change my view on this topic but I haven't had much luck talking myself into feeling differently. I personally find sex work to be offensive. I've had plenty of casual sex, I'm pretty adventurous, not a prude. I think the men who participate in paying for sex workers, strippers, onlyfans are disgusting. I'm very resentful toward the women who participate in giving these men an outlet for men to be unfaithful in a more easily accessible & discreet manner. I've seen many SW online brag about how men prefer them over their own partners, talk down on women who aren't as ""sexually liberated"" and just generally being condescending toward women outside the industry. What happened to women looking out for each other? How can you be proud to benefit off destroying relationships? I would never intentionally engage with a man who isn't single because the guilt would eat me alive. I believe SW should be safe & treated with kindness. I just can't get past the idea that some of these women can gleefully make a profit by providing married men with their ""services"". I know cheaters will cheat regardless, but why help & profit from it? I see it the same way as being a side chick, morally bankrupt. This mainly applies to women who choose the industry despite not needing to, those who do it for survival I view differently. I've met sex workers who are smart & kind. I'd like to not have this automatic bias against them, my brain is so stubborn. Let me know your thoughts, thanks!"

While I understand that pet preferences can be subjective, I genuinely believe that the loyalty, affection, and unique qualities of dogs surpass those of cats.  
Dogs are known for their unwavering loyalty and devotion to their owners. They form strong emotional bonds, providing a sense of companionship and security. Unlike cats, dogs are often eager to please and thrive on human interaction, making them fantastic companions for various activities.  
Additionally, dogs have a remarkable ability to sense and respond to their owner's emotions. Whether you're feeling happy, sad, or stressed, a dog's intuitive nature allows them to provide comfort and support. This emotional connection fosters a deep and meaningful relationship between humans and their canine companions.  
Moreover, the range of tasks and activities you can enjoy with a dog is vast. From outdoor adventures to playful activities at home, dogs are versatile companions that can adapt to various lifestyles. Their enthusiasm and energy contribute to a more active and engaging companionship.  
While I acknowledge that cats have their unique charm and appeal, I believe the overall companionship that dogs offer is unparalleled. Change my view: Convince me that cats can provide a companionship experience that surpasses that of dogs."

63,2024-01-21,CMV: Current harassment rules in schools and workplaces are too subjective because they are based on whether the behavior was unwanted or not instead of whether the behavior was inappropriate or not,u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19cb32s/cmv_current_harassment_rules_in_schools_and/,changemyview,"To be clear, I do think harassment is a serious problem affecting both men and women. I'm not trying to minimize anybody's trauma here. Many men/women have been harassed by other men/women and that's not at all Ok. 

But one of the things that bothers me about the way we currently talk about sexual harassment is that it's often ""did this person make you feel uncomfortable or not"" and not ""was this behavior objectively inappropriate."" 

If I'm walking behind somebody in a dark alley at night, they may very well feel uncomfortable. But I don't face consequences for that because it's generally recognized that the person I'm walking behind might feel uncomfortable even though I didn't do anything problematic. Same thing if the roles are reversed. 

That doesn't seem to be the case with workplace harassment. And the problem I see with that is that a myriad of factors will make a particular behavior seem more/less threatening even if the behavior is the same. For example, looks, fashion or lack of fashion, whether the other person is unkempt or not, mannerisms, and anxiety. 

If there was a list of behaviors that could be considered inappropriate, people would know whether their behavior was in line or out of line. If they behaved in a way that was within guidelines they wouldn't be punished. If they behaved in a way that was not in the guidelines they wouldn't automatically be punished, but they could be if it made the other person uncomfortable. This way women/men wouldn't face consequences just because the other person wasn't attracted or interested in them in some way and women could report harassment with confidence it will be dealt with. 

That's my view but I'm open to hearing other thoughts. CMV!"

A lot of students from Asia, especially East and India, seem to be really good at their work. They not only complete assignments well but also ask questions in a well-manner and professional way. 

When I give feedback on grades, these students don't usually complain. Instead, they ask how they can do better next time. On the other hand, some other students say I graded them unfairly until I explain why they got the grades they did. Just so you know, I don't want to mess up anyone's future, and I'm also a student working on a Ph.D.

Looking back at my two years as a teaching assistant, I can't ignore the idea of ""model minorities."" This means groups of students who consistently do well. But it worries me because it might make me biased or affect how I see things. Balancing this is tough because I want to be fair to everyone

The difference stands out when they ask questions. They don't just want answers; they genuinely want to understand the material. They hold more accountability to themselves rather than believe that society is against them.

When it comes to grading, the response from these students is different too. Instead of getting upset, they see feedback as a way to get better. They take it positively and want to improve. This creates a positive atmosphere for learning.

Dealing with other students who think they were graded unfairly can be challenging. It's essential to explain the reasons behind the grades. As a teaching assistant, my main goal is to help students learn and succeed in their studies.

The concept of ""model minorities"" has become more apparent to me over time in classroom space. This idea involves certain groups of students consistently doing well. While this might be true, it also brings up concerns about bias. I don't want to treat students differently based on stereotypes. It's crucial to be fair to everyone, no matter their background.

Reflecting on my role, I see the importance of maintaining a fair and inclusive learning environment. It's not just about noticing patterns but also about ensuring every student gets a fair chance.  But it’s so hard to ignore the pattern I see and experience in real life. 

In summary, my experiences as a teaching assistant have shown me some interesting patterns among students. However, it's crucial to balance these observations with a commitment to fairness and equality. Every student deserves a chance to succeed, regardless of where they come from."

My logic is as follows. 

1\. Globally, [around 8% of people identify as LGBTQ](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/lgbtq-population-by-country).   
2\. Identification is higher in where LGBT is more accepted, lower where it is shunned, but we should expect true numbers to be somewhat the same across our species even if people aren't publicly out of the closet.  
3\. Hamas [killed up to 1,139 people in Israel on October 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war)   
4\. The [IDF has killed more than 20,000 people in Gaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war) since October 7.   
5\. We have no reason to believe the the victims in each instance deviate significantly from their populations with respect LGBT status.  
6\. Taking a liberal estimate, 15% or 171 of the victims of Hamas on October 7 were LGBTQ.  
7\. Taking a conservative estimate, 4% or 800+ of the victims of the IDF since October 7 were LGBTQ. 

C1. Just counting the open hostilities, Hamas has killed no more than 171 LGBT people, and IDF has killed at least 800 LGBT people. 

8\. We have no reason to believe has killed more than 600 LGBT people outside open hostilities in the past year (They follow a law which commands them to kill LGBT people, and they likely kill some gay people just for being gay, but I'm unaware of this happening in any systematic way or in these numbers.)

C2. In all likelihood, the IDF has killed more LGBTQ people than Hamas has in the past year.

2,2024-01-21,CMV: Alimony should be abolished.,u/bigelow6698,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19cdbo5/cmv_alimony_should_be_abolished/,changemyview,"Please read the entire post before commenting, if you have something to say and then you read my entire post, you may be surprised to discover that I already addressed the point you were going to make. 

Remember, alimony is different from child support. If a couple breaks up and one person gets custody of the child, it makes logical sense for the non-custodial parent to be forced to pay child support to the custodial parent. 

Alimony is money you pay to your ex-husband/wife. This can happen, even if you never had any children. 

I believe that alimony should be abolished. 

Here are my reasons. 

Reason #1: If the expectation to continue to be a homemaker ceases after a divorce, then so should the expectation to be a breadwinner. 

Imagine one spouse goes to work while the other stays home to take care of the house and the children (assuming they have children). After the divorce, the home maker would not be compelled by court order to continue cooking for and cleaning up after his/her ex-spouse. If the homemaker is allowed to abandon his/her responsibility as a homemaker just because he/she does not feel like it, then the breadwinner should enjoy that same privilege. It is only fair. 

Reason #2: Being paid by your ex-spouse after the divorce is like being paid by your employer after losing your job. 

Point #1: 

Severance pay is not required. 
https://www.google.com/search?q=Severance+pay+is+not+required.&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US960&oq=Severance+pay+is+not+required.&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB4yDQgCEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgDEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgEEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgFEAAYhgMYgAQYigXSAQczMDVqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 

Point #2: 

Alimony has no time limit in some states. Depending on where you live, you can be required to pay alimony for the rest of your life ( https://www.cga.ct.gov/2014/rpt/2014-R-0036.htm#:~:text=Connecticut%20law%20does%20not%20set,indefinite%20or%20lifetime%20alimony%20order. ). In the state of Florida, there is a law that says alimony can last no longer than half the length of the marriage ( https://www.tampafamilylaw.com/divorce-family-law/alimony-spousal-support/florida-alimony-bill/#:~:text=Mid%2DTerm%20Marriage&text=Just%20like%20a%20short%2Dterm,paying%20ex%2Dspouse's%20gross%20income. ). Even at companies where severance pay exists, it is never the case (that I know of) that severance pay can last a lifetime or even that it is required to last half the amount of time you spent working at the company. 

Point #3: 

Comparing alimony to severance payment works, only if the person who initiated the divorce is the one paying the alimony. If the person who initiated the divorce is the one receiving alimony, that is analogous to your employer being required to pay you even after you have quit your job. Generally speaking, severance pay is not given to those who leave a job voluntarily. 

Statistics show that the overwhelming majority of divorces are initiated by women ( https://www.google.com/search?q=mpst+divorces+are+inititated+by+women&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US960&oq=mpst+divorces+are+inititated+by+women&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCDcyMjhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 ) and women are overwhelmingly the ones who receive alimony ( https://farzadlaw.com/divorce-statistics#:~:text=Nearly%2098%25%20of%20people%20receiving%20alimony%20are%20women. ). Clearly, the bias against men in the court system has created a situation where you can be rewarded for ending a marriage. 

Reason #3: You could (and I would argue should) get a job and receive government support in the meantime. 

Alimony was created in a time when women had very limited job options, and so alimony was just about the only way for a divorced woman to make ends meet. That is not the world in which we live today. Today, women account for almost half of the workforce ( https://www.bls.gov/blog/2017/12-stats-about-working-women.htm#:~:text=Women%20are%20Integral%20to%20Today's,three%2Dquarters%20of%20the%20workforce. ). 

If you are unable to work, then you can and probably should receive disability benefits. If, however, you are capable of working, then just do that. You can receive welfare benefits in the meantime. Universal Basic Income also sounds like a pretty good idea ( https://youtu.be/kl39KHS07Xc?si=EIhJYmknnX6_I0FO ). 

Imagine that your spouse asks you for a divorce. You get down on your hands and knees and beg your spouse not to divorce you. You make every promise you possibly can to change and improve the marriage, but your pleas fall on deaf ears. 

In this situation, if your spouse has to receive government benefits in order to make ends meet, you will have to support your ex-spouse through your tax dollars. However, every tax paying citizen will have as much financial responsibility to your ex-spouse as you do. This makes logical sense, as every tax paying citizen had as much say in the decision to end the marriage as you did. 

Reason #4: For as long as alimony exists, you could be rewarded for destroying your marriage.

If the lower earner cheated and that was the reason for the divorce, it would not be right to force the higher earner to pay alimony to the person who destroyed the marriage through infidelity. 

Gold digging has always been a thing. There have always been people who value their partners exclusively for their money. Alimony takes gold digging to a whole new level. Not only is the higher earner valued exclusively for his or her ability to provide financially, the higher earner is more useful to the lower earner after the divorce than he/she ever was while the couple was together. 

Reason #5: If you were abused physically and feel you are owed reparations, those reparations do not need to take place in the form of alimony. 

The argument in favour of alimony that may be on your mind is physical abuse. If you abused your spouse physically, then you should be forced to pay reparations. 

Obviously, being forced to pay reparations to someone you have abused makes logical sense. This does not need to take place in the form of alimony. I am pretty sure there are laws that allow you to sue someone for assault. 

Reason #6: If we go off the logic that you deserve to be compensated for the sacrifices you made during the marriage, then this should not be specific to married people.

Here is one hypothetical I hear a lot from those who support alimony. 

Imagine your spouse supports you through medical school and you become a rich doctor. Many proponents of alimony argue that, after the divorce, you are entitled to your ex-spouse’s money, because your ex-spouse would not have been able to make as much money as they did if it weren't for you supporting them. 

Imagine your aunt lets you live in her home to save money while you attend medical school. If you become a rich doctor, should you be compelled by court order to pay your aunt some of your money? No legal precedent that I know of allows this hypothetical aunt to take her niece or nephew to court and demand money from her niece or nephew. 

Suppose you have kidney disease and someone gives you a kidney. If it weren’t for this person, you would be dead. If you become a doctor, should you be compelled by court order to give money to the person who gave you a kidney? 

Reason #7: If you wish to receive money from your spouse following the divorce (and especially if you want it to be mandatory) you should ask for a contract that says so. 

If you decide to take time off of work so as to make sacrifices for the marriage, you know that being divorced and no longer having monetary support from your spouse is a real possibility. You ought to get a contract signed stating that your spouse will have to support you after the divorce, if that is what you want to happen. 

As it currently works, if you wish to get married and you do not want to have to pay alimony in the event of a divorce, you have to get a prenup signed, which specifies that no alimony will be paid in the event of a divorce. Some people feel awkward asking for a prenup, because it sounds like you expect the marriage to fail. If one person feels that the expectation to support your spouse should end when the marriage ends while the other person wants to receive monetary compensation following divorce, the latter is the one who should be placed in the awkward position of having to talk to a lawyer and get a contract signed guaranteeing that you will get what you want in the event of a divorce. That is because the latter is the one who feels entitled to someone else’s money and the former is the one who believes that you should have to stay married if you want to continue receiving support from your spouse."

How many of you have liked or dated a guy who follows a ton of other girls on Instagram and routinely likes scandalous bikini photos? Did it make you feel good and secure in your relationship or did you compare yourself to these ladies and come to the conclusion that you’re not good enough? Enough women have complained about the unrealistic beauty standards created by social media and the breakdown of the dating market by men having widespread access to beautiful women right at their fingertips but no one has done anything to stop it. We’ve pleaded with men since the dawn of time to controlling themselves and remain completely loyal but they’ve been relatively unreceptive. 

The only thing left for us to do as women is stop giving these men content to lust over. You can’t call yourself a girl’s girl if you’re posting pictures and videos on social media a.) wearing low cut, skin tight clothing to show the outline of your hourglass body, b.) wearing a push up bra two sizes too small with your boobs right in the camera, c.) making seductive facial expressions while lipsyncing to sexually explicit songs, or d.) turning your entire body to show your ass. 

Any woman who posts content like this on social media is doing it for the attention of men. I don’t care what they say. As a woman, you know how much drama thirst trap content causes in relationships and how insecure it makes other women feel. But you don’t care as long as you’re able to reap the benefits of social media popularity like money and pr packages. You also love the ego boost you get from men sending you dms and leaving comments telling you how hot you are. You can’t do something that you know is directly harming other women and call yourself a girl’s girl."

At such levels, in addition to psychological reactions, hearing damage is a risk (depending on the level and duration of exposure), and there have also been reports of migraine, vomiting and loss of equilibrium [160].

You cannot choose who you are celled with. You have to eat with them, at the times they eat, sleep with them, at the times they sleep, talk like they talk, watch out of all possible conflicts, be always on the lookout not to say anything stupid while still trying to appear tough, share bathrooms, and on and on. It is exhausting.

On the other hand, who wouldn't choose solitary confinement? Honestly, that is almost like a vacation. You don't have to worry about other people wanting to kill you or give you a hard time. You have your own time for yourself. It sounds too good to even believe they offer that in prisons, I even doubt it is real.

""But that is boring"" I never get bored by myself, it is others lying and manipulating and trying to harm me in general that is boring. I don't hurt myself. I am fine by myself. I just despise society. I wish I could go to some monastery in the Himalayas or something like that. I am just tired of being scammed with literally everything in modern society.

""But you don't have human warmth"" I don't care. I don't need others to feel fine. I just don't want to be forced to live like other people live. That is why I would choose solitary, and have all the time to think or just lay there meditating. One day they knock on the door and it is over.

1,2024-01-21,"CMV: Romantic relationships, by their very nature, are transactional.",u/SinopeLycanthrope,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19cekkw/cmv_romantic_relationships_by_their_very_nature/,changemyview,"For once, I am posting something that isn't a troll! Now all of you have officially seen everything.

&#x200B;

Love is a lie, there are no true equals, and romance is just business with a smiley face slapped on it. These declarations sound like some drug-addled spew from an insane basement dweller who has never left his room, but I may just be right. Maybe.

In ancient times, the Middle Ages, the Romans, ancient China, hell, even Sumer, relationships weren't about anything we modern humans perceive as ""love"". Marriage was a political bargaining tool or an opportunity to climb up in the caste system. Nothing more.

What modern humans perceive as love, that is, sexual attraction, was fulfilled in the form of concubines for the wealthy and brothels for the common man. Sex between the married was rare at best, and was more often initiated due to societal expectations rather than legitimate attraction.

We see this same logic often in modern times, women are dating ""up"" whereas men are dating at the same level, leading to the male loneliness epidemic and collapse of the birth rate. The rich are literally drowning in pussy, while the rest of us are starving for even the most basic human connection. Those women don't really ""love"" those men, and are often not even attracted to them. They're just rich.

Back in the day, we didn't have this problem, as women were dependent on men. In the nuclear family, we see the same dynamic as we have seen throughout history-the marital deal. That is, romance and marriage are strictly business. They are a business deal. In the nuclear family, the woman required a house, food, and clothing. The one thing she had to offer was sex. This spawned a transaction. She performs sexual acts, and he shelters her. 

We've seen this in every society where the rights of women were limited. The Islamic world, medieval Europe, modern-day Africa, ancient China, pre-feminism America, and so on.

But now, with the new post-feminism marital market and the destigmatization of breakups and divorce, there is simply no need for 90% of men anymore and those men have been left in the dust. If love was a real thing, how come so many of us have been cast to the side? Again, partnerships are just business deals. You always want a better deal. A richer man, a hotter woman. Everyone fiends for the best, and most settle in their 30s, but if the opportunity for a better deal comes up, of course you'll accept.

This isn't some crap redpill argument. Men do this too. Henry VIII went so far as to behead his brides when he saw a better deal, even further proving that this logic is human nature and is utterly timeless.

The dynamics we're seeing aren't ""OMG WAHMENS ARE EVIL AWALT AWALT FEMOIDS BAD FENEMIZM RUINED MY LIFEE"", it's just that women have a higher market value than men and get way more options. They don't have to settle for less until they're basically on their deathbed. Naturally, you'd flock to the best deal like you were perusing through insurance adverts. It's nobody's fault.

Women don't need men anymore. For money, they have a job. For emotional support, they have friends. The only real reason a woman would need a man is for sexual pleasure, so naturally, they flock to the most well-endowed. The best deal.

Relationships are strictly business, and that's all they ever were. If there was some mystical binding force that attracts men and women like magnets, why have most men been forgotten about as soon as they ceased to be useful?

This is why I never understood why women are mad that they're ""just sex"". Of course they are, in the same way men are just a wallet. A sale isn't about the dude selling it to you, it's about what you get out of it. Don't women understand this? Men understand it just fine. Women treat men as wallets, so why aren't they mad when men treat women like prostitutes? It's dehumanizing, but it's human nature to dominate, to feel superior, and thus dehumanize others. I, a man, fully understand that romance is just an overcomplicated form of sex work.

Back to human nature for a bit. People claim that the best relationship is an equal one. But there's no such thing as an equal relationship. You might as well say that the best animal in the world is a displacer beast. It's human nature to dominate others. Every ""romantic"" relationship has a dominant partner. This is typically the one with higher ""sexual market value"" (hotter, richer, etc.). They know they have multiple opportunities to get a better deal, and they know that you know. And they know you will do anything to keep them. So of course they sleep around and take your whole paycheck. And they're so happy that you put their name on your house and your shiny new car. And you let them get away with it.

People have been letting the dominant partners do whatever the fuck they want for millenia. If the queen put up a fuss about the king's concubines, she'd be tortured to death in the castle dungeon. If a peasant woman didn't like the idea of her ""dearly beloved"" getting piss drunk every night at the brothel, well, she got brutally beaten and kicked out.

Sex was never wholesome, or pure, or had any meaning at all, really. It was always either a casual dopamine rush, or a reward for your ""partner"" for doing your bidding (getting you more things you want out of the business deal). I never understood why religious folks think sex is holy or something. It's not. It's just something of value that people will do anything for. Oil isn't holy, and neither are pieces of paper with Washington's face plastered on them. Neither is gold, or silver, or jade, or seashells, or cacao.

And back to business deals, here's why she got mad that you had another girlfriend before her or lied about your height/yearly income, kids! Because as soon as she finds out the truth, she sees you in the same way she sees used car salesmen. You conned her into a bad deal. If another woman broke up with you, she can infer that you aren't a very good deal. A house that keeps going up for sale is going to drop in price, because if nobody wants it for long, there must be something wrong with it. You are used, damaged goods. She returned you to the market, and there must have been a good reason.

If you lied about your height or wealth on a dating site, then the reason she didn't call back is the same reason companies have been sued: false advertisement. You can't do that in business relationships, so, by proxy, you can't do that in ""romantic"" relationships either.

Love isn't real, and sex and romance were always strictly business.

&#x200B;

I understand that there may be holes in my opinion, that's why I'm coming here. This isn't a troll, I'm not gonna soapbox, this is a legitimate post. I promise. I need a different opinion here. This is the way I've thought about the world for a while, and I've come to realize it's kind of a fucked-up way to view things.

Please restore my faith in the human race.

Secondly, I realize not everyone is guilty of this. My post was prompted by a few comments in another thread asking why Chicanos/Latinos don’t have diversity in their group. It’s because they have their own cultural identity! That thread led me to the realization that a lot of people in America simply don’t have a culture/tradition they can identify with, so they push diversity & inclusion as a coping mechanism.

Here’s a thought for those people: What if others WANT to be culturally unique, what if they WANT to adhere to long held traditions and value systems? For example, chicanos/latinos are predominantly catholic in their religious beliefs, is that going to be a problem for those who preach inclusivity while also denouncing any form of religion? 

Here’s what you can refute: Why should diversity be encouraged when it destroys local culture? It’s ok to have your own cultural identity/traditions, not everyone has to look the same, dress the same, act the same, and parrot the same ideas as you. It’s ok to be different! It’s ok to know where you come from and to be PROUD of it. I’m tired of self-loathing people shirking the idea of tradition. We don’t need to be on the cutting-edge of everything, jumping behind every new idea. Put the Adderall down and take a chill pill for once lol ok I’m done."

They take any opportunity to praise Mahomes as so “unlucky” in his career while talking about how many breaks Brady has gotten in his playoff career. Here’s an example from @barryonhere on X:

“A teammate fumbling the ball out of the back of the endzone for an opponent touchback NEVER happened to Tom Brady ONCE in 381 career starts btw.”

This is one particular stat. For a more general look at Luck, let’s go through Mahomes playoff resume, shall we?

2020 Divisional Round: Chiefs go down 24-0 against the Texans early on. However, due to Bill O’Brien’s idiocy and the Texans falling apart on both sides of the ball, the Chiefs are able to come back and win.

2020 AFC Championship: The 9-7 Titans knocked off the 14-2 Ravens in the previous round, making the Chief’s route to the Super Bowl much easier. 

Super Bowl 54: Patrick Mahomes threw two interceptions in the first three quarters of the game and went was narrowly able to muster another comeback due to Kyle Shanahan choking and Jimmy G falling apart. Many missed penalties also.

2021 Divisional Round: Mahomes went down but the defense clutched up against Mayfield.

2022 Divisional Round: After Buffalo scored with 2 minutes left, Tyreek Hill had a massive miracle touchdown. After Buffalo scored again, KC went down the field in less than 13 seconds due to terrible defensive playcalling. The coin toss. May I say more.

2023 AFC Championship: This game went down to a hit out of bounds getting KC into field goal range. Very questionable reffing also.

Super Bowl 57: James Bradberry and excellent Special Teams play.

2024 Wildcard: Defense holding the #1 ranked offensive to 7 points in freezing temperatures.

2024 Divisional Round: Multiple deep passes by Allen dropped by his receivers, missed 44 yard field goal in final 2 minutes to tie the game.

As you can clearly see, there has been incredible luck present for the Chiefs to have the runs they’ve had, nearly as much as the Patriots had in their first few Championship runs. You can apply this logic to any other Dynasty, whether the Bulls, 49ers, Cowboys, Lakers, etc. Anyone peddling these arguments against one athlete or team has a personal vendetta to grind."

It assumes that the reason history repeats itself is because of a lack of knowledge or wisdom about the past. That horrible crimes and unjust atrocities are perpetuated because of a lack of knowledge about history. I think this is wrong - I think human beings will always behave like this because it's in our nature to behave like this, and no amount of book-learning is going to change that.  
Also remember that so many of the evil tyrants, despots, and dictators of history were usually well educated and well read individuals who studied history deeply. Stalin and Hitler were famously well read. Learning about famous statesmen, politicians, generals, etc has been a commonly documented activity of the ruling elite going back to ancient times. The thing is, those individuals choose to learn a different lesson from history that you or I might learn. For instance, a normal person might read about the period of the Holocaust/WW2 and think, ""hmm, what can we do to prevent such horrifying atrocities in the future"". Someone with the disposition of a Stalin, or a Pol Pot, might read about that same period history and think ""what can I do to avoid Hitler's mistakes in my quest for power?"". No amount of book-reading is going to change their fundamental nature.  
And yes, I understand that the vast majority of people are not bloodthirsty wannabe tyrants, but as long as the people who manipulate the levers of power and influence in the world are indifferent to the well-being of the common man (and they are, certainly), then humanity will always have pointless wars, populist dictators, petty tribalistic politics, etc. It is our nature to behave like this.  
At the end of the day, we are living beings that evolved on a world with finite resources, and thus evolution bred in us an inherent competitiveness, greed, lust, violence, myopia, us vs them mentality. This is deeper than human nature, it's the nature of most living things on Earth. History will continue to repeat itself until human nature changes, something which learning about the past will never be able to bring about.  
2) There's a smug, silent assumption on the part of the person posting this quote somewhere that they have, in fact, learned from history, while the ""other"" has not. But history is actually insanely complicated, and its variables and parameters are always changing, so a behavior or course of action that worked in 50 BC likely won't work in the 21st Century. We almost always look back at history and think that the ""right"" behavior was so simple, that it's shocking that people behaved otherwise, but this is just hindsight bias. We have to live history going forward, and that is hard, and the best decision to make is often very difficult to determine.  
Again, most of the statesmen and politicians of the past who have made horrible, boneheaded decisions were often well educated and well-read individuals (take, for instance, the politicians of Britain and France in the 1930's, during the period before WW2) who thought deeply about history, and yet they still made those mistakes. We like to think that, because we bought a history book off Amazon or from Barnes and Nobles, and spent the next few weeks reading it, that we are suddenly enlightened about history, but the reality is so much more complicated than that. Anyhow, rant over.  
TLDR: The mistakes of history are repeated, and always will be repeated, because of human nature, which is fixed, and this is something that will not be changed by learning/reading about history.

In 1971, Robert Nixon abolished the Britton woods system and never re instated (though he mentioned he would)... [The USD has maintained a free floating system (based on debt)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock) and the ramifications of that were so far reaching....  
  
[Take a look at this, and weep.](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)  
  
Here is the present mechanics of the USD system;  
  
\- The USD is debt and it is printed and for every dollar printed more is owed back( due to interest on that debt) in the form of government bonds. This means that the REAL GDP of an economy has to be able to produce enough real wealth to at least keep up with the interest + printing because the debt has to be paid back with currency exchanged for the real goods. If an economy does not produce enough real wealth/GDP growth, the country's government bond yields will spike and the value of a country's bonds will decrease and therefore its currency will also decrease in value as the currency is effectively a representation of a country's ability to pay back the government bond it represents.  
  
This is why we live in a debt based system. The currency is backed by debt.   
The debt is ever increasing as we print more to pay off more debt that we cannot afford to pay off with our GDP.   
Recession after Recession, bubble after bubble. Lives are ruined, stressed, more and more income disparity.  
And you see how your money does not buy the things it used to...people can't even afford to reproduce anymore, buy a home etc. and life gets harder for everyone.  


Fueling conflict, oppression, depression. drug abuse, tents encampments in major cities, massive illegal immigration, etc. etc.  


The bankers stay ""rich"" and conglomerates (bankers included) lobby your politicians to due their bidding ( and not make a change).  


 That's why; The Bankers are the source of the majority of pain in the modern (1970-now) world"
1,2024-01-22,"CMV: The ""How often do you think about the Roman Empire"" meme actually shows a profound and innate difference between men and women which damages the argument that there is little innate difference between the two sexes.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19cnsml/cmv_the_how_often_do_you_think_about_the_roman/,changemyview,"I remember not long ago there was this trend going around on Tikok(?) or some social media site where women were recording them asking their boyfriends/husbands how often they think about the Roman Empire. Almost all the men filmed gave answers ranging from ""at least once a week"" to ""every day"". This seems to be a common response for men, regardless of background or other factors.

This became a popular trend because women seemed to be completely and utterly bewildered that men would think about a historical empire this much. I think women mostly viewed this as an amusing curiosity and didn't give it much more thought beyond that.

But I think this actually shows a pretty profound difference in the core nature of men as opposed to women. There seems to be this idea in Western culture that men and women are much more similar than they are different and most of these differences are socially created and enforced, but I think a near-universal fascination with an ancient empire which is largely absent from women is not exactly something to which this can be attributed.

I think it speaks to a sort of ""shared psychology"" that men have where we marvel at the history of great civilizations and we admire those in the distant past who have been able to build and maintain such a glorious empire for so long.

The fact that women are so utterly bewildered by this fascination shows that they seem to, as a whole, lack this mentality that men seem to share on a deep level. I think it shows that maybe there are profound innate differences between men and women which are tied to our biological and natural roles as mammals. Men are focused on building civilization and the glut of cultural, logistical, and political facets which are part and parcel therein (the macro level), whereas women are more concerned with domestic matters and social connections, things on a more micro level. Both of these are critically important for civilization to function, and I think it speaks to a yin-yang relationship which is necessary for a healthy society.

So what do you guys make of this trend? Why are so many men fascinated with the Roman Empire? Does it speak to something innate about the nature of men as opposed to women? If not, why did women find this so bemusing? Is it wrong to say women aren't interested in historical civilizations in the same way men are? If so, why was this trend so popular?

Is there something else going on? Change my view."

Countless lives were lost and it seems that the war is at a stalemate with no end in sight. We can all agree on that part. 

If Ukraine had just allowed Russia to freely enter their nation then more lives wouldn't be killed. All this death and destruction wouldn't even be at the level it's at. 

Consider this: Ukraine lets Russia steamroll through and accepts a foreign occupational force under the whims of Putin. Ukraine then ignites peaceful protests, demonstrations, as a sign of unity and integrity against the invading oppressors.

You might counter that peaceful non-violence doesn't work well with dictatorships or oppressive regimes. While this may be true, it doesn't regard the fact that Russia is not in the same vein as Soviet-era Russia or Nazi Germany. Also, corruption is hugely endemic all over Russia, as well. So even if Ukraine would end up like Russia - Russia is at a point where it's still in a no better situation. 

You might also counter that fighting conventional war is the only way in the same vein as WW2 due to a sturdy, unwilling enemy hellbent on oppression and force. But you're losing lives, regardless. With or w/o conventional war. At least not fighting conventionally, you're minimizing the chances of destruction by trying to solve things as diplomatically as possible. Even if such diplomacy fails, which is high, you can still fight back with peace and love.

We know that morale amongst Russian soldiers is mixed at best, maybe at lows. We know Russians are willing to give themselves up and aren't gung ho in fighting for Putin's war. So imagine the level of growing empathy they would have by occupying a peaceful, non-threatening nation that voices their independence. Eventually, they will see the wrongs of what they are doing given enough time.

The war is costly and has permanently damaged relations and done great harm to the environment and to international commerce. All of this could've been avoided if Ukraine tried to solve this diplomatically and with the foresight of peace and non-violent resistance. 

Stop killing each other and solve things diplomatically. Use the means of Gandhi to solve your issues. "

Immigrants see opportunity and hope, both for themselves and their families, in this country. If anything, I’d be more worried if people weren’t trying to immigrate illegally. Long-term, the only solution is to create an easier path to citizenship for the honest immigrants and increase border enforcement to catch those who want to cut the line, human traffic, or sell drugs."

Like almost all of you, when I go on the internet, I am exposed to a plethora of qestern cultures and atmospheres. A common theme I see is that their western education systems are not as stressful as our eastern education systems. They talk about dating, have nearly failing grades such as 70s and 80s being acknowledged as amazing grades, and have multiple chances to pass the class. However, I as an Indian, find those very simple and easy. I only have one chance to pass my final examination, which counts as nearly 80% of my grade. My tests and prelims only count for 20% of my grade. In my school, the pass mark is 20%. Obviously, I have it harder than most westerners.

Moreso, imagine the amount of stress and studying an Indian has to do to get into a top college in India! 1st, they have to stufy from 6 to 7 hours per day for 2 years for either the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education or the Central Board of Secondary Education! Then, they have to study from 7 to 9 hours per day for 2 years for either the Indian School Certificate or the Central Board of Secondary Education. After that, they have to study for 10 to 12 hours per day for the Joint Entrance Examination, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering, etc, for 1 to 2 years! Chinese students have a similar ordeal. Meanwhile to get into an Ivy league college, one just has to learn a foreign language, do some social service, etc, for around 4 years! Obviously, the former is more stressful to be in.

In 2022, around 13,089 students died in India due to overstress. In South Korea, the number of students that committed suicide was 13,452 students in 2023. In China, the number of students that fell victim was 
11,296 students in 2021. Compare that with Greenland, which has only around 35 to 50 each year in the 2020s. In the France, only 300 to 350 teenagers commit suicide per year due to overstress. Therefore, we can conclude that more teenagers fall prey to overstress in eastern countries than in their western counterparts. The main reason why this occurs is the high population density in eastern countries which increases competition to get into good colleges."
1,2024-01-22,CMV: Privileged People (Mostly) Have No Right To Complain Or Be Upset About Issues In Their Lives,u/NomadicContrarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19cye0j/cmv_privileged_people_mostly_have_no_right_to/,changemyview,"**TLDR AT THE BOTTOM:**

Now I'll (24M) admit that I'm ready for some flak on this considering that this may be a touchy subject, but that's why I wanted to post about it on this sub, and as a way for me to hopefully gain more empathy for others, which I admittedly withheld for a long time after all the crap I went through.  
And that is the idea that privileged people (pro-athletes, attractive people, rich people, influencers etc.) shouldn't be complaining about many things in their lives. Now, I'm obviously not referring to morbid situations like losing a loved one, going through abuse, or other deeply traumatic stuff like that. I'm mostly referring to everything else that isn't of such a painful magnitude.

Let me give you a concrete example just to make things easier to understand. I have this former co-worker (28F), who, even after all these years, I still resent to my core (she's probably in my top 3 most hated people of all time). But why is that? Well, here are a number of reasons (in no particular order). She's attractive, comes from upper-middle class parents (who had her at a relatively young age), went to a private school, got married to her high school sweetheart at a prime age (26 and 27 respectively) that she went to prom with, and is an accountant at a relatively decent-sized firm whilst her husband is finishing up law school. I on the other hand have Asperger's, come from a middle middle-class family, never had a relationship, am planning on doing a PhD in epidemiology, and only had my first kiss a month ago whilst still being a virgin. Essentially, an inferior life compared to her virtually perfect one.

So with all the background stuff aside, how does this relate to my CMV? Well, essentially, I feel that people like this co-worker of mine have no right to be upset about issues in their lives (again, I'm not referring to the really morbid ones I mentioned that everyone goes through at some point). Just the thought of her being upset at other problems in her life, which are most likely trivial anyway given how much she and similar people have going for her, makes me almost livid to my core. I'd honestly wager my bank account that she was one of the people who ""struggled"" during the COVID lockdowns because she couldn't do her usual ""perfect life"" stuff and boast about it and completely forgot how much better she had it than 99% of people around her.

To give you another concrete example, I get tinge of lividness inside of me when I see attractive reporters on news channels and can't switch away from them, cause let's be real here, those people got their jobs mostly due to their looks and only had to meet basic qualifications. But regardless, they probably do not know what true tribulations are like I do, considering that, for instance, they probably just had to show up to social gatherings and bam, in a relatively instant matter, they get friends and partners just like that, unlike me where it took me 24 and a half years to get my first kiss, in case you needed a reminder.

So yeah, please feel free to share some of your takes on this, as I'm genuinely curious to hear them.

**TLDR:** Privileged people mostly don't have ""real"" problems that lesser privileged people do in their lives and thus have no right to complain about such issues given how trivial they most likely are.

Hamas wants to increase the number of civilians casualties and make the world pressure Israel to retreat. When you call for cease fire you are supporting and enabling the terrorist organization to keep operating and encouraging it to using the same human shield strategy in the future.

""I don't care about Hamas, thousands of dead civilians is bad""

Unfortunately, the war against terrorism is hard and takes sacrifices (and not only from the Palestinian side). There is no way around it. You can't stand thousands of deaths now? You will get hundreds of thousands in the next decades when Hamas will attack again.

And not only Hamas. The whole world is watching. If a relatively small terrorist organization like Hamas can paralyze a 10 times more powerful nation like Israel by this scale of human shield civilians, be sure they won't be the only one to do so.

""So Israel should be allowed to kill as many civilians as it wants without criticism?""

It's ok to criticize and demand Israel to show it does what it can to reduce civilians casualty to the minimum. This is different than calling for cease fire."
1,2024-01-22,CMV: Alimony should be abolished.,u/bigelow6698,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19cza6c/cmv_alimony_should_be_abolished/,changemyview,"Please read the entire post before commenting, if you have something to say and then you read my entire post, you may be surprised to discover that I already addressed the point you were going to make.

Remember, alimony is different from child support. If a couple breaks up and one person gets custody of the child, it makes logical sense for the non-custodial parent to be forced to pay child support to the custodial parent. 

Alimony is money you pay to your ex-husband/wife. This can happen, even if you never had any children. 

I believe that alimony should be abolished. 

Here are my reasons. 

Reason #1: If the expectation to continue to be a homemaker ceases after a divorce, then so should the expectation to be a breadwinner. 

Imagine one spouse goes to work while the other stays home to take care of the house and the children (assuming they have children). After the divorce, the home maker would not be compelled by court order to continue cooking for and cleaning up after his/her ex-spouse. If the homemaker is allowed to abandon his/her responsibility as a homemaker just because he/she does not feel like it, then the breadwinner should enjoy that same privilege. It is only fair. 

Reason #2: Being paid by your ex-spouse after the divorce is like being paid by your employer after losing your job. 

After losing your job, your former employer is not required to keep paying you. Therefore, after a divorce, you should not be required to keep paying your spouse. You may be thinking that severance pay is a real thing. However, let’s keep three points in mind. 

Point #1: 

Severance pay is not required. 
https://www.google.com/search?q=Severance+pay+is+not+required.&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US960&oq=Severance+pay+is+not+required.&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB4yDQgCEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgDEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgEEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgFEAAYhgMYgAQYigXSAQczMDVqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 

Point #2: 

Alimony has no time limit in some states. Depending on where you live, you can be required to pay alimony for the rest of your life ( https://www.cga.ct.gov/2014/rpt/2014-R-0036.htm#:~:text=Connecticut%20law%20does%20not%20set,indefinite%20or%20lifetime%20alimony%20order. ). In the state of Florida, there is a law that says alimony can last no longer than half the length of the marriage ( https://www.tampafamilylaw.com/divorce-family-law/alimony-spousal-support/florida-alimony-bill/#:~:text=Mid%2DTerm%20Marriage&text=Just%20like%20a%20short%2Dterm,paying%20ex%2Dspouse's%20gross%20income. ). Even at companies where severance pay exists, it is never the case (that I know of) that severance pay can last a lifetime or even that it is required to last half the amount of time you spent working at the company. 

Point #3: 

Comparing alimony to severance payment works, only if the person who initiated the divorce is the one paying the alimony. If the person who initiated the divorce is the one receiving alimony, that is analogous to your employer being required to pay you even after you have quit your job. Generally speaking, severance pay is not given to those who leave a job voluntarily. 

Statistics show that the overwhelming majority of divorces are initiated by women ( https://www.google.com/search?q=mpst+divorces+are+inititated+by+women&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US960&oq=mpst+divorces+are+inititated+by+women&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCDcyMjhqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 ) and women are overwhelmingly the ones who receive alimony ( https://farzadlaw.com/divorce-statistics#:~:text=Nearly%2098%25%20of%20people%20receiving%20alimony%20are%20women. ). Clearly, the bias against men in the court system has created a situation where you can be rewarded for ending a marriage. 

Reason #3: You could (and I would argue should) get a job and receive government support in the meantime. 

Alimony was created in a time when women had very limited job options, and so alimony was just about the only way for a divorced woman to make ends meet. That is not the world in which we live today. Today, women account for almost half of the workforce ( https://www.bls.gov/blog/2017/12-stats-about-working-women.htm#:~:text=Women%20are%20Integral%20to%20Today's,three%2Dquarters%20of%20the%20workforce. ). 

If you are unable to work, then you can and probably should receive disability benefits. If, however, you are capable of working, then just do that. You can receive welfare benefits in the meantime. Universal Basic Income also sounds like a pretty good idea ( https://youtu.be/kl39KHS07Xc?si=EIhJYmknnX6_I0FO ). 

Imagine that your spouse asks you for a divorce. You get down on your hands and knees and beg your spouse not to divorce you. You make every promise you possibly can to change and improve the marriage, but your pleas fall on deaf ears. 

In this situation, if your spouse has to receive government benefits in order to make ends meet, you will have to support your ex-spouse through your tax dollars. However, every tax paying citizen will have as much financial responsibility to your ex-spouse as you do. This makes logical sense, as every tax paying citizen had as much say in the decision to end the marriage as you did. 

Reason #4: For as long as alimony exists, you could be rewarded for destroying your marriage.

If the lower earner cheated and that was the reason for the divorce, it would not be right to force the higher earner to pay alimony to the person who destroyed the marriage through infidelity. 

Gold digging has always been a thing. There have always been people who value their partners exclusively for their money. Alimony takes gold digging to a whole new level. Not only is the higher earner valued exclusively for his or her ability to provide financially, the higher earner is more useful to the lower earner after the divorce than he/she ever was while the couple was together. 

Reason #5: If you were abused physically and feel you are owed reparations, those reparations do not need to take place in the form of alimony. 

The argument in favour of alimony that may be on your mind is physical abuse. If you abused your spouse physically, then you should be forced to pay reparations. 

Obviously, being forced to pay reparations to someone you have abused makes logical sense. This does not need to take place in the form of alimony. I am pretty sure there are laws that allow you to sue someone for assault. 

Reason #6: If we go off the logic that you deserve to be compensated for the sacrifices you made during the marriage, then this should not be specific to married people.

Here is one hypothetical I hear a lot from those who support alimony. 

Imagine your spouse supports you through medical school and you become a rich doctor. Many proponents of alimony argue that, after the divorce, you are entitled to your ex-spouse’s money, because your ex-spouse would not have been able to make as much money as they did if it weren't for you supporting them. 

Imagine your aunt lets you live in her home to save money while you attend medical school. If you become a rich doctor, should you be compelled by court order to pay your aunt some of your money? No legal precedent that I know of allows this hypothetical aunt to take her niece or nephew to court and demand money from her niece or nephew. 

Suppose you have kidney disease and someone gives you a kidney. If it weren’t for this person, you would be dead. If you become a doctor, should you be compelled by court order to give money to the person who gave you a kidney? 

Reason #7: If you wish to receive money from your spouse following the divorce (and especially if you want it to be mandatory) you should ask for a contract that says so. 

If you decide to take time off of work so as to make sacrifices for the marriage, you know that being divorced and no longer having monetary support from your spouse is a real possibility. You ought to get a contract signed stating that your spouse will have to support you after the divorce, if that is what you want to happen. 

As it currently works, if you wish to get married and you do not want to have to pay alimony in the event of a divorce, you have to get a prenup signed, which specifies that no alimony will be paid in the event of a divorce. Some people feel awkward asking for a prenup, because it sounds like you expect the marriage to fail. If one person feels that the expectation to support your spouse should end when the marriage ends while the other person wants to receive monetary compensation following divorce, the latter is the one who should be placed in the awkward position of having to talk to a lawyer and get a contract signed guaranteeing that you will get what you want in the event of a divorce. That is because the latter is the one who feels entitled to someone else’s money and the former is the one who believes that you should have to stay married if you want to continue receiving support from your spouse."

The people who defend the idea that you should only go for people with low body counts, bring up research which shows that people who have had more sexual partners are [more likely to cheat](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1348/000712605X47936) or have [less happy marriages](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/10/sexual-partners-and-marital-happiness/573493/). But even if this research is right, I think there is a clear and obvious explanation to it. Surely it's because people who have more sexual and relationship experience simply know a substandard lover when they get one, so of course they are more likely to cheat or break up and go look for someone better. 

So, to me, people who bring up such statistics are actually saying: 'the only way I can get someone to stay with me, is when they are so inexperienced that they won't even realise how bad a lover I am'. Surely, the right solution is to just become a better lover, no?

In fact, I very much prefer to date people with a lot of experience! I've got two main reasons:  
1. People who have more sexual experience will statistically speaking be better lovers. This means that dating someone with a higher body count will mean you will get better sex.  
2. If someone who has a high body count decides to date you, it's the best compliment - they are perfectly aware how good a time they could be getting with other people, but they prefer to be with you!"

Due to cancel culture any public entity requires a strong moral and ethical foundation in order to work, not just in its own infrastructure but also any representative of it. It keeps it entirely in check and shifts the power pole to the people. Isn’t this literally what Marx has thought of when he talks about the dictatorship of the proletarian but without it being ideological? You can’t cancel someone for the sake of canceling them, it has to be based on reasonable stance and allow for discourse, in which the accused party redeems themselves or digs their grave. You can argue for cases in which a people jump on a bandwagon abuse it but none of these have created valid existential threats that the everyday person doesn’t go though. Cancel culture strips these entities of a privilege but no of their position or existent, it gives em the right to earn it.

I’m don’t want to say it’s better than voting but it gives the people immediate control over the political landscape and isn’t this sort of the ultimate goal of a democracy? For the people, by the people. 


Maybe I don’t see it, even if the potential brutality and monstrosity of the mob mentality exists, but acts of canceling doesn’t exceed the Internet space and its impact lies on the public persona of the entity and their representative not a person itself. As a political movement and an organic democratic tool, I don’t see how we can ever set aside cancel culture. It’s important and necessary!"

Not only that, but I have friends that are republicans and friends that are democrats.

My democratic friends seem to be more into highlight people race, and dividing people into colors.

The republicans I know, seem to be more about hoping the government won't charge them too many taxes.

I've also experienced close relationships with both ends of the spectrum, and to be honest I never had a republican or someone from a red state highlight race as much, the only time someone talked a lot about race, was in  North  Carolina and it was a  Newyorker who moved there who was not very shy about his dislike of black folks.

In the south, the theme is how much money you make, the part of town you live in (I experienced that in Atlanta and Raleigh).

In the north is ""Your race?"", it was insane but in Boston and NYC people go on and on and on about heritages, and how they are 10% this, and 20% that.  Then you are told X area belongs to the Irish,  Y area is for the Italians, M Area is black, Puerto ricans over there, Asians there...

 In the south people seem to live side by side with little regard to who fits into what category.   The common denominator is once again, is this a nice area?  Nice homes?  Good shops around? How are schools?

Another thing I noticed is that as a Hispanic, the only people that ever highlight me being Hispanic have been people from the north.   Southerners NEVER EVER have higlighted the race category I fit in, and trust me, I've been around some really rough country folks from the south!     

In fact I feel safer driving around some small town in South Carolina, than I feel driving around some small town in Pennsylvania or upstate NY.

I was on a trip in Europe and met this ""Very liberal and highly educated individual from the North East with Italian roots"",  guess what he said?  I am an ethnic person in Europe, because I am latino!  I've gotten micro-aggression from him several times because even if he pretends he does not care, the topic of race seems to matter to him, and Ive also experienced that sort of I AM WHITE YOU'RE NOT vibe from liberal folks from NY and Chicago.

Ironically I toured Europe with southerners of different races and right leaning white American folks from North Carolina and never had anyone even talk about that sort of stuff!   If anything the common denominator was they are Americans in Europe and OMG the culture shock! No Target!

Now I am moving from North Carolina back to NYC and I am expecting it again to be all about heritage, race, as it used to be when I lived there in the 90s.   Here in NC in my daily job, daily interactions with people of all colors, I never hear people mentioning race or calling me Hispanic, this only happens with northern folks.

Am I right?  Or maybe it's just I got unlucky when I lived in NYC and Boston by being around racist folks?

They don't go along statements like ""you can't rate art objectively cause it's subjective"", by this logic the Mona Lise could be rated worse than the first time drawing a cartoon character art (w(). There's not a single artists or painter in human history who would do so, but this nonsensical way of avoid critical stance towards art"" has become established.

Enjoy art to enjoy art is a baseless proposition and does not contain the antecedents of why you're enjoying what you're enjoying, and giving a reasoning, relatable reasoning, means to objectivity it to some extent so subjects, beyond your own subject, could empathise with it. If I say X is objectively better than Y"" it just means that my reasoning for X being better than Y is understable and logical as to why I think X > Y. And btw, trying to explain why X > Y also means, again, having a logical reasoning to why X > Y (objectivificating it, even if it means in your own way).

And yet again, the term extends on its context. Engaging a discussion towards which art is better requires rationalisation of why X > Y, be it in your own ranking or general. Simply, it requires intellect and thinking, more specifically critical thinking and exploration of the properties of your art. If someone tells me this first time drawing of a spongbob art is better than the Mona Lisa, one of the most treasures art in human history, then I require an reasonable explanation of why he thinks what he thinks.

And saying I think it, because I think it as it is subjective is literally the worst tautological argument ever. And applying scepticism and denial of universal and synthetical truths leads us nowhere near an intellectual convo So, when a person says f.e. X is objectively better than Y, then we don't mean it's an undeniable, apodictic, identitical, synthetic approved, semiotic and syntactic, declarative, perlocutionary independent truth, but simply there's more reasonable arguments for having X above Y 

When the term „objectivity"" is used in art, we don't use any axiomatic, apodictic truths or any immanence bivalence in atomic proportions or any semiotic, syntactic inferences. Objectivity is a language term bounded to the neogolistic and dialectological diachrony of language itself and follows, like Wittgenstein postulated, an neogolistic development related to its context. The term theory"" has an dialectological equivocation immanent, how the potential of the singular term theory"" unfolds depends on the circumstances the term is being used in. Same goes for objectivity, there's no normativ universal definition for any circumstance the terrn is being used it, and it's not a fallacy either as long you elaborate on the equivocation of the term, since the term has different meanings like the term theory in sciences and common language."

In my opinion, for those like myself who want to see truly progressive policies passed in the United States sooner rather than later, Donald Trump beating Joe Biden in 2024 gets America closer to those policies in a faster timeline than if Biden were to win. 

My main argument in support of this view is that Trump would be so absolutely horrendous for the interests of the vast majority of Americans if he were to serve a 2nd term, that it would absolutely devastate the long term viability of the Republican party moving forward. There will always be a significant portion of the American electorate that will vote Republican no matter what, but I see that core base shrinking over time after the inevitable disaster of another 4 years of Trump. Anyone who identifies as moderate, left, far left, independent, etc would blame the Republican party for enabling Trump and I predict that would cause a huge leftward shift in American politics. Republicans would get decimated in the 2028 elections due to how unhappy voters would be with them in the aftermath of Trump's 2nd term, and this could potentially open the door for progressives to run campaigns on drastic reform instead of continuing ""business as usual"". These progressive candidates can run on policies such as universal healthcare, tuition free public college, canceling student debt, affordable childcare, federally guaranteed paid parental leave, and higher taxes on the top 1% of Americans. 

In contrast, if Biden wins, the democratic party will be empowered to not push for any of these big reforms because they were able to win on keeping the status quo. It is unlikely that any progressive reforms will be taken seriously by the Democrats in their 2028 platform, because they would deem it strategically unnecessary. Furthermore, in the absense of these big reforms that would improve the economic well-being of everyday Americans, the GOP can continue campaigning on the premise that Democrats haven't done enough to improve things for working class voters. This could very well lead to a Republican president being elected in 2028 who supports all of Trump's policies, but is much more competent than Trump and doesn't have all the baggage (legal and otherwise). Obviously, this hypothetical result would ensure that progressive policies would not be enacted anytime soon because a Republican president would never sign off on them. The democratic party might even still be campaigning for ""moderate reform"" instead of actual progressive policy in 2032 if they're looking to beat an incumbent Republican president. Therefore, in my opinion, progressive policies actually have a better shot at becoming a part of political discourse and actually implemented sooner if Trump wins in 2024. It would be a dumpster fire in the short term, but as a result it would be a victory for progressives if we took a long term view of what the future holds."

I feel that America puts a specific pressure upon men to create a society where men are put in an arena to fight for their own survival, and to prove to women that they can survive. Women are consciously and subconsciously aware of this, and choose their mates based on two standards - survival in the immediate environment (that the woman grew up in) and survival in the bigger society of the nation they grew up in. Don't get me wrong, I know that passion, chemistry, romance, and other factors are in play here - however... I would argue that those factors are influenced by the environment.

What i am still confused about is how and why anybody would in their right mind continue to ignore and label this as a non-issue, and why denying this has become to popular, and lastly why so many native peoples are so lethargic and care so little for their ancestral and cultural heritage.

 In most of the West, demographic statistics back up the claims that the birth rates of developing countries and the native peoples who reside in them are declining rapidly. I am not saying dying off, but declining, which on it's own should be not a problem in relation to the context of this issue, but that in conjunction with the reality of the modern world does make this a real problem for our societies.

By reality of a modern world, I am referring to the declining global situation and the inevitabilities that will follow, including the mass migration of people from the Middle East and Africa to Europe. It has been said that as of right now, hundreds of millions of people across the world could be applicable to become asylum seekers according to the UN and apply in Europe. Current international law obligates states to provide and to not send these people back in case of persecution etc, which means in continental Europe refugee camps and here in the UK literally wherever the government wants to dump them. These Asylum seekers or criminals as i will now refer to them are dumped in seemingly random communities where they are more often than not completely unwanted and often scare the locals. Most of these criminals are young men, and that combined with that backwards sensibilities is an understandable reason why local people are scared. If we are to be generous and say that only half of them are not deported, then based on the numbers alone of the criminal arrivals, then the numbers are in the 10's of thousands and not so much. The problem here is that the number is too large when taking the low character of these sorts of people, who care not for our laws and almost certainly not for our ways. Most of them are opportunists and cowards who are here solely to exploit us and our society. It is not unreasonable to say that a third of them likely go on to commit further crimes once granted asylum.

But those are just the illegal arrivals. The real and harder problem to tackle is the legal ones. Europe and the developed Western nations are obviously the current pinnacle of human civilization, which combined with the temperate and hospitable climate make it the obvious choice to move to. And come they have in increasingly larger numbers every year (thanks to the scum Blair). In the span of 40 years, actual native British people have dropped from 95% to 73% of the population by 2021. London itself is now majority inhabited by non-(ethnic )British people while other areas like Luton and Leicester are 30% and even an area of Brent has 0.0% British people there. I would like to clarify two things here: Firstly, i am not saying non-whites can't be British, and second, that when i say British i am referring to ethnicity and as such white British, who are whether you like it or not, are the native people of the United Kingdom. 

This is and should not be a controversial statement. My main point here being is that immigration to the UK and likely Europe is going to get worse and it is causing problems, such as communities in the UK transforming to reflect the culture of those who live there, as another problem in this country with immigration is the fact that immigrant communities fail or outright refuse to integrate into a British way of life. They often conglomerate in these segregated racial ethno-religious communities which almost always causes ethnic and religious tension, as we saw recently between Hindu Indians and Muslim Asians in Leicester. Under normal circumstances, having isolated communities would be the end of it, but the issue is if we harken back that immigrants to Europe have a much higher birth rate than Europeans likely because of their backward cultural norms and the utterly different societies in which these people originate. These people who fail/refuse to integrate bring with them their own demographic inevitabilities which include the massive population increase we are seeing in that part of the world. While the European birth rates collapse, these people who now live in our land and are still increasing while even if we assume that at best third and fourth generation immigrants eventually and naturally integrate into the Western style including our birth rates, this fact is null when we take into account that 40% of foreigners to the UK alive came in the last decade. This is barely the time for a second generation, never mind a third and fourth. This is reinforcing that a large portion of these immigrants are first generation and thus primarily corrupted by their old and backwards ways, much more resistant to integration. This issue will eventually reach a point where new immigrants will see no need to integrate at all to British values, considering that such a large portion of the population remains and acts as foreign as when they arrived and new arrivals will have little practical need to do so. Under current demographic rates, basic math suggests that in the next century or two, native British people will become a minority in their own land.

Taking all these facts and inevitabilities into account, I would appreciate it and ask you how the statistical projections are wrong and how my country will not become London, Luton or Leicester nationwide in the next century or two. Is there going to be some miracle end to the migration crisis that i don't know about, is there going to be some massive re-migration event like the Jews going back home to Israel or is the native population going to go back to post-war birth rates by some natalist miracle and somehow be successful where it repeatedly fails everywhere else. As far as i can tell, there is very little hope under current circumstances that the latter will not happen in the given time frame but if you would like to enlighten me, please do. I fear that British values that enlightened the world over are going be relegated to irrelevance and replaced by the foreign backwardness that plagues the world today."

7,2024-01-22,CMV: There's minimal benefit to liking popular things and you should be happy if others dislike your interests,u/uwantallofdis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19d7s06/cmv_theres_minimal_benefit_to_liking_popular/,changemyview,"So, I was having some banter with friends who were clowning me for being a Swiftie but also being a visceral Drake hater. But I'm not here to talk about music. 

It made me realize that while when I was younger, I felt like I wanted to ""justify"" my opinion-interests (e.g. liking Android instead of Apple or Blackberry,  preferring Nintendo games to Xbox, or arguing that LeBron was better than Kobe). But now, I've realized it's better if I like something other than the dominant fan-favourite. 

If I like Android more than Apple, I should be happy that people are flocking to iPhones, it means that there's less demand for the Android phones I want and that makes them both chelated and easier to get (less likely to sell out). Same logic applies to me wanting to get Nintendo games on release date or LeBrons instead of Kobes). 

If I don't like Drake, then it means that I won't be drawn into buying expensive tickets to his concerts or clothing lines. On the other hand, I shouldn't try to convince people into liking Taylor Swift because if I'm successful, I'll have increased the competition for the limited resource (tickets) which is acting against my own interests. 

One thing I've seen this a lot is with golf courses. A ton of people got into golf during COVID and now courses are more expensive and more busy, making way for slower rounds. While I've tried to convince friends to get into golf, I've come to realize it's better instead to seek out people that already play the sport without much prompting. 

This is in addition to the fact that it's inherently really hard to change people's opinions in short periods of time. So by spending energy to convince someone they're wrong for liking an alternative to your preference, you: 
1) have a very level of successfully changing their minds 
2) even if you are successful, have only succeeded in making it more expensive/difficult to do what you enjoy. 

TLDR: don't try to make people like what you like because that only makes things worse for you"

The internet is gated off by actors with money, because what originally was supposed to occur has now become perverted by capitalism. 

But it's not solely money -- dating apps will give only the extremely attractive men every option to date and find love. It will give attractive women too many options. But it will give less than near perfect standard people nowhere near as good an option for dating and marrying, because 90-95% of matches goes to an absurdly small % of people on these apps. In this case, it didn't democratize anything because human choice and preference maintains the same, making the apps pointless. 

Looking to social media, our likely online third spaces, we see the same. Many of us post videos and photos, but only a small % of people get the opportunity for a bigger community. It is the same with products, brands, services -- the attention based economy where it is ""democratized"" is a sham -- only a small % gets all the attention and they pay for it.

People frame this conflict as a two-sided issue with two bad players when in reality it’s one side attacking and another retaliating.

Most of Israel/Palestine was uninhabited before 1880. Tel Aviv didn’t exist and Jerusalem was 50/50 Jews/Muslims. So this, in my view, dispute the claim that Jews came and stole land.

The claim of stolen land comes from the Nakba, and even that was preceded by Arab riots and attacks against Jews. 

There has been virtually no conflict that wasn’t at the very least started by some type of attack. War of 1948 was started after all sides attacked. Six-day war was started as Egypt was planning an invasion. Yom Kippur war was an attack. The intifada started with Palestinian riots. The current was was started by a Hamas invasion.

Please explain how Israel is at equal fault without having attacked first throughout history."

32,2024-01-22,CMV: moderate or centrist populism can exist. Populism isn't exclusive to the far right and far left of politics.,u/SnooPeripherals2455,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19daf4h/cmv_moderate_or_centrist_populism_can_exist/,changemyview,"Populism is defined by the cambridge dictonary as ""political ideas and activities that are intended to get the support of ordinary people by giving them what they want"" so by viewing populism through that lense and definition then isn't the more moderate position in politics the truly populist one. However in the west only the far left and far right positions delivered by firebrands are considered the populist postion. 

Consider the topic of abortion. The majority of Americans support abortion to be legal under some circumstances according to the Gallup poll 51 percent believe this according to polling done in July of 2023. So why do we as society only believe that either the far right or the far left represents a populist position on the matter when their beliefs are in the minority making their postions out of the populist norm. 

Consider the controversy of Pennsylvania senator John fetterman recently with his unequivocally support for Israel in the current Israel hamas war. John fetterman wasn't elected by the people of Pennsylvania to support Palestinian issues. He was elected to support democracy and to prevent a nationwide abortion ban. The moderate voters who swung to him in suburban Philadelphia counties didn't care about that issue because it wasn't an issue then or they might actually support Israel. So wouldn't that make fettermans position a populist one if populism is simply supporting the ideas that your constituents want you to support. Why do people consider him compromised when he never had major opinions on palestine in the past as lt. Govenor or mayor of Braddock pa. 

So why do we consider the politics of either bernie sanders and Jeremy corbyn on the left and Nigel farage and donald Trump populist when based on the definition of populism their ideas would be accepted by the minority of voters. Maybe people like them and others ""tell it like it is"" but does that make them populist based on the defiention of the word. Consider the topic of health insurance in America according to Gallup polling in January of 2023 57 percent of Americans said government should ensure some form of health coverage for all but 53 percent think the private industry should run it not the government and a majority like the affordable care act. So why is these positions not considered the populist ones and the minority of support for Medicare for all at 43 percent according to Gallup poll research.

Now, I've matured since then, and I've realized that Palestinians are OBJECTIVELY more oppressed than Israelis (and I say this as someone who supports Israel). The conditions they live in are clearly way less favorable than Israelis, they go through way more hell with checkpoints and stuff, they have basically no government, and they barely receive any support from the West.

However, the thing that still doesn't make sense to me is how people always bring up these flaws as being connected to the fact that Israel is an ""apartheid state,"" is on ""stolen land,"" ""relies on ethnic cleansing,"" and ""has always been the oppressor.""

As someone who's done a ton of research on this topic, I'm not going to go into everything, but here are some key points about the history of this conflict that give context to this situation:

* Jews are literally native to the land--yes, thousands of years ago, but still native to the land. That's not to say that Palestinians don't ALSO have a long presence in the land
* Even after being kicked out of their own land, there still was a Jewish presence in the land for several years--Jews never ""completely went away,"" and the population significantly grew leading up to the creation of Israel, before the plan to create a Jewish state was even on the table, so it's not like when Jews ""took over the land,"" they came out of nowhere
* During the early 20th century, Jews were treated absolutely terribly in Mandatory Palestine and were consistently massacred
* Jews were also kicked out of several surrounding Middle Eastern countries simply for being Jewish
* Although there were SOME people who had the end-goal of Jewish statehood in mind, that was not the case for everyone, and there were several treaties experimented with that would simply ""allow for a Jewish homeland in Palestine"" WITHOUT expelling or disrupting anyone who lived there--essentially, a one-state solution in which Arabs and Jews would have equal rights. The Arabs rejected this because they did not want to live in a country alongside Jews
* Then, Palestine rejected a two-state solution. Again, this was AFTER they had already been offered several opportunities to live in ONE STATE alongside Jewish immigrants who were already there. Israel becomes a state, and Palestine bombs them the day after
* As the years go on, Israel keeps making Palestinians' lives harder and harder, BUT, many of the ""inconveniences"" such as checkpoints, were literally in response to suicide bombings from the Palestinians that killed several Israelis

Now, do I think this makes it all justified what Israel is doing now? Absolutely not. I think there's so many better decisions Israel could have made in the past 75 years. But, read all of those points above, and pretend that the people I mentioned were reversed: Whenever I mention Jews or Israelis, pretend I'm talking about Arabs or Palestinians, and vice versa. Or, think of any other geopolitical conflict between a ""white"" group of people, and a ""non-white"" group of people, such as Brits vs. Native Americans--and whenever I mention Arabs or Palestinians, imagine I'm talking about the ""whiter"" of the two groups, and vice versa for Jews/Israelis.

In this situation--if a ""not white"" group went through what the Jews went through to ""get"" Israel--from a land that consisted majorly of ""white"" people--reclaiming land, moving there as immigrants after getting kicked out of other countries, accepted peace treaties, and took steps to protect their people from violence--do you think anyone who is now supporting Palestine would say that they were in the wrong?

My bet is: Absolutely not. They would be backing that ""not-white"" group 1000000% for ""resisting oppression"" and taking over ""colonizing forces"" and they wouldn't give a shit about the ""white"" group who lives under harsher conditions on occupied land."
24,2024-01-22,CMV: Captain America was wrong in Avenger Civil War,u/JoyIkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19derq4/cmv_captain_america_was_wrong_in_avenger_civil_war/,changemyview,"I know this is an old topic but i would still like to have a go at it. I think Iron Man was right in Civil War and Captain America was just being unreasonable. 

So in Avenger Civil War, the world government can no longer turn a blind eye to the actions of the Avenger and passed the Sokovia Accord which states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary. There are also provisions on the regulations of enhanced individuals but that's another topic. I also won't go into details about the Accord, rather i want to look at the general idea of the Accord.

To reiterate, the Avengers - an organization comprised of some of the most powerful individuals in the history of humanity will be placed under the control of a UN panel in which they can only act after being sanctioned by said panel. As for the implementation, i imagine it would be something like the UNSC which we currently have but without the Veto power (hopefully). 

For the arguments, Iron man believed that the Accord is necessary since it will legitimize the actions of the Avenger and with official public support, there would be less damage. In other words, he wants the Avenger to be held accountable for their actions.

Captain America, on the other hand, believed that the government should not be in control of the Avenger since they could abuse their power for political gains. They could stop the Avenger from doing the right things when it is necessary.

In my opinion, Captain America's view is too idealistic and too arrogant. 

First of all, the Accord wasn't the product of the US government, it was drafted and passed by 117 nations around the world. It is effectively a decision of the world. So the argument that any single nation can use it to benefit themselves is lackluster. Also, it doesn't seem the Accord can force them to do anything, they just need to have clearance when they want to do something. So the Avengers would not become some sort of tool, rather, they would only be limited in what they can do.

Second, Cap's way of thinking that the Avenger ""always knows best"" is inherently arrogant, egotistical and authoritarian. The Avengers are not infallible, in fact, after everything, they were much more prone to error than regular people. A system must able to handle the worst situation, a system that relies on factors outside of its control like ""trust"" is inherently not reliable. What if the Avengers turn rouge? what if, to protect his friends, Cap is willing to go and commit crimes? to bust his friends out of jail? Expecting a man (no matter how virtuous) to always choose the best option for all in every case is delusional. It's the rhetoric of dictators and single-party states use: ""There is no need for regulations since I/the party always knows best and will never become corrupted"".

Thirdly, there is also the issue of liability. The Avenger has no authority to conduct the actions they performed in any country. What gives them the right to attack people without any warrant, without giving people their day in court? What gives them the right to main, cripple and kill people without any sort of judgment or verdict? Why can the Avengers deny people their right to due process? ""Well, because they are Hydra agents"" is not a valid excuse. What gives them the right to unleash an uncontrollable behemoth with no regard for collateral damages? They made these decisions by themselves without consulting anyone and refused to take responsibility. Also, the Avengers can't just waltz into any country and do whatever they want, whenever they want in the name of ""beating up the bad guy"". They spat in the face of all those countries they fought in. 

In short, this is not a viable option for using their power for the good of the people when they apparently care more about beating up bad guys than protecting people.

I know this is just a comic book movie and i agree, they can do whatever they want. I'm merely saying that if you apply that scenario to the real world, Captain America would most certainly be in the wrong."

I feel so upset about it and I think I missed out on some of the greatest opportunities for sex.  
When I was like 16 years old I had rock hard erections and could masturbate and cum multiple times a day and still want more. I was so overwhelmed with horniness i felt like I could go crazy. Now I dont even have that same feeling anymore :(  
I know people say shit like sex as a grown up is ""better"" because of things like experience but it doesnt make me sense to me. I missed out on sex as a teenager so how the heck am I gonna enjoy sex as a adult if I didnt experience to begin with?  
furthermore, dating and finding sexual partners with other adults just seems so difficult and stressful. adults seem more jaded and not interested in fun. And I worry I will be the same.  
I worry I will not care about sex as a grown up and seeing naked women wont even excite me. I wlll probably only care about money and power.  
plus, I didnt do shit like go to a aquarium with a girl, take her to eat ice cream, make out with her after school and in the car. it really saddens me so much. As another user stated here, it doesnt seem as ""magical""  
im only 19 and the laws where I live say its okay for me to still date a girl whos like 16 and I wanna do that because adult women seem much more intimidating and have ""higher standards"".  
I wanna do the things I missed out on like take her to a aquarium, eat ice cream at a park, go to a carnval and eat cotton candy, and so much more."

Then a chap pulled out a cigarette packet and everyone scoffed and started abusing them, saying just one is enough to get cancer so they won’t smoke them, but I got a free one so I’m not declining, just like I’m not declining a free hit(s) of a vape.

My reasoning is that nobody fussed about sitting next to a campfire, walking next to a main road etc, where the number of carcinogens being offered accumulates to approximately the same as that of a cigarette. Furthermore, while everyone gets cancers daily, the body is usually able to fight them off and eliminate them.

So your body will get its immune system working out to repair the damage induced by the cigarette."
1,2024-01-23,"CMV: Social media ""points"" (karma, hearts, likes, etc) ruined more platforms than advertisers and commercialization.",u/Peaceful_Browsing,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19dhs3v/cmv_social_media_points_karma_hearts_likes_etc/,changemyview,"Both of these brought good and bad features. Let's start with ""points"".

If the community is good, there's nothing wrong with having points in it. My monkey brain likes to see number go up, no doubt about it. But if the community is bad, it creates an echo chamber that's reinforced not only by a slew of comments from angry community members, but also with comment suppression with negative points.

The point system drives reposts and bot accounts. Not that they wouldn't exist without it, and people still create things (games and video back in the days of flash, now just fake stories on outrage subs and tumblr) for attention and not for points. But a point system definitely exacerbates it.

Points are also used incorrectly. At its inception, karma as a mechanic was supposed to promote contributions to the discussion. Now it's a reaction button, used to punish bad opinions and reward good opinions. It would be one thing if the karma didn't matter, but low karma results in hidden comments or barred entry to certain communities. Likewise with YouTube, videos used to be rated on a scale. Then they replaced that with a simple good/bad mechanic. And now that's pretty much gone, so there's no point to ""liking"" a video except for adding it to a playlist or for boosting it in the algorithm.

Contrast that with commercialization. For those of you old enough to remember the internet's gilded age, you're also old enough to remember just how rotten it was. Things were less centralized on the major platforms, sure, and many people weren't just in it for the money when they put something out. *But* on the flip side, there was much less regulation. You could go see porn on YouTube, snuff films on Facebook, and open pedo communities on reddit. And that's not even considering all the smaller websites with huge communities that were floating around at the time with much moderation.

Once these platforms began to rely on advertisers, they were forced to curate the content. This made everything feel the same, sure, but gross shit that was *everywhere* began to go away. The internet culture from 20, hell, 15 years ago is almost unrecognizable. And I'm not just talking about the rage comics that got replaced by soyjacks. We're talking about entire communities built on the concept of hate. The words you'd get banned for today, or cancelled for, were just part of everybody's every day vernacular. Fuck the advertisers for taking away the edge and the variety, but thank god the scum has mostly scattered to the darker corners of the internet.

All that to say, CMV. Adding points to these websites has made more platforms worse than the commercialization."
1,2024-01-23,CMV: Stoning adulterers is actually a good idea,u/Knucklesof_Steel619,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19dinnh/cmv_stoning_adulterers_is_actually_a_good_idea/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I am not advocating violence or spousal abuse in any way shape or form.

With that being said, here’s my position. I think that stoning adulterers to death is a good idea because it would make someone think twice about doing something like that. Adultery destroys people’s families, marriages, and lives and I think the punishment of stoning would be a good deterrent to infidelity. Now picture this: You’re living in the Middle East 2000 years ago and you’ve just seen the adulterous whore of the town get stoned to death along with the man she had sex with. Now imagine the fear that would instill into all the potential cheaters in that society due to having watched adulterers die in agony. With infidelity rates being the highest in the [western](https://www.statista.com/chart/6841/the-most-unfaithful-nationalities/) world, I think we could learn something from the Islamic world. I’m not even Muslim, but I think some of the sharia laws are good ideas that could be useful here in the west."

You want to make a decision? Your decision will be based on your knowledge of what your deciding, relevant experience, and your opinion. So let's say you were making a decision on whether to do some risky activity: that will depend on things like how knowledgeable you are of the risks (which depends on how much research you've done, what you've heard from others, and so on) how skilled you are at things related to the activity, how fun the activity looks to you, etc; not how developed your brain is.

A person is immature? Maybe they've been hanging around other immature people or spent a lot of their life looking at/reading silly stuff on the internet or watching lots of silly movies. A person is very mature? Maybe they've spent a lot of time around much older people or been exposed to lots of adult-rated content or experienced traumatic events (ex: abuse).

With that being said, how developed your brain is doesn't really make a difference. If a teenager magically made their brain as developed as a 25 year old's brain or if an adult magically reversed their development to that of a teen, they're not going to change whatever decision they just made or all of a sudden start acting more/less mature or different.."

Students can still ask questions and discuss among themselves using chatrooms and they can look up old discussion. Teachers would have more time to consider their answers.

Often times you'd just be looking into a dark window with your own reflection compared to being able to angrily/judgementally look at another driver following their actions.

This works to quickly descalate driving frustrations since you cannot see any person to direct your anger at. I'd suggest that psychologically, we are not designed to become mad at inanimate objects (such as a car whose driver cannot be seen).

Since road rage incidents are becoming more common and deadly it seems, window tinting should be normalized provided that it is otherwise safe to use in that area."

I've had a couple part-time jobs but I don't own anything or have a lot of money.

It seems pretty obvious that all knowledge work will be automated away. I've seen people on Reddit praising this, saying that once that happens, we can all spend time doing what we love and not worrying about basic needs.

This perspective seems very stupid to me and hopelessly utopian. Once all knowledge work is done by machines who are more intelligent than people, there will be nothing left for people to do except for manual labor. This is fantastic for people who own significant part of those companies and can profit off of them, but for people like me, who own nothing and live in places with a high cost of living, we're totally fucked.

Even becoming a plumber won't save anyone, because once that's the only job everyone will learn how to plumb and it'll be a horrible race to the bottom like everything that was once good in life.

The only people I can see this benefiting other than the top .00001% who own everything are the people who live in extreme poverty, because I imagine this would raise the floor when it comes to standard of living.

Out future is living in shitty public housing and relying on handouts from the state, which will be paltry because we live in an oligarchy. The people who will control the value have no incentive to share it with everyone else.

I genuinely see the only hope to maintain a good standard of living as starting a business and somehow making enough money to live off my savings while automation fucks everyone over and gives the majority of our money to the class who owns everything, keeping the rest of us barely alive and at the mercy of those people.  


Change my view.  


PS:  
I'm not going to respond to anyone whose argument is simply ""AI isn't going to automate all knowledge work."" It's getting better at an insanely fast pace and if you think a human is always going to be a better pilot than an AI you're delusional. Operate under the assumption that all knowledge work will be automated.

The legislative argument is that being closed on a particular day of the week may be harmful to those in need of “service” whilst traveling on the highways in that state.  

I’m of the view generally that for-profit retail businesses offering non-essential service wishing to close for religious reasons should retain the right to so.   Keep in mind, these businesses exist to make a profit.  They do not exist in service of the common good.

From a legal standpoint, this seems like an infringement on the right to religious liberty.  Lindsey Graham, hyperbolic sycophant to the religious Right that he is, declared “War” on anyone wanting to force open CFA’s on Sundays - even going as far as to say he wants federal funds withheld from any state that does this.  (Note: I find this patently absurd).  That said, I have to imagine that highway-side Muslim establishments would not get such vociferous protection from Evangelicals for closing during the entire month of Ramadan if they asked for it (technically this would be fewer days than every Sunday each year).  
Furthermore, one would be hard pressed to demonstrate the material harms the Sunday CFA closures, without recourse, produce.  Stripping down the formal language of my argument: you could literally like, just pack a sandwich. There *is* recourse, as essential food vendors are open 7 days a week.  
Logically, this argument extends into scheduling minutia: what about early AM hours? Granted, not as much food access is needed on the Highway, but wouldn’t we need *some* mandated openings? This isn’t slippery slope reasoning.  It’s just an extension of the same flawed logic.    
Look, I’m all for food access on major highways, but let’s leave that to the grocery/gas stations (these exist, btw).  Leave your CFA out of it."

Guys don't know what they're doing with their lives and everything seems pointless and just not what we were hoping for. I've been there, I know what it's like, I sympathise.  
  
What I found most annoying, is that people seem to think that the way to deal with this is to tell guys to just 'man up' and stop being such weaklings. Which is as useful as telling a depressed person to get a grip and snap out of it. All it does it makes you feel judged and even worse.  
  
Or, from the more woke progressive side, guys get told off for whining because after all we have so much male priviledge that what is even our problem. Which, essentially, is the same as telling us to man up, just with a aura of moral superiority.  
  
Sure, there are some genuinely useful self-help resources out there and that's great, but a lot of the time it's just one of the above. We need to seriously stop doing it and call out people who say such things, because it's really not helping men who struggle."

When I was in school they mixed us all together and took these kids I’m talking about to separate classrooms for extra intervention for a couple of hours a day. I used to watch them in our normal lessons too and honestly it gave me the belief that they’re miserable. They could never comprehend what we were learning about and got frustrated with just having to write down in their notepads because it was really difficult for them, the fact that they couldn’t explain why they found it hard and that they couldn’t express themselves just got them more upset, and as a result our teacher was distracted trying to get them in order and kids who didn’t have these issues ended up getting ignored if they were struggling to understand the task or if they had a question themselves. 

The kids who did get taken out required additional specialist support and I just don’t understand the point in it. None of these kids I went to school with have ended up having jobs or doing anything with their lives, they all require around the clock support, so what was the point in sending them to school in the first place, wasting everyone’s time, and depriving able kids from getting the extra support instead so that they could’ve perhaps achieved even better?"

First off I believe Business school students have the highest ceiling for earnings STRAIGHT out of undergrad. Im talking just graduated, Investment banking/Private Equity analysts are making 200,000+ and idek if that includes bonuses and all that. That beats engineers as well as IT pretty soundly. These are 22 year olds making more than a 50 year old doctor in some cases. 

Second, I believe even the more readily available jobs for business major make waaaaaay more than others. I know people who:

Went into teaching needing a second job with nearly 10 years experience. 

Went into architecture for 7 years of study with a PHD making maybe 60,000. 

Went into chemistry with a 3.5 GPA and is unemployed or barely making over 50000 with no benefits. 

Went into med school and is now a ~~slave~~ resident with crippling student debt. 

Meanwhile douchebag Joe who spent college roofieing girls with his 2.5 GPA went into corporate finance and is clearing 160,000 at 30 years old. His boss who was in the same frat is clearing 300,000 plus with just a bachelors. 

Third of all business majors seemingly have the highest ceiling for potential career earnings with basically little to no need for continuous education (unless you count spending their MBA doing coke in Cabo). I get doctors studying their ass off to make maybe 400,000, but you get Private Wealth Managers, Managers and Directors making the same with an MBA and sometimes not even that. 

It just seems like business majors dont need to try really hard in their studies compared to other majors and have a seemingly stupid high pay ceiling with almost no need for continuing education. "

Love is a lie, there are no true equals, and romance is just business with a smiley face slapped on it. These declarations sound like some drug-addled spew from an insane basement dweller who has never left his room, but I may just be right. Maybe.  
  
In ancient times, the Middle Ages, the Romans, ancient China, hell, even Sumer, relationships weren't about anything we modern humans perceive as ""love"". Marriage was a political bargaining tool or an opportunity to climb up in the caste system. Nothing more.  
  
What modern humans perceive as love, that is, sexual attraction, was fulfilled in the form of concubines for the wealthy and brothels for the common man. Sex between the married was rare at best, and was more often initiated due to societal expectations rather than legitimate attraction.  
  
We see this same logic often in modern times, women are dating ""up"" whereas men are dating at the same level, leading to the male loneliness epidemic and collapse of the birth rate. The rich are literally drowning in pussy, while the rest of us are starving for even the most basic human connection. Those women don't really ""love"" those men, and are often not even attracted to them. They're just rich.  
  
Back in the day, we didn't have this problem, as women were dependent on men. In the nuclear family, we see the same dynamic as we have seen throughout history-the marital deal. That is, romance and marriage are strictly business. They are a business deal. In the nuclear family, the woman required a house, food, and clothing. The one thing she had to offer was sex. This spawned a transaction. She performs sexual acts, and he shelters her.  
  
We've seen this in every society where the rights of women were limited. The Islamic world, medieval Europe, modern-day Africa, ancient China, pre-feminism America, and so on.  
  
But now, with the new post-feminism marital market and the destigmatization of breakups and divorce, there is simply no need for 90% of men anymore and those men have been left in the dust. If love was a real thing, how come so many of us have been cast to the side? Again, partnerships are just business deals. You always want a better deal. A richer man, a hotter woman. Everyone fiends for the best, and most settle in their 30s, but if the opportunity for a better deal comes up, of course you'll accept.  
  
This isn't some crap redpill argument. Men do this too. Henry VIII went so far as to behead his brides when he saw a better deal, even further proving that this logic is human nature and is utterly timeless.  
  
The dynamics we're seeing aren't ""OMG WAHMENS ARE EVIL AWALT AWALT FEMOIDS BAD FENEMIZM RUINED MY LIFEE"", it's just that women have a higher market value than men and get way more options. They don't have to settle for less until they're basically on their deathbed. Naturally, you'd flock to the best deal like you were perusing through insurance adverts. It's nobody's fault.  
  
Women don't need men anymore. For money, they have a job. For emotional support, they have friends. The only real reason a woman would need a man is for sexual pleasure, so naturally, they flock to the most well-endowed. The best deal. And relationships built strictly on sexual pleasure don't last long, as sexual attraction dies out over time, and sooner than later, you are trapped in a long-term relationship you are bored of. Then, you start to get sick of the other party and resent them. In loveless relationships such as these (like most marriages) a social hierarchy forms similar to Rudolf Schenkel's wolf experiments (a.k.a. the doggo prison gang) where the trapped wolves fought for dominance over the others. This stems from human nature-monkeys don't mate for life. Humans don't either. We are a hypergamous species-all of us, not just women. Long-term relationships and marriages turn people into Schenkel's wolves. Unrelated individuals trapped and left to fight.  
  
Relationships are strictly business, and that's all they ever were. If there was some mystical binding force that attracts men and women like magnets, why have most men been forgotten about as soon as they ceased to be useful?  
  
This is why I never understood why women are mad that they're ""just sex"". Of course they are, in the same way men are just a wallet. A sale isn't about the dude selling it to you, it's about what you get out of it. Don't women understand this? Men understand it just fine. Women treat men as wallets, so why aren't they mad when men treat women like prostitutes? It's dehumanizing, but it's human nature to dominate, to feel superior, and thus dehumanize others. I, a man, fully understand that romance is just an overcomplicated form of sex work.  
  
Back to human nature for a bit. People claim that the best relationship is an equal one. But there's no such thing as an equal relationship. You might as well say that the best animal in the world is a displacer beast. It's human nature to dominate others. Every ""romantic"" relationship has a dominant partner. This is typically the one with higher ""sexual market value"" (hotter, richer, etc.). They know they have multiple opportunities to get a better deal, and they know that you know. And they know you will do anything to keep them. So of course they sleep around and take your whole paycheck. And they're so happy that you put their name on your house and your shiny new car. And you let them get away with it (This ties in back to the wolf experiments I mentioned earlier).  
  
People have been letting the dominant partners do whatever the fuck they want for millenia. If the queen put up a fuss about the king's concubines, she'd be tortured to death in the castle dungeon. If a peasant woman didn't like the idea of her ""dearly beloved"" getting piss drunk every night at the brothel, well, she got brutally beaten and kicked out.  
  
Sex was never wholesome, or pure, or had any meaning at all, really. It was always either a casual dopamine rush, or a reward for your ""partner"" for doing your bidding (getting you more things you want out of the business deal). I never understood why religious folks think sex is holy or something. It's not. It's just something of value that people will do anything for. Oil isn't holy, and neither are pieces of paper with Washington's face plastered on them. Neither is gold, or silver, or jade, or seashells, or cacao.  
  
And back to business deals, here's why she got mad that you had another girlfriend before her or lied about your height/yearly income, kids! Because as soon as she finds out the truth, she sees you in the same way she sees used car salesmen. You conned her into a bad deal. If another woman broke up with you, she can infer that you aren't a very good deal. A house that keeps going up for sale is going to drop in price, because if nobody wants it for long, there must be something wrong with it. You are used, damaged goods. She returned you to the market, and there must have been a good reason.  
  
If you lied about your height or wealth on a dating site, then the reason she didn't call back is the same reason companies have been sued: false advertisement. You can't do that in business relationships, so, by proxy, you can't do that in ""romantic"" relationships either.  
  
Love isn't real, and sex and romance were always strictly business.  
  
I understand that there may be holes in my opinion, that's why I'm coming here. This isn't a troll, I'm not gonna soapbox, this is a legitimate post. I promise. I need a different opinion here. This is the way I've thought about the world for a while, and I've come to realize it's kind of a fucked-up way to view things.  
  
Please restore my faith in the human race.

Men can be men and women can be women.,u/wisehands_9,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19dovai/cmv_toxic_masculinity_doesnt_exist_and_theres/,changemyview,"Many decades ago, a young man growing up in his culture had to learn what it takes to be a true man. That included being a protector and a provider for his family. It included being a strong leader, caring, stoic and a leader. This is exactly what young men grew up learning in the past era way back then. Unfortunately, now todays generation of men is weakened and made to be weaker mentally and physically. Boys these days are told to hide their true masculinity and to show and express their feelings to be more vulnerable nowadays. It’s nothing good but for set them up for failure. That just weakens men and makes them more worse off than how it was many years ago. There’s nothing wrong with telling a man to be strong and to not be way too sensitive all the time. A man can’t be weak and not able to provide for his family. A women needs to have a father male to protect her children and herself. Men are given that role responsibility of being providers for the family. Men aren’t meant to be submissive and subjected to women or anyone’s authority like that. Even children themselves truly deserve a good role model in being mentally strong in this dark world. I just believe that toxic masculinity is some BS made up term used by the left to weaken and mess this society up."

The cost of hired security to curb it just ends up getting passed on to the customer (or, oftentimes, the taxpayer in the case of actual police involvement). I’m also tired of seeing edgy internet leftists (I am considerably left of center) engaging in apologism or even outright endorsing it as a means of leveling the playing field. All it does it foment further decay in social trust, enforce stereotypes, and make it harder for small businesses to survive.

It has recently been in the news when a report came out that they are working on a secret plan to deport all immigrants, citizens of foreign background, and citizens who are supportive of immigrants. This is incredibly dangerous and not all that different to Nazi Party before Hitler got absolute power in 1933. There have been protests across Germany against AfD because of these plans, and other German politicians are considering banning or restricting AfD, the way Germany did with other neo-Nazi parties post-WW2.

I think that other Western Liberal Democracies need to take actions too. They can impose sanctions, asset freeze and travel bans on AfD leadership. This will send two signals:

1. The German politicians have the support of their allies in taking action against AfD

2. Germans will recognise that by voting for AfD, they risk alienating Germany from its allies.

You may wonder why AfD and not other far-right parties in Europe. It is because Germany is the birthplace of Nazism and the key aggressor in WW2. The Allies sacrificed tens of millions of lives to keep Nazism at bay and we cannot risk Nazism or similar ideologies returning to Germany. It is necessary to start taking clear positions against the AfD before they become impossible to contain, by internal or external forces."

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Units_to_Aid_Production

 These camps were undoubtedly terrible however they were technically not punishment camps per say. They were done because they were alternatives to military service. If you couldn’t join the military or didn’t want to you were put to work here instead. The conditions were awful and so bad humanitarian issues were raised, but people weren’t necessarily rounded up with the exception of possibly gay men or suspected to be gay. You were sent there because there was no other alternative for you. 

   Those who didn’t want to serve had to work here, this was essentially the policy of the Cuban government, it was an alternative to military service. Even then these people were usually interned for six months to a few years. How long each sentence was per “crime” or category is unknown. Gay men were seperated from the rest of the people that’s about as segregated as it was. Based off religious beliefs I believe there was categorization and Jehovah’s Witnesses were treated extremely harshly even worse than gay men and were not allowed to leave the camp whatsoever. Otherwise the fact they were allowed family visits, and also had a relatively short stay meant it wasn’t truly a punishment camp. Moreso an alternative military service that was administered extremely badly.

  And before anyone asks: No Fidel Castro did not “sneak in as a gay man to shut down the camps” that story is debunked and yes the Cuban government was well aware of the UMAPs."

The ""free market"" breaks down, it's internal check and balance mechanisms, become self destructive, when the good or service is one that cannot be refused on pain of death or substantial material deprivation. 

This is why healthcare, housing, and food are so often the ones that require the greatest government intervention to stabilize and are most prove to radical exploitation is left to their own devices. Everyone needs to live somewhere, and everyone is eventually gonna need a doctor, everyone has to eat, and one cannot freely opt to refuse these services, well you can, but in the same way you can freely choose to not give a mugger your wallet and get shot. It's not a ""free"" choice, it's a coercion and an ultimatum. It is widely accepted that a choice made at spearpoint isn't a free choice. Whether that spear it literal or in the form of not being able to afford insulin.

Without the consumer being a free agent, able to enter into an exchange with the purveyor as equals, able to arrive at a mutual beneficial transaction, the inherent self-correcting mechanisms of the ""free"" market break down, because at that point the market, at least the market for that good or service, is not free. It is obligatory. 

When a good cannot be refused, on pain of death or severe material deprivation, the purveyor is free to jack up the price as high as they wish, they are free to price a large swathe of people out of the market entirely, accepting their demise as chaff if it means the profit they pull in off of the substantially higher price on fewer transactions still proves more fruitful than lower profit on more transactions.   


There are only two ways to address this. At a certain point, people, as in the bulk of the people, the mass of the people, will not merely accept dying cause their job doesn't pay enough. That state of affairs will eventually lead to civil unrest of uprising. Which of course will see a breakdown of the market. To avoid this happening, an institution, usually the government, must put their hand into the transaction in some way to ensure the populace has access to the service, either by subsidizing the purchasers or placing price controls on the purveyors. 

&#x200B;

But long story short, in the case of an obligatory good or service, the market can never be free. The choice is coercive to the buyer by default, and can only be corrected by institutional intervention, or dismantling the market entirely (usually violent revolt). But all three scenarios are not free markets."

I’m speaking in a more abstract sense about the concept of difference, and how that creates disparities when making comparisons relating to those differences. 

Let’s say you have two humans. They are both equal in most ways because they are both human, which means they are alike in that way. Keyword here being alike and not different. But let’s say it’s suddenly a sports competition between these two humans, now you’ll soon find out that they are not performing so equally. Because they are different, they excel at different things, but also falls short in other things. Men and women are equal in a lot of ways, but they are also unequal in some aspects. Our interests and physique are different, so we excel in areas we have an upper hand in. 

Claiming that “different but equal” is a thing, is not only damaging, but also disingenuous, because it’s built on emotions rather than the objective truth, and I find such anti intellectualism to be disgusting, because I regard it as the primary disease that is rotting modern society and making people strive for an equality of outcome, rather than focusing on everyone playing to their strengths. instead of suppressing those who perform better, and elevating those who underperform, we could be progressing so much faster by focusing on equality of opportunity instead rather than outcome.

I used to be afraid to drink alone at home because of my childhood. My parents are divorced. At the time I thought it was because of alcoholism. It wasn't but I developed a fear of it. So I keep two rules, no drinking alone and no alcohol at home. You'd be surprised that liqueur can go bad  but I managed. So that's why rule number two. 

Few years ago I tried to drink less socially so I switched to non-alcoholic beer.  I drink one Czech brand which I like. We make a fun about it with friends and stuff but no big deal. 

Later I started to drink it at home. Just because I feel like it. Or because something bad happened and I want some dopamine.

This got me thinking. People drink beer because of alcohol. To feel good and relaxed and stuff. But with the way I enjoy non-alcoholic beer I sip it for the same reasons. I don't buy six packs of cans anymore. I buy whole bottle crate which can last me for about a month. 

TLDR: One can get addicted to a non-alcoholic beverage in a psychological way without any substance that could cause an addiction. CMV!"

I mean, after Jan 6th, after the MOUNTAIN of evidence and discovery about his wrongdoings, incompetence, nasty behaviors and buckets of failures in doing his job as the president, how can anyone with an ounce of rational thinking STILL fully support Trump? Don't tell me they are just ignorant or don't like the democrats, because you have to be extremely irrational and ignorant to behave like this, only a small percentage of people behave this way, but we are talking about 70 million plus voters, its just not possible that most of them are simply ignorant and anti democrats. 

Note: I dont like the democrats either, but I will never vote for Trump. 

I think most of us dont want to accept this truth, because it means we have to accept that USA has 70 million plus or more really dumb or really bad people who strongly align with Trump's way of thinking and bad behaviors. It means we will have to find out how USA becomes like this, what went wrong, what caused 70 million plus Americans to be so dumb and so nasty? How do we even begin to change them?

I've thought this for a while now, so I will address a couple of the most common responses I have run into over the years below, and why they are thoroughly unconvincing to me.

\-""Its important to make your voice known to the elected officials, regardless if you win or lose"": I sincerely doubt there are that many elected officials or policy makers that will have a different takeaway from an election result if they see that they had 1,586,946 votes in favor instead of 1,586,947 votes.

\-""You not voting can have a cumulative effect on other would be voters that may swing an election"": In the 2016 election in my state, the entire population of the town I lived in my whole life could have voted one way or the other as a united front, and not have effected the result of the election, both in terms of the presidency, and every single state policy that was voted on at the time. Yes I looked it up just to prove a point.

Once the tech was proven to be possible and successful they should have destroyed those datasets and rebuilt them with proper respect to artists and copyright owners, before releasing the models to the public. Unfortunately now the cat is well and truly out of the bag and I don't think there is any going back.

With that in consideration; I think basically everyone discussing AI art on platforms like reddit, YouTube, pixiv, etc have a strong emotional bias against the technology, and are unable to discuss its merits. Commonly when an AI image is posted you see comments calling it soulless, bad art, obviously fake art, or just generally claiming it is objectively bad. Even when the art itself is cool or interesting. It seems like even expressing a neutral opinion about ai pieces will get you dozens of replies telling you you are objectively wrong, and that you should feel bad for being interested in the tech.

I wouldn't call myself an artist these days, the most artsy thing I still do is 3D print and paint miniatures for dnd. I have had an artistic background though, before pivoting my career path to trades. I foresaw myself struggling too much to make a career as an actual artist (was training to go into theatre design) and decided I just want to live easily and keep my hobbies. 

Art has historically been full of gatekeepers. Photography was considered similarly soulless. Then when photoshop was created it was considered cheating. Even extremely famous artists were ignored in their time because their art was 'incorrect' as such. (Think van gogh). I feel a lot of people decrying AI art don't realise they are becoming the gatekeepers here by being resistant to change.

I'm not sure what else I should include in this post, feel free to ask additional stuff in the replies. I suppose my personal opinion is like this: AI tools are here to stay, and they will improve and improve in the coming years until they're as good or better than traditional methods. Combined with other artistic tools it will be used to created incredible works of art. It has also opened up a world of creativity for many people who never found a way to express themselves artistically. Many of my fellow DND players are really happy that they can make character art without having to copy something from online or commission an artist. I think there will always be a place for talented artists, but that world is going to change massively, the same way that it has since the advent of digital art tools and methods."

My claim is that Mosaic Law directly influences American Law... down to when the pilgrims first founded this nation, down to christianity being riddled in american law, down to modern times where christians are in office and black folks are choosing to identify as israelites up to the churches preaching about Yeshua up to folks learning about the history of ancient Israel up to the folks that will be in office in the future having let go of christian doctrine down to the children becoming more educated about true history outside of American-washed doctrine down to Israel having a conflict with Palestine and tiktokers promoting or shunning what Israel is doing. America is directly influenced by Torah law - and the law in general here in America is influenced by Torah Law.

I doubt there is proof that American Law is not affected by Torah law, so maybe my second point of ""There is no American Law that breaks Torah Law"" can be a focus here. I don't believe there is anything in American Law that would prohibit one from practicing Torah to it's fullest extent. My claim might evolve here but this is what I have so far."
1,2024-01-23,CMV: 'Grimace Ohio Skibidi Toilet rizz' memes are not any more or less intelligent than MLG or Vine,u/Tommys_Lawyer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19e3a4u/cmv_grimace_ohio_skibidi_toilet_rizz_memes_are/,changemyview,"It is often said that the new generation ('Gen Alpha') is full of exceptionally brain-rotted iPad kids. Many carry the sentiment that the youth are progressively losing intelligence due to memes like Grimace Shake Kai Cenat Skibidi Toilet gyatt Baby Gronk only in Ohio sigma rizz, etc. Most of these originated from TikTok and while there is a fair argument about TikTok itself lowering the attention span of children, these specific memes themselves born on the app have nothing to do with that.

The new age of memes is not any less intelligent than that of the past. For example, Vine was a social media site that ran from 2013 to 2017 where users would upload 6 second clips of themselves. This gave birth to equally unintelligent memes to modern day 'brainrot'. Popular ones include; a girl saying ""Asian people are-"" before wheezing, ""so I was sitting there, barbeque sauce on my titties"", a kid wearing his hood behind his ears, and equally nonsensical videos. These videos are widely seen as iconic.

In the early 2010's (or arguably the late 2000's), the memes were just as foolish. There was a popular branch of memes at the time known as 'Major League Gaming' (MLG) that encompassed; a hooded man saying ""fuck her right in the pussy"", a very poorly drawn Sonic the Hedgehog ('Sanic'), an old guy saying ""wow"" before winking, a kid shouting ""oh baby a triple"", another kid saying ""I like turtles"", Mountain Dew, Doritos, everything being Illuminati - yet the older side of 'Gen-Z' and everyone else above want to bag on the new generations of memes for making no sense? it's hypocritical.

Brainrot has been around forever. Think back to the 90's; While Beavis and Butthead occasionally had intelligent and clever comical moments, the show often finds itself relying on the viewer to shut their brain off and find humor in the crude mess of nonsense. It was immensely popular."

It's mutilation, and it should be banned from doing to babies. But the new ""progressive"" trend is to call someone an 'incel' if they are against circumcision. Feminists will refuse to support intactivism and in general, any progressive space is going to be not so much pro circumcision, but hostile to anyone who is against circumcision. It's extremely artificial, and extremely bullshit.

it is the height of hypocrisy for a feminist not to be against unnecessary routine infant circumcision, and makes me very assured in being an anti-feminist."
48,2024-01-23,"CMV: Reddit, as well as all forms of social media as it's currently built, is inappropriate for philosophy/philosophy-adjacent conversations",u/AnonWinds,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19e48sn/cmv_reddit_as_well_as_all_forms_of_social_media/,changemyview,"My view is that despite the interest some people on here have with philosophical conversations—whether that be related to ethics, politics, aesthetics, etc.—I don't believe Reddit or any other social media platform actually facilitates insightful, novel, creative, or otherwise *good* arguments or models. This isn't to say philosophy shouldn't be more public, but rather that a lot of the conversations I see and the ways that social media makes the environment not conducive to actually well-thought-out, intellectually honest, formally and informally good discussions. 

For starters, I think Reddit's upvote system can indirectly encourage arguments that appeal to popularity or the inverse. Like, it may be the case that n people believe in some proposition *p* and *p* is true or reasonable, but whether *p* is epistemically merited is irrelevant to if n people have belief in *p*; for a more concrete example, the Euthyphro dilemma in the Euthyphro by Plato—is the pious god-beloved because it is pious, or is it pious because it is god-beloved?—points out the irrelevancy of the gods insofar in explaining what piety is. The fact that the gods love piety doesn't explain what piety is. To go back to the abstract example, it is not in the n number of beliefs that makes *p* true.

Does that make sense? The point is that there is some cause for why n people believe in *p*, and appealing to the n number of beliefs doesn't explain very much beyond it having the quality of popularity; despite this somewhat trivial statement, the upvote system makes the popular beliefs popular and the unpopular beliefs unpopular regardless of the actual merit of the beliefs. It's possible that the upvote system is used to uplift reasonable, good, or well-thought out arguments or models, but it is not *necessary* that the upvote system uplifts those arguments. The upvote system is a Reddit/forum thing, but likes, shares, and retweets function similarly.

The second reason I think social media isn't a good medium for philosophy is because, from my perspective, the conversations generally don't go deep enough. 

What initially prompted me to think about this was a now 4 month old post along the lines of ""CMV: Credit scores shouldn't be in the rent process."" The comments that stuck out to me was this belief that credit scores are reflective of your moral character (at least in regards with money) so having a low credit score means in some way you're deficient morally. (**Personally**, I think that credit scores are more indicative of financial health, but I digress.) Regardless of my personal opinions on the matter, there was more discussion about why morally deficient people are less desirable rent applicants and not about how low credit scores are indicative of moral deficiency. This is important (and an issue that's actually prevalent in academic philosophy) because if we don't explicitly lay out our assumptions, it's not going to be apparent when we're wrong. And, being wrong is the best teacher!

On the base logic level, if it is the case that accept the premise/assumption (if they have a low credit score, they are morally deficient \[and all that entails\]), and still show its conclusion doesn't follow—*that* person has a low credit score but not from moral deficiency but, say, bad luck in a bad economy, then the inner logician in us can reasonably infer that our initial assumption is incorrect (modus tollens). 

On the metalogic level in regard to arguments using prepositions and predicates (basically, statements and statements about something else), it is the case that valid arguments have no valuations where the set of premises is true and its conclusion false. Consistency with respects to statements just means there is at least one valuation where it is true, and contra positively if there is no valuation where the statement(s) is true, it is inconsistent. I think this is relevant because valid arguments have no valuations where the premises are true and its conclusion false, but if the premises themselves are inconsistent (i.e. it's contradictory or always false), arguments with inconsistent premises *are* valid insofar as they make no legitimate claim. To that effect, if we don't go deep enough to explore our assumptions, it's possible that we're uplifting vacuously valid arguments that are well-written than well-thought out.

The crux of the issue here, though, is that social media doesn't encourage deep thinking. Outside of Reddit, it's an aggressive algorithm designed with the platform's business model in mind (e.g. the TikTok algorithm is going to send videos to keep you engaged because engagement means more seen ads and more chances to buy from the TikTok shop.) On Reddit, it's the internal cultural of the subreddit that determines what is acceptable and unacceptable, in addition to a subtle but nevertheless invasive platform design that enables constant scrolling and consumption of content. If long-form posts are frequently ignored (maybe they're not immediately gratifying or they take up too much space for more entertaining content), long-form posts will be ignored; but, deep thinking requires long(er)-form posts, so in some ways you could say that *some* subreddits discourage deep thinking. To that effect, it is possible that particular subreddits encourage/enable deep thinking and deep discussions, but it is not necessary that Reddit as a whole encourages those things."
1,2024-01-23,CMV: Most Are Dumb Because They're Emotional Thinkers,u/vercettiworthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19e4c6u/cmv_most_are_dumb_because_theyre_emotional/,changemyview,"I think in terms of many different perspectives and although it's useful when it comes to decision making it can be mentally draining. I don't side with men, I don't side with women, I don't side with the left, I don't side with the right, I don't side with pro government or anti government parties, I don't side with communists, I don't side with corporatists, I don't side with ""redpill"", I don't side with any side. To most people this is bad, ""fence sitter"" ""centrist"" ""coward"" but the the truth is I don't side with any one side because I can separate my emotion from whatever it is I'm trying to perceive. There's some comments on a tiktok of people saying ""I blame capitalism"" and the reality of the tiktok is capitalism isn't to blame it was just a tiktok of a woman showing people how to clean their showerhead. I commented ""capitalism isn't to blame, its only a tiktok about how to clean your showerhead"" and the replies to my comment are going to be the typical ""bootlicker"" ""you're not a billionaire why defend them"" and other nonsense comments. These people are emotional, irrational thinkers jumping to conclusions and try to label me as something I'm not to feel more comfortable. The second they label you in their mind they know who you are hence why words like ""bootlicker"" ""sexist"" ""racist"" and many other terms have exploded in popularity, im sure they're used correctly but a lot of the times people are throwing these words around just so they can label whoever they're talking to which justifies their ignorance to themselves. ""He said this he's pro Argentina I don't need to listen to him (random example). What they don't know is a couple hours earlier I was going on rants about how corporations are the worst (I don't like corporations), about how tipping culture is a culture made by corporations and payment processors and I'll even talk about how money isn't the focus and there's a balance if you remove the variable of greed which is intrinsic in many so it's not too easy.

 

Point I'm making is the rational thinker doesn't label people based on very little knowledge, the rational thinker asks questions and based on the answer asks a question that correlates to the previous question which can then lead them to a better understanding of who they could be

 

There's a book called thinking in systems and it talks about the different levels of thinking and alot of things started to make sense. I see people in the comments of videos about wealth say ""88% of millionaires have degrees you aint gonna be rich"" and these comments are usually directed at those that want to make money. The irrational thinker just sees statistics at face value, the rational thinker understands ""88% of millionaires have degrees, cool but how many of them used their degree to create their wealth because we already know many people get a degree in a field and work in a completely different field. How much did it actually help them, I'm sure for some of them it's essential but most millionaires are created in real estate, business and stocks and they don't have real estate and stocks classes and we all know business classes aren't teaching updated info and how to implement and use AI to make your business, it's the opposite the schools are against AI"" ""How many of those millionaires would honestly skip the college route, get a full time job and go all in on their business"" ""how many of them started their business while doing their degree"" ""how many got the degree as a backup"" ""how many felt they needed it and even though they knew they weren't going to use it they got it anyway then ventured into business"" These are only some questions you can ask to lower that bullshit surface level statistic but the point I'm making is there's levels to thinking and the emotional thinker in this example is a limited thinker

 

Humans need to understand social media has made you all more tribal than ever. I try to use only tiktok simply because facebook, twitter, instagram, snapchat and any other social media is just not funny, boring, overall just pointless to use and because I can calculate ""cool ill scroll 10 times"" or maybe ill find some actual useful workout information or whatever, tiktok has some utility even though its mostly nonsense. Instagram and twitter are probably the worst at making you more tribal. If you have instagram, check instagram reels and look at the content it's just ""should men pay on the first date"", a biased video of someone doing something and then a bunch of moronic racists in the comments its basically destroying your ability to grasp and understand perspectives and reality.

 

I feel so fucking bad for people growing up with this type of social media, there's gonna be so many ""hyper"" racists, sexists, etc because of all the bait content and the people in the comments being more racist or sexist than they usually are because people on social media get mad very easily even though they pretend like they're not. There's already people that just got into high school with ""communist"" in their bio like they fucking know anything about communism. They got thrown on to a certain side of the algorithm and now that's their personality. They then find their way into rabbit holes so they become this extremist by the time they're 16 and I know this because I've seen both sides of the algorithm. I've been on the leftist side of youtube shorts, tikok and instagam, if you have kids and they get sent down either rabbit hole its not easy to get out especially if they actually make friends in those rabbit holes. The point I'm making is social media is breeding emotional and illogical ""thinkers"" and there's nothing wrong with ""emotional thinking"" but you have to balance it with logic in my opinion that's just my perspective"

But as a black man, when it comes to black women, it definitely feels a lot more antagonistic.  
Now I have never seriously dated a black girl and that's not from lack of trying. I remember growing up I was never on the radar of black girls and would get made fun of by them because I was into 'white boy stuff'. But then around the end of high school I grew more attractive and started dating an Asian girl, and a common question that was asked was ""Whats wrong with black women"". I obviously would answer ""nothing"" to which the next question would be why I'm not dating one. Obviously the women in my family constantly reinforced that I had to date a black girl becuase this or that. 

  
I then remember when I was maybe 21, my black friend was interested in this girl so i went and attempted to introduce him to which they responded they were only interested in white guys. One day I went people watching at the club and there was a cute older black woman standing at the bar. Just watching how she interacted with black guys vs nonblack guys was so different. When black guys would approach her she was very standoffish and challenging but when a nonblack guy approached her she was open and bubbly.

  
Most recently I made an effort to date more black women thinking maybe it's just in my head. This week alone I went on 4 dates and I remember just feeling like a clown the entire time. It wasn't fun because they were refusing to even try to have a good time, giving short answers and were making little subtle comments based on stereotypes of black men. It definitely felt like they thought I owed them something and left feeling worse off, ending 2 of the dates after less than 30 minutes. So idk what the specific reason for this is but it clearly has to do with race because this dynamic only happens when I go out with black women. Maybe it's because they're projecting stereotypes or maybe it's because I'm not 'black' enough or something. Not sure if this is something present in other communities but it seems like a common thing within the black community. 

  
I think if I was to date enough black women I'm sure I'd find a few that don't act like this towards me but at the same time what's the trade off? It feels like I would be handicapping myself in the dating world if I attempted to pursue more black women but wouldn't get a benefit that I would get from dating any other race.

Talk about how Canada has bagged milk?  
""AMERICA DOESN""T HAVE FREE HEALTHCARE!!!""  
Talk about about bread and butter? ""

AMERICANS KILLLLLL CHILDREN""  
Then when I mention it, I always get the response of ""It's criticism"" and ""You don't care about the children!!!"". Like the people using their deaths to ""own"" Americans unprovoked do? How does going on a incredibly xenophobic rant on a completely unrelated topic ""criticism""? That's like saying a bully who is bullying a fat person about their weight is actually concern about them and is motivating them to lose weight, which is wrong, the bully is an asshole, not someone who is concerned.  
Like I get it, America is not perfect nor I'm implying it, but this is ridiculous, there is no ""concern"" or ""criticism"" behind those comments. It's often brought up completely unprovoked or just used as whataboutism to direct attention onto American's faults instead.  
Here's a example of how I personally view this ""criticism"" and why I think it's a bullshit excuse since I know people will do some mental gymnastics to defend it because people here are full of self-hating Americans,.

21,2024-01-23,CMV: US Healthcare Incentives are Misaligned from Patient Interests. Patient and healthcare system agendas are at odds.,u/Mysterious_Poem189,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19e5z50/cmv_us_healthcare_incentives_are_misaligned_from/,changemyview,"CMV - patients shouldn't blindly trust that healthcare workers and services always have their best interests in mind.

* **Services**: Clinicians such as dentists and other healthcare workers only get paid if you're (in most cases) in pain & unhealthy. It is solely a financial transactional relationship where they will only resolve your pain, restore your health, or monitor/maintain it if you can pay with insurance or out of pocket. It doesn't matter if you've seen them for years, the second you can't pay, it's over. And the more pain and health issues you have, the more money they make.
* **Finances**: Patients do not have the specialized healthcare knowledge to recognize/detect when they're being deceived financially or oversold services they don't need (like a scam in terms of major upselling/marking up past what treatments should cost, doing extra services like X-rays or etc that they don't need, and so on). And again, the more health issues and pain you have, the more money they'd make. But even if not looking at it as negatively, it is an exchange of money for treating pain or restoring health. Think about what their incentives must be then.
   * For example, there are many guides out there others have made on how not to get scammed by the dentist and other healthcare professionals in efforts to help minimize the chances of exploitation/manipulation there may be, including from a select few people in the medical field themselves since they know this can and likely does happen.
* **Mistakes**: Patients do not have the specialized healthcare knowledge to recognize/detect when their clinician makes a mistake in many cases. They would rely on the clinician/healthcare worker for this information to be documented and reported to them. They also wouldn't have the specialized insurance or financial knowledge to know when something may be intentionally or unintentionally coded/billed wrong to their insurance or in an invoice.
* **Mistakes**: Clinicians in many roles including dentists to surgeons & etc are expected to never make mistakes. It's not the same as non-healthcare jobs where if you accidentally sent an email or made grammar errors it's nbd. If they do make a mistake, it is a much higher risk for them to admit it to the patient or in general since they could potentially get sued, banned/barred from ever doing their job again in a country, etc.
   * For example, it is not the same as a barista in a coffee store making coffee and a mistake happens where they can just remake the coffee. Or where the customer has the coffee knowledge to know the wrong coffee was made or an error in the right order was made. If a barista does make a mistake, it is easily salvageable for the product and financially, but in healthcare this isn't the case (the product may be your tooth, an organ, etc). Usually a coffee customer isn't in dire need of coffee and would have time or general understanding on its price point too for the product. And if a barista does make mistakes, they can still be a barista in that state or throughout the country.
* **Records**: studies have found, including from associations for healthcare areas like dentistry, that insufficient recordkeeping and documentation is done at times on patients during visits. Couple this with the chances of how underreporting for mistakes can occur including in patient records, or the laws on maintenance of these records in terms of longevity and also quality. Additionally consider financial incentives where they may be motivated to have less records if not involving insurance or for some other reason, which would be harder to track cash ""under the table"" payments tax wise.
* **Nepotism**: if studies, everyday people, and organizations in general seem to find nepotism does exist in the medical field from medschool to jobs afterwards, are you really getting the best possible treatment that's merit-based?
* **Cottage industry**: aspects of the medical field still operate like a cottage industry, such as dentistry, orthodontists, optometry, physical therapy, chiropractors, audiology, etc. This means they're like home-based systems of production/services where service quality can vary greatly from one healthcare office to another as well as prices, tools/technology equipment, staff skills, and more.
* **Oversight/regulation**: some medical boards provide little protection for patients (ex: injuries), NDAs from surgeons like plastic or dentists/orthodontists, medical field clinicians/people regulate each other in some cases versus independent outside parties, and more.
* **Subjectiveness**: some medical fields are subjective where a clinician can think of one solution or diagnose X issue while another may say Y and propose a different treatment. This is true for dentists, chiropractors, and more.
* **Services/Treatment Approval**: the No Surprises Act was developed for a reason to protect patients from surprised bills and not consented to services. Informed consent is required from medical professionals when treating patients. Yet studies have found that patients don't always understand all of the risks or costs associated with recommended treatment."

* Mercenary groups still function anyways by exploiting legal loopholes to operate as ""Private Military Companies""
* Mercenaries have historically been a hugely important part of warfare.
* A private military is really no different from a private police force or private security, both of which are legal.
* Legalizing mercenary activity would bind them to uphold the laws of armed conflict and afford them protections under the treatment of Prisoners of War (POWs).

Firstly, mercenary groups simply rebranded themselves as Private Military Companies (PMCs) to subvert the illegallity of mercenary activity. Mercenaries are de-facto legal so why do we continue to label them illegal? It makes no sense.

Mercenary groups have played a hugely important role in military history since the dawn of time. Before the advent of modern standing armies, nations relied heavily upon mercenaries to bolster their forces. The Swiss Guard in the Vatican are technically mercenaries. Why are the Swiss guarding the pope in Italy? Because Switzerland was renowned for the plethora of mercenaries they provided during the 1400s, the Swiss Guard are originally a mercenary group contracted by the Vatican for defense that have since become a quasi-legitimate paramilitary force today. 

Mercenaries quite literally stopped a genocide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and saved the nation from total collapse in the 1960s. When the DRC gained their independence from Belgium in 1960, the nation was immediately plunged into civil conflict known as the [Congo Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Crisis). Part of this crisis included the uprising of the Communist-backed Simba rebels in the East of the nation. The DRC lacked any form of centralized military at this time and relied almost exclusively on mercenary forces to halt the rebel advance and protect the legitimate government in Leopoldville (now Kinshasa). The Simba rebels carried out numerous massacres and acts of ethnic cleansing against those they considered enemies such as: killing anyone employed by the government like politicians, police officers, professors, and school teachers, targeting religious institutions and killing priests and nuns, killing based on race and ethnicity specifically white Europeans. These senseless killings were only stopped because of the direct intervention by government mercenaries.

Private police forces and security companies are numerous and legal. Are these groups really so distinctly different? Is a person that takes up arms to enforce the law of a private company really so different from someone that takes up arms to train or fight for a foreign nation?"

If hes found guilty for any hes serving rest of life in jail. Because of the severity of his crimes.

I think he knows this too and understands the only way to not go prison is to be president and then stay president.

He already tried to stay in power. But he didn’t have enough yes men. Now if hes to be president again, he’ll hire yes men and stay in power.

Because he’ll understand that there will be lots of cases against him. And he can’t pardon all of them if any?

Hence why American democracy is at high risk because his personal motivation of not going jail will make him want to stay in power?

So for you to change my view - you must present to me he has other motives that isn’t staying in power or either going jail."

I used to play on stake pretty religiously. Yet, I hold the view that all forms of gambling and betting should be banned. I acknowledge that my opinion may have its flaws and I'm open to changing my view through this discussion.

The crux of my argument lies in the addictive nature of gambling. Despite my own positive experiences, I can't overlook the broader social harm caused by gambling addiction. This addiction often leads to financial ruin, mental health issues, and strained relationships. It's a societal problem that exploits hope and frequently results in despair.

Additionally, the corrupting influence of gambling, especially in sports, is a significant concern. Betting on outcomes can lead to match-fixing and compromise the integrity of sports. This corruption isn't limited to sports; it extends to political and financial systems, where decisions can become distorted by a gambling mentality.

Moreover, the societal costs of gambling, such as increased crime, loss of productivity, and healthcare expenses related to addiction, are substantial. These costs often overshadow the revenue generated by the gambling industry. While I have personally benefited from gambling, I am aware that my experiences don't negate the broader negative impacts.

I understand that my stance might seem contradictory, and I'm open to hearing different perspectives on this issue. Perhaps there are aspects of this topic that I haven't fully considered, and I am willing to adjust my viewpoint based on new insights."

A 6 year long investment of a relationship that ended in complete and utter betrayal was one of the biggest wastes of time in my entire life. I gave every last bit of love to someone who, in the end, would become my worst enemy. I had my reservations even before entering this relationship because I was afraid of getting hurt. After years I let my guard down and I allowed myself to believe that love existed and it would last forever. Now that it is over, I am left with nothing. I wake up believing everything was my fault even though I was the one betrayed. I would have been so much better off and happier having not entering this relationship at all. I guess the title of this post should be more akin to ""love doesn't exist"" but I hold onto hope that there are some people in this world that find true love, but that is few and far between. For the rest of us, wasting time and energy loving others is useless. You are better off focusing on every other aspect of your life than deciding to give your all to another.

Men are told they’re toxic, misogynist, lacking emotional intelligence, bad at dating – everything is wrong with us. Regardless of what you think about whether this is justified or not, or how much of it is, the fact is that by far the most that men hear from this side is negativity: **what not to do** and **how not to be**.

What men get very little of, is any kind of indication of positive alternatives: **what to do** and **how to be**. If not this, then what? What is expected of us? What would be the right things to do? It seems like there are just no positive narratives or role models on the progressive side. There are many on the conservative side though. The progressives hate them, but don’t offer anything in their place, only double down on the criticism.

But there is something very basic and primal about human psychology: we like the people who are nice and help us, and don’t like the ones who are mean and criticise us. Doesn’t matter who is right, on a certain level that’s just how our brains work.

As I consider myself centre-left, it just hurts me to see the progressives basically behaving in a way that makes more and more men annoyed with them. Of course they’re annoyed, all you have for them is constant scorn! Maybe if you focused on giving them some positive encouragement and advice on what to do, they would actually like you more!

Don't downvote this post based on your political views. I don't care if you're liberal, conservative, feminist, humanist, or whatever. The point is: the strategy of the progressives with regards to men just doesn't work."
1,2024-01-24,CMV: Teaching as a job doesn't make much sense,u/sayer_of_bullshit,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19egg65/cmv_teaching_as_a_job_doesnt_make_much_sense/,changemyview,"I'll state my case and then preemptively defend myself, so if you're going to comment, read it all.

When you're teaching something, you have to know what you're actually teaching, in depth, to be able to give someone the knowledge. As someone who educates the juniors in my team at work, I find that I can't really explain something until I fully understand it, and I can't fully understand it without hands on experience. 

I'm infinitely more knowledgeable, working now, than I was fresh out of college, when really, I knew just some theory. I imagine going into teaching at that point, and I can't help but feel I would've been a very uninspiring teacher, because I think kids really pay attention when they understand stuff, but lose interest when they don't, and feel like they never will ""with this fucking teacher"". Most teachers have no/minimal experience with their subject, so how can they be of any use? 

Math is a good example of a subject that really needs to be taught from ground up, and with historical context. It's also important to show kids the actual real life application of math. Yea, most math teachers just tell you some formulas. No wonder math is stereotypical ""the worst"" and ""I hate it"", because it probably requires one of the highest degrees of preparation before being taught, beyond just theory.

Anyway you get the gist.

&#x200B;

*Clapback 1: ""But knowing and being an expert doesn't translate into being a good teacher that can convey information""*

I don't think there's a universally recognized good way to make people good teachers. If you think that's what the pedagogical module is for...lmao. It's mostly just a waste of time ""you pass, get out of here"". Granted, I didn't finish it, but I still attempted it. 

People can train their teaching ability but I feel like some people are more interested about it than others, some people have better social skills, and that matters too. There are many factors. I feel like the ability of being able to teach well is spread throughout the population. Just because you're a teacher doesn't mean you can teach. Just because you work at a corporation doesn't mean you can't. 

So who would you rather have teaching you? A good teacher with real life skills? Or a good teacher without real life skills? Keep in mind, most teachers aren't good teachers, and don't have real life skills. And people wonder why education is so bad.

*Clapback 2: ""You mentioned math, but for some other subjects what you said makes less sense. What about foreign languages?""*

What about them? If you work as a translator (of books, live), or editor, etc. you will probably know more regardless, and get in contact with the culture as well, which is important. Still WAY better than learning a language and going straight into teaching after college.

I don't think that there's a subject where teaching isn't greatly improved by hands-on experience for years and decades.

*Clapback 3: ""Ok, so then who is gonna teach the children?? Someone has to, dismissed.""*

Someone like me who isn't considering teaching, because it pays so bad (and other reasons: in my country at least you also have to deal with politically placed school directors for instance). It pays bad, because it's so easy to become one and the quality filter is non existent (yea, someone had to say it). But I would gladly teach for a couple of months, as a break from what I do. And I'm sure A LOT of people would. 

There could be a system where people sign up for a class for just a semester. Or other systems, who knows. Discuss.

Anyway, post your other clapbacks below."

That’s it. 

Gay women just want a connection and if they’re partner is attractive, that’s a huge bonus or like a 1B reason. 

Cis women of the west seem to idealize men. A lot of men are assumed to be a certain type of person by cis women based on fashion, skin color, religion; basically, the ego starts making insane assumptions based on what she *wants* to see. 

White American women will sometimes FORCE an image onto a man because they want their unborn child and/or them themselves to reap certain benefits. Black Americans have deep rooted colorism and image issues; you’re “less black,” if you don’t have random tattoos, an accent, and wear designer clothes. 

For a group that wants to dismantle and restructure Hollywood and the workplace, a lot of women still use past precedents stemming from these as a bench-marker for what other men could be. 

Then, you add in the facts that most women just want to be comfortable, need to consider finances, their relationship with their dad, their cUlTuRe which is rarely an actual set of customs but rather skin color, language and food, and you get a nice concoction of, “I don’t know wtf I want but I’ll pretend like I do.”

This is why a lot of men follow fashion trends they usually wouldn’t. They start looking like they’ve dressed for a part in a movie in an attempt to get women to think, “I look like *insert actor or job role.*”

For example, my entire life in America, women always say, “you look like *insert brown actor.* It’s like you need to be verified here to find a partner. With women from other areas, I’m handsome to them. It’s as simple as that. 

I don’t need to remind non-western women of an actor or the men they grew up around. There’s no familiarity or entertainment bias.

My wife is from East Asia. She looked at me, I looked at her, there was attraction, we figured out finances, and boom, we’re life partners. It was that easy. A lot of couples like us, one westerner and one easterner, feel the same way. I see men marrying into Hindu families easier than finding a date with an American woman.

This is why more often than the other way around, western cis men marry foreigners. They can be very beautiful and intelligent without the materialistic culture baggage. This is not to say that Eastern women are not materialistic, but how you carry yourself will speak volumes in those countries.

Here in the US, your dating value is determined by the insecurities of people."

I have no opinion on what the OP did, but I was thinking about if it was right for the child to be punished rather than the parents. I think most cases of minors doing something wrong is because of their upbringing. The frontal lobe isn't fully developed until 25 (correct me if I'm wrong) and I think children should be given grace until they're 18 at the very least. Whatever crime they commit, the parents should face the legal consequences because they should've raised their child better/more diligently/ If it was a case where the child was deemed insane, then obviously the kid should be sent to a facility and get help.

I'm somewhat unconfident in my view because I'm not very well researched on subjects like ethics/law, so I will be extremely open to giving Deltas and conceding my argument"

It seems everything these days is always one or the other. Climate change, Covid, Politics, whatever the subject matter, people too often (and too easily) fall into one camp or the other. It feels like most folks are unwilling to ask questions and equally unwilling to respect anyone who does. As an example, I questioned an ongoing project in our county. Because I asked a few questions (regarding possible outcomes/impacts of the project) I was ""Anti-project"". I am not Anti-project, simply Pro ""project done well"". I actually don't care nor have any intense feelings about the project either way (believing that like nearly everything else in this life there are advantages and disadvantages to everything we do...or don't do). This was a specificity no one wanted to hear. I either accept the project without question or concern or sit down and shut up.  


I see it hear on Reddit all the time regarding a hundred different topics and thoughts.  We realize that the vast majority of the information we consume is meant to influence us...right? I doesn't matter who it is coming from, most information is given to us with the express purpose to ""tickle our demons"" and get us riled up so we will choose a line to stand in and can be counted as being on one side or the other. Precious little information is offered with the express purpose of expanding or improving our understanding of any given subject.   


Even the ""experts"". It seems everyone loves to drag out the ""experts"". Generally speaking, I do not have any issue with so called experts. The skills, the knowledge, the experience of experts can be valuable and important to have. Without experts where would we be? Sitting around a fire still trying to make a wheel I suppose. My problem is that because someone is an expert it seems so many people assume they are honest.  Are they?  Do we REALLY know? Perhaps this expert is out there acting with integrity and in their efforts is truly seeking to expand and inform the depth of human understanding. Perhaps this expert has been promised support in getting grants for a very important project if they come on MSNBC and state \[this\] or \[that\]. We do not know. Both are equally likely. To believe that just because someone is an ""expert"" that their thoughts, opinions, experience is somehow more genuine that the guy standing in line with you for coffee is not only ludicrous but dangerous. They are subject to all the same human frailties as in anyone else. The knowledge does not exempt them from greed, or avarice, or bias.  Their experience does not exempt them from their human nature, it perhaps only tempers it...but yet we quite quickly accept their evaluations not as the evaluation of one or one group of individuals, but instead as a presentation of fact and truth. Do we forget how often these same experts are wrong?  


We don't ask enough questions. We trust too easily. We do not take enough responsibility for the information we consume. We just are not cynical enough. Cynicism is healthy. Asking questions and investigating the information we are offered (even when it hurts a little) is the only real path to understanding."

a lot of women are average or lower without makeup, but they take the time to learn what works to make them attractive. most men would never be caught dead in a makeup isle even knowing it would drastically improve their looks; for example, filling in sparse eyebrows, concealing blemishes, lip plumping moisturizers for thin lips. the average man would think it’s “gay” but i don’t understand why you wouldn’t chose to make a choice than benefits you. 

a lot of women spend time on their style to keep up with trends or even to find personal style but the average man just throws on jeans and a t-shirt not really caring much. 

a lot of women do not have excellent hair, but they get extensions, or wigs. even though those options are there for men too, most don’t bother. 

self care wise, women spend a lot of money on skincare, most men don’t even have a dermatologist. they also go to spas more than men do.

money aside, men have these options and don’t take them but still want to complain. i really don’t understand it at all.  if you disagree please let me know why, but i’m pretty firm on this view."

This painting is incredibly macabre. The darkness of the background forces your eyes to the brutal display of cannibalism. The  imprefect brushstrokes give it a chaotic feel, as one should feel when witnessing cannibalism. But what's also incredibly interesting is the sublte look of terror, horror and guilt in Saturn's eyes. Alsomst as if he is not in control of his actions and some outside force is forcing him to eat his son. Not only does this create a different interpretation of the original myth in Saturn's motives but it also connects to Goya's personal life. This painting is one of Goya's black paintings. A collection of paintings he made in his later years after the napeoleonian wars and after seeing the terror caused by war and the spanish inquisition. This painting his human darkness made into a painting and can have various meanings. It may also be how Goya saw himself in relation to his children as seven out of eight of his children died very young, meaning that he maybe saw himself in Saturn.

AI cant do this. Maybe AGI one day but simple algorithmic AI cant paint like this. It cant create stories in it's paintings or attach meaning to it. All AI can see is a guy eating another person.

There is also the problem of skill. We as humans like to celebrate human ability and creating art requires a lot of skill. Not just physicial but mental. Creativity is a skill as well. And some pieces of art could be recreated with microsoft paint yes, but the same can be said about hoe olympic sprinters can never outrun a car, and yet they are still worthy of exaltation. And even then, simple art still requires q bunch of talent that may not be noticable at first. All of this is something AI can never match."

* [At least 317 Palestinians killed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/2023-most-violent-year-for-west-bank-settler-attacks-watchdog-says/) in the West Bank, where Hamas is not in control.

* About 136 hostages are still in captivity. It would've been higher if IDF didn't kill 3 of these hostages.



All of my sources are from Western media, UN (not UNRWA) and Western/Israeli NGOs. If Western sources are willing to quote Gazan Health Ministry, then either they are complicit and are Hamas' media wing, or they find reasons to believe their numbers. Gazan Health Ministry's numbers have generally been reliable in the past, and what they report lines up with what Western journalists and UN report on the ground. 

If this situation persists, hundreds of thousands will likely perish from the humanitarian crisis and not from violence. I think Israel should work harder to pursue a ceasefire in Gaza on moral and humanitarian grounds. I know Israel and Hamas have offered the other side a ceasefire deal, but we all know they are for show because neither side will accept it. Israel should pursue negotiations with Hamas much more aggressively to come to a workable deal, similar to the one in November but much longer. The international community should also be more aggressive by threatening to withhold aid to Israel or even sanctions to force Israel to come to the table with Hamas."

As someone who follows the Oscars race, you follow a lot of precursors and industry predictions. 

Robbie was always sort of in that 5th slot for acting. She was always on the bubble. It's not *that* shocking she didn't get a nomination.

Within the industry: Other award shows, industry papers, tracking websites (Gold Derby), promotion and campaigns — even your favorite sports gambling apps — It was safe to say that Gerwig was an expected lock for a nomination.

You can even use some social justice if begrudgingly want. 

Feminist female director, making a popular/critical darling feminist movie. The storyline for Gerwig was very juicy... especially for a Hollywood that is supposed to be too ""woke"" and liberal.

With all these factors, yes... It was a shocking snub.

All the same, the moment the possibility of a little more comfort or survival somes along, we view it as a moral failing not to do everything scientifically possible to grasp at it. 

People are dying because of the poisons we have chosen to consume for 10,000 years! The answer, more surgeries, more medicines, more machines to keep us alive just a bit longer, damn the means. New technology that never existed for the many who died before me. I need it to live, so it is immoral I don't have it. 

People are dying because of the heat! We are not wrong to settle these deserts, move rivers, burn coal to pump the heat from our houses into the world. It's immoral for us not to have the power to burn so that we can live where we settled. It is unjust that we should have to live in the heat and polution we added to.

Even if we cannot give up the things that we have, can we not at least appreciate how impossibly lucky we are? We live in the sliver of a golden age, where we dont have to face the full consequences of the can we kicked down the road. We mourn the wonderful life our neighbor has, but can't appreciate we've been saved countless times already by vaccines, light, heat, dentistry, and knowlege. We mourn the price of gas, when our great grandchildren will have never seen gas to burn thanks to you ordering a hundred knickknacks that flew 8000 miles each.

1,2024-01-24,"CMV: ""Counterculture"" fashion is cringe",u/RaindropDripDropTop,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19emzkb/cmv_counterculture_fashion_is_cringe/,changemyview,"I'm mainly going to be referring to the main counterculture trends in the US that have existed roughly from the 60s to today. I'm sure there have been countless mostly forgotten counterculture trends around the world throughout history, but I think there are certain ones that most people, including myself, are most familiar with. I'm talking about everything from hippies, to punks, goths, grunge, emo / scene kids, hipsters, e-boys / e-girls, gender fluid, etc. 

To clarify, I'm not saying these countercultures as a whole are bad (although some are), I'm specifically talking about the fashion trends. What all of these countercultures have in common when it comes to fashion is that they have very trendy and unconventional looks that tend to deviate from the more classic and timeless type of styles. Whereas more classic and timeless styles go for very basic, tried and true looks that are generally just about practicality and looking good, counterculture fashion is more about making a statement, deviating from the norm, and fitting into a certain subculture. 

The first issue I have with counterculture fashion is that it's very trendy and in the moment, it ages poorly, and generally just doesn't look good. It's tacky. Obviously something looking good is subjective, but I think the fact that these trends pretty much always die off quickly and don't stand the test of time says a lot. While oftentimes certain aspects of these styles stay in fashion, the majority of it ends up going out of style super quickly. Meanwhile, compare this to a basic conventional style, such as a simple plain color t shirt, normal fitting jeans or trousers, and classic sneakers, a look which essentially never goes out of style and always remain popular. There are way too many counterculture fashion trends to go into detail about why each of them look bad, but just to name some examples, the absolute worst ones in my opinion are ear gauges, emo/scene haircuts, punk haircuts (e.g. mohawks), brightly colored hair dye, sagging pants, neck and face tattoos, etc. All of this stuff just looks awful. 

The second issue I have with counterculture fashion is that it is way too try hard and shallow. I think most people who follow these certain counterculture fashion trends do it because they want to show off their interest in the associated subculture and make themselves easily identifiable to other people who are interested in that subculture. This makes sense in theory, but in reality you can be interested in that subculture (e.g. maybe you like the music or agree with the life philosophy or politics that generally align with that subculture) while still dressing in normal timeless clothes that look good. If you have basic social skills, you will meet people and find other people with common interests without having to follow these silly fashion trends. In other words, you can easily become part of a subculture without following the superficial trends of that subculture. Another benefit of dressing normally is that even if you are super into a certain subculture, you can still more easily blend in and fit in with general society without getting immediately judged and pigeon holed into a specific stereotype. 

Ultimately, I think people can dress however makes them happy, there's nothing wrong with that. I'm just saying, there's a reason why most of these counterculture fashion types grow up and then cringe when they look back at old pictures of themselves. ""It's not a phase, mom!"""

I saw some people commenting the argument, well if you were told your favorite art was generated by an AI, why would that decrease its value? It's the same exact art as you found meaning in moments before. I personally think it does, and this is why.

The truth is, this phenomena happens all the time when it comes to art created by humans. One example is the book Wicked Saints by Emily Duncan, which has been criticized for its anti semitic portrayal of a character and racism. Initially, a lot of readers had brushed it off or ignored it, but after news came out of the author's past bullying towards poc, some people had lowered their ratings and mentioned the news as the reason why they had done so. Technically, it's the same book before the news came out and after the news came out. And yet, people saw the book differently in the two time frames. The reason for this is, before, people saw the racism and thought it was just a coincidence and didn't pay attention to it. After, people saw that the racism was likely intentional, and reflective of the author's own viewpoints. A similar phenomena happened with JK Rowling's Ink Black Heart. Had people not known it's JK Rowling, they would likely have a different reaction than the fact it is.

Overall, I believe it is a similar logic when it comes to AI art. For example, when I read Tim O Brien's book about his experience during the Vietnam war, I was incredibly moved by the feelings of sadness, anger, and guilt. If you then told me after I finished the book, that actually O Brien never fought in the war, and he was just imagined those feelings, the meaning I gained from that book would change. If you were to tell me that actually, it was an AI that wrote the book, how I see the book would change again. To me, part of why I liked the book originally was because the experiences described in it were real. When O Brien wrote the book, he wasn't simply writing a story, but about his own emotions and memories. If they weren't real, I will not like it as much even if the AI had written an identical book. Since AI only operates on data and algorithms, they do not feel human emotions or have human experiences, which I think is what makes art meaningful."

My personal threshold is that I wouldn't want to feel like my partner needed a drastic change, like surgery, or even a big weight change (let's say that's 30+ lbs). At that point I probably wasn't attracted to them enough to date them. 
But I find that I (F) feel strongly about my partner's legs (being strong) and hair (length, and that they have hair). These preferences have nothing to do with judgment about the person or what other people think, they are strictly physical / sexual aspects that I pay a lot of attention to and respond to. 
In fairness I know society balks at men being critical of a woman's body, but my perspective is that the issue is more media driven about “body type"", and men actually all have different tastes. Of course most hetero men will like some curves and feminine features, but I don't fault them for that and that's subjective anyhow. I support body positivity, but don't know how to just “be okay"" and not encourage my partner to take care of their hair and do squats. 
I'd love to care less and just be thrilled with them exactly as they are. But if we're looking at decades of monogamy, I don't want to be struggling with an attraction issue beyond the aging that is inevitable."

For personal context: I’m not a huge football fan; I’m just a guy who is sometimes in the same room as football fans and who ends up watching the game through passive interest and nothing else to do.   
I’m going to structure the argument as stated here:  
\-First, I’ll establish what football is and how it works  
\-Second, I’ll talk about what makes football a different watching experience than other sports, both positively and negatively  
\-Third, I’ll make some statements about what professional sports are even for in general   
\-Fourth (and finally), I’ll put it together to establish why the current rules for clock-stopping erode everything that makes football good and bring forward all of its problems.

A basic explanation of how football works, for anyone who doesn’t know, and also just to set a foundation for what’s coming later. As stated above, I’m not really a football guy; this is just stuff I picked up through osmosis. Football fans, if I get something wrong, please correct me.   
Team A has the ball, and has 4 attempts (called “downs”) to move the ball 10 yards down the field. They move the ball by either throwing it and having a downfield player catch it, or by handing it off to someone and having them run.   
Team B is doing everything it can to stop team A from getting those 10 yards. This generally involves being some combination of fast, hostile, and large.  
If Team A successfully moves the ball 10 or more yards within 4 downs, they countdown starts over; they get another 4 downs to move the ball another 10 yards. Rinse and repeat until they get the ball to the end of the field, at which point they score.  
If, on the other hand, Team A uses up their 4 downs without moving the ball 10 yards, the teams switch sides. Team B gets the ball and now has 4 downs to move it 10 yards in the other direction, while Team A is trying to stop them.  
Between any two downs, a timer is set for 30 seconds. This is called the “play clock”, and its purpose is to prevent teams from waiting forever between their downs and making the game take an agonizingly long time. If the next down doesn’t start within 30 seconds of the previous down’s ending, something bad happens. I’m not sure what, because it never actually happens in the NFL, but I assume it’s pretty rough.   
So far, so good. Now, about the clock.   
The game of football takes 60 minutes to play, split into 4 15-minute quarters. Or, at least, that’s what it says on the box; in reality, the game takes between 3 and 4 hours. Some of the difference comes from the halftime break (between quarters 2 and 3) or from the shorter breaks on the first and third quartiles, but another huge chunk of that time comes from the clock-stopped time between downs.   
See, depending on the way a given down ends, the clock might stop until the next down starts, while the play clock is counting down. A down ends when one of the following happens:  
\-The player with the ball runs into the end of the field (called the “end zone”) and scores  
\-The player with the ball is brought to the ground (confusingly called “downing” the player). This can happen as the result of a tackle from the opposing team, or as the result of the player downing themself.   
\-The player with the ball runs out of grounds  
\-The ball is thrown, but no one catches it, and the ball hits the ground (an incomplete pass)  
In the first two of the above situations, the clock keeps ticking while the play clock counts down to the beginning of the next down; in the last two of the above situations, the clock stops while the play clock counts down, and only starts up again when the next down starts.   
Okay, so that’s football in a nutshell. There are a bunch of special rules governing edge cases, different conditions under which the ball is turned over from one team to the other, and special point rules for field goals and 2 point conversions, etc, but for the most part, the above is the basis of the game and all the other rules are designed to facilitate that game structure. 

  
**What Makes Football Different:**  
Ask basically anyone who isn’t an avid football fan whether they enjoy watching football, and they’ll tell you that the game takes way too long to be exciting. You watch 3 to 4 hours of TV to see less than 60 minutes of actual playtime; compare that with a game like soccer, or even tennis, and the ratio of Entertaining Stuff to Boring Downtime is absolutely atrocious for football. No wonder so many people are bored with it; in my opinion (again, as a firmly stated non-football person), that’s football’s single biggest downside as a sport. There’s just so much time with everyone spent sitting around not doing anything.   
So, then, if it’s so god-danged boring for 75% of the time you have the TV on, why does anyone watch football in the first place? In a word: drama. What football lacks in continuous watching pleasure, it more than makes up for in extreme moments of tension and dynamism. There’s no way to really measure this, but I’d go so far as to say that the exciting moments in football are probably the most exciting moments in all of team sports. One 3 second play is all it takes for the entire status of the game to get violently thrown off course. Turnarounds, comebacks, run-backs, long plays, some guy the size of a refrigerator barreling through a horde of 11 angry defenders doing everything in their power to stop him; each one of these things can happen, and then can be over, in just a few seconds. A team can be behind by 14 points and make it back into the lead in less than 30 seconds of in-game time. Football’s moments are pretty spaced out, but when a big play is made, there’s nothing else like it. 

  
**What Sports are For:**  
Before I go on a rant about what happens after the two minute warning, a quick aside about why pro sports exist. It seems like all of the value that pro sport have can be traced back to entertainment. It’s entertaining to see people achieve incredibly high levels of skill; it’s entertaining to watch tense competition, unsure of the outcome; it’s entertaining to become a part of a fandom. Pro sports don’t provide goods or safety or medicine or education or social infrastructure. At their core, all pro sports exist because the rest of us enjoy watching passionate athletes push the bounds of human achievement. 

In this view, the best sport is the one that is the most exciting to watch. So, when I say something will make football ""better"", I mean it'll make it a better viewing experience. 

  
**Why the clock should stop between every down after the two minute warning:**  
Finally, we've got the tools. Now, why should the clock be stopped between every down after the two minute warning?

For context, the two minute warning is the warning that teams are given when 2 minutes remain on the clock until the game is over. This is the “get shit done” time period of the game; if you’re behind, you better get your ass in gear and find some points before your loss is set in stone.   
But, what usually happens after the two minute warning is this: the team in the lead gets possession of the ball, and then the game just de facto ends. It doesn’t literally end until the clock runs out, but because the clock only stops when a pass isn’t completed or when the ball goes out of bounds, they can just hand the ball to a player who self-downs, let the play clock run out as the game clock ticks down, and then repeat that 4 times.   
It’s, like, the most horrible way for a game to end, from a viewer perspective. And it seems particularly ironic that it takes place in football. As I said above, the whole reason this game is special, the reason it’s worth watching in the first place even though 75% of the watch time is just dudes standing on some grass without anything happening, is the exciting moments. For the viewer, these moments are the absolute core of the game. And this game, which is so built on excitement, flops its way to an end with all the tension of a deflated balloon.   
The entire reason I enjoy watching football is because of its capacity for drama. I never care who wins, but I (and, I presume, many other people) absolutely love the excitement of a game that is down to the wire, with the lead changing teams over and over again! Or a game where a team makes a heroic comeback, earning impossible-seeming points to re-take the lead in the final moments. These are the games that have people leaping out of their chairs in excitement and shouting uncontrollably.   
And yet, with the way the current football rules are, most football games just kind of… sizzle out. It’s sort of like Game of Thrones: it’s the most exciting and invigorating TV show you’ve ever seen, right up until the very end, at which point it just craps out and everyone leaves with a bitter taste in their mouth, thinking about how great it could have been.  
This is why the clock should stop between all downs after the two minute warning. This would force any team with possession of the ball to actually engage with the game right up until the end. If you’re in the lead, you’re already at an advantage, and you’ll still probably win. It’s riskier, sure, but not by a ton. But the benefits to us viewers would be huge!

In that case, why not stop the clock between every play? Well, it already takes a stupid amount of time to play a game that is nominally 60 minutes. Stopping the clock after every down would make that way worse. Enacting this after the two minute warning seems to provide a good balance between keeping the game at a reasonable level of time-sink while also ensuring that the highest-tension moments of the game aren't stomped on by a technicality in the rules about the game timer.   
If you want to CMV, the most obvious things to do to me seem to either:  
\-Explain why else pro football matters. If there’s some reason it’s important for football games to end this way that I don’t understand because I’m viewing sports through the lens of entertainment, I’d love to learn.  
\-Explain why this current state of affairs actually provides for a good viewing experience. I don’t really see how that’s possible—sure, the fans of the team in the lead get to rejoice earlier, but there are also the fans of the team that has no chance to come back even though they nominally have 2 minutes left of game time. And I’d imagine that even some team stans feel that ending a game on a timing technicality like this isn’t in the spirit of the sport.  
If you can think of another way to CMV, that’s also fine; I just think the above two are the main pivot points of my argument, so that’s where the weaknesses likely are. "

Fitting a Trump theme of taking epic loads of humiliation and abuse, but eventually taking a knee and kissing the ring.

As a pragmatic situation, what else could he do? If you want to play establishment GOP politics, you have to support the obvious nominee.

That loyal niche of MAGA supporters will haunt your campaign, now and into the future if you don't play ball.

We've seen the ebbs and flows of Never Trump martyrs. John McCain, Mitt Romney and the Bush Family. It's tough to acertain what their Republican legacy is. I suspect mention of their names would cause a cascade of boos at your typical CPAC convention.

Yes, DeSantis could have waited until summer under the cover of the Olympics and conventions to endorse Trump. He could have gone through the door with a bunch of other people to blend in.

Looking at the obvious fact he'll run again; my view is that you might as well get it done now. It's like getting chickenpox as a kid. Parents would send you to play with the sick kids to get it over with.

Okay at the very top. I am fully aware that buying a woman a drink does not entitle a man to anything from that woman. That is not something I am here to debate. My point is that I think this is a rude thing to do. By the same token, I think the idea of sending someone a drink and demanding something in return is shitty. I'm not going to debate and argue about whether or not a woman could assume the drink is just a nice gesture. It's not. We all know this. I'm talking about real human interaction, not an academic debate. This is something everyone except severely socially inept (or what's more likely here argumentative contrarians) understand. If a man is offering to buy a woman a drink, 99.9% of the time it's because he's interested in her.

So I think that in a nightclub or bar, romantic interactions are pretty superficial. It's not an environment where ""getting to know someone"" thrives, it's based on first impressions which are mostly carried by looks. If a guy is good looking a woman may be interested, if not, he's SOL. So I think by the time a man says ""Can I buy you a drink?"" she's already made that first impression judgment and knows whether or not this is someone she'd be interested in. 

What I think is rude is when that judgment is a 0 and not a 1 and the woman accepts the drink. I don't think ""leading on"" is the right term, but it's just rude to kinda give someone false hope like that when you know you have no intention of going further just because you want a drink."

A lot of the conversations on the topic turn towards the notion that men need to learn to be happy single. 

And I agree with this up to a point. While I think it is important to have self esteem and stability outside of a partner. It's also not really talked about that most men don't have access human touch and intimacy outside of relationships. This varies culture to culture but the men where I'm from aren't particularly cuddly. Years of cultural homophobia and intolerance towards that has created a cultural taboo around men being Intimate with one another. 

And on the other end of the coin. Platonic intimacy between men and women is also shut down due to the stigma around male sexuality and fear of sexual predators. 

This leaves lonely men in a shit predicament that opens them up to dudes like Andrew Tate. If they don't have a relationship nobody wants to touch them or hold them when they cry and etc. And if they talk about being sad about this more often than not they get dismissed as incels. 

I feel like this feeds a lot of resentment in ways that are unseen since men are not often raised with the tools to communicate this. So they just get dismissed as wanting sex while sexual relationships are the only ones they get things like human touch and closeness from."

I will mostly just be talking about Margot Robbie being snubbed do to “sexism” as I already understand the side of the argument that misogyny was the reason why Greta Gerwig wasn’t nominated for Best Director.

Many people, including myself, were surprised that Ryan was nominated for his acting but not Margot Robbie, including myself. And they responded with the unfairness by calling the Oscars sexist. This seems ridiculous. Margot Robbie wasn’t competing against her co-star. If she was, I think most people agree that the outcome would’ve (hopefully) been different. She lost to another woman. You could argue that maybe the Oscars wanted to push their narrative by “refusing to nominate the lead of Barbie”, and yet they nominated an actress who had the most controversial and progressive monologue in the movie: America Ferrera, along with the movie receiving 6 other Oscar nominations. This really just sounds like people are mad that Margot Robbie didn’t get nominated for Best Actress and calling sexism when it doesn’t make sense in this case.

I’m willing to believe that the Oscars are sexist as I’ve disliked these awards for a while now. Shows and actors/actresses are constantly getting snubbed out of awards and it doesn’t seem like many of the people winning the awards deserve them. However, I still don’t see how you can make the claim that Margot Robbie being robbed out of a nomination is misogynistic."

I want as much freedom that is possible for all, where it is a net benefit to society. I believe this is the case for the free market the majority of the time.

I also feel there is a lot of wasted money with the US system: insurance overhead, marketing costs, lawsuits, etc. that we don’t see with our system in Canada. Our cost per capita is much lower, and you don’t have things like “medical bankruptcy” or uninsured. BUT those who are insured in the US appear to have superior coverage. We get wait listed a long time for surgeries, for instance.

Anyway, that is all beside my main point. Which is that if we are to have universal healthcare, it is not fair for the taxpayers to have smokers be covered. They cost far more for the system (eg. Cancer care). We should also be focusing on preventative healthcare. Obviously it would have disadvantages, such as an increased black market. But the government should make it as hard and/or expensive as possible to smoke under a universal coverage system . They currently aren’t making it hard enough.

I have no problem with people smoking in a privately insured system, as they are not nearly as much as an unnecessary burden on the tax payer. They are at least partly responsible for their own health in this system .

1,2024-01-25,CMV: A civil war with the highest number of casualty possible is the only objectively correct way to achieve true peace in society.,u/Statement-Doors,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19f3tso/cmv_a_civil_war_with_the_highest_number_of/,changemyview,"I genuinely don't care whether you are a right-winger or a leftist, because my view is equally applicable and should be practiced by both right-winger and leftist.

Democracy is objectively the cruelest, most evil political system in human history. Democracy forced the people with opposing political ideologies to begrudgingly co-exist by submissively acknowledge the legitimacy of the political ideology held by the majority of the population over that held by the minority of the population via election like a cuckold. People, or should I say slaves, living under democracy believed that the political opinions held by the majority of the population will always be the objective truth, and therefore should never be fought against unless you want to be treated as uncivilized barbarians. Democracy forced the losers of the election to live a life of shame under the government held by the winners upholding political ideology that actively hate the losers, all while the losers are forbidden from fighting back under the unspoken rule of ""civility"".

And here I say to you: DON'T BE A SLAVE! DON'T BE AFRAID OF BECOMING AN UNCIVILIZED BARBARIAN! DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ELECTION RESULT!

You should never solely rely on election to establish the existential dominance of your political ideology. You should never force yourself to acknowledge the result of every election. You should never give a shit whether the opposing political ideology is logically supported by 500 different political thesis co-authored by 1000 political philosophers. You should never waste your time debating with people that uphold opposing political ideology.

At the end of the day, you should always believe that your political ideology is the only objectively correct political ideology that deserves to be enforced as the only legitimate political ideology in the face of this planet. More importantly, you should always believe that people who uphold opposing political ideologies deserve to be physically exterminated from the face of the planet.

This is why the fairest way to determine which political ideology deserve to rule society is through an all-out war between believers of different political ideologies, a civil war. The winning political ideology will physically exterminate all other political ideologies and build its own utopia with zero opposition.

There is literally zero downsides to starting a civil war:

1. If you survived the civil war, and all your political oppositions are dead, then you will have the complete freedom to build your political utopia with zero obstacles from any political oppositions and reap your justly reward. In the end you win.
2. If you died in the civil war, but your political ideology still wins the civil war, then your political comrades will build your political utopia on your behalf. In the end you still win.
3. If you died in the civil war, and your political ideology loses, then you literally have nothing to worry about. In this case, death should be seen as a blessing to you, because you no longer need to live the rest of your life in shame in a society ruled by an opposing political ideology that actively hates you. In the end you still win.

In conclusion, you have literally nothing to lose by starting a civil war to determine which political ideology deserves to rule society regardless of whether you will live or die at the end of civil war. It genuinely doesn't matter how many people will die in the civil war, as long as you are a right-winger or a leftist, at least 50% of the population will uphold opposing political ideologies, and you have the moral obligation to erase their physical existence with all your might.

Tl;dr: Mass slaughter the entire country via the bloodiest civil war possible is the only objectively correct way of achieving true peace in society by making sure only the believers of one political ideology is allowed to live, be it right-wing ideology or leftism. DO NOT BE AFRAID OF BATHING IN THE BLOOD OF YOUR ENEMY! DO NOT BE AFRAID OF DEATH! YOU LITERALLY HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE!"

The man who shared it with me had dealt with his share of mental health and substance abuse problems, and he referred to the years he spent without regular housing as “living outside.” 

He explained that he wasn’t technically without places he could have gone to stay, but he felt most comfortable being on his own and not involving anyone else in his current situation. The more I have met “homeless” people in the years since, the more I have felt this to be an accurate way of framing their situation. It also removes the individual burden of “homelessness” and the societal burden of “unhoused”, both of which fail to capture the multiple elements involved."

One in particular got into a 1v1 fist fight with me and it had to be broken up. The coach forced both of us to say sorry to one another and shake hands. Neither of us meant it. I never forgot that and yet I don’t feel hatred towards him. But I never “forgave him” either. I am not sorry for having fought back. I don’t hate him. But he was not “forgiven”. I don’t feel like that experience negatively affected my development either. I assume that means that I “healed”? Or did that not “damage me”? Because I never forgot it.


“It’s always better to forgive”. 
“Forgiveness is what frees you.”

I am sure that we have all heard things like this before. 

I do not understand how this is true, let alone why it is regarded as a universal cliche. Nor do I understand how anyone can claim that saying or thinking the words “I forgive you” actually does anything at all for one’s “inner peace”. 

Forgiveness does not reverse a wrong.
It does not reverse the negative emotions that one felt at the time of the experience.
It does not eradicate a negative memory. 
It does not reverse trauma.
It does not bring back a murdered family member.
It does not reverse a rape or sexual assault.
It is not “necessary” to heal. 

“Forgiving someone” has never made me feel better. And being told “I forgive you” by someone else has never made me feel anything positive if I had legitimately wronged someone that I did not want to hurt. 

We don’t even actually “know” if someone actually forgives us on top of that. We can’t read anyone’s mind. You don’t actually know what anyone thinks or how anyone feels about you at the end of the day.

I could literally argue that forgiveness is a lie that you tell yourself when you are tired of feeling negatively about something. 

A mere cognitive placebo effect directly proportional to one’s beliefs.

As a species that is physiologically wired to dwell on negative experiences, how exactly is attempting to exist against our nature “healing” anything at all?"

And neither will I entertain things such as “but men do date, so it isn’t useless” because there is virtually no counter argument to actually change my view. 

Dating for most young men in this day and age is useless. This is exactly why there are more stats being put out about how there are more male virgins, a significant increase in male loneliness, and young men who have never dated before.

If a guy was to point out how the expectations held by women are extremely high, it is considered as “you are blaming women.” Young guys are told now by society that we shouldn’t or aren’t allowed to approach women even in social settings, such as bars and clubs which USED to be social settings for people to get to know each other, ask each other out etc. 

Society now no longer has OR tolerates “third spaces” where people can socialise and intermingle. 

Dating apps are completely fucked for men considering there are more men on the app than women, and most women profiles are either bots or inactive. 

Then there are tons of young women talking about what they expect of men, such as high income salaries even as a guy in your early 20’s, having your own apartment/car, needing to already have sexual experience to be considered attractive. 

I don’t care if you think it’s just a “selected audience”, the fact that there ARE women mentioning such standards and thinking it’s the norm OR should be the norm is ridiculous. 

There is practically no reason for a young man to want to date women, because the standards set by women are extremely high and it has become extremely shallow and toxic. If young men want to lose their virginity, all they need to do is visit escorts. I don’t see young Gen Z men approaching to date or be in relationships anymore due to the shift in dating culture. 

And please, do see how that the dating culture in the 2020’s is extremely different from the 60’s to 2010’s. Culture shift is a real thing.

It's actually illogical to think that there isn't an afterlife. Because when humans created the number system, they didn't put a cap or a limit to how far numbers can go to. Like we didn't stop at 100 or 1 million, rather we said it goes until infinity. So if there is a continuation of numbers it only makes sense there would be a continuation of the soul as well, whether that's in heaven or hell. I also think this ideology can be used to argue of God's existence. Being that, the number system started with 1. Everything starts with 1. Therefore there had to have been 1 being that started everything. And since me and you aren't that ""1"" being, then it only makes sense we might not being able to intellectually understand and have answers to certain questions about existence that the 1 being would have answers to"

For example, a random art school in Austria cannot be blamed for World War 3 or the deaths of millions of people. All they did was reject a candidate which they had every right to do. For those of you who have watched Breaking Bad, Walter White is not responsible for the mid-air plane collision; he is only responsible for Jane's death.

A more extreme example of this belief is that attempted murder should be treated just as severely as murder. Whether or not it was actually successful shouldn't matter. A DUI that didn't resulted in a casualty should be treated just as a DUI that didn't as you shouldn't be treated better for getting lucky (or treated worse for being unlucky).

I would like to point out an exception of gross negligence. There are scenarios where certain consequences are obvious and you should have seen them but didn't. In that case, you should be punished so you're more vigilant in the future."

I just want to thank people for there beautiful comments and I wanted to add some info and response to most crucial comments  
  
  
First things first, Arab conquest is different from European colonization in many aspects but the most important aspects are:  
  
1. Arab conquest is an invasion of imposing values and languages not an ethnic cleansing one, and that explains why I am able to write this post rn and have a highly genetic correlation with ancient Egyptians. And there isn't any historical event that the arabs killed all the people of the lands that they conquer just because they are not arabs.   
  
And ro prove that arabs are imposing their language (not ethnic cleansing peoples) look at every land that Arabs have ever steped on it, it either speak Arabic or its own language is massively influenced by arabic. For example:  
  
8% of the Spanish dictionary are arabic words  
2% of the portoguese dictionary are arabic words  
10% of the Turkish dictionary are arabic words  
  
  
2. Arabs didn't distinguish between people on the basis that they are arabs or non-arabs, unlike the European colonization which had a racial discrimination between people, for example black people in there lands can have white slaves, which is something most people consider it strange. (Ofc at that time slavery was rampant sadly)  
  
But arabs had a religious discrimination between Muslims and non-muslims. Which means if you are a Muslim you will have some governmental privileges that non-muslims don't have.  
  
3. Arabs didn't distinguish between their home town in the Arabian peninsula and other conquered lands, they built facilities like hospitals and courts and markets all over these lands weather it's arab land or non arab land. For example, most of the capital cities of the arab empires (Damascus, Baghdad, Cairo) were not in the arabian peninsula.  
  
  
Second things second, what happened to the coptic language?  
  
Egyptians have spoken the coptic language for more than 500 years after the arab conquest !!   
But because:-   
  
1. arab arabized all the land they have conquer to make facilities easier  
2. Many Egyptians accepted islam and because of that they learned Arabic to make it easier for them to understand Quran and hadith  
3. And some persecutions from some rulers  
  
Yes, some rulers persecuted Egyptians and forced them to their language, for example  
  
Almaqrizi (an Arab histororian) said that an arab ruler called abu ali almansur, which name himself a very egotistical name which is ""the ruler by command of God"" ordered to cut the tongue of every Egyptian who spoke the coptic language !!! even in the prayers of christians and day to day life!!  
  
And because Egyptians are famous of a dish that's called molokhia, which is rooted to the ancient Egyptians, he ordered also to kill every Egyptian who ate this national dish !!   
  
So Egyptians feared death and neglected their language  
  
He was crazy guy like kim jong un and nobody loved him during his ruling   
  
Arabization along with persecutions of some rulers made the coptic language to die unfortunately, and made Egyptians forget there true identity, that they are NOT arabs.  
  
Third things third. Are all what so called ""arab countries"" have the same culture?  
  
I will say no. Yes most of these  22 country have a very similar culture, but I'll say that's not because of the arab culture. It's because Islam.   
Most of the common cultural features of ""what so called arabs"" are rooted in islam. Things like generosity, hospitality, the prospective of marriage, the glorifying of parenthood, all are rooted in Islam teachings and all are present in all muslim majority counties like Indonesia, not only in so called ""the arab countries""  
  
And there are differences between the 22 countries in different aspects and even their dialects are different (which is also explained by the fact that they aren't arabs in the first place)  
  
For example the ""tribal fanatical"" is presented only in the arab Penneaula and it's something that arabs are famous of it even in todays life, some parents will refuse to make their daughter marry to a man just because he's from a specific tribe. This things is not in Egypt, and more ironically it's presented in Egypt in the places that's inhabitated by arabs like sinai and western desert. And actually this is one of the many things that preserved the Egyptian genome, because arab didn't engage in marital relationships with other people   
  
And also their is differences in food, specific traditions in occasions, feasts and more.  
  
And yes we have some similarities but that's because of the proximity. Turkey has a very similar culture to us does that mean they are arabs? No   
Same thing in Persians.   
  
And this is very normal thing in the word  
European countries have similar cultures   
South Asian countries the same  
 But all of them are named after a logical name, for example, it's the European culture or the western culture, not the English or the french culture.  
  
Lastly, it's very crucial to refer to us as Egyptians, berber or cannites but not arabs  
  
This provides an opportunity to some political movements to kick us from our lands  
  
For example one of the most basic concepts of the Zionism movement is that palestinians are arab colonizers and not the indigenous people of the land and they use that palestinians refer to themselves as arabs against them.  
  
While the national library of medicine -and if you are a medical student like me you will understand that's one of the most important medical websites in the world- says  
  
 ""Archaeologic and genetic data support that both Jews and Palestinians came from the ancient Canaanites""   
  
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11543891/#:\~:text=Archaeologic%20and%20genetic%20data%20support,but%20not%20in%20genetic%2C%20differences.  
  
And also the afrocentrism movement that claims that all saharan countries belong to black people. They have no historical evidence nor a genetic evidence that they belong to these lands. And they say so because 2 things   
  
1. We ""Egyptians"" are not black. I don't know why they suppose that all the races of the 2nd largest continent in the planet earth have the same color. Are all Asian people have the same color? Are indians have the same color and features of japanese people? Are Persians have the same skin color and features of Chinese? Does that means that they also don't belong to their lands?  
  
  
Even small continents like Europe have different colors, are Iberian people have the same skin color of Scandinavian people? Is the color skin of ronaldo the same as the color skin of magnus Carlson?? The Mediterranean parts of Europe generally have a very close skin color tone to the Mediterranean parts of Egypt does  
  
2. They also use the black color in the Egyptian temple drawings of people as a proof.  
  
Firstly it's not black its brown  
Secondly brown color refers to masculinity in ancient Egyptians and black color refers to death and blue color refers to heaven  
  
So when you see a brown worker in the temples that refers to that he's a very strong masculine men   
  
And a black man in the temple that refers to that he's the death   
  
And blue man or woman in the temple that refers to that he/she is a God of something  
  
That's the translation of these colors  
  
But what they will never mention is that some Egyptian temples have drawings of many Egyptians with a very Egyptian features fighting with black people of kush with a very african features.  
  
So if there claims are right why Egyptians never draw Themselves with very african features the same they did to the kush?"

I am a 22 year old who lives in Florida. I am disabled, can't get or hold a job, and I live with abusive family. I truly believe, and have believed for the entirety of my consciousness that life is ultimately not worth living, and that dying imminently would ultimately save myself from so much pain and misery. I have attempted suicide at least 10 times in my life, the earliest being when I was only 8 years old.

The argument against suicide I always hear is that I'd be ending a temporary problem with a permanent solution. As though my experience living is 100% invalid. As though this suffering and disability will just spontaneously disappear someday. Or that I'd be stopping all the ""good things"" from happening to me. As though there's ever been anything good in my life that didn't ultimately lead me to even more pain. As though there are people in my life who actually do love me and aren't just mocking me with their presence. There's not one thing about me that is deserving of love. The people who claim to love me are just waiting for the right moment to strike, to hurt me as deeply and cruelly as they can. There has not been one instance where this is not true. I am absolutely certain that if I actually did end my life, not one person would shed a single tear. 

All signs point toward society becoming a worse place, between climate change, AI, transphobia, racism, rising corporate greed, where there is genuinely no incentive for someone like me to even bother trying participating in it. I could enslave myself to the corporate masters, or I could simply put a bullet in my brain. It would literally accomplish the exact same thing. I'll never be able to hold *any* job, let alone one that would pay enough to escape my current life. I've tried therapy, all throughout my life. I literally can't remember a time in my life where I wasn't actively seeing a therapist. It's never helped. Between my extreme depression, extreme anxiety, ADHD, AVPD, gender issues, heart issues, (half) deafness, loneliness, (C)PTSD, sexual abuse, there's just not much they can do for me. I've been on countless anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, stimulants, recreational drugs, and not a single one of them have ever given me even an ounce of relief from these feelings. I am unfortunately not considered disabled enough to actually get on disability, I have tried.

I'm not sure what could change my view. I am sure it is possible, but I do not know how. In all honesty, this post is coming from a place of desperation. I want to be wrong, but everything in my life has proven me right again and again. I've been the most depressed I have ever been in my entire life lately. I have only been able to lay in bed, and drink water, for 2 days now. I have not eaten in 30 or so hours. I feel as though I have genuinely lost the will to even survive, let alone live. Please don't tell me to hospitalize myself. That is where a fairly hefty portion of my trauma came from. I would rather perish and rot than go through that experience again."

It's common knowledge that most men rarely get likes and matches on online dating platforms whereas most women are bombarded with likes and matches which forces them to be incredibly picky. I believe this phenomenon is caused because most men are just mindlessly swiping right without much consideration.

It's sort of a chicken and egg situation. Most men swipe right readily because the probability that a particular profile has swiped right on you or will swipe right on you is low. They are trying to maximize the chances of a match. However, the reason why the probability is low is that from women's perspective, the probability that a man has or will swipe right on them is high and they would have to be pickier.

Guys, imagine this scenario: there is a profile with a girl, that looks like a goddess, posting in bikini pics sipping on martinis. Except this profile doesn't have anything on the bio. What would you do? Think about the likelihood this profile is a scam profile. Even if it wasn't, think about whether this girl would even be compatible with your personality and lifestyle. If you swipe right, it most likely is a waste and all that will happen is exacerbate this phenomenon.

The solution for guys is to be pickier on who they swipe right on. Don't go for premium plans that allow endless swipes. Also, limit the time that you spend swiping on these apps daily. If you are not getting matches on these apps, don't bother too much. It means nothing about your worth as a person as luck plays a huge factor. Think about online dating as a tool to get to know people outside of your social circle and not as a guarantee for your love life."

This can have varying difficulties unfortunately due to immigration law discriminating based on home country, but a bosnian who speaks will have a far easier time immigrating to even somewhere like Hungary or poland than one who only speaks Bosnian. At the very least, speaking English reduces exploitation by employment agencies and bosses by giving a common language.
* Career-wise, speaking English permits you to work jobs that require international interaction. With multinational companies, good jobs often require colaboration with teams in other countries. Lack of conversational, fluent English makes this an impossible task.
* Personal Growth-wise, speaking English enables you to consume news directly published by journalists in foreign countries, allowing you to see how life is in that country without relying on your native media to (mis)represent the situation. This is a very common issue with rural Hungarian folk being fed outright false news about life in Germany that if they were able to even talk to german people on a forum, would be resolved.
* Personal Growth-wise, speaking English enables you to consume material that might be banned in your country. For instance, if there's laws about ""LGBT propaganda"" with threats of fines and jail time, your only real source for such matters will be on servers outside your country's jurisdiction. This particularly applies to people in Russia, and maybe (unfortunately) one day to Hungary.
* Personal Growth-wise, speaking English opens up the globe for socialization. You can make friends in Spain, Germany, Poland, Russia, Brazil, Japan, US and the list goes on - you get to see a far more diverse set of perspectives than if you'd only spoke your native Language.
* Personal Growth-wise, the English wikipedia far outperforms any localized variant in quality and quantity alike.

Therefore, it is clear that speaking English is a must-have skill.
Unfortunately, as children are wont to do - they will not recognize these advantages gained by putting in the effort to learn English. They aren't fun - other than making friends in other countries  and wikipedia diving - and therefore suffer the same fate as other elementary-high school subjects.

However, if make English a requirement to enjoy highly entertaining, engaging media? Learning English suddenly has an instantaneous reward, a tangible sense of improvement and access to that which was impossible before you improved. It gives children a motivation far more powerful than any of my earlier listed arguments.

I know this out of anecdotal experience. I grew up in a rural, quite poor family - albeit with a PC and internet connection even if other things were uncertain. I engaged in ""traditional eastern european methods to acquire video games,"" and then played them until I hit roadblocks due to my lack of comprehension. So, like you'd practice last hitting in League of Legends to rank up, I worked with dictionaries and phrasebooks until I could solve quests in Morrowind, Gothic 2, KOTOR and other story & text heavy roleplaying games. Eventually, I got into playing Neverwinter Nights 2 online on heavy roleplaying servers, and I am utterly confident when I say this: If not for that, I'd probably be just like my countrypeople and barely manage to scrap together an English sentence.

If I didn't have the video game as a motivator, I'd have never put in the work. In fact, I have infamously neglected homework for all my classes. I had peers from wealthier families who received private tutoring, and yet I outperformed them when it came to English as a Second Language thanks to having a tangible, direct reason to study and then use it live. I ended up with B2 quality English by high school, and finished by high school with a C1 language certificate. Finally, my chemistry thesis was written and defended in English.

This is not an exceptional story. This is **the** archetypical story for all my friends - be they Russians, Spanish, Polish, Chilean - they have all vastly outperformed their peers regardless of their career choice (business, programming, engineering, theatre) thanks to being forced to speak English to play their much-desired roleplaying games.

By localizing video games, we are robbing the future generation of a very powerful language learning tool. 

Therefore, by the above argument: Localizing video games harms the younger generations of non-English countries."

* China´s oppression of minorities and LGBT people is not their fault: it is their way to protect themselves from western oppression, we can´t judge how they do that.
* Someone committing sexual assault is not their fault since they had autism, and trouble understanding boundaries.
* Palestinians wanting to genocide Jews is not their fault: they were driven to it by oppression.

Here´s a few things I saw in my own life over the last few months. These are real things told to me by close ones:

* ""He cheated on his fiancée months before the wedding, but he has ADHD so it´s not his fault, he couldn´t help it."", said by a psychology student
* ""The Algerian government is corrupt, sexism, homophobic and authoritarian, but it´s not their fault: they have generational trauma from colonisation"", said by a human rights lawyer

These are not isolated opinions. These are not a few random crazies on the internet. This is what the discourse is now in spaces visited and influencing dozens (hundreds?) of millions. This is not an anomaly you can ignore and wait until it goes away. And it is getting worse.

This way of talking about trauma and oppression has only been really popular for 3-4 years, and already it has gone so far. 

Add onto it the increasing spread of self-diagnosis, and the idea that these feelings HAVE to be affirmed as the default, and you are creating an epidemic of horrible people being excused of their behavior, and even being treated as the victim. "
1,2024-01-25,CMV: Consumers are just as greedy as corporations,u/SnailAdventure,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19faxpm/cmv_consumers_are_just_as_greedy_as_corporations/,changemyview,"They are just greedy for different things. 

If you subscribe to contemporary microeconomics, all voluntary transactions are positive sum, meaning mutually-beneficial. The seller values the cash more than the item, and the buyer values the item more than the cash. This is necessarily-so, since a party that doesn’t “win” in the trade would not accept it. This also assumes that value is subjective (a person dying of thirst values a glass of water much more, and would pay much more, than another person would, etc). 

The consequence of this is that corporations can only *sell* what consumers voluntarily value over their own cash. The businesses can only be as greedy as the consumers who buy from them.

If the balance is ever lost, it is corrected automatically. Corporations who are too greedy, and charge too much, lose market share and revenue, and must reenter the greed balance to compete. Consumers who are too greedy, and want items for less than they’re selling, will need to reevaluate their fair price threshold if they want to make successful purchases."

When I found out there was going to be a reunion movie, I was naturally excited and looking forward to it.

Unfortunately, while the movie had the obvious effect of getting the cast back together in character on one screen, it was otherwise, in my opinion, a stinking pile of shit.

Let’s start with the main and obvious one. Monk spends almost the entire movie preparing to commit suicide and constantly figuratively stepping up to the ledge and then back from it. This was a massive tonal shift from the show, which was never that dark. It’s also a departure from Monk himself, who certainly struggled but was always portrayed in a light and upbeat way. To have him contemplating suicide is such a severely dark deviation from the character and the mood of the show that it comes out of left field and feels like an insult to fans. This is the main reason the movie sucks in my opinion and I can’t understand why it’s not talked about more.

There are also other reasons. Captain Stottlemeyer always had a good moral compass, and wouldn’t have been so corrupt as to willingly look the other way when he realized his boss was a crook for “Rolexes and vacations” for the first 2/3 of the movie. Also, to kill Monk’s stepdaughter’s fiancé when she already had her mom murdered just feels like a dick move and they could’ve had another case provide the plot."

Servers/bartenders literally live on their tips. Giving bad service hurts your bottom line. A McDonald’s employee or a Dr’s receptionist could care less whether you leave happy or not. Tipping incentivizes people to be nice to each other and those who are nicer and more courteous will get paid more. This would help breed a culture where it pays to be a good person. 

Tipping culture also means prices will be lower since businesses don’t need to rely on paying as much for employees. This helps small businesses who are struggling to keep their doors open.  On top of this, it allows you to pay for the service you receive. Don’t you get irritated when you go to McDonald’s and you get home only to find out your Coke was a Diet Coke, you ordered a burger and fries but the burger was missing cheese and the fries were cold? Ever go into the Dr office and see the receptionists ignoring you because they’re gossiping about things that happened over the weekend. These things happen all the time in every industry, but the only one that penalizes the paychecks of those who aren’t giving you a good experience is the service industry. 

Quite simply: You will breed a society of people where everyone is nice to everyone even if it’s fake nice, you’ll still be treated important, it’ll make things cheaper across the board with easier wages helping small businesses, and you’ll only need to pay for what you deserve to pay for. Bad services mean bad tips, so if you don’t get what you deserve, you don’t need to pay what you expect."

Nations and political groups have always used it to coerce people into action. 

However, the last 30 years of increasingly ""personalized"" news and social media has created more and more self-contained echo chambers that deeply benefit from hyping their specific audience's particular fears and concerns. They rely on the age old technique of blaming reliable ""boogeymen"" that are out to get them.

As the increasing economic distortion field of social media makes us feel more and more insecure about our own social and economic standing, these echo chambers tell us that we, too, would be rich and powerful if some other group hadn't wronged us or wasn't trying to destroy us. 

In many (if not all) cases, there is some real injustice and, possibly, genuine concerns that ought to be addressed. However, the echo chamber serves to amplify the scope and scale of those concerns and discount or dismiss the concerns of others. 

The facilitators of the echo chamber profit from their enablement leading people to go deeper and deeper into the victimhood rabbit hole. 

People occasionally peek out of the rabbit hole and see that their victimhood is not validated by others or see other people's sense of victimhood as a threat to their own desire to be the ""true victims"" who deserve attention and restitution. 

Any denial of their ""true victim"" identity only serves as proof of the threat from the ""other.""

There is no truth unless it agrees with us. Facts are replaced with varying sets of ""alternative facts."" We are told not to trust our eyes or our feelings if they counter our narrative. They claim that the conspirators of our destruction are rooted deep in every institution and they are continually working towards our demise. 

There is no nuance. There can be no compromise. Every person who disagrees with us is ""in the pocket"" or ""under the control"" of ""the other."" Every fight is another step in the existential struggle. Every slight is proof of the other's intention to destroy. Every victory is a sign of righteousness. All damage done in the name of the cause is excusable. 

So... deeper and deeper we go until the only option left is the complete suppression and silencing of others who do not acknowledge our absolute and unarguable right to be validated and for our perceived wrongs to be made right. 

This, to me, seems like the template for each group I interact with and I see no sign that this will change given how the echo chambers are being reinforced by the increasingly ""personalized,"" click-driven media landscape."

Just because it's expected / agreed that the sitting President will do it? Why? If the first term of the President was really great then he would get the nomination anyway - but shouldn't it be an honest election?

Personally (and also I think indicated by the the latest data) it just seems like a recipe for a loss. Since there are people who just just really might dislike the current President. 

Is it not as obvious as it seems or what am I missing?

It reminds me a bit of the 2016 election where it also seemed (and I think later came out) that the Democratic nominee was not voted in completely fairly and that backfired too. But that's another topic."

As far as feelings during prayer go, I would attribute them as simply your own feelings about what you’re thinking about/internalizing.

I also believe religions follow a sort of natural selection, with less “strong” (against the human mind essentially) religions were consumed by larger ones, and then their children are indoctrinated etc… Point is, prayer exists in all religions because it’s a useful thing for people, and it’s an obvious thing to do if you believe in an omnipotent being that listens to you…

The knowledge and information taught to law students is important and empowering, and *everyone* should have access to that information without having to go through a rigorous and abhorrently expensive process. 

Sadly, that is not the case. Because of this, the population at large is **generally** not capable of understanding *most* legal writing - including both statutory law and case law. Hell, many lawyers themselves are not capable of understanding the full effect of many rulings outside of their areas of expertise.

And yet, with the recent disputes between Texas and the Federal Government on the border, I have heard and seen so many piss poor interpretations or explanations of the situation ranging from accidentally misleading, to deliberately misleading, to straight up wrong. The discourse is so bad that, until I went back and read the 5th Circuit order granting the injunction that SCOTUS vacated on Monday, I was actually completely mistaken about what had actually happened because I had read so much bad information. Such widespread misunderstanding  has led to tons of inflammatory rhetoric, often calling for violence. And what is scary to me is that the procedural history and the legal subject matter at issue here is not even particularly complicated, relatively speaking.

This is dangerous. People are being manipulated. Sometimes, people are manipulating other people without meaning to do it by simply being wrong about what they are saying, and that is very scary to me. Because of that, I feel like it is irresponsible for people who are not trained to interpret or voice their opinions on legal matters that they don't truly understand.

I hope I am not coming across as arrogant here. I feel the same way about other areas of special expertise, too - I would never presume to tell an oncologist that their interpretation of the latest paper on cancer treatment was wrong.

I want to believe that I am wrong, and that public discourse on legal issues can be healthy and productive - but based on what I have read over the past few days, I just have a hard time seeing it. If there are any lawyers out there, I am curious what you all have to say, too. Have at it."

Another benefit is that people used to be able to build a home anywhere. Now only animals can do that. Humans are not allowed to build a home. So a lot of us have to struggle just to survive.

Here’s my point: It doesn’t matter whether or not you’re Christian, Muslim, Jewish, or God forbid a Scientologist, but I’ve met very great individuals , as well as very hypocritical, toxic individuals within the same communities of each group.

This is the same with atheists, there’s great people, and there are bummers. 

I’ve noticed the growing amount of people calling themselves atheists — know-it-all, closed minded, “THERE IS NOTHING” — I don’t know how the hell that doesn’t get exhausting. 

Actually believing there’s nothing that created the system of which creates you while in utero. 

Actually believing there’s no point in being in this realm of existence other than to be miserable. 

Actually believing that going through all of that only leads to our demise and nothing else matters at all? 

But theres also chill, easy going, laid back, it is what it is types too. 

But just considering yourself anything at all in itself doesnt (maybe it does) do much, if anything, positive. 

The same people that call themselves atheists and claim “you can be a good person without religion” (which is true) are the same people that want to k*ll themselves the most, because they closed themselves off to believing in ANYTHING at ALL; including believing in themselves. 

Every major religion BELIEVES, they are right and everyone else is wrong, correct. So do atheists. 

The same arrogance, the same closed mindedness, the same confidence and/or confusion. There’s no difference.

I hope you guys are doing well. I'm personally very interested in trying to understand things to get to the most likely truth. I know the title can sound ignorant but I have to say that, despite being a homosexual man myself, I can be very ignorant about some of these things; but I'm still intelligent enough to be open to idea of being wrong and being curious about other people's views, and that's why we're here.  
  
My goal with this post is to know whether being ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" has to do with environmental influence or sexual orientation.  
  
I haven't met made non-heterosexual people in my life, as far as I know, the people closest to me are all heterosexual so I'm sure this might be the reason why I don't know much about these stuff other than my own life. Growing up I never had lots of friends or anything so the most consistant bonds I had were with my relatives, and especially with my biological mother, who was overbearing, and lots of aunts, and granma (my biological father would visit sometimes but was ultimately very absent), and an uncle from my biological mother's side, but I couldn't relate to him much.  
  
When I was a young boy (5-12) I remember feeling neutral with most kids my age, but feeling different from my biological older brother and not being able to relate to him. And maybe a bit with a male cousin who was my age, but I was more relaxed and neutral with him. Now, I know there can be lots of non-sexual reasons to ""feel different"" from someone, especially at a young age and having very different personalities. But I remember playing make-believe as the pink ranger, Kimberly, and even doing a feminine voice just like her when ""fighting"". My biological brother sometimes would call me out on this but I didn't care much, in fighting games I would pick guys sometimes but also female characters because I thought they looked more beautiful and agile. On one instance, I remember hearing my aunts and grandma telling my biological older brother to leave me alone and not comment on these ""feminine"" things. But my grandma would tell me to ""man up"" sometimes, and that ""the boys play with the boys and not with the girls"" when I wanted to play a lot with my female cousins and my biological sister. Ah, and at 10 I remember being called ""gay"" at school, I think because of some things in my behavior but also because I had a pair of briefs that kind of resembled panties.  
  
Interestingly enough, every single one of my crushes growing up were girls my age, and I was told when I was even younger I used to look in awe at a female cousin who was older than me.  
  
At around 12, I was taking a show with a younger male cousin and remember getting an erection, but didn't think much of it, and then (13-17), testosterone kicked, started watching adult content, realized I would pick the videos based on how attractive I thought the men in it were, googled ""men xxx"" or something like that. And, at school, some classmates teased me about me liking other boys like three or four times.  
  
The more I grew into my teens, the less I would hear comments on my sexuality, and the more masculine I felt to be honest. I got into a class group where we were like 17 dudes and 4 women so I spent a lot of time with other guys as well and became more open and stuff. Now, at 25. I think I'm still a sensitive and calm person, but I'm very masculine and have gotten comments on how masculine I am (mostly my voice).  
  
I know there are many heterosexual men who are ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" and many non-heterosexual men who are ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" but truth is, this is the only non-heterosexual person's experience I know, my own, so I can't help but compare it with heterosexual people's experiences in my life and wonder whether; being ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" has to do with environmental influence; in my case, more (dominant?) women in my surroundings or with sexual orientation; in my case, homosexuality."

I’ve tried these substances and experienced how potent they can be and alter your perceptions and outlooks for the better, but to say EVERYONE should give them a try is simply absurd.

Abusing psychedelics can lead to psychosis, HPPD, schizophrenia, worst case scenario a psychotic episode leading to death of the user or those around them. There’s a news article I saw getting popular recently about a woman having a psychotic episode off of marijuana and stabbing her boyfriend over a hundred times. 

Of course cases like these are relatively few and far between. Responsible users would take all of the necessary precautions to ensure the risk of an event like this happening is as minimal as possible, but not everyone is a responsible user. Even if you include controls like being of a mature age, having no history of mental illness in yourself or family, being in a safe environment at the time of effects, etc., the risk of mishaps is higher than 0% and must be considered.

I believe psychedelics and marijuana have the potential to give wonderful experiences and alleviate some of the stress that life carries, but these are powerful substances that must be respected, and the potential risks of everyone trying them just once outweighs the rewards. Not many things in life are meant for everyone and any type of drug is certainly not one of them."

After 1-2 weeks after the relative’s death, in one day my wife left home without wearing and when she came back home she found the ring bend, but really bad that she was not able to put it back on her finger. The problem is that she made the connection with the ring and the dead relative’s wish, bla bla bla, you figured it out.

1,2024-01-25,CMV: There Is Nothing Wrong With Travelling For Love,u/vercettiworthy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19fif3k/cmv_there_is_nothing_wrong_with_travelling_for/,changemyview,"Women on social media are celebrating because men that went to Colombia and used dating apps while in Columbia got killed. Women are happy because they've jumped to the conclusion that all of these men are evil without knowing anything about them and think they wanted to ""exploit"" these women. When in reality most men aren't sociopaths or psychopaths, they're regular men that went to another some possibly with the intention of dating and others possibly with the intention of wanting to meet and experience the country with new women. 

1. There is nothing wrong with being a man or woman, in this case a man and travelling outside your country for love. I could never imagine myself marrying a british woman, but I've travelled and dated in 4 different countries and have the conversations and experiences I have with women from those countries is more fulfilling than love island, pop culture topics, witchcraft. Not saying all british women are like that but from my experience alot are and when travelling the women are completely different and they dont use ""internet speak"".

2. Men aren't actually doing anything wrong by leaving the country. Women are very free to think they should do nothing while the man pays for everything in the west, women are very free to demand the highest of high standards from men while they want to bring nothing to the relationship, women are very free to be feminists, women are even free to say ""I wanna have sex with alot of men but im ready to settle a man needs to be available or he's insecure"", women are free to initiate most divorces so now divorce is basically a coinflip I'm literally on your side. But you can't say all that and then when men leave get mad, people can do what they want with their money as long as it's a regular relationship and not ""exploitation"" which isnt what most men are looking for regardless of what the scary media and social media tells you. 

3. Most men that travel aren't travelling to ""exploit"" women, most men that travel and date have regular relationships which can lead to them getting married. How hard is it for people to understand normal people travel abroad, normal people date abroad and normal people get married together abroad and stay in that country. Men and women that ""exploit"" people in relationships are going to do it regardless, no sane human is travelling just to ""exploit"" women and if thats what you think then you need to understand the exception isnt the rule. Millions of very normal men not wanting problems and a small minority of weirdos doesnt make those millions of men travelling to date women from different cultures and have new experiences bad people

4. ""men only travel to third world countries to exploit those poor weak women"" when I travelled to a ""third world country"" and went on my first date the idea of me being in a ""third world country"" and dating didnt come to my mind, I'm simply dating a woman from a different country, she's teaching me here language, she's teaching me about how things work. And those ""poor weak women"" women in ""third world countries"" are far stronger and more indepdnant than women in england and I can only really speak for england. Those women are strong, they speak with chest, they work hard, they're not afraid to get their hands dirty, they're not afraid to speak their mind. The false narritive pushed by western women that women that arent in countries where feminism is this popular thing where there's parades every month are being sexist by saying these women are weak and easy to exploit. They're not, they know their shit. Some of the most intellectual conversations ive had have been from women from countries western women who are ""proud strong independent feminists"" would call them weak. 

5. If men are tired of women saying they're insecure any time they have standards, if men are tired of women feeling like they should have a man spoil them while they almost literally do nothing, if men are tired of women are their ""delulu"" ""sprinkle sprinkle"" ""period"" internet talk and the constant hate non sense about ""men are broke"" ""men are sassy"" tiktoks I see every 10th scroll then men have the freedom to move and women have the freedom to open up and listen to these men. Women also have the option to keep their standards, I think its best you have solid standards but the man is also free to do what he wants. Most of you on the left want open boarders you realise there's men that would want to date those men? You want open boarders but dont want cultures to mix? ""Passport bro"" went from a man travelling to find love and women turned it into ""passport bro ohhh you wanna go to other countries to hurt people you're so evil"" lmao 

The idea that the person you love is in your city, country or region is low. Nothing wrong with travelling to have regular relationships with regular people which ive experienced and had amazing experiences with amazing women who arent nearly ""weak"" and ""exploitable"" as western women make out to be. Some of you should listen to what they have to say about women in the west, when I talk to people I let them talk and the contrast between western women and women around the world is actually pretty large, I'd highly recommend you travel and experience other cultures, dating or not."

This has allowed them to become equal to men in terms of earning capability. This also means you have an increasing number of situations where a woman will outearn a man, in some cases even by a significant amount. This is fine for the baseline level of life and it is more fair than it was back in the day however the byproduct of this had made dating much harder for men and women. You may not care about dating, however I am simply explaining how this hurt the dating/relationship game. 

&#x200B;

The reason why I say women's liberation is destroying the dating world is because of the earning capability. Men are hardwired to want to be the head of household and the leader of the family. When something goes wrong or something isn't ideal, the women and children look to the man of the house to fix it. It is an innate duty in men to lead their family and be the provider. The male beaver builds his dam to attract a female beaver. Thus, providing for his beaver family. The male bird builds the nest for his wife and his kids. Humans are a little different, but the core principle is the same. As a man you're supposed to build your ""dam"" (in this case house/money). 

 This is hardwired in women too. How is a woman going to depend on you if you earn less than she does? When times get hard, she can't look at you for help through tough times because of this. When you're with a woman it is your job to make her feel safe and to give structure and security in her life. The world is still a dangerous place for a woman. If she is the one making the big decisions of the household, then she's going to lose respect for you because you are not stepping up enough to be the rock she can lean on. You can't be the head of a relationship when you're earning less. It's hard to listen to someone with less money than you, especially if it's significantly less. A woman is not going to respect your dam/nest if it's smaller than what she can have, she may as well be single then. 

This whole thing leads to women having a harder time finding men they respect and a harder time for men building a dam big enough. You end up having a society where women don't respect men and men feel depressed because they're not whole because they aren't living up to their expectations to be leaders of society. "

1,2024-01-25,CMV: We don't have sufficient reason to believe that conscious AI will never happen.,u/FiveAlarmFrancis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19flbfk/cmv_we_dont_have_sufficient_reason_to_believe/,changemyview,"So first, I'm not arguing that AI \*will\* ever truly be conscious. I have no idea if that will, or could, ever happen. What I'm responding to is the number of people who seem strongly convinced that it can \*never\* happen. I'm also definitely not arguing that any current ""AI"" or LLM (GPT, etc.) is or could become conscious. 

I have no expertise in any field relevant to this topic, so I'm very open to having my view changed. I've seen many people say that ""AI can never be truly conscious,"" and I want to understand what makes them so sure.  
With that said, my argument goes like this:  
Consciousness is, as far as science and evidence can show, is an emergent property of a brain. We can define what it means to be conscious in different ways (sentience, self-awareness, the ability to feel or experience, etc.), and opinions differ on what exactly ""counts"" as consciousness. Regardless, every example we have of consciousness, as far as I'm aware, is the product of a brain.  
Brains are made of matter. They are tissue made up of cells made up of molecules made up of atoms. Brains receive, transmit, process, and store energy in the form of electrical and chemical signals. Matter and energy make up everything a brain does. Information, communication, thought, sense experience, etc. all boil down to physical processes taking place in the material structure of the brain. In other words, as far as we can tell, consciousness is merely a physical process. Why then should we assume that there could never be another kind of physical process that could also create consciousness?  
Our brains evolved through natural selection. We've replicated and even improved on many other abilities that evolved the same way. For example, birds evolved the ability to fly and then humans created airplanes. Birds can fly because they evolved things like hollow bones and feathers that allow them to create lift. Humans didn't have those advantages, so we created a different way to exploit the same physics and now we can fly higher than any bird ever could. The point is, there's more than one way to achieve flight. Why can't there be more than one way to achieve consciousness?  
Once again, I'm not arguing that AI, machine learning, LLMs, or anything like that \*will\* or \*likely will\* ever be conscious. My view is that we have no sufficient reason to conclude that it's \*impossible\* for anything other than organic brains to produce consciousness. I don't see how anyone can know one way or the other. So, if you're confident that AI can never gain consciousness, I want to here from you as to why.

To change my view, you don't need to convince me 100% that AI will be impossible forever. That would be asking you to ""prove a negative."" I'm on the fence as to whether or not AI can be achieved, but I tend toward the idea that it \*might\* be possible someday. I will award deltas for reasonable, evidence-backed arguments that push me in the other direction."

The idea that you can’t be straight unless you’re totally and utterly repulsed by any sexual experience with the same sex is wrong. Male and female animals, for example, often engage in sexual play and humping with their own sex, especially before sexual maturity. Men and women who are incarcerated for long periods of time often engage in same sex relations. Most of them are considered straight “on the outside” but are “gay for the stay”. On voyages in the age of exploration, sex between male crew members was very common. And I think more boys than are willing to admit did questionable things as tweens and young teens. I know a number of guys who identify as 100% straight who mastered the art of baiting with other boys when they were in their early teens. 

That brings me to my point. Sexual preference is just that, a preference. It isn’t set in stone. We all have a sex drive. We all have a preference. But like with food, sometimes our drive to eat/have sex overcomes our preferences. Straight guys hate the thought of this, but I will always say it’s true; if all women disappeared from the earth for 5 years, 75-80% of men will have sex with men by the end of the 5 years. It works like that in prison, it worked like that aboard ships, so why wouldn’t it work like that in the real world? 

Given that, I would say no person is completely straight, and the idea of that even being possible is a social construct and an identity."

1,2024-01-25,"CMV: Israel Is Not Committing Genocide, Hamas Is Attempting Genocide, and Most Criticism of Israel, Including Accusations of Genocide, Is Motivated by Antisemitism",u/AMG_MDM,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/19fnjbd/cmv_israel_is_not_committing_genocide_hamas_is/,changemyview,"You read that (fairly lengthy) title. Because the title contains three parts, I’ll split this post into three parts.

1. Israel is not committing genocide:

Genocide is the deliberate and systematic destruction of a nation, ethnicity, culture, or religious group. That is my definition of genocide, and I’m sure that most people’s definitions are similar. Thus, to prove that someone is committing genocide, one must prove the following:

1. That the accused is destroying a certain group of people in some way, usually through mass murder.

2. That the accused’s actions are deliberate and done with the usually explicit intention of the permanent destruction of a group of people.

3. That the alleged victims are actually being destroyed.

We can easily apply these to many genocides throughout history, including the Holocaust, naturally. The Nazis tried to kill as many Jews and other “undesirables” as quickly and as efficiently as possible. They sent some victims to concentration camps where they died of exhaustion, starvation, and disease. Other victims were sent straight to extermination camps and killed on arrival in gas chambers. In the earlier days of the Holocaust, the *Einsatzgruppen* gunned down Soviet Jews en masse. The Nazis went to great lengths to document these killings. At the Nuremberg Trials, practically everyone accused confessed in some way, though some tried to argue that they were “just following orders.” So, the Nazis undeniably murdered millions in pursuit of racial purity. The Nazis also fully intended to carry out the Holocaust; Hitler advocated for the extermination of Jews several times in *Mein Kampf* as well as speeches, and Himmler gave an entire speech justifying the genocide of Jews. So, they more than met the second criterion. As for the third criterion, the most common estimate given for the number of Jews murdered during the Holocaust is six million, though some say five or seven million. At the time, Europe was home to some 9.5 million Jews, meaning more than half of all European Jews perished in the Holocaust. Indeed, almost all Ashkenazi Jews today are related to Holocaust victims. So, the third criterion was easily met as well. Now, let’s apply these criteria to Israel.

A common canard is that the Israeli government or the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is trying to exterminate the Palestinians. This accusation, however, is contradicted by the evidence. Let’s start with the first criterion, that Israel is trying to destroy the Palestinian people. There is no conclusive evidence suggesting this. People commonly cite the casualty numbers of the current Israel-Hamas war, in which as many as 25,000 Palestinians have lost their lives. That is a large number, but genocide would usually mean much larger numbers. This conflict has gone on just slightly longer than the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, which lasted about 100 days. During those 100 days, between 800,000 and 1 million people were slaughtered, 32 to 50 times the numbers of Palestinians killed thus far. Additionally, the IDF has stated that roughly a third of Palestinian casualties have been members of Hamas. While this *does* mean that the majority of casualties have been civilians, such is the case in nearly every modern war, especially urban warfare. In fact, the war has a remarkably *low* civilian casualty rate compared to most other conflicts. Additionally, Israel has tried to limit civilian casualties through leafletting, roof-knocking, and evacuation orders. Israel *has* hit declared safe zones, but unless proven otherwise, we cannot say that Israel did so deliberately. So, the first criterion has not been met.

The second criterion has not been met either. At no point has Israel expressed the desire to exterminate the Palestinians. Some far-right Israeli politicians have advocated for expulsion to Egypt or other parts of the world, but genocide is still on a completely different level. Plus, if they intended to exterminate the Palestinians, then why fight a long, protracted war instead of just nuking them? Gaza is so small that a single nuke would probably level everything in Gaza and kill millions in a flash. It would be quicker and far less costly than fighting a war and would accomplish the same goal. Occam’s razor suggests that genocide is not a part of Israel’s agenda.

And even if those were true, the third criterion still wouldn’t be met. The Palestinian population is *skyrocketing.* Both Gaza and the West Bank have very high fertility rates, and Palestinian population growth is so high that the number of Palestinians killed during this war is insignificant. Israel has barely made a dent in the Palestinian population. If that’s genocide to you, then your definition is flawed.

2. Hamas is attempting genocide

Now, let’s look at the other side. On the other side of this conflict is Hamas, a Palestinian Sunni Islamic terrorist organization whom the Gazans elected in 2006. Hamas then killed all of their opposition in Gaza, creating a one-party Islamofascist dictatorship. Hamas also began firing endless rockets at Israel, and in October of last year, launched a genocidal attack on the Jewish state.

1. Hamas meets the first criterion for genocide. Hamas deliberately targeted civilians during its onslaught and filmed themselves murdering, beheading, raping, mutilating, and cannibalizing innocent Israelis

2. Hamas meets the second criterion as well. Hamas carried out the Oct. 7 attack purely to kill Israelis and wipe Israel off the map. 1,200 or so Israelis died in the attack, the deadliest attack on Jews since the Shoah. Hamas operatives have since said that they planned to repeat the attack until they killed everyone in Israel. Hamas’ 1988 charter also makes clear their intention to destroy Israel and murder all of her citizens. That’s almost as damning as the evidence against the Nazis.

3. While Hamas, thankfully, has yet to meet the third criterion, the amount of death and destruction they could’ve caused was immense. Let’s suppose that Hamas killed the same number of people they killed on Oct. 7 every day between now and then. Over 120,000 Israelis would be dead now. Granted, that is still a lot less than the number killed in the Rwandan Genocide, which lasted about as long, but it’s still almost five times the number of Palestinians killed. Frankly, though, the fact that Hamas has managed to stoke antisemitic sentiment worldwide is probably still a success in their eyes. Obviously, their planned second Holocaust was prevented, so I can only consider this an attempted genocide.

3. Accusing Israel of Genocide and Other Criticisms of Israel Are Rooted in Antisemitism

Israel has every reason to consider itself the Jewish state. The Jewish people originated in the area that we now call Palestine, though it used to be called Judea. The Holy Land is another name for the area in which the Jews originated. The modern concept of a Jewish state was the result of Zionism, the belief that Jews constitute a nation and deserve the right to self-determination. Zionism developed during the end of the 19th-century following a surge of antisemitism in Europe, including pogroms in the Russian Empire and the infamous Dreyfus Affair in France. Theodor Herzl, a non-religious Jew from Hungary, organized the first World Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland in 1897. Zionism became increasingly popular among European Jews, and, following the Balfour Declaration in 1917, which promised a Jewish state in the Holy Land, hundreds of thousands of Jews immigrated to what would later become Israel. Following World War II, in which Nazi Germany tried to exterminate the Jews, Zionism became even more popular, and the Jews were ready to finally have a place where they would be forever free from persecution by gentiles. Just as that happened, their Arab neighbors attacked with the goal of crushing the dream of a Jewish state before it could truly be realized. Fortunately, the newly-independent State of Israel won. The Arabs then expelled their Jewish populations; communities that had existed for hundreds of years suddenly ceased to exist. Fortunately, these Jews had a place to go, a place where they would be safe and accepted: Israel. Most Israelis nowadays descend from the ~900,000 Jews that were expelled from the Islamic world following Israel’s creation. Zionism is not a hateful ideology.

Furthermore, claims that Zionism is hateful seem to parallel claims that the Jews are an insular people that believe themselves to be superior to all others. In the eyes of many antisemites, Jews view goyim as cattle that only exist to serve them. Now, think about it. People essentially  make Israel out to be the devil, almost as if they believe that Jews are evil. Indeed, several Jewish advocacy organizations have pointed this out. So, it would seem that opposition to Zionism is a reinvention of old “Evil Jew” stereotypes, the stereotypes that led to blood libel, the stab-in-the-back legend, white genocide, and numerous other false claims.

Before you say anything, the reason Israel seems bad on the news is because Israel has a free press. Because Israel has a free press, reports of settler violence or war crimes by the IDF can come out. Israeli news sources can also freely criticize Netanyahu and the Israeli government as a whole. People hear these reports, and due to availability bias, people think that they are common occurrences in Israel. The fact that Israel is a Western country and US ally is also likely a factor, especially among “anti-Western” members of the far left.

If you actually look at Israel and Palestine, that the left generally supports Palestine seems absurd. Israel is a democracy, the only one in the Middle East. It is one of the few Middle Eastern countries in which homosexuality is legal and is easily the safest Middle Eastern country for queer people. The Israeli government even recognizes same-sex marriages, provided that they are performed outside of Israel. Meanwhile, Palestine has two governments, one of which is a theocracy that kills its own people and the other of which is a slightly less theocratic, slightly less murderous version of the former. Gays get thrown off of roofs, beheaded, and stoned to death. Women have no place in society except as *de facto* sex slaves. The people are some of the most mindlessly hateful people in the world. Their *children* dream of exterminating the Jews. It’s *that* bad. And yet, leftists go on and on about how they oppose bigotry, while supporting a “country” founded and ruled by bigots and terrorists. The reason why is antisemitism. It’s as simple as that. Palestinian terrorists reframed the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a struggle for independence from
“oppressors,” believing that they could garner support from leftists in doing so. Their plan, seemingly, worked perfectly.

So, yes, if you oppose Israel, even if you identify as Jewish, you are (probably) a closeted or inherent antisemite. Let me hear your rebuttals."

During the Armenian genocide from 1915 to 1923, the entire collective Armenian population in Anatolia was relocated, murdered and their children Turkified. This meant by effectively stopped existing compared to beforehand where Armenian populations there dated back thousands of years settlements were many and sprawling accross the eastern parts of Anatolia and reaching down towards modern Syria and Iraq. During this time, they were scapegoated by the Ottomans as backstabbing Russian-loyalist traitors and treated as such. This was because the region with Armenians had many rebellions from Turkish rule to escape the discrimination, heavier taxation, pogroms which resulted in Armenian massacres for centuries by thay point.

Needless to say, I believe that it is a greatly overlooked and forgotten fact that Armenians would've been near extinct if not for the Russian Empire and later Soviet Union which protected the remaining Armenian population from extermination in the Russian controlled Armenian areas. This is why this area still exists with Armenians today whereas all thr Anatolian Armenian areas under Ottoman authority have vanished.

If the Russians hadn't held this territory, it is likely that the Ottoman violent retribution would've reached the remaining Amrenian enclaves and resulted in the total annihilation of Armenians and their near extinction apart from a select handful of diaspora Armenians that have by that point migrated to Europe and America. We would be looking at Armenians today as a sad curiosity of the past and a lesson on genocide as we do for the Holocaust and other such events.

All this to say, Russia saved the Armenians and prevented the complete extinction of their people group."

Okay sure on average women get way more attention than men but how much of it is good attention? Like if a guy is catcalling a girl should the girl think of it as positive attention? Quality males are as rare as genuinely good females. 
Even on dating websites, women get way more matches but most of them are from horny men who have no intention to build an actual serious relationship. In fact, dating websites are the prime example of this, the ratio of bored and horny men to good men is probably 10:1.

To people still disagreeing with me; I give you a challenge, make an online catfish profile and see the amount of “Hey” and unsolicited pictures you get. But if you actually try to engage with these people, 90% will be terrible assholes who just want to “pump and dump” women. 

 I am no expert on dating and social skills but my best advice is, “Work on yourself and surround yourself with positive people, you’ll naturally find someone who vibes with you.”"

One political party can't just wave a magic wand and make everything better in 4 years. Same internationally. I think there will be more foreign conflict like with Ukraine and Gaza. Again, a lot of it due to decades of terrible foreign policy such as the US starting coups, arming terrorists, bombing countries, sanctions. Things will continue to get worse before they're better.

So, even though the next 4 years will be a disaster out of the control of either party. The political party in charge will still get all of the blame. And therefore the opposing party will win the election in 2028.

0,2024-01-25,"CMV: The best way to respond to tailgating, high-beaming, speedy drivers is to waste even more of their time, and all three should be more heavily penalized than they are",u/DullahanJake,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ab7nl3/cmv_the_best_way_to_respond_to_tailgating/,changemyview,"There is an argument to be made on behalf of anyone who ever has been stuck in the fast lane by someone cruising, or stuck behind a visually impaired, elderly driver. There are morons out on the road who don't signal, drive like snails, hold up traffic. I accept this.

However.

Tailgating is never a necessary or advisable driving behavior. It increases the odds of an accident that the offender will almost certainly be on the hook for.

Most if not all new newer cars come equipped with white, piercing lights on front. Woo-hoo I can see on those dark dreary nights. But now, if I am less than 3 car lengths behind someone and they don't have light dampeners on their windows, at extra cost to them, that person is likely being blinded by my heavy duty LED ligjhs. Oh well, good luck anonymous low income stranger, sure hope you turn off soon.

What do I mean by speedy. People who do 10 or 20 over the speed limit. There is never a good reason to be doing this. Leave earlier. You only do it because there is not an automatic consequence to your actions. You do not need to be doing 50 in a 30, 40 in a 20, or 60 in a 40. I refuse to believe every person doing this is rushing their pregnant partner to the hospital.

Somehow all 3 of these behaviors typically end up together in my experience.

Best response I've had to all of these is to just slow down even more. 

* Its cathartic. They're making my day worse. Might as well make theirs worse. 
* Slowing down encourages them to pass - and likely get busted for being stupid further down the road. 
* Its gives me little risk, certainly no more than I had previously, and forces them to take a larger risk (calculating when they can dart around me). If they're risk-averse they might chicken out. I've had a few high beamers slow down and lower their lights, probably because I can barely see and they realize they're not helping.

In my area there is a school with multiple signs posted that limit speed up to 25. This is inconvenient to me as this is my work route. Every week though I come through here and someone has the urgency to gun it behind me, tailgate me, and blast their white high beams into my mirrors. Just recently someone did this and waited until we were at the next turn where we could do 50 (and I did) before they turned their lights down. I could not understand why it didn't occur to them to do this earlier.

Except, that there is no steep penalty for blinding someone, so no one practices courteous behavior. Its not required to have a license and own a car.

Tailgating in city areas maybe is ounished more. I've lived in the countryside most of my life and I feel cops are less busy out here. Still doesn't seem like I see cops chase down people tailgating often. 

Speed limit abuse is harder, but I absolutely think there should be a steep fine for this, and it would tip the cost/benefit ratio of the average driver for speeding, and probably produce a more productive society when people need to be on time more rather than feel they can risk speeding all the way to work.

I understand this would likely punish low-income drivers who run a heavy risk of losing jobs if they don't make it in on time. I'm one of them. That said, I'm tired of seeing people zipping past me when I'm doing the speed limit to the point I don't have a lot of empathy.

I feel as though the same people I'm angry at feel a similar lack of empathy. ""Well if it bothers you so much you'll invest in light dampeners for your windshields."" That's what I think, and if I'm right then it's dog eat dog. I'd rather drive slower and safer to make you late for brunch than bend to your yoke.

I understand some cars are just larger than mine and maybe the driver doesn't intend to harass me or blind me. I do feel bad in that case, but its hard to judge/pity that, and it still feels as if most drivers I encounter don't bother turning their lights down, as if this isn't taught in driving schools.

I understand in bad weathed it can be necessary to havw brighter lights on more frequently. I've driven in a blizzard. Funny thing is though I still jabe 4-wheel drivers who don't acknowledge bkack ice, drive up behind me, and slide past me in wintry conditions with their brights on.

So its very difficult to separate any of these three behaviors from each other, for me. I think if someone thinks you're going too slow you should go slower to piss them off and make them make a mistake, and on top of thst the risks/penalties of engaging in any of the 3 should be steeper to nore actively discourage them

The lack of universal Healthcare in the country is appalling. It is a myth that countries with universal Healthcare have longer wait times or worse outcomes, in fact the opposite is true. I wrote a whole essay on this a few years ago. Healthcare is a human right, and it shouldn't be radical to believe that someone shouldn't die because they're poor. There is also massive amounts of inequality in Healthcare. 

Teachers are not paid nearly enough and are forced to take on far too much responsibility outside their job description. Many schools are overcrowded and it is ridiculous that the one tax we can regularly directly vote on is whether schools should get minute increases in funding. 

The fact that politicians can legally be largely funded by corporations is atrocious. So is the two party system and the electoral college. 

Government shutdowns: some people loose their source of income and some people are forced to work without pay. Why? Because congress couldn't come to a compromise and decides to impact millions of lives rather than being rational and negotiating with the other side. 

Do I even need to go into law enforcement? The inequal ways they treat people, especially people of color, the immunity and privilege they have in court, and the lack of training they receive causes massive problems. 

The legal system is messed up in several ways. Firstly the amount of discretion judges have is crazy. They can let someone convicted of a crime walk free or sentence them to death. People are also commonly convicted without evidence (especially people of color) and overturning a conviction can take decades, even if they have convincing evidence of innocence. 

The BLM's wild horse and burro program is also not managed well. There is over 50,000 horses in holding and even though the mission of the program is to ""manage and protect herds,"" horses can legally be shipped to slaughter under a loophole known as the 3 strikes rule. The appropriate management levels (number of equines the BLM determines the area can handle) is not based on science and is often set far to low. Livestock also get priority so much of the destruction attributed to horses is actually caused by livestock. I also wrote an essay on this lol. 

The older I get the worse my opinion of this country gets. I have personally experienced many of these issues and know that I (white middle class woman) am privileged enough to not experience many of the other issues. 

While some are much larger issues than others, I believe that every sector, no matter how big or small, has major issues that will not get fixed in the foreseeable future.

1,2024-01-26,"CMV: The term ""far-right"" should be retired (in place of more situation-specific and fitting labels)",u/rrlzsrnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1abbkjk/cmv_the_term_farright_should_be_retired_in_place/,changemyview,"I hate politics. I hate it because of the disunity and division. I believe we need to be civic, but I can't stand how politics increasingly divides people and makes them hate each other when we actually have a lot in common. I'm not a utopianist. I'm not like John Lennon. I know there will always be some level of conflict. I just think we can bring about more unity naturally through more reasoned discourse. I hate hearing the term ""far-right""  thrown about for several reasons:  


FIRST - the word is ill-defined (no matter the inherited or assumed meaning)

I don't know what it literally means. Its meaning doesn't make sense. In the normal sense, ""left"" means ""wants more government (and blessings thereof like security, equity, etc)"", and ""right"" means ""wants less government (and blessings thereof- more freedom, personal responsibility). Therefore in this definition, far-right is most represented by small town farmers minding their own business- but this is not what people mean. You could say right-left comes from the French era, where the right were monarchists and that is centralized power but nobody on the right is really a monarchist. 

In actual fact I would say in the standard definition, both the nazis and communists, their polar opposite, both want a big central government. That's not where they differ. Where they differ is on the ethno-nationalism and egalitarianism/universalism spectrum, so why not just call them left wing nationalists? How can the term ""right"" encompass both the rural farmer who wants a small government with a nationalist that wants to tell you how to live, just in a different way? That makes no sense to me.   


The word is ill defined and such ill defined words would never be used in science, or mathematical proofs  


SECOND - it strikes me that it's just gamesmanship, a rhetorical tactic to bludgeon and stoke fear with no consequence for its misuse  


It strikes me as playing games, stoking fear. It's such a cheap shot.   
I've grown up around both right wingers and left wingers but nobody is violent (that I grew up around). Most people have good ethics and have more in common than not. This word stokes fear in the so called 'left' and frustration and resentment in the so called right, as they feel labelled, confused, misunderstood and conditionalized (emotionally blackmailed- to yield their position or be called a name). None of this is pleasant and all goes against freedom of thought. 

The idea is that someone who is far right is like a nazi and by extension a bigot, a hater, a murderer.   


If someone, some group of people gathering are nationalist, call them that.  If they are racists, call them that. If you falsely call them that they can call you out but at least you're being specific. You're being rational, you're putting your cards on the table. Nationalism is not inherently genocidal but it is a step in that direction for sure. If some group is violent, call them violent. I also don't like the word ""extremists"". Although it doesn't suffer from some of the same flaws as far-right, it is usually not specific about what someone is extremist for and is too easy for someone with bias to just say without explanation or detail. I live for detail. I'm a 'just the facts kind of guy'. I will read opinion for entertainment and to entertain new ideas but I don't like my views spoonfed to me.   


Certain things are bad. Name them instead of hiding behind vague terms. Call people nationalist, racist, violent, if that's what they are but don't use far-right as a de facto pejorative A because it doesn't have clear meaning as in point one- and B you're using it for gamesmanship.  


I hate how it is so easy to use- a cheap shot and those who use it don't have any accountability. There is nothing at risk for them. Everyone still believes their credibility. They're more than welcome to call people nationalists, racists, violent people (where they would have to justify their terms) but here's what happens when you use ""far-right"" ""extremist"" terms. People on one side get scared, and protective. This is real. My mom got that way. On the other side people feel misunderstood.   


This sows exactly the kind of division I hate. I believe we have more in common than we realize. I believe people play us like fools because people can't think.   


So many words and terms would not pass in a scientific field, as they don't have clear precise meanings. I am a lover of definitions. I hate when people play games (I'm going to read Eric Berne's book ""Games People Play"" as it's been one I've wanted to read for a while). I hate when games are played unless everyone wins. Ok, there's a place for honest competition -for a romantic partner or for business but I'm a lover of ethics and honor. My mom played games with us in terms of judging, name calling, gaslighting. People usually don't name call bluntly. They do it passively, subtly. This is a huge pet peeve of me and I see it in politics so much.   


And I'm scared there's going to be world war 3. Well I'm not terrified, and whatever will be will be, but there's a chance there could be and it's also totally preventable if people are just reasonable.   


I've accused people in the mainstream and left of misjudging people on the right- or groups- as 'far-right'- some of whom you could say are on the left as they want centralized power. What is right anyway? How can it encompass two very different type of people?   
   
Do people on the 'right' attack the left? Of course I call out all violent ethno-nationalists, any stupid patriots and war mongers and abusers. Of course. They fight in a different way. They perpetuate lies, they create myths, but they are logic sounding. At least they try to use logic and try to make a case. I am against lies. I hate lies so much. I spend my life trying to question all I know and I have recognized so many lies taught to me and as a result I eat better, I'm healthier, I'm happier etc etc. I hate lies. But the other side that is also bad and corrupt doesn't lie so much as screech and rattle people's emotions with all these terms and phrases and emotionally charged words.   


But the majority of people- I believe we have more in common than we realize if we could only be rational. I'm a big fan of Descartes. I am a big fan of questioning assumptions, using precise terms when necessary, using reason.  


We have more in common than we realize. I wish those who use half-formed words and concepts to stoke fear and create division could be punished somehow in a karmic sort of way - i.e. by getting some kind of blowback, from people recognizing how dumb it is.   


If you only commit to questioning assumptions and defining terms, and using language clearly, then in the political space you'll sound more reasonable and intelligent than most university political science professors. I admit they're intelligent, but as the Hippocratic oath states- first do no harm. Less is more- if you can't speak clearly don't speak. That's my motto. It's fine to have strong feelings about things- be impassioned. Labels and pejoratives means usually that you don't have an argument- not that there isn't one. Just that you don't have one and they are hardly necessary in any case. People are people. There's a person underneath. Far-right and 'extremist' is a pseudo-pejorative (I'll gladly maintain), especially, especially when a group or individual doesn't identify as such. It is a pseudo and de-facto pejorative and just an all around divider and fear stoker (as if we need more fear of each other) and is an ill defined term that should (but definitely won't) be relegated to the dustbin of history. Maybe I can at least change somebody's mind and get this out there.   


I wanna say, if you've gotten this far, I give you my admiration, LOVE and respect and I hope you have a wonderful day, a wonderful week, and a wonder year whoever you are. Really- I feel you're probably in the top 1%. To steal a quote from Oscar Wilde and to make it better (because I love principles) ""I like people more than politics and I love people without politics most of all"". Not 100% true- politics has its place but funny and poignant nonetheless. "
1,2024-01-26,CMV: There is no way to prove that life itself is 'real',u/wastrel2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1abbq58/cmv_there_is_no_way_to_prove_that_life_itself_is/,changemyview,I guess what I actually mean is that it is impossible to prove anything. There is no way of knowing anything is true. I could be living in the Truman show right now. Or we are all in the matrix. Or some other major part of my life is a lie. There is no way for me to be truly sure of anything. Any possible proof could simply be fabricated without my knowledge. For example; I could be the only conscious entity to ever exist. Our entire universe and everything in it could just be a figment of my imagination. A hallucination. There's no way for me to disprove this.

1,2024-01-26,CMV: National Guard members deployed to the Texas border should defy their orders.

Members of the national guard take an oath to defend and uphold the constitution of the United States; the supreme court has said that the constitution is with Biden, not Abbot; members of the military have a prerogative to defy unlawful orders. If you obey unlawful orders to defy the constitution you are an oath-breaker and a traitor. 

I would extend this even further to say that if you live in one of the states whose governor's have pledged to send troops to Texas and you consider yourself a patriot - you have a patriotic duty to resist and interfere with that. You should do anything in your power which isn't illegal to prevent it from happening, and to punish anybody who participates in it."
1,2024-01-26,CMV: The job market in the US' tech sector is not uncharacteristically overheated.

The US' unemployment rate is currently 3.7 % which is incredibly low and arguably close to the point of inefficiency. It is indicative of a pretty significant labor shortage if anything. 

Well, how about the tech industry? If it's so competitive, surely the unemployment rate should be high. 

The unemployment rate in the tech industry is 3.1 % in December:

https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf

Sorry, this is completely inconsistent with a highly overheated job market. The tech industry is doing great, except not as great as it could **because of a labor shortage** and not a surplus. 

If you got fired from your tech job in the midst of the recent mass layoffs, I feel for you. However, stop spreading rubbish about the state of the industry. You can find a job yesterday, but you don't want because you value working on League of Legends more than pursuing a deadend 9-5 like the rest of us.

1,2024-01-26,"Cmv: if feminism and all it entails is such crap, the best way for its opposers to beat it is to adopt it to speed up ""the decline"" rather than resisting it thereby slowing it down.",u/Taohumor,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1abfb5v/cmv_if_feminism_and_all_it_entails_is_such_crap/,changemyview,"Looking at you influx of red pill memers. Bad system is bad, adopt it  to prove a point. That way you can truly be part of the solution instead of bitching about it because you will be blowing on the cinders, sparking bigger flames faster, then when it burns the forest down you can say you were right that this system doesn't work and not have your soul sucked dry resisting it. Even better because you supported it a feminist can't blame you for fucking it up somehow, you were being an ally, you said the words, you did the things. Maybe if you're lucky ""respecting wamin"" will find you a girlfriend I hear girls like respect and you can enjoy the decline together. If it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't, also feminists can spend less time fighting opposition and more time with actual social reform, right?

If patriarchy is so good, then stop supporting it with your actions to demonstrate why it is so good. Simple geometry. If feminism is so bad, then when it doesn't have an opponent to fight on the outside it will collapse on itself. Take this challenge for example, I'm literally recruiting from the enemy and giving clear motive that fuels the ego of even the most self serving and self destructive malignant narcissist to smile and play along, if a feminist says anything bad about this they are turning on themselves because what I advocate for their victory and the surrender of opposition. The only way to beat this is to assume bad faith. It's a perfect trap for both sides because both sided will oppose the idea even though it guarantees their victory over their opposition, and worse it unites them in an idea against me therefor building a bridge.

I've solved the equation so you don't have to. Now come at me and crucify me. Will give triangles for good feedback.

This might be proof of concept that some people want conflict and not progress. Really eager to see how things turn out."

1,2024-01-26,CMV: All Ethical Problems are Just Probability Problems in Disguise,u/Pyrephecy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1abo60y/cmv_all_ethical_problems_are_just_probability/,changemyview,"I will elaborate, but let me define a few words i have used for some of my concepts.

I will define an *experiencer* as ""the smallest entity that can experience pain or pleasure without assistance."" A human leg is not an experiencer because it can not feel pleasure or pain without a brain. A group consisting of a human brain and the components needed to sustain it however, would, as far as my understanding goes, because it can feel pain and pleasure on its own, and it would not function while missing parts - making it the smallest entity that can experience pain or pleasure.

I will define a *negative overflow* as ""the amount of pain resultant from an event that is greater than that resultant from the same event."" Thus, an overflow of negativity. An important thing to keep in mind is that the calculation of a negative overflow should mot be concerned only with immediate effects. For example, if the event of poisoning a river will cause pain in the far future, that pain is resultant of the event as well, and must be included in the calculation. A positive overflow would be vice versa.

I will define a *positive overflow floor* as ""the positive overflow experienced by the experiencer experiencing the lowest positive overflow."" 

Now that those terms have been defined, I believe that every ethical conflict can be solved by;

First, attempting to quantify the amounts of pleasure and pain in everything, in as logically as possible. 

Then, calculating the ratio of pleasure and pain being experienced by each experiencer in existence as logically as possible. 

And finally, attempting to steer any given event in a direction toward which there is the least negative overflow as logically as possible. If a choice must be made between events with the same amount of negative overflow, the event with the highest positive overflow floor must be sought.

By turning ethical dilemmas into a utilitarianistic algorithm, every moral quandry would be a simple statistical question regarding which courses of action can fulfill the algorithm the best.

For the algorithm itself to be flawed, there must be a scenario in which a hypothetical situation that is solved by the algorithm to be unethical.

EDIT: If a choice must be made between events with **no** negative overflow, ==> If a choice must be made between events with **the same amount of** negative overflow,

EDIT2: Clarification on the concept of negative overflow"

1,2024-01-26,CMV: History does not repeat itself; it rhymes.,u/MuskySkunk,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aboxhm/cmv_history_does_not_repeat_itself_it_rhymes/,changemyview,"While semantically investigating the aphoristic phrase, ""history repeats itself,"" may seem arbitrary as the original purpose of this aphorism is to simply state the historical cause & consequential effects that can occur in our individualized micro lives and institutionalized macro countries, I believe a poetic revision of the aphoristic saying ""history repeats itself"" would be more accurately portrayed as ""History rhymes with itself,"" because this is more precise language to illuminate the idea that history builds off its own causal events.

Such an impactful word as 'history,' is difficult to contextualize. With many micro- & macro- examples available within historical accounts and our lives, the only tangible evidence that is mutually shared among all of us would be our differences of our upbringings. Whether you had three parents, two parents, one, none, or other typical guardians, these caregivers wish to guide you (for better or for worse) to be the person that they wish to mold. At times, you may thrive or deviate from this environment; but ultimately, these foundational blocks by these guardians are what upbrings our early lives to influence the type of character that we may become in the future.

History repeating itself may imply that the nature of a human is at a constant; although, this phrase also ignores the possibility of new inventions and concepts (that we may not know of) that may reshape society's and human's structure. For example, the rise of smartphones and social media/communication starting in the 2000s inherently shape cultural norms in the West, while creating a new genre of hobbies and careers based on an evolved median (computers) that has built off of previous technological inventions. What type of concepts from 100 years from now that may destroy our current reality of metaphysics today? History would have to build off its own technological inventions in order to create futuristic teleporters, flying cars, other Back to the Future references, etc..

Lastly in poetic terms, rhyming gives a predictive melody what the next phrase of the poem may say, but our predictions may be one or two letters short of the actual outcome. 

""I was having a ball throwing shit against the stall! All until ma balls against the wall.""

Rhyming would seem more appropriate than repeating, as repeating indicates a concise order of events to occur, while rhyming indicates the flow of the causal beginning events leading into the effectual climax, ultimately finishing as a poem with a lesson and moral to learn about for the next lesson in life.

TL;DR: History does not repeat itself. History rhymes, because it builds off itself and its predictions can be more accurately foretold."

However the methods that have been established have just been so convoluted and corruptible due to human error; or in the gas of nitrogen has even dangerous to those around the condemned.

Instead the drop hanging method should be used for all executions for these reasons

.it’s quick and painless

.no blood spatter/gore (draw of firing squad)

.it’s cheap 

.with proper calculations it will never fail

.not a danger to those around the condemned (nitrogen)

Second, why I think this is important enough to make a fuss about.

## How should they be defined?

0^0 = 1

0/0 = 0

0 (mod 0) = 0

### Why?

0^0 = 1 is already almost universally accepted by mathematicians. So much so that in all fields of math, 0^0 is either defined to be 1, or left undefined. [Furthermore there are not, and have never been, any authors defining 0^0 as anything other than 1.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_the_power_of_zero?wprov=sfti1#Current_situation) 

0 (mod 0) = 0  
First let me say, I understand that n mod 0 is left undefined for all non-zero n for obvious reasons. But for n = 0, whatever arguments you used, kinda fall apart. So it feels like it would be reasonable to take a closer look at this case. We obviously can't assign it any number with absolute value larger than zero, because we're taking mod 0, so the only number left is 0. And it extends the idea that n mod n = 0 for all n.

0÷0 is an empty sum. One of the most notorious reasons I've heard advocating for 0^0 = 1 is that it's an empty product. By that logic, why can't we say 0/0 is an empty sum? There's not really as much too this one, it's mostly that 0/0 can't be defined as anything non-zero, and defining it to be zero doesn't seem to cause any problems. And it extends the idea that 0/n = 0 for all n.

This wouldn't change anything algebraically, (n/n = 1 , n^(a)/n^(b) = n^(a-b) for all n≠0 was the case before and it still is now), it's only arithmetically that things have changed. I've simply decided to fill the hole of what was left undefined.

## Why should they be defined anyway?

(TL;DR: it's mostly just me whining).

This is mostly my experience, but the whole reason I decided to make this post was because one line of code was just the last straw. In my code I was assuming n (mod n) = 0 for all n, which felt like a super reasonable assumption to make, but when I was testing edge cases, I got an arithmetic error. 0 mod 0 was undefined, which confused me. Why not just define it as zero? After looking into it, I didn't get any answers other than ""because n mod 0 doesn't make sense for any n"". Nothing rigorous, just the same assertion over and over.

Then a bunch of arguments online started coming back to me where I was defending 0^0 being undefined when I lost my footing so-to-speak. One of the biggest counter arguments is that 0^0 *is defined* to be 1 in ℕ. So I wonder now, why can't 0/0 and 0 (mod 0) be the same? 

Arithmetically it fill holes, and makes certain situations in programming  and higher math easier, with fewer edge cases. Any situation where it's helpful to define it as such will be much more concise, and any where it's not, we just exclude 0 anyway like we already do. In cases like programming, we have to work around these 0 cases anyway, why not just allow us the opportunity to use the special case where it's definition is useful?

So my stance is that all of the three I've listed should be true in ℝ, but I'd even be happy with those only being the definitions in ℕ.

## Preemptive Arguments / What would change my mind?

The main argument I've heard is ""The Argument From Limits"". Because lim f(x)/g(x) → 0/0 ⇏ lim f(x)/g(x) = 1.

And I agree. I never said it was. My argument was never from limits. It was just to fill the arithmetic hole of being undefined. It was discontinuous before, and it's discontinuous now. nothing has changed except I put something in the hole that was left undefined anyway. 

The main counter argument I've used, and the main counter argument I expect to get is ""It will be too complicated for calculus students. Imagine trying to teach students that 0/0 is indeterminate, and also 0/0 = 0, it would be maddening for both parties"". I agree, and I believe (as of yet) this is the only valid objection. However, it doesn't quite convince me. It's mostly just a ""Student's will just have to deal with it"" kinda thing. Either they'll keep asking questions until they understand, or they'll just memorize the fact that ""if I see 0/0, it's 0, unless it's in a limit"", which isn't too complicated to memorize.

It doesn't really add any barrier to serious math, and it also is an opportunity to learn more and understand why we define operations the way we do. So I don't think this line of debate would change my mind.

### What would change my mind? 

Any blatant contradiction caused by defining these as what I've given would certainly be enough. This would attack my ideas at the heart, and I would be forced to change my view.

Alternatively, attacking the ""should be"" part of my view. If you showed that it would be far too annoying for mathematics to deal with 0 in these scenarios. To be clear, it would have to be a genuine nuisance to the day-to-day life of a mathematician, not just something where you have to add one or two extra sentences to the top of your paper each time.

These are the main ways I can think of, but I'm still open to change my mind."

1,2024-01-26,CMV: I disagree with Dark Souls’s design philosophy,u/Lordkeravrium,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1abyczp/cmv_i_disagree_with_dark_soulss_design_philosophy/,changemyview,"I would like to start off by saying that I will block anyone who insults me in the comments or anyone who tells me to “git gud”. That’s not what this post is about and I want to be clear that this is just my opinion and I’m very open to hearing what other people have to say. That being said, that doesn’t mean I’m not going to argue back in any way.

I’d also like to be clear that I’m specifically talking about the original dark souls game.

So, I love RPGs, both tabletop and video game. I find them to be a blast and when I hear that dark souls mimics old school DnD through its design philosophy, I wonder what’s not to love.

I’ve always heard that these games were frustrating and punishing. So I give them a try.

I first played Bloodborne which I had a blast with. There was something cinematic about it that I really enjoyed. It wasn’t just punishing in its combat, nor was it just rewarding, it was fun and had an element of escapism to it.

Now enter dark souls, I enjoyed dark souls 1 for a long time. But I eventually started to realize its whole design isn’t about fun. Or at least, not what I’m calling “fun”. It’s about being rewarded. There’s a certain kind of enjoyment that comes from reward, but when the entire moment to moment gameplay begins to revolve around reward and it doesn’t compel you in any other way, it isn’t only frustrating, but reward becomes the only reason you end up playing.

I’m aware that dark souls has wonderful lore and worldbuilding, but the lore and worldbuilding don’t seem present in the moment to moment gameplay. And fans reply to this by saying you’re supposed to discover it through interacting with the game, but the problem with this is that it’s again- not fun. 

It feels like I’m being fed a dose of morphine every time I beat a boss. Yeah it’s rewarding but the reward goes away when you realize it’s just a video game and you actually accomplished nothing of significance. Reward is an important tool in video games I won’t lie, but when that’s all that’s there in the moment to moment gameplay, I have a hard time getting on board from a conceptual standpoint.

I’m not saying that this kind of gameplay isn’t enjoyable, but it misses what’s really important, fun. If you’re not enjoying the process of beating that boss, you aren’t having fun, you’re just enjoying the experience of reward after the fact. And I won’t lie, the reward is immense in dark souls. But I’d say Bloodborne did it better in that the process of playing the game is actually enjoyable and not just the outcome of victory.

Old school DnD is very much enjoyable both during and after completing a challenge. Dark souls claims to take from it, yet it’s missing the whole idea that you create a story while you play and enjoy the process of doing so.

In Bloodborne, I get this feeling of creating a story. I can’t quite explain how but the world and narrative are much more present throughout the game even if it’s not spoonfed to you.

I guess my takeaway is that Miyazaki had improved the formula by the time he made Bloodborne. But I do feel as if the design philosophy had changed between games."

Most other superpowers can be done with telekinesis. You can fly by moving yourself, have superstrength without even touching. You can water/earth/fire/air bend. But let’s not stop here. Without limits, you should be able to move atoms and even subatomic particles.  You can theoretically create something out of nothing by breaking down the atoms around you and forming new atoms, then condensing them to make whatever you desire. You can shapeshift yourself or other people, instantly heat or freeze anything by changing the speed at which the atoms move, and probably make something dense enough to make a black hole. This is only scratching the surface of what can be done with telekineses. The only things I think can’t be done are things involving time and traveling between dimensions. Unless there is a way."

3. Arabs, and Muslims in general, will always advocate annihilation of Israel whether Palestine has a territorial foot hold in the region or not. Their religion prescribes subjugating or eliminating Jews, so there will never be consensus among the Arabs that Israel has a right to exist.  
  
4. Egypt, a Muslim Arab country would not have an open border with Palestine because Palestine is a total mess run by Terrorists.

That’s not accounting the already service you pay for, taxes, and potentially gratuity fee. It’s gotten to the point where if you don’t even tip, depending on the waiter/worker, they look so pissy and annoyed and give you a death stare.

Waiters are the worse of it from my personal experience. They deliver you food and take your order. Then when you pay, they expect an extra 20% tip for their “service” when all they did was carry my food.

I always believed that I pay for what I receive and nothing more. Tips are an incentive for good work,  and I don’t see why I should give extra money to people when I am already giving them money in exchange for goods. 

I have heard many people say that tips are a way for employees to make a living. Well I get that, but it’s their job and we citizens shouldn’t be the reason why they make 1/3 of their salary. Personally opinion, but I rather restaurants charge more on their food rather than continue this culture of tipping. It made dining out for me less enjoyable when I have the worry about the wrath of an employee when I choose no tip.

Idk, I just hate how tipping culture is forced down upon you. In some registers, they don’t give you a “no tip,” which is annoying as it is. I’m not trying to start an argument, but I want to hear other people’s perspective on this."

Now, based on the title, you might be shaking your head and thinking this is all just some pill rhetoric, but before you do, let me try and explain this a little further. 

For those who did not see the last post, I will be 25 in just under 3 months, and I only had my first kiss a month ago. Nevertheless, I'm still a virgin. Other details about me, in case you were curious, I am Canadian (of Iranian descent), balding, 5'6.5"", mildly autistic/asperger's, have GAD and dysthymia, and am currently in my final year of my master's degree with the hopes of doing a PhD in epidemiology/pharmaceutical sciences. 

Now to cut to the chase, a thought that I feel like I've had inside of me ever since 8 years ago when my mind got utterly destroyed by what was going on in high school is that some people (regardless of gender) truly are incels or involuntarily celibate. Now I'm not speaking about the really radical ones who believe in morbid things, but I'm referring simply more towards people like myself who, despite doing everything they can given their challenges, just simply cannot succeed in dating and honestly life in general.

To use myself as an example:

* I obviously do not need to provide the statistics about how practically next to impossible it is for people with ASD (especially males) is to get meaningful relationships. The autism subs can explain that just fine, and I am practically a textbook case of that.
* I'm obviously vertically challenged, which once again, do I even have to explain how much of a struggle it is not just in dating but practically life in general? The short subs can do that just fine.
* Minority ethnicity in a predominantly white country
* Will not become anything more than middle class given what I'm pursuing (which is also the best possible route I can do at this point).
* I've seen 12 (including my current one) therapists, and practically none of them have been able to help me unless the external circumstances in my life were positive (which sadly didn't happen a lot of times). Some of these therapists even reinforced my bitterness towards others.
* I've employed strategies that my social skills therapists provided (including active listening, open ended questioning, dressing nicely etc.) and guess what? Still no success with relationships and minimal success with friendships, especially given the numerous betrayals/backstabbings/ghosting/fake people I've had the misfortune of encountering in high school, undergrad, and even beyond
* Based on personality tests, I'm also considered to be an INTJ, which unsurprisingly is the least compatible personality trait with North American society, given what I've shared and others in the respective sub have shared

You could take a couple of these traits, particularly autism, and put them into someone else and you'd see practically the same outcome. Unable to find meaningful relationships despite their best efforts. Once again, I'm not referring to the people who are clearly too far gone in their ugly personalities, but moreso for the people who may not have such personalities but still struggle and fail.

On the other side of the spectrum, I feel like some people have what I call ""supernatural love powers"". What do I mean by this? Well, take Mormons for example. They practically don't have to do anything above and beyond to find love and get married at a prime age, and I feel that even those with the challenges I mentioned above would still be able to find meaningful relationships by virtue of their religion, ethnic background, or social status. 

So yeah, I hope this isn't too controversial, but I would not have posted this if I wasn't truly desperate to change my perspective, even if I admittedly might have some difficulty accepting different perspectives initially. "

But based on recent conversations, it seems some people think specific freedoms and human rights are necessary for create a good economic situation. I strongly disagree with this, and there’s numerous historical examples that prove otherwise.

Most European colonial empires were absolutely brutal in their treatment of native populations in the colonies, yet these empires made up nearly the entirety of the global economy. Specifically the British and French Empires. King Leopold would be a more “tame” example however, as most of his pillaging seemed to have been limited to the Congo. Hell, American treatment of the Philippines and Cuba was pretty brutal too.
Barista’s regime in Havana was really authoritarian too, but the country was doing okay economically.

Most of the Middle East is still extremely repressive on human rights, but most of the Gulf states are doing quite well for themselves. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE are fucking theocratic monarchies for crying out loud, and we all saw the horror stories during the soccer/football tournament last year. But have you seen how much money Saudi Arabia wastes, or looked at Dubai?

The same has been true historically as well. Ba’athist Iraq and Imperial Iran we’re clear dictatorships (and Iraqi treatment of the Kurds is still terrible). But prior to 1991 and 1979 respectively they each were huge regional economic players. 

This is probably we’re I’m going to catch some flak. The Soviet and Eastern Bloc’s economy did okay for several decades, even using 3rd party numbers there was steady economic growth during most of the Cold War. That’s until their eventual stagnation, but I digress. And nobody will contest their authoritarian nature. 

Moving East, the PRC is the 2nd largest economy in the world. That’s after Tiananmen Square, the Cultural Revolution, and all the other purges. China is doing okay, at least on paper, yet nobody will contest that their authoritarian.

Even Western-backed countries in East Asia were authoritarian for most of the Cold War. When the South Korean economy exploded, they were cycling between various Juntas. For its short existence, South Vietnam was also doing okay economically, but was lead by a Junta during the 60s and 70s.

I hope I made my point."

This concerns me because I don’t want my kid to grow up feeling like I am constantly looking over his shoulder, it doesn’t feel right. 16 years old is legal working age in a lot of states, if a kid this age were to say earn enough money to fund his own mobile plan why should the government tell him what he can and can’t download because he’s 16???

It's a demographic issue there. 

What's happening?

* Population growth comes exclusively from immigration
* Former and current immigrants have many more children than the natives
* The youth, including the children of the natives, are predominantly woke Marxist type

The youth, including the children of the natives, are predominantly woke Marxist-typeg natives and immigrants. When they become the majority (which is inevitable) - it will lead to total thought policing (much harsher cancel culture) + nationalizations or 90% taxes on the middle class- the 'bourgeois' (because that's where Marxism ultimately leads, dictatorship and stealing from the 'rich').

In response - the others who are not part of these categories (natives over 40 years old with some business/property/job etc.) - obviously want to prevent this. However, the alternative cannot be democratic (because in a few years, the Marxists + immigrants will become the majority). Therefore - the others support Trumpism and the far-right - expelling immigrants, stopping immigration, and the idea of free voting to cease (the attack on the Capitol in Washington, etc.).

Why is this chaos actually greatest in the USA? Because they are exactly on the edge between the two groups:

* Ethnic minorities (black/Latino) are already at 30-35%
* Democrats widely open the border for illegal immigration (about 1% of the population annually!!)
* Woke/Marxist movements have completely captured the youth in big cities + office workers + the academic area.

So the woke/Democrats will inevitably win the 'popular vote' from now on because they have the numbers and are further increasing them through illegal immigration. Obviously - the others want to stop this, even through dictatorship if necessary, through armed revolts, anything. And they will do it.

In short - I see the future in the West is one of two options, in which democracy will no longer exist anywhere:

* A new type of Marxism (with eco, LGBTQ, and Islamic flags)
* Pro-business fascism, anti-immigrant and anti-woke."

Just in case, yes, in best pot with best carrot you can still f up if you eg. overboil carrot, put it aside and take mediocre chef, not ignorant who never cooked in life. The result would be amazing with two drops of world's best olive oil.

My buddy and I will die on this hill. My argument is that if you went to a restaurant and ordered boneless wings and chicken nuggets, you would always get two distinctly different dishes. If you went to a restaurant and ordered boneless wings and you received a plate of chicken nuggets covered in sauce you would think to yourself, “hey these are chicken nuggets, not boneless wings.” And you would not be happy that that’s what they served you. 

Chicken nuggets have always been ultra processed shaped “nuggets” and boneless wings will never be processed to the degree that nuggets are. Another part of the argument brings in chicken tenders. If you call boneless wings nuggets, you have to call chicken tenders nuggets too. Granted, boneless wings are not deboned wings. That’s just the name that restaurants have adopted to please people and give people a “boneless wings option.” Change my view."

There is a lot of talks about how housing has become unaffordable and landlords are just taking advantage of everyone but I don’t think that’s the issue. 

I think the real issue is people want to live in urban areas with high populations and a higher COL. Some cities around the world where this type of complaining happens a lot New York, Toronto, Los Angeles and London. These cities are all expensive and are the most popular or among the most popular cities in their respective countries.

Considering all these cities are among the most expensive places to live in their countries, I think complaining about not being able to afford living there or in the surrounding cities is just ridiculous. While they may be expensive all the countries where those cities are have an abundance of places around the country that is affordable to live. Of course if you want to buy a house in Los Angeles or Toronto you will pay a premium that’s the way all major cities are around the world. Even living one city over or 1-2 hours out is still pretty close. 

Many older people who bought years ago for cheap did so in a completely different time when these cities weren’t what they are today, they actually helped develop these cities into what they are and are reaping the benefits decades later. People nowadays aren’t willing to go to anywhere underdeveloped and help grow a community for that length of time. Instead they think they are entitled to live in the most expensive parts of country and complain as if they have no other options. 

I’m not saying things aren’t a little inflated but acting as if buying property is just not a possibility for younger generations is just completely inaccurate and a bad mindset. Just because your parents lived somewhere doesn’t mean you’re also entitled to live there. I think everyone deserves the right to shelter, food and safety but not in the literal best circumstances."

There's few people who want to speak to men about the issues the face in a way that doesn't either center women or blame men. I took multiple feminist studies classes in college and something I noticed as the only man there was that how patriarchial standards harm men was also said as a footnote, minimized, or implied that men were holding the boot on their own heads. 

As a man born in 2001 who has literally no political or socioeconomic power other than my own ability to vote, I could easily see how this would be frustrating. I feel there are issues I have to deal with that women do not have to. I also feel that it's not other men that cause 100% of those issues 100% of the time. A lot of women who believe they are feminists don't want to acknowledge this because they feel conceding any point to women having any aspect of life easier than or playing into certain patriarchial roles anti-feminist and pro-men.

Men are struggling to date more and more. I mean I saw some statistics that men age 18 to 30 were twice as likely to be single than the same age group. Many young men are struggling to find romantic partnerships. The ""feminist"" view to that is to tell them that they're not entitled to romantic love. The Petersonian view is that men are struggling and they should be allowed to feel what they feel and it is a problem that so many men are lonely. g that hates you.

With this I think there's been a bit of an overcorrection to casual misogyny that women specifically in my generation do where they call for an end to casual misogyny (valid and correct) while combating it with casual misandry. Again, seeing both of these views perpetuated by what you believe feminist are and by someone who calls themself a feminist, you're not gonna want to look into it. You'll view it as something counter to you and something that hates you.

This is such a common belief that the average man's exposure to ""feminism"" is likely going to be from social media and turn him off from feminist ideals. I mean why would he? If some 19-year-old dude keeps seeing online that not only is he oppressing women but he's also the cause of his issues, he's not gonna see feminism as a positive thing. st, you're not gonna want to look into it. You'll view it as something counter to you and something that hates you..

*As far as I can tell, this YouTube channel makes videos about the entire world. It doesn't seem to have a clear Israeli or Palestinian leaning.*

Essentially, the video looks at the geography and terrain of Israel and explains why control of the West Bank and Golan Heights, which sit elevated above Tel Aviv, are vital to their national security.

Israel doesn't trust their neighbors to not try to kill them, so even though it's illegal, they refuse to give up control of these two areas of strategic importance. Israel may have peaceful(ish) relationships and most of the Middle East right now but who knows if that would hold if a favourable situation to attack them arose.

Tldr- If an attacking force controlled Golan and/or the west bank, they could bypass the Iron Dome due to the elevation difference between those two areas and Tel Aviv. This leave Israel little to no choice but to control those two areas."

Teachers accepted non-peer reviewed articles, and articles listed as sources on Wikipedia, but not a Wikipedia link itself. Simply because they knew it was too easy.

For example if you lose job and can't find job, become homeless, your choices are steal or die if begging for mercy didnt work. You can say but jobs are abundant and so is money and food! Prove it I will listen. Food is abundant when you see plants that have food on them lining every street so that you can just pick an apple and nobody loses their mind. That's abundance. The nature of paying for food is the admission and acknowledgement that this is a limited resource at its core, that you need to give your energy for this ie pay for it.

This means everyone in the world is in constant competition for success to the limited food available. It feels not limited because the machine is churning smoothly for you, but it is a machine churned by the hand of man, it is not a natural occurence in nature. Stop turning the wheel for 1 day and everything is chaos. It can be but it's not, because not having to work to eat means you don't buy into the game as much and don't need it for your survival. Food has to be scarce in society for you to serve or it would need to provide you with another scarce service for you to work and pay premium for. The job market wouldn't have people working 12 hours barely able to feed their kids thereby increasing the cost of labor drastically because they need an incentive other than the fear of hunger, like wanting something nice a luxury of some sort. Is life itself a luxury to be grateful and to toil for no matter the conditions of said life?


This is a simple example as a concept and can be applied to anything including police and military. Both are fueled by the things they protect against. Crime fuels law enforcement, it is the food they eat so society needs to grow the food known as crime for law enforcement to sustain itself.

Find what sustains the thing, and see if it isnt an ouroboros(snake eating it's own tail).

For life to not be a zero sum game, ok your turn and don't give me some shit antidote about how its a matter of perspective because perspective doesn't make an apple spawn like magic when you are hungry. Or does it? Dm if you're a wizard and know the secret forbidden arts actually asking.

A marital relationship should have the husband and wife being both understanding.

That if the wife wants every 2-3 days of sex and the man wants once a week, then they can do every 4-5 days.

If the wife wants to tell the husband something that he should change in himself and he misunderstands and assumes that she’s insulting him. Then causing the wife to be mad and shout, which he then calls “wolf!” he should understand that he made his wife mad with his words and assumptions.

If the wife has a complaint, then it’s so unfair if the man tells the situation to the wife’s dad in a way where he isn’t wrong, but i am. (I always end up being the person who needs to change after a “fight”).

If the man and wife are a special relationship, they should be best friends and respect eachother instead of not wanting to talk because “there’s nothing to talk about/do” or “i have nothing to talk about” but then light up when the wife’s dad or anyone’s around.

If the man enjoys with others aside his wife,, shouldn’t she have the right to want to be with him? Is it right if the man complains that “I can’t look at you forever”

In a marriage, there shouldn’t be negative assumptions about eachother, but the man always takes the wife wrong and vice versa, is it wrong for the wife to get offended and try to prove the man wrong by her words?

Is being married okay to be your whole life? Because the wife can’t feel like she’s okay without the man, but the man can live without her,,

***Just a little context: im trying to challenge my own views,, because according to these relationship views i have, it’s causing a lot of issues in my relationship, i just want to debunk them , because i feel that the “right” relationship views constantly conflicts with my personal relationship views and feelings.

I understand the premise of the parents serving as legal guardians for minor children in that the children are not considered mature enough to make their own decisions, and therefore their parents legally make decisions for them. However, this premise rests on the assumption that parents have their children’s best interests at heart and will strive to make decisions that are in the best interests of their children. In situations where children are in poverty and the parents choose to keep custody, though, this clearly isn’t the case; if the parents are choosing to force the children to live in poverty rather than giving them a chance at a better life via adoption, they clearly do not have the children’s best interests at heart. 

Young children might not be able to make a fully rational decision about this. For children 13-17, they should be able to decide that they want to be put up for adoption, and this should be allowed to happen, even if it’s not what the parents want. For children under 13, if they are in poverty, a neutral party should be assigned to gauge the child’s desires and decide whether or not adoption would be the correct choice. If the child wants to be adopted, and the neutral party affirms that the child understands what it would entail, then it should happen, even if the parents don’t want it."

Powerlifting and calisthenics both offer functional benefits that rival those of bodybuilding (Better bone, joint and connective tissue health, contributing to healthy testosterone levels, better quality sleep, metabolic benefits) however they also offer greater levels of absolute strength, (in powerlifting) and relative strength (calisthenics) and are more functional.

If someone has greater than +\-25% of your total life experience, you will likely not ot be compatible.

This would mean:

A 25 year old’s compatible range is 19-31.

A 30 year old’s: 23-38.

A 40 year old’s: 30-50.

(Note half years are rounded up).

Why do I think this….
 
Well, close your eyes and think of the last quarter of your life. What did you discover about yourself? What happened during that period? Did you graduate college? Buy a house? Have children? Experience a close loss? Fight in a war? Start a full time job? Do you look back on the **first** three fourths of your life— the decisions you made— with a cringing retrospect? 

I’d wager most people 25 and older feel their lives just began, picked up, or solidified in the last quarter of their life. If someone has lived 25% less or more than you issues will likely arise and those issues will snowball.

3,2024-01-27,CMV: Non-offending pedophiles should have legal access to erotic material that is NOT CSAM,u/ChemicalPotentialY2K,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1acksuh/cmv_nonoffending_pedophiles_should_have_legal/,changemyview,"**Introduction**

I think pedohebephilia is one of the most misunderstood topics today and comes with an understandably large social taboo. People want to protect children, as they should. There are a lot of very dangerous people who use and abuse children and adolescents for their own gratification. I think each and every person who abuses children in this way deserves to rot in prison for the rest of their life. I also think anyone who has actively manufactured, distributed, or consumed child-sexual assault media (CSAM) deserves the same fate. These people absolutely deserve the punishment they get, and often more so. More should be done to weed out child molesters within families/family friends as well, as this is a pervasive problem especially among highly religious families that needs to be solved. 

However, on that same token, we cannot let our understandable emotions get in the way of preserving human rights. Pedophiles and hebephiles (males sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children and adolescents, respectively) did *not* ask to become the way they are, and there is no established evidence that a pedohebephile can become a non-pedohebephile ([Cantor et al 2008](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18039544/)). These people's brains were simply wired the wrong way likely by pure accident. They can't un-wire it. The best they can hope for is anti-androgen medication to reduce libido. Even then, that only reduces the frequency and intensity of sexual fantasies.

So we're left with people who have a very taboo sexuality that they can never hope to fulfill consensually, as most people are able to. So what are we then left with? We're left with people who are probably going to have a certain level of sexual frustration. So one may ask: what do we do? Thought crime is off the table. I don't think we should imprison people for simply having these sexual fantasies. I think they should be able to talk about these things with their therapist without the risk of being put on a list.

**Fictitious pedohebephilic erotic material (FPEM)**

The subject of my CMV is the pornographical aspect. Note that I'm specifically talk about fictitious material that does not involve *any* harm of real-life children. I'm mostly referring to things such as *shotacon*, *lolicon*, written erotica, and sex dolls. I think that the benefit that comes from the legality of these things is two-fold:

*1) It takes traffic away from child porn websites*.

As much as we wish people would use their better judgment and that their better judgment would win out against their erotic urges, this doesn't always happen. Many of us who don't consume FPEM can recall something we regret masturbating to. For those people who would otherwise seek out actual media of child sexual abuse, providing a legal and ethically less terrible alternative takes traffic and therefore demand away from child abusers.

*2) It provides an outlet for those who might otherwise abuse a child*.

Going along with point 1, FPEM might also provide a less ethically and legally dubious alternative for pedohebephiles to actually hurting a child. Humans are lazy, and a pedohebephile who would offend in any other setting might be content getting their fix from easy-to-access legal erotic material that allows them to sleep at night.

Ultimately, this is a harm reduction strategy. I don't deny that there are ethical and moral considerations to take with FPEM, but when weighed against the alternative, it looks attractive. Until we live in a utopia where we can give them a nanobot injection to re-wire their brains, we have to learn to live with them, and that means making some hard decisions that make our stomachs churn.

**Common arguments against legal FPEM**

In order to save time in the comments, I'll include the best argument I've heard against FPEM (made by my girlfriend actually).

*FPEM can de-sensitize a pedohebephile to and romanticize the reality of child sexual assault, dulling their ethical convictions against it over time, even for someone who wouldn't otherwise hurt a child.*

I think this so far is the strongest argument against FPEM to me. It's an understandable objection that uses good analysis of how media influences our ethical framework. However, I think the overpowering majority of people who are rightly disgusted by child sexual abuse will provide an avenue of coercion via shame to ensure that those who stray are kept in line. 

Counterintuitively, the available research seems to show that the availability of hardcore pornography actually *decreases* sexual crime in certain populations [https://thesociologicalmail.com/2019/06/27/does-drawn-paedophilic-images-encourage-or-discourage-behaviour/](https://thesociologicalmail.com/2019/06/27/does-drawn-paedophilic-images-encourage-or-discourage-behaviour/). 

However, there are limitations to the research, and with the advent of generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) making images, there are some new ethical quandries to consider that did not exist 5 years ago. For instance, recently there was a [14 year old girl who sadly killed herself](https://www.eviemagazine.com/post/girl-14-commits-suicide-boys-shared-fake-nude-photo-suicide-squad) because boys at her high school spread GPT-generated pornographic images of her.

**Conclusion**

This is not a simple issue. Anyone who pretends it is is lying to themselves. Sometimes we need to have difficult conversations in order to figure out the best way to minimize harm. The available evidence seems to suggest that the availability of pornographic material decreases sex crimes to a minimum, and the rest needs to be dealt with using other avenues. FPEM might reduce demand for people who make CSAM and for child trafficking rings. I'm in no way saying this will fix the problem. For instance, I wasn't born yesterday. I'm not going to believe, for instance, that Jeffrey Epstein was the first or the last major child sex trafficker who catered to wealthy, well-known people. I'm looking forward to the discussions, including any ideas people have for how the ethics of AI fit into this.

Similarly, in order to explain discrepancies between our theory of gravity and our observations, scientists invented ""dark matter."" This is a substance that supposedly makes up 80% of the universe but can't be observed experimentally. There isn't a single shred of empirical evidence that dark matter exists. According to Occam's razor, it is more likely that our current understanding of gravity is completely flawed, rather than the majority of the universe being made up of something that can't be directly observed. Rather than admit the entire standard model of cosmology is flawed to it's core, scientists deploy ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"" like gravitational fairy dust to make their equations work."

You’ve probably seen it used in this very community. The reason is this tactic is too easily abused in argumentation online. 

I’m not going to argue about whether one’s personal experiences related to their identity can be a meaningful discussion to have. The fact of the matter is, our society will take certain ideas more seriously if they come from people with certain identities. It’s why people share their identities in this context in the first place. 

The reason this is problematic online, and not in real life, is because there is no way to prove that one actually holds the identity they espouse. It is easy to take advantage of people’s natural propensity to hold certain identities in higher authority on certain topics in order to advance.

I see this a lot with people holding socially conservative views, while claiming to be a part of the minority group their view most affects. I know this tactic is used on the other side of aisle as well, where it has equal capability of being abused.

If a guy doesn't feel like it's worthwhile to have sex if his partner insists that he wears a condom, that's his prerogative and a boundary he is entitled to.  If his partner shames him or tries to guilt him into wearing a condom, she's being manipulative.  No one is entitled to sex or entitled to sex in the manner that they demand sex occurs.  If he doesn't want to wear a condom, that's his choice and then his partner needs to decide whether or not she still wants to have sex within his boundary or not.

I see posts in women-centric subreddits on a regular basis where women complain about men not wanting to wear condoms and call those men all sorts of derogatory names and even calling them sexual predators and assaulters.  That's absolutely ridiculous.  It's just a preference and if he doesn't want to wear a condom, that's his choice.

And even in the few cases,mostly serial killers,where this is a significant criteria some only target men. I believe that it is an ideological construct in order to phrase female murder victims as more important than male murder victims. Cause when we look at raw numbers most murder vicims are men. It is a regresive idea that puts women as inherently weak victims and how their whole identity is their sex. And that is all that matteres in their last moments. Disgusting stuff but hey maybe I am wrong. I would love some decent arguments. Ideally not dependant on an ideological framework which I clearly don't suscribe to just secular arguments."

The ego, or higher consciousness does not require testing to believe something. You can choose to believe anything at will at any time.  When we do this flagrantly and for fun, we call this pretending.

The subconscious requires a belief to be tested, or it speaks against that belief through emotion. It tells you you're wrong with doubt and stress, it demands release via the pursuit of experiences that contrast with the belief, usually physical. A belief of restraint will cause the subconscious to rebel with an action or emotion that expresses freedom, an incongruent, conscious belief that invokes a sense of freedom, will cause the subconscious to rebel via the manifestation of actions or sensations that bring restraint and control.

If you don't challenge your belief systems earnestly and honestly, your subconscious notices, and an underlying stress and doubt develops that usually only manifests in ways that you can't predict. Without testing and challenging your beliefs, you fail to know yourself, and thus you are continually surprised by your own thoughts and actions.

And the 'earnest' part is important. You need to do so in a way that is the most honest. You should seek out communities that oppose your beliefs, approach them patiently and transparently (if they'll allow that), with no intention of changing minds or getting into debates (these may come naturally, and you should join if they do, but don't go in with the goal of proving people wrong).  It should be 'enemy territory' so to speak, where your are very much alone.

People who believe in oppositional beliefs to your own have spent a lot of time looking for flaws in your beliefs, and will offer profound insights either directly or indirectly. Use that effort freely.

Once you have run yourself through the gamut, you will have either convinced your subconscious to align with your concious, or you will have new belief system more aligned with your subconscious.

tl;dr: The subconscious keeps score, and tallies every little thing you notice throughout the day, when that score doesn't match what you believe, the subconscious rebels.  In order to fix this, you must expose your belief system to an environment that honestly tests it, so that either your subconscious keeps a new score, or your belief system changes. When you are finished, you will feel solid."

1,2024-01-27,CMV: It's morally and logically consistent to not vote for Biden as a progressive,u/SebasW9,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1act5ap/cmv_its_morally_and_logically_consistent_to_not/,changemyview,"Biden and the democratic party as a whole has genuinely lost a lot of their voter bases who want to vote for them. I'd argue at this point it makes sense not to vote for Biden regardless of the possibility of Trump winning 2024. Let me explain why

The current political climate has the democratic party gaining votes not by being a progressive party but rather by positioning themselves as not the evil republican party... which is partially valid. So we should vote blue no matter who right? I don't think so on the basis this leads to complacency within the party. If they win no matter what on the basis that they're better than the worse guy then they never have to do better than not as bad at the worse guy. The democracts have an incentive to win the nominations outside of ""pushing progressive values"". They like using the position to make themselves rich. So the only political tool we have to drive them to be an actually good party that doesn't co-sign a genocide in Palestine is to not vote for them even if we have to grit 4 yrs of a Red party. Come 2028 the democrats will have dealt with the reality of their complacency and have to act more in favor of their constituents to actually win the elections. Thats what Red did, they told their ppl they were gonna bring abortion bans and they did. They said they'd built border walls and they did. Team Red wins elections by actually ""fulfilling"" their promises. Team blue tries to win them by not by fufulloing promises but by trying to stop team reds (which they're actually bad at ding)

TLDR: Voting Democrat no matter what makes them complacent and letting Republicans win just makes them Democrats actually have to try.   "

 What I'm proposing is that logic and facts should be above all. If I hold a belief and I have the proof to back it, I shouldn't be shoved into a group that has nothing to do with me just because that belief belongs to that group. That's because this belief isn't a belief, but a fact we all should accept

&#x200B;

In todays time, you're either white or black: liberal or conservative, and both have specific traits and if you inherent ANY of these traits you're automatically one of either.

 lets identify the current state of the two tribes, and here are some status quo traits that either tribe identity's with, regardless of my opinion on either.

the classic ""liberal"" : supports climate change, thinks women shou is ""logical""("""" because i dont think logic is dependant on the tribe you're in), supports being gay, atheist/spiritual/not really religious, loves vaccines.

the classic ""conservative"" : hyper religious, ""mysoginst"" (or just has ANY opinion on the treatment of women), likes cars, likes freedom, cares a lot about money, ""illogical"", hates vaccines and masks

why  this is dumb:

1.none of these traits from one side have much in common  , nor do they have contradicting traits from the other side.  They just got clumped together from different historical events where the tribe strongly supported either opinion, despite it not being fitting today. 

&#x200B;

2.this splits people into 2 heterogenous tribes for no reason, and diminishes logic                           


 for **EXAMPLE**: one can be gay, not religious, and not support abortions. Why? he logically concludes that having consensual sex were one is aware of high possibility of conceving is already agreeing to a baby, and the person must be accountable for there actions, rather than aborting as an escape.  


of course, this doesn't exist because it contradicts his liberal identity. his friends and family put the tribe above logic, and despite applying logic, thus man betrays his tribe by holding this logical opinion and therefore he doesn't.  

another **example**: supporting climate change as a conservative despite being 1000% factual is considered liberal.

My 1st reason for believing so is that both of them are unethical in nature; one by catfishing, and the other by cheating. Catfishing is wrong, and is a form of emotional abuse. Surinder should not have catfished his voice by joining her dance class by disguise. Even then, 'Rahul' should not have been harrassing Tina by continously flirting with her, and giving her compliments. However, Taani is also in the wrong. She should have told 'Rahul' that she was married to Surinder, instead of slowly falling in love with him, which counts as cheating, albeit not physically. The whole point of an arranged marriage is so you can slowly fall in love with your spouse.

My 2nd reason for believing so is that Taani is not even truly in love with Surinder! Tina only fell in love with 'Rahul', which was a disguise made by Surinder. He had to completely chamge his personality for her! Therefore, Tina has not fallen in love with Surinder, but Rahul, a made up concept! That is not supposed to happen, and she is supposed to love him for the way he is! She even vowed to change herself for Surinder when he was supposed to love her for the way she was! He did, but she never truly realised that. This is because he does not know how to be romantic! He has such a bland personality that he is unable to be romantic!

My 3rd and final reason for believing so is that Surinder was just a backup plan for Taani to marry. He only married her because her former spouse died in a bus accident last-minute. He also had to fullfill her father's last wishes, which means that he did not marry willingly. Moreso, the only reason Taani's father asked him to marry her was because she was naive, and she would not be able to survive in this world by herself, which is a form of sexism and should not have been in a movie that was released as late as 2008; 1 year after Taare Zameen Par and 1 year before 3 Idiots; both progressive movies that are highly praised for their progressive nature and relatability. This means that Surinder does not wish to fall in love, but protect Taani insted."

The format changes, but not the essence. The disappointment for me is that I thought that with technology, modern laws, etc. this trend embedded into human nature could be corrected to prevent abuse, but it doesn't seem likely. Please change my mind.

This transcends countries and political ideologies. Our human nature has always created certain (groups of) individuals who have, are, and will continue to use whatever rules are in place to live off the backs of others. I don't mean to say that they enjoy making others struggle either, it's just that it's necessary for them to obtain and keep a lavish lifestyle.

If there was a magical way for them to make the same large sums of money without taking cuts from others (be it rent, credit interest, part of the crop yield, diverted public funds, etc.), then I think most of them would choose it. But then if everyone were wealthy (using this magic wand where no one has to be... undermined), the problem becomes this: there is only one house at the top of the hill with a view to the lake, only so much room on the world-famous Santorini island in Greece, etc."

I (37M) am have been married to my wife (29F) for 9 years now, we have 3 kids and have a peaceful household, when she was 20  our families arranged a meeting and we got along enough to accept ( this is quite common in our culture, we don’t believe in fleeting things such as love but are far more realistic, and also note this marriage wasn’t forced upon anybody as she also had to agree and no her parents didn’t force her to do anything because that doesn’t happen anymore and I asked her in a safe setting) she always had a beautiful face and that is what she used to marry far above her social standing ( I come from generational wealth whereas she is from a low income family ) anyhow once we got married she was taken aback by how my  lifestyle was  and she seemed happy until recently where she discovered that I have some mistresses. when she found out she seemed fine( she saw a message of me arranging a meet)  so I felt like she understood that this was the cost of marrying rich ( she obviously knew that this was going to a loveless marriage) (also note I only meet with the mistresses when my wife doesn’t want to have sex or can’t because of pregnancy and postpartum time periods anyhow ) anyhow last night I saw crying when I was about to walk into the bedroom and was genuinely confused, when I walked in she quickly wiped my tears and the first words that came out of my were “I’m sure you know this was how things were going to be I don’t know what else you were expecting?” She looked even more depressed after that so I just got changed and tried fell asleep which leads to the next morning where she was still ignoring me, I just told her if she doesn’t like how things are she is free to file for a divorce but she just looked sad while  there( I had her sign a iron tight prenup in the presence of numerous lawyers so it can’t be broken but, in the event of a divorce she will receive in our currency what translates to 300K usd, but since her plan was to always marry rich she has never worked and therefore can never get a job and she can’t remarry because in our culture for woman to get married she must be a virgin ) and a 1 time payment of 300k will never fund the lifestyle she has grown to enjoy while being my wife."

Why do they have to care if it affects those around them? Like the whole point of life is literally to seek happiness, if a suicidal and depressed person can’t find that then what is the point? 

If others around you can’t accept that you did not feel fulfilled with your life and wanted to end it as a result, then are those people really people who care about you? It’s more selfish on their part actually to guilt-trip you into staying because it’s just going to be the sufferer, at the end of the day, enduring forthcoming amounts of pain in order to fulfill the needs of others. 

I’m just gonna say that when people say ‘rest in peace’ and still can’t cope without the person it really does disrupt the idea of ‘peace’ that you desire for them because it feels like you want them to be there by your side every time in order to fulfill your selfish needs. Instead of learning to cope and find fulfilment in other people in the world you latch onto the dead that desperately wanted to leave the world and avoid the pain it gave them.

By personal experiences, I was told by my safeguarding teacher in secondary school that I was attention seeking because I kept telling her that I feel suicidal due to numerous problems with my life. She told me that I was being selfish and that I should just grow up. Since that day I still remember those words and feel nothing but anger, sometimes I felt like I should’ve punched her that day. Remembering that day is what made me to make this post. I don’t think my mind will be changed but I’d like to know what you all think."

 “these comments are WILD you guys have ever only heard her on the radio and it shows. she's incredible poet. best of this gen”. 

A freaking POET. I have never liked her music and have never understood it. What was this person seeing that I was not? By no means, would I ever consider her a poet, and even more so, the “best of this generation”. Was I missing something? Or are Swifties just that deluded.

I decided to try and understand why she is so universally loved, so I investigated. I found some examples of what Swifties consider some of the best poetic writing of this generation. Here is one;

From Ivy (2020)

“How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand”

This to me seems like something a teenage girl would write in her journal after a bad hair day. To compare this to poetry is to compare KFC to fine dining. This is essentially angsty slam poetry aimed at repressed teen girls. 

“I’d meet you where the spirit meets the bones, in a forgotten land.” 

What does that even MEAN? The spirit meets the bones? In a forgotten land? This is nonsensical lyrical soup made to sound pretty and ominous. 

The fact that people can listen to this and think that this is revolutionary songwriting is astonishing to me. To me, Taylor Swift is the the graham cracker of the music industry. She is the logical end to production and industrialization of the music industry.

If anyone can provide me any semblance of evidence for this poetic goddess that I cannot seem to find, please enlighten me. This could be through more lyrics with some analysis of them or maybe a different perspective on her that I am not seeing."

This is achieved by maximising muscle size, symmetry, and reaching as low a body fat as is sustainable for the period of assessment (a competition). 

However, in terms of utility, bodybuilding pales in comparison to other disciplines of resistance training such as powerlifting and calisthenics. 

Powerlifting and calisthenics both offer functional benefits that rival those of bodybuilding (Better bone, joint and connective tissue health, contributing to healthy testosterone levels, better quality sleep, metabolic benefits) however they also offer greater levels of absolute strength, (in powerlifting) and relative strength (calisthenics) and are more functional. Not to mention that calisthenics and powerlifting can both offer a pleasing, well balanced physique. 

Now, if someone wants to COMPETE in bodybuilding, that is another matter. I speak of the average weightlifting population.

Porn provides a pleasant sensory experience that gives a quick temporary boost in dopamine, while providing no other benefit to the body or mind. It is addictive and it warps your thinking over time with regular consumption. Crack is the same.

People who sell pornography are essentially taking advantage of their client's weaknesses or bad life situations, the same way a crack dealer would. The porn consumer then becomes dependent on the porn producer in order to get their fix, the same way a crack user becomes dependent on a dealer.

The porn producer may even convince themselves that they are providing a real service and helping people to feel better, or they may say something like ""I'm just fulfilling a demand. These people would get their fix regardless, so I'm not doing any harm by giving it to them."" Drug dealers justify their actions with similar excuses.

You could say that sometimes people are in desperate situations and they need the money from selling porn in order to pay their bills. The same situations often push people to sell drugs. It's unfortunate, but the solution isn't to normalize the sale of drugs, it's to get people out of desperate situations so they don't feel the urge to sell them."

I mean me. So before anyone goes ""gee I wonder what sort of person YOU are OP"", let's just nip that in the bud. 

Second, this is specifically aimed towards people who actually believe in capitalism, free markets n' such, people who believe that an unproductive welfare underclass is morally repugnant– **Why do you not want people like me dead, if you don't? What difference does it make, to you?**

I am an inherently lazy person. I don not want to work for pay. Given the choice between devoting my life between being a more productive member of society and a gun to my head, I would choose the gun if not for stupid animal instinct. As a result I am effectively one of society's leeches, and the only argument I've seen people make towards my worth is ""consumers are a good thing"", and I'll get to why that doesn't actually make sense, either.  

Let's get more specific. I am a school bus driver, a job traditionally reserved for bored retirees. I am 27 (stealing a job from them rather than doing something an able-bodied 27 year-old ought to do), and I am autistic. I live with my parents. As far as I can tell, I couldn't possibly support myself alone at my current income level, I'd need some sort of roommate, and my parents seem to agree with that assessment. The trouble with roommates is that one, they need to tolerate you, and two, they leave, because most people would rather live with a romantic partner than a ""roommate"" and manage to do so. A second job is hardly feasible with a school bus driver's odd schedule and even if it were, I'd burn out and quickly quit within a few months.  

I went to a community college. Burnt out and dropped out. Worked in a few shitty IT internship positions– pity fired from one because they couldn't pay me, actually fired from another for justifiable reasons. Moved on to software development, fired out of my first job when it became clear that despite all the training and despite all the classmates who were doing just fine, I had thr intelligence of a potted plant and couldn't figure out how to do my job (or what my job even was, half of the time).  

So now I drive a bus. I specifically chose driving because it's dead-easy, I finally acknowledged what I'm actually capable of doing. But specifically because it's dead-easy, hiring for it is easy, pay is as low as it is and, again, it's mostly seen as a job for bored retirees. The fact is that people hate the idea that some people are actually just this mediocre, and will forever argue that actually you totally aren't, but they buffet that argument by making sure to ignore people who have proven them wrong for their whole lives. I'm going on a decade. Personally that's been long enough to prove the point.  

To summarize: My parents subsidize the cost of my life, and if they didn't, the government (in theory, not in reality probably) would. This is despite the fact that I refuse to offer anything in return. By all accounts this makes me a burden on society as a whole, and that society would be better off if someone shot me, and the sort of mindset and life I'm describing doesn't seem uncommon any more– and yet everyone seems repelled by that idea. Why is that? The alternative would simply be homelessness, and given that the options there are once again government subsidized housing or architecture specifically designed to repel homeless people, just shooting them would be significantly smarter economically (and probably more humane).  

One of the rare arguments I see free market types make in favor of keeping people like me alive is that consumers are great, even if they don't really contribute anything, because they provide other people with jobs. That is circular reasoning– these people are only consumers because the effort put into someone else's work is being used by them to consume the fruits of that work. That isn't helpful at all."

The exploitation and profiteering of the pornography industry disgusts me while I still feel a need to consume content. 
Stigma related to sex work is a burden to everyone.

Until the stigma is gone, and the porn empires toppled I think it may be ethically better to over the next few years source porn via AI image generation and animation.

I think we should all be working toward a world where people are accepted for having a sex related job or hobby. My worry is the momentum behind that as far as I can tell is stalling, and background search technologies are only getting better.

Let's not kid ourselves here a lot of the image generation capabilities have been built out for two (probably not seperate) groups: not artists who want to make art and people who want their own user tailored porn.

I'm not saying leave current porn actresses hanging, if anything, help educate them on how they can make money off their own likeness or generate their own work. If anything, with the right rig and advancements you could arguably manipulate your age, you could continue performing for your fans well into your 40s.

Don't provide an incentive for new entries, but if youre already here, have some tools for longevity to hold you over until the crotchety people in hiring departments die. What about hobbyists? Well you'd also be able to keep up your hobby forever, but you're the ones not doing it for an economic incentive. Ultimately I wouldn't want anyone forced put of porn nor a porn ban but even if an amateur onlyfans performer used a manipulated version of their voice and rigged themselves up to an artificial version of their own body that would serve as an extra layer of protection.

I'm not set in stone about this if anyone has any better ideas call them out."

Having someone dead in .5 seconds vs 5 seconds means not getting shot at 4, 5, 6 times. 

That is not the goal of a criminal though - criminal use of weapons is about killing people, not self defense. You dont care about .5 seconds, 5 seconds, .5 minutes, or 5 minutes, the goal is simply to have the person dead. And any modern firearm of any kind is pretty much equal there - except full auto means you run out of ammo virtually instantly.

Otherwise, men are not ugly or less attractive than women. We are simply different than women. In fact, our specific features make us special and unique, in contrast with women:

\-Larger bodies

\-Stronger muscles

\-More body hair

\-Deeper voices (more striking pitch)

We're 29M and 27F.

We've been friends because of our parents since we were born. Our parents are best friends.   
We've lost contact after high school and only see each other at social gatherings at our parents' maybe once a year.

I went into business with her father in 2015, but ended that relationship in 2018 because of a disagreement and swore I'd never talk to him again. We've since put it behind us, but I made a wrong call and got involved with him again earlier this year, which ended in legal troubles. He called me names and we're on worse terms than before.

Shortly thereafter we received a ""save the date"" for the wedding one year later.   
It was on Facebook Messenger, so we didn't want to leave them on 'read' and decided to shortly reply that we're looking forward.   
We were surprised, that they even invited us. My girlfriend barely know them, and I haven't had any contact with her for a decade and have never spent any one-on-one time with him.

A few days ago we received a Facebook event invite for a birthday brunch next month. It seems that people invited to the wedding are invited to the brunch as well. 

I do not want to be in the same room as her father and I do not feel like we're friends with the bride and groom to be. 

We don't feel like going to the brunch nor the wedding. The friendship died off many years ago, and only our parents' friendship keep us somewhat connected. Now that I'm on bad terms with her father, I feel that connection is lost.

They say that back in the 50's and 60's good paying union jobs allowed the average joe to buy a house and raise a family on a single income, all without a college degree.  Even if we ignore the fact that these times were less than ideal for women and many minorities, I dont thing the idea holds up to scrutiny  

The first most obvious thing that goes against this narrative is that people make more money today on average, even after adjusting inflation.  According to the census, he median male salary in 1960 was $5,400, which is about $56,500 a year in today's money.  Compared to today, where the median male makes over $60,000 a year.  Note I only talk about men here because I think the situation with women has changed so much that it doesn't really make sense to compare, but women are probably doing far better than they were in the 50s and 60s in terms of what they can make.  

But what about college?  Isnt it unfair that young people are expected to go into debt just to get a job?  Yeah it sucks but college debt is generally a pretty good problem to have, seeing that people who have bachelor degrees make on average 1.2 million dollars more over their lifetime compared with people who dont, and this gap only widens when we add advanced degrees to the mix.  The truth is that even with rising costs of schools, getting a degree is a no brainer.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, today, Men who have bachelor degrees make a median salary of $70,000 a year which far better than what people used to make 

So why does it not feel like we are doing amazing?  Simply put, young people today spend more money.  People drive bigger cars, live in bigger houses, watch bigger T.V.s and so on.  Young people are much less likely these days to cook their own food or to repair clothes that get ripped.  Young people these days also have smartphones, smart watches, streaming services, laptops and videogames, all things that simply did not exist back in the day.  The truth is that you can still raise a family and buy a house on a typical salary these days, you just need to live like how many people in the 50s and 60s did and only own one crappy car, have a 2 bedroom house for a family of five, never eat out, never fly on a plane, and have no college fund for any of your children, but that life is not appealing for obvious reasons.

The point of the UN is to add another point of pressure with the power of international consensus. 

If a convention is accepted by a vast majority of countries, countries that don't will stand out in international diplomacy, potentially harming their prospects in foreign policies. Once a country accepts a convention, if it violates the convention in the future, it gives its critics more ground to stand on. They can accuse the country of going back on their promises, and giving them ground to take more practical actions like sanctions and such.

He proposed that, whenever his descendants were able to end slavery in the U.S. (he felt with certainty that this would eventually happen), they should give the freed slaves a plot of land in yet-unsettled territory, all of the supplies needed to get started, and treat them as a separate independent nation.

At the time when Africans were brought to the South as slaves, the cultures of the English settlers and African slaves were very different. These two groups had experienced thousands of years of divergent cultural evolution, and were far more different from one another present-day White and Black Americans, who have been growing more similar for hundreds of years. But this convergent cultural evolution was the problem. As the two groups naturally began adapting their cultures to become more similar, as all cultures do when in contact, aspects of owning slaves became part of Southern White culture, and aspects of being a slave became a part of Southern Black culture. The point of separating the two groups would be to give the two cultures the chance to shed their former slave-related aspects, and to shed their former hierarchical relationship to one another.

Naturally, this was not what happened - instead the attempt was made to integrate freed slaves into the culture of the lands in which they lived, but with some divisions still remaining in place.

Over this time period, we saw rapid growth in African-American quality-of-life, the founding of many Black Colleges and Universities, and certainly many more subtler cultural adjustments to the new and different challenges of free life.

Since integration, we have seen many of these trends reverse, and living conditions gradually become worse. This logically makes a lot of sense.

In an ideal scenario, what would have happened would have been, that the two cultures evolved separately to the point that they reached a level of mutual understanding and mutual respect, and viewed one another as equals. However, this was not what happened. Integration was fought against heavily by one group, who had not decided to embrace it because they were impressed with the progress made, but because they'd been inconvenienced into submission using nonviolent but still aggressive tactics.

This is why we find ourselves today seeing the cultural relationship between the two begin resembling its original form to a greater extent.

I don't want to say that integration was a mistake. Rather, I want to point out that it was an action which carried with it a tradeoff. The tradeoff of placing these two cultures back into contact not because of the establishment of mutual respect, but because of a nonviolent rebellion, was that many of the original resentments and original power dynamics eventually began to return to the relationship, which was at that time not-yet-fully healed.

From where I'm sitting, it seems like the way to move forward is to grapple honestly with the nature of the situation. Both cultures have some growing up to do, in order to finish transforming what was once a hierarchical relationship into a relationship between equals. This is not a matter of ""deconstructing Whiteness"" and leaving African-American culture entirely unchanged. There is work to be done on both sides - continuing to act as though the former slaveowners have infinite power to change and the former slaves have no power to change will only further reinforce this power dynamic.

I'm sure that I've said something in here that is imprecise or will be offensive to someone. Would anyone be willing to correct where my characterization here fails to line up with the facts of the situation?"

Iran is bluffing. Their military is nothing in comparison to the U.S. We need to call their bluff and teach them a lesson. That’s the only way this conflict stops escalating. 

In retaliation for this act of terrorism, the U.S. should destroy any and all Iranian military ships present in the Persian gulf. There should be cruise missile attacks on shahed drone factories in Iran. There should be a massive cyber offensive against Iran to try to cripple their telecommunications networks. Strikes on Iranian proxies in Iraq, Yemen and Syria should be undertaken and be substantial and sustained. 

If Iran does anything in retaliation to this, we cut off their oil trade and destroy their Air Force. No Iranian tankers should be allowed to transit the gulf of Oman."

Nearly every liberal democracy has a duopoly of political parties (usually a moderate left and moderate right party) that exist in near constant gridlock due to the constant swings of power and the unanimous focus on highly-polarized issues that may or may not have relevance to the average American citizen.

Most people do not have strong ideological lean, one way or another. Most people tend to vote for one party or another for the same reason they vote for a football team (e.g. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9831368/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9831368/)). For instance, protectionism only became part of the Republican Party when Donald Trump argued against NAFTA, and anti-Russia sentiment only became part of the Democratic Party as part of opposition to Donald Trump.

Among those that *do* have a strong ideological lean, few are actually familiar with the role of government, the separation of powers, gerrymandering, and the nature of historical and recent major Supreme Court rulings. 

The issues that have arised this century include a rise in populist leaders, such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Andrej Duda, Marine Le Pen, and others. People must also remember that Adolf Hitler rose to power by using democracy against itself, defeating the system from the inside out. The National Socialist Party did not storm into Berlin with tanks and soldiers talking of killing the Jews. They did so in the ballot booths, by talking about correcting the economic course of the Weimar Republic. 

Additionally, Hamas did not win the government in Gaza with guns. They won it by arguing that Fatah was weak against Israel and that the people of Gaza needed a stronger hand at the negotiation table. Look how both have turned out. Despite the suffering of people in Gaza, Hamas actually has *record* approval ([https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-palestinians-opinion-poll-wartime-views-a0baade915619cd070b5393844bc4514](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-palestinians-opinion-poll-wartime-views-a0baade915619cd070b5393844bc4514)). So are the people *really* voting in their best interest here?

I'm very skeptical of ontological arguments for universal democracy, such as that having less voting rights makes you less human. I think, for instance, that felons are full humans that deserve every ounce of respect, despite the fact that they have been disenfranchised. 

Now how do we combat this? By forcing people to do their homework. What I'm proposing is a simple competency test, something with very easy questions like ""What Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms?"" or ""Who is the current governor of your state""? These questions could be determined by a randomly-selected group of citizens. It should be nothing like the literacy tests meant to discriminate against people of color, and the random citizens who determine the questions should be determined by a nonpartisan (not bipartisan) group. 

This test could be part of a system of weighting votes. For instance, if it's a 30-question multiple-choice test with four possible answers for each question, the lowest score we should expect is roughly 25%. Each question would have a weight of 1, so the lowest weight we could expect is 7 or 8. The people who do the best on the test would have the highest weight. If you want to have higher weight as a voter, do your homework, find practice tests, and do your homework so you can look like you've done your homework.

Any form of government is going to have unintended consequences, because we exist in a survival of the fittest game of life. The major parties will try to find ways to exploit this system of government for their own benefit. That's a given. Winston Churchill once said ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms which have been tried from time to time."" Why not try a new one to make a less terrible form of government?"

1,2024-01-28,cmv: grades don't make sense (American education system),u/BoysenberryOk9654,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1adi2pu/cmv_grades_dont_make_sense_american_education/,changemyview,"why is the education system based on grades?

It's not like, a new thing to think that our education system is flawed. There's a hundred reasons why it's  not as good as they could or should be, but the one I want to focus on is grades.

I always remember hearing from teachers and professors that like, ""the goal isn't the grade, it's the learning."" If that's the case, why would you still rely on grades? Why are grades and learning not equivalent? 

Like, how did we get to the point where the intelligence and capability of someone in a subject is based on how many 4 option questions they can answer in a row, or how well they can synthesize a passage into an essay when given a 1 hour time limit? Why do things like attendance, participation, and homework matter in any way towards a grade that is meant to represent your understanding of a subject? Why do your grades from the start of a semester matter, if you should be at your peak knowledge by the end of one? The goal of an education is to teach. You want to take someone who doesn't have knowledge and give it to them. 

It just feels really strange that we build things around grades. It makes classes feel like series of challenges that you are meant to conquer in order to earn certificates, rather than places that are meant to improve you. They have points and are formatted like competitions, some teachers setting curves that say only a certain number of people can get A's. Shouldn't the point be everyone getting an A? It makes no sense.

To me, the worst part is that the solution is extremely simple.

Instead of having your class completion being based on your grade, it should be based on your ability to do the thing that the class is meant to teach. Language class? Write an essay that proves you have appropriate mastery. Math class? Take a test that requires those math skills. Science class? Do some lab work or write a paper that represents the requisite knowledge. I can't think of a single class where a practical exam of a certain standard wouldn't be better than the class itself. 

Instead of having courses be races to the finish line, ""we have to get through this unit, otherwise we won't know enough by the final!"" you could just organize them by topic. This class teaches you about this type of grammar in this language, this class teaches you a specific formula, this class teaches you how to write a formal paper. You can split them into multiple days for complex topics, but without placing time limits. Just hold the classes and people who need them will attend. Have schools actively build schedules to work with students. That would make things way easier on students as well. You won't be bored if you can handle taking a ton of classes concurrently, and you won't get overwhelmed if you can't handle the expected amount.

This isn't a perfect system, it's not even a good one. It's one I thought up in like 5 minutes. But I think the practical ideas of uncoupling classes and exams and making exams based on practical ability rather than testing ability are both improvements that could be made to the current education system.

That doesn't reply to all levels of education. In elementary school and middle school, I understand a grading system. You have to walk students through a course, and homework is important because you're teaching them those skills of being a student. How to study, use resources, and take notes. That stuff should be graded because part of those years is teaching kids how to learn. Also, a system like this would be too complicated to be practical for most kids.

However, I think in higher education like high school and college, this would just work better. The current system doesn't make sense. I had friends in high school who graduated without knowing long division and I had friends who wasted years of their lives in high school because they had already gotten everything they needed out of it by junior year.

It's not like this couldn't work practically, as well. A lot of the reasons why we couldn't have a system like this 40 years ago was because we didn't have the internet. But now we do. If you need a lecture on a certain subject that isn't being taught for you for months, go watch an online lecture that's happening *today* in a classroom a hundred miles away*.* A lot of studing techniques focus on memorization because you need memorization so you can do multiple choice quizzes. Why should you need to memorize material when you have all the knowledge in the world a quick internet search away? What matters is how you use that knowledge, that you know how to find good sources, stuff like that.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that the education system doesn't make any practical sense. Grades are meaningless. It's no wonder that people don't want to hire fresh graduates. They just spent 16 years learning how to be a student, not how to work. It's also less efficient, causing people who learn faster or slower to have a worse education experience for no reason. Its goals also don't make much sense, as with the internet the types of information we need to have memorized have shifted. We don't need to have every fact memorized, we need skills, intuition, and knowledge of resources.

Is there a reason why the education system is like this, or is it just too hard to change it into something better?"

Nationalism is simply loving your nation more , the same way  you love your mom more than the one of your's friend. I find this stuff to be pretty obvious.           
What someone's suppose to be patriotic of, if you take a nation out of the conversation?   
Am i suppose to be patriotic of my land? The economy?  Landmarks? Culture? Those reasons are either superficial, or they come back to the people. For example, If you would take Japanese and French people and switch their lands you would find that they went their own respective cultural ways regardless. Japanese wouldn't have built Eifel tower and French wouldn't have built The Fushimi Shrine , because it's not the land that makes culture,  it's the people, the nation, the very dna of them.  
Imagine being a French patriot. The country so diverse people forget that their main demography used to be europeans at some point. Now imagine China declares war on France. As a patriot i would find my duty in enlisting, but as someone with half a brain i would ask myself.  
""What difference does the race of my occupants make ?"" It's not my country anyway. Am I really expected to die for for the sake of arabs and somalians that are coming here in millions?  
A stamp in the passport may give someone a citizenship, but it sure as hell won't create a country united with love and loyalty to it, otherwise - Patriotism.  
Imagine being a child to a parent  that gives away all their support and care to every single child they lay their eye on, leaving you with 1/10000 of that said support, or leaving you with nothing at all. And if you rightfully try to claim an exclusivity of their parenting, they would tell you how immoral and disgusting and old fashioned you are for even asking it.  Well if that's the case you cannot expect me to be your son when the time comes.

1,2024-01-28,CMV: I think in shades of gray and I don’t really like how others think in black and white.,u/Icantevenrizz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1adiyxf/cmv_i_think_in_shades_of_gray_and_i_dont_really/,changemyview,"Do you think in shades of gray or black and white? 

And really think about this topic here. Don’t just say one thing because it’s something you think. A lot of people say they think in gray yet they really don’t. Be honest. 

There will be some extreme topics here. 

I, (M 18) did a paper on capital punishment (death penalty) last semester. I will say, I have read many books and many research papers regarding the issue of the matter so I will humbly consider myself well educated on the matter. The essay asked us to defend or go against a controversial issue, so I chose capital punishment. We then had to create a presentation on the matter. A girl who went two presentations before me also did capital punishment. However, she was all for it. She put pictures of men who were executed years ago for some serious crimes. She then was talking about how these men were “pure evil” and deserved to suffer. Her argument was understandable and valid, however I feel like she missed come key points on some aspects. Then it got me thinking about the big picture of all of society and how people really only do see things in black and white, or good and evil. 

For my presentation, as someone who had always grown up seeing things in shades of gray, I talked about how the problem is not inherently capital punishment or the criminals that take part in such serious crimes, but what paves the road to make them do it? Why are we so surprised to find out that murderers and those on death row are poor and/or grew up in abusive households? The problem is that the death penalty is a lazy “solution” to what the real problem is: we have no way to fully prevent people from growing up to become such hateful and harmful people. By labeling people as “evil” and “undeserving,” we lose sight at the big picture and lose focus on the future. 

Story time is over, not saying that anyone’s opinion is less valid, but think: why are we stressing ourselves out over problems that can be prevented through thinking in shades of gray?

Think about it. Wonder why I’ve always hated politics? Because we HAVE to choose left or right, democrat or republican, etc. I’m always around the middle and I can never get myself into thinking extreme about one thing. Haven’t even registered to vote. WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF ALWAYS HAVING TO CHOOSE IN THE EXTREME???

I used to work at a diner. My co workers LOVED to make fun of the regulars who would eat there, especially because they were old and cranky. From their black and white perspective, they only saw grumpy old people whose sole purpose was to make our days miserable. However, I never knew why, but I just saw an elderly person who struggled through life and is now just tired. I never made fun of them. I naturally sympathize and understand. My friends and family always call me sensitive and complex, and others have told me that it’s my ability to see in shades of gray and never see things at face value. 

Things are more complex than how they seem. Never think one opinion is less or more valid, try to understand that person’s argument and maybe WHY they think that. It can real help you become more complex and accepting. 

I don’t really think one view point is better than another, but can someone explain why seeing in black and white may be a better approach? I’m really curious."

Why do Americans think that people in Argentina are racist? As a non-white Argentinian who lives in Buenos Aires, this actually bothers me since lately many Americans are seen associating Argentina with the Nazis and then with racism towards people of African descent because 2+2=4, right?
from postcasts of German communities in Argentina (which also exist in Brazil) to a documentary of Afro-descendant people in Argentina (spoiler, they almost do not exist because there were no black slaves in these lands) to African Americans who say they will not go to Buenos Aires because the Argentine past and I say to myself, what past is he talking about?
The unpleasant thing is that you magnified the Nazi theme and related it to the current racism seen in the United States. how in the Second World War they magnified the issue of the women of France and the American soldiers filled their streets with sex and prostitutes. It is incredible the gossip machinery that you create and believe yourselves. No, I don't think that in Buenos Aires anyone will be mean to you for being black, because just as in other parts of the world racism is frowned upon, and if someone were to be racist towards another person in Buenos Aires it is not because their Nazi grandfather did it. indoctrinated in white supremacy but because he is an idiot. What's more, if American racism is like Hollywood racism, it is very accurate to say that the racism that can occur in Argentina is not even a tenth of that of America, where they divide people by race and cultures do not mix (you are obsessed with that not the other countries).
no, just because they ask for your ID to use your credit card doesn't mean they judge you (the ID is shown for possible common scams in the third world) someone thought they were racist for asking for it and why did he use the wrong words when asking for a coffee and not being given coffee he felt offended.
That man's post made me think that some people of African descent would accuse a white person of being racist if he doesn't show them a big smile all the time and if they don't give him everything he asks for, why? I guess because of slavery and subsequent segregation, well, that didn't happen in this country, why should someone show a smile to a foreigner all the time here? Or rather, why does a foreigner feel entitled to see American racism in a country foreign to his society, such as Argentina?
In general, it bothers me that Argentina revolves around these issues in society because it is bad publicity. Possible tourists miss out on coming to one of the best cities in Latin America just because in their country they were told that they are racist Nazis."

Hence, what we need is a deception monitoring system so powerful that it can see through _all_ human-to-human -- and maybe even machine-to-human and machine-to-machine -- manipulation.&nbsp; The system would then explain in irrefutable terms, with evidence when needed, what and where political deception is occurring.&nbsp; No doubt, there would be naysayers.&nbsp; But the AI could, as its secondary objective, debunk any public naysayers in similar fashion.&nbsp; At every level, it could shine light upon the pitch darkness that is real-world politics.

In an ideal world, we might expect the government to build and deploy such a system on principle alone.&nbsp; But naturally such prudence may be a pipe dream for many nations here in this place.&nbsp; Still, there may be hope, perhaps of an honest governing body somewhere, or perhaps of a non-government organisation, to bring about such an AI-based informant.&nbsp; In a world where lies are louder than truth, the voice of reason could use a volume boost.&nbsp; And superintelligence may be a realistic option toward that end.

An additional goal, if possible, could be to make unlawful the deployment of AI toward automated deception.&nbsp; A deception monitoring system, perhaps like that described above, could serve to identify and prove guilty those systems which have been deceptive or meaningfully misleading.&nbsp; This active defence would help to mitigate the likely inevitable rise of automated corruption campaigns backed by existing regimes and other bad faith players."

Very often B&W thinking is underlined by some painful personal experience with one person or more, which is then generalised to the entire gender. Sometimes it's super overt, like [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0g2drvCUYj/) (men think of their families, women only about themselves) or [here](https://medium.com/@donna.gratehouse/society-does-include-men-but-whenever-society-is-being-called-upon-to-address-mens-problems-it-s-6ea30fe2f4ac) (women want to help men but all they ever get in return is violence). Other times it's by implication, like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiDpvn77eqE&lc=UgyZ5Bm0GnM23wIQ5wR4AaABAg) (highlighted comment implying that all women want marriage and will make it a disaster for men) or [here](https://medium.com/@lelper/10-things-for-guys-not-to-do-on-dating-apps-5680ce34ffd9) (men are shit at dating, listing 10 sins which are hardly things only men do). I'm literally just picking a couple examples I've got fresh in my mind, but there are millions around. 

It's usually examples of the [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error). 

* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the good ones and everything **we** do is good or, if it's bad, it's because **They** provoked us or deserved it anyway. Meanwhile, when **They** do something bad, it's proof of their wicked evil nature.
* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the innocent victims and underdogs and **They** are the perpetrators in power.

Those basic narratives are so powerful and play so hard to the tribal thinking we evolved with, that it's incredibly hard to break out of them. The simplicity of this heuristic just makes it win with the complex truth that the world is not B&W but all shades and colours, that everybody is different and you can't just treat groups as monoliths. They might have power in this domain but we have power in another, many people in the group might have power but not necessarily this person, some of us are also pretty shitty sometimes while some of them are actually great, and so on.

Of course, there are many who know this. When you explicitly ask people about it, many will say this. But in practice, most still act and overwhelmingly think in terms of black-and-white. And it's a constant in human history - it's as much of a problem now as it was in Ancient Greece, we have evolved nothing.

What does this mean? It means that it is just such a bloody pain to get through to people! To help them stop spending so much energy on fighting each other and instead use it on making the world better for everyone. We keep fighting culture wars with imagined enemies and make everyone's lives miserable, while all it would take is to just stop and admit that there is in fact no us and them. That we're just all people who make mistakes and can get better.

But so I go, trying to promote this view, yet every time I feel like I succeeded on some small scale, I just see more and more of that everywhere else. It seems so inescapable. Can you please change my view and show me that it's not?"
119,2024-01-29,"CMV: Suicide prevention policies have more in common with blasphemy laws, more than they do with public health policy. They are motivated more strongly by the fear that life might be bad, than the conviction that life is good.",u/existentialgoof,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1adss07/cmv_suicide_prevention_policies_have_more_in/,changemyview,"Let's imagine that you are throwing a big party for your family and friends. You've put in a lot of work, and you're confident that everyone in attendance is going to have a great time. The very last thing that you'd think to do would be to hire a firm of big, burly bouncers to guard the doors of your house to keep people *in* and make sure that nobody can leave before you had decided that the party had ended. If the party was any good, you would expect the guests to choose to stay of their own volition, without any threats of coercion, and without their exit being blocked. 

Imagine that you had attended such a party, you decided after about an hour that you weren't having a good time and decided that you wanted to leave; and you found that your path was blocked by a large, beefy security guard. When you explained that you would like to leave, he told you that the party was objectively wonderful and that your decision to leave was evidence that you were of unsound judgement. Therefore, by continuing to detain you at the party, he was actually protecting your own best interests against your faulty judgement. Would you humbly accept that you were, in fact, wrong in your assessment of the party and that your decision to leave is symptomatic of a profound impairment in your capacity to make decisions that reflect your rational best interests? Or would you be more likely to conclude that the fact that strongarm tactics had to be employed to stop you from leaving was, in fact, evidence of deep insecurity on the part of the host?

Blasphemy laws in Islamic countries work on a similar principle to this. These laws don't exist because a Muslim's faith in his religion is so strong that there is nothing that could ever possibly be said to cause his belief to waver in the slightest. They exist for the opposite reason - because faith in Islam, or any other empirically unproven belief system is dependent on mutual confirmation from the people around oneself. If everyone around you, and all the people that you admire and respect, share the same belief system and the same strong faith, then you will most likely retain your own strong faith as well. However, if all around you, people that you generally hold in high esteem for their intelligence and level-headedness start to express deep-seated doubts about what they (and you) have been taught to believe, then there is a strong chance that, over time, your own faith will start to weaken. 

If you depend on your faith to provide you with your sense of meaning and purpose in life; then this process of finding your faith start to falter can be extremely distressing, and this is why you might be driven to develop defence mechanisms to try and prevent you from being exposed to any evidence or alternative viewpoint which contradicts your own worldview.

I believe that the same process is in play when we talk about suicide. It can't have gone unnoticed by many that we are currently in the grips of a moral panic concerning the subject of suicide, which is being portrayed as an ongoing public health emergency. From the amount of suicide prevention campaigns that we get in the UK, and from the urgency that governments are being called upon to act to reduce suicide rates in the UK, you would fully expect that people were positively queuing up all day, every day, to jump from Tower Bridge into the Thames. When in fact, we have not seen a recent upsurge in the suicide rates in the UK, and suicide rates in the UK remain low by European and worldwide standards. 

All suicide prevention schemes, without exception, draw upon the same tired old stereotypes and tropes about suicidal people being emotionally unstable and are in urgent need of treatment for a presumed mental health issue. They have constructed a rhetorical fortress whereby any person asking for the right to be suicide can be summarily discredited as ""mentally ill"" (i.e. they are unreliable witnesses to their own thoughts, and cannot be taken seriously) and in urgent need of mental healthcare. Conveniently for proponents of suicide prevention, these presumptions of mental illness are completely unfalsifiable, and in merely making the insinuation that someone is mentally ill, you open up a credibility gap between the suicidal person who is deemed unsound of mind, and the rest of society who has a paternalistic duty of care to make sure that the suicidal person does not have the opportunity to make plans to act based on their allegedly compromised mental state.

As a general principle, I think that if you feel confident that your opinion is well informed, then you don't mind allowing people on the opposite side of the debate to put across their ideas, and to have an open exchange of ideas. I don't think that you would need to try and portray your interlocutor as being mentally deranged, or assert that they've been possessed by the devil in order to shut down their viewpoint before they've even had the chance to express it. You'd let them speak, and then you would calmly go through their argument, point by point, and show them the errors in their reasoning. For example, it doesn't seem that atheists are quite as defensive about their ideas as devoutly religious folk; as firstly, atheists are simply advancing the null hypothesis with relation to God's existence, and usually don't seem to be as strongly emotionally invested in their perspective as theists are. But as we see from blasphemy laws, devout theists are often very defensive about their beliefs, even to the point where they are prepared to use extreme violence to shut down any opposing perspective 

Although suicide prevention advocates aren't typically resorting to stoning people to death for expressing heterodox views about bodily sovereignty (which would, of course, defeat the purpose of suicide prevention); people on that side of the debate do seem to get very ""triggered"" by any suggestion that there is more moral complexity to the issue of suicide prevention than they are willing to allow. After years of debating the issue of the right to suicide on Reddit and Twitter/X; one trend that I've noticed is that many of the people who are most passionately opposed to the right to die are people who themselves report having had suicidal thoughts in the past, or even being suicidal in the present. This puts me in mind of anecdotes about homophobic Christian preachers who later go on to be exposed to be soliciting the services of male prostitutes. It seems, from the outsider's perspective, that denouncing homosexuality as sinful and perverse is how they go about resolving their own private internal conflicts. One wonders whether the same might be true about many of the people who are among the most vociferous opponents of the right to suicide.

It is my personal psychoanalytical theory that the aggressiveness of the suicide prevention lobby often stems from the same form of dissonance between the person's innate biological drive to resist death at all costs, and their nagging suspicions (suspicions that they wish to suppress) that people advocating for the right to die might actually be on to something about the ultimate futility of humanity's plight. As this is merely my armchair psychoanaylsis and I am unable to see into the minds of the people who are passionate supporters of suicide prevention, I am open minded to any evidence that might change my view on this."

With the advent of universal rights, such as freedom of expression, the creation of porn and porn parodies has only grown. In the digital era, we have rapidly transitioned from simple photos  involving the transposing of the face of a celebrity onto the naked body of an similarly-built actress into increasingly advanced AI tools that can render entire scenes, not just single frames.

Attempts to infringe upon freedom of expression and stuff the technological genie back into the bottle will fail. Swift's lawsuit is just the latest censorial moral panic. Making pornoraphy from images of Taylor swift is constitutionally protected speech. Even if AI generated porn were somehow found to be illegal, the precedent that would set would endanger freedom of the press and the ability to produce parodies or other kinds of art without government prosecution.

If you believe involuntary AI porn should be illegal, you do not believe in freedom of expression."

Please do not interpret what I'm saying is that feminism is bad and the economic equality women have is bad. I'm not justifying what incels say and think about women. I just think it should be understood why incels become incels. So I think the biggest problem isn't entitlement. I know most people will disagree with me off the bat, but I say this because I don't think that incels feel any more entitled to women than the typical male who's been raised in a patriarchal society. The difference is whether or not that entitlement is validated. 

What is driving men into becoming incels and red pill Andrew Tate bros is the fact that in the last 40 years alone what it meant to be an attractive man has changed. Like looking at the US, up until the 90s dating culture was pretty similar as it was in the 80s to the 10s. A man who has a good job and good money is able to pull in a woman. So, whether or not this was right, this was the standard of attractiveness as a man. Your ability to provide for a woman and a family. If you could not do this, you were unattractive and if you were unattractive and you couldn't solve it you had a life a bachelordom. 

Now things are different. Women are in charge of determining the standards of attractiveness for men since now we're dating on a much more equal playing field. Now not only are the things that make you unattractive as a man immutable, but men of my generation were the first men that were raised with these antiquated standards of dating, but in practice date with the new standards. Like I am comfortable admitting I struggle a lot with dating and the advice I frequently receive from older men is like ""if you can't be handsome be handy, women don't care what you look like, they care about what you can do for them"" which is pretty shit advice.

So when you have a generation of men raised on such shit advice, when they go out into the dating world and discover that's not the case, they're going to struggle and look for solutions. Red Pillers offer a grift. ""You can be successful if you just buy my course on banging chicks"". Incels offer a more realistic (even though drastically overblown) view about sex and dating. If you are an 18 to 22 year old man who isn't attractive and can't change in any way to fix that, one of those two paths is gonna look enticing. Hell, being online in leftist spaces I've met so many men that have said ""oh I was like two or three youtube playlists from getting radicalized"". It's not uncommon.

I just think that a lot of feminist and women centered spaces give a very easy answer to incels and the red pill that isn't nuanced and allows them to paint them as cartoon villains. People do the same with racism but typically so they don't have to be self critical about it."

> 54 - In the Court's view, the facts and circumstances mentioned above are sufficient to conclude that at least some of the rights claimed by South Africa and for which it is seeking protection are **plausible**. This is the case with respect to the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts identified in Article III, and the right of South Africa to seek Israel's complain with the latter's obligation under the Convention.

The ICJ has ruled that Israel is plausibly in violation of the Geneva Convention, and therefore should take steps to prevent a genocide, to punish those inciting a genocide, to provide more humanitarian aid to Gazans, and to report to the ICJ in a month's time. #

Here is the situation in Gaza


* At least [25,000 killed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-68050172), [16,000 of which women and children](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news-stories/press-release/2024/01/press-release-two-mothers-are-killed-in-gaza-every-hour-as-fighting-exceeds-100-days). Potentially 90% civilians according to [Euro-Med](https://euromedmonitor.org/en/article/6004/Contrary-to-Israeli-claims,-9-out-of-10-of-those-killed-in-Gaza-are-civilians). 

* [More than 85% displaced](https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/12/20/most-gazas-population-remains-displaced-and-harms-way), some doubly displaced

* [More than 50% of all buildings in Gaza](https://redd.it/19ek4h7) likely damaged or destroyed

* [At least 93%](https://www.who.int/news/item/21-12-2023-lethal-combination-of-hunger-and-disease-to-lead-to-more-deaths-in-gaza) are facing crisis level of hunger, with at least [15%](https://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/20240108_israel_is_starving_gaza) facing 'catastrophic conditions'

* It has reported that there are 25 times more diarrhoea among under 5 children than comparable period

* [At least 317 Palestinians killed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/2023-most-violent-year-for-west-bank-settler-attacks-watchdog-says/) in the West Bank, where Hamas is not in control.

These are all reported about a month ago, so the situation must be even graver now. With this in mind, it's absolutely correct for the ICJ to demand Israel make sure the crisis doesn't worsen even further and keep a close eye on the development on the ground."

The word was created by Benito Mussolini and extended to include the Axis powers of World War II.  It is an Italian/ Latin word that means ""group"".  It was used by Mussolini as the title of his newsletter and was intended to communicate that people together are stronger than they are individually. True enough, but beyond that definition, it has no meaning. There is no ideology behind it beyond typical nationalism and authoritarianism. To use the word fascist is to hide those characteristics behind a title with no additional value.  It also invites dismissal by those who would say, "" Of course we don't want to go back to the days of Mussolini, that is ridiculous.""

When confronted with the insanity that is Donald Trump, we struggle to describe the phenomenon. He is, among other things, and authoritarian nationalist who seeks power for his own ends. As we all know, his political ideology is rooted in a pathological narcissism. Nothing exists for Donald Trump outside of his own interests.  If elected, he will be nothing more or less than a dictator who seeks to rule according to his own desires.  Calling him a fascist,  adds nothing to that."

1,2024-01-29,CMV: We should rank things on a 1-12 scale rather than a 1-10 scale.,u/VilliamQK,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ae2u76/cmv_we_should_rank_things_on_a_112_scale_rather/,changemyview,"It makes sense why we use a 1-10 scale to rank things. I believe it is because we have 10 fingers, which subsequently made a base-10 counting system to norm. However, 10 isn't divisible by a lot of things. Only 3 numbers, those being 1, 2 and 5.

I think that we should make the switch from using a 1-10 scale to using a 1-12 scale. I believe this because 12 can be divided by more numbers than 10 can, those being 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. That's double that of 10. That would make it easier to rank things more effectively, as I believe that we first form our answer as a fraction like ""three quarters"" and them reformulate it to match the 1-10 scale. In this case, we would have to choose either 7 or 8. With a 1-12 scale, it would simply be 9. No decimals or having to choose between two values because the scale used isn't optimal.

I think a 1-8 scale would be a contender as well, as it allows us to not have to deal with recurring decimals when converting to percentage, e.g. 7/12=.5833333...

With a 1-8 scale, every number would simply be a multiple of .125.

This, however is a pretty small advantage over the proposed 1-12 scale, however, the price you have to pay is 2 less divisors, as 8 only has 4 divisors, where 12 has 6.

They are both only 2 integers away from the conventional 1-10 scale, but the 1-12 scale has the benefit of just sounding better. An example would be how ""average"" would be 4 on a 1-8 scale, whereas it would be 6 on a 1-12 scale. I feel like 6 just makes more intuitive sense here. It also just kind of *feels* like less of a change than moving 2 integers down, but I don't know if that's just me.

I am very willing to change my opinion on this matter. I would even prefer my view to be changed as that would give me further insight."
1,2024-01-29,CMV: the trump defamation case(s) and how they were adjudicated are problematic,u/PM_me_ur_datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ae3632/cmv_the_trump_defamation_cases_and_how_they_were/,changemyview,"first, want to make clear that i'm a vehement anti-trump conservative. i think he is the anti-statesmen and it's embarrassing that he's a serious candidate despite everything everyone knows about him. 

second, IANAL but as i am a fan of legal matters, i know enough to be dangerous but do not claim to be an expert by any means

now, as many probably already know, trump was recently found guilty in two separate cases of defamation and ordered to pay more than 88mm in judgements against him. he has stated his intention to appeal, though doing so will likely be problematic for any number of reasons. 

i have no issue with carroll's defamation claims against him themselves. as a result of his first trial, trump was found to be civilly liable for sexual assault (ie. rape, as per the presiding judge over both cases). i make no claims about the objective truth of the matter, there's no ""smoking gun"" in this case as is true for the vast majority of sexual assault crimes. my understanding is that in a civil trial the jury makes a finding based on the ""preponderance of the evidence"" rather than the higher bar of ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" as it would be in a criminal prosecution. in other words, if the jury thinks its 51:49 for the complainant, they will find for them. with the evidence presented, the jury found for carroll. fair enough. 

for the second trial, however, the judge told the jury to treat the claim that trump did rape carroll as a fact despite the lack of a criminal conviction. as a legal layperson, it doesn't seem fair that this instruction is given to the jury. i think it would be more fair to say something like a jury found trump liable for this claim of sexual assault and the difference b/w ""preponderance"" and ""beyond a reasonable doubt"". 

second, let's posit for a second that trump is correct in his claim that he never sexually assaulted carroll. it doesn't excuse him from defamation claims, but denials that the assault took place seems like it should be allowed as, from what i understand, the truth (however unlikely or unsavory) is an absolute defense against defamation. the fact that the judge didn't allow them to present this defense for the second trial also seems problematic. 

for these reasons i think the second judgement, in particular, has some problems with how it was decided. can someone change my view?

Due to my complicated upbringing, I was part of both communities.  A common view amongst hateful feminist communities is that men are Sex goblins incapable of making meaningful relationships due to how horny we are. The primary focus of Men other than sex is money and power (and this is why men like superheroes)  This justifies gaslighting, manipulation, and other nasty tactics in order to maintain power in a relationship in their minds

Strangely enough, The Red Pill Community has the same message just not presented the same way. The claimed focus of the movement is to restore toughness, strength, discipline, and ambition to the men of today. However, there are 2 things the movement focuses on more than anything else, Money and Coochie, and upon further inspection, money is just a way of getting coochie. Prominent ""Alpha males"" say that Men are too horny to have one partner and not cheat and that's just ""nature"" Some will even go as far as to say that Rape is a result of men not being able to handle their libido. They can hide behind the fancy science and philosophy babble but the reason why these guys have a beef with women is not for all the purported reasons is due to Coochie not being delivered easily.

Issues relating to these movements are just used to justify their position and are actually meaningless to the people who follow it."

431,2024-01-29,"CMV: No group of people in history would willing allow the enactment of anything like the Zionist project on their own land, and no group of people would, in the Palestinians' place, respond to Zionism with anything but hostility.",u/onstreamingitmooned,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ae4b6a/cmv_no_group_of_people_in_history_would_willing/,changemyview,"For me, the most frustrating thing about the discourse surrounding Palestine-Israel is the way in which the Palestinian people are routinely portrayed as irrationally extreme, violent, or anti-Semitic, when in fact their deep hostility to Zionism (and Israel in general) is the most obvious and predictable thing imaginable. I am convinced that **no group of people in history would willing allow the enactment of anything like the Zionist project on their own land, and no group of people would, in the Palestinians' place, respond to Zionism with anything but hostility.**

Imagine the following scenario in *your* country:

* A group of people are immigrating into your country in massive numbers, and *they have made it explicitly clear they want their own state on your land*. They go from a trivial percent of the population (\~2%) to almost a third of the population in around a generation. A foreign power retains control of your immigration policy and doesn't allow you to stop the influx
* As soon as this group arrives, they begin lobbying foreign powers to grant them their own state on your land. They'd love all of it, but they'll take as much as they can get for now
* They buy up land from absentee owners and kick off native tenants. They enact terms on the land that makes it illegal for it ever to be owned or worked by anyone but them ever again
* Eventually they succeed in making their case to the reigning superpowers: despite representing less than one third of the population and being mostly foreign-born, they are granted over half of your land — including half the coast and virtually all of the best farmland. Additionally huge numbers of your people will now have to live in their ethnostate, while none of them are expected to live on your side.

Given this history, the Palestinians rejected the 48' deal. Can someone seriously tell me that they are surprised? How do you imagine *your* people would respond? Do you really think that your people would have accepted that deal? 

Or, to put it differently, if the Zionists had wanted Connecticut or Cornwall for their state, do you think the US or UK would have considered that proposition for a single second? Do you think they would have handed over a single acre of their territory for a Jewish state? And if not, why should the Palestinians have been expected to?

Here is some additional evidence:

* The 30s and 40s were a massive litmus test of the Western world's decency toward refugees, and virtually everyone failed. There *were* hundreds of thousands of Jews looking for a home then, due to Nazism, and every single country turned them away. As an American, I think it is to our eternal shame that we did not go out of way to take in the whole of European Jewry, but if the US — a far larger and richer country with a much, much larger Jewish population (at the time) — was unwilling to open its doors, why are we surprised that the Palestinians weren't crazy about Jewish immigration, when it clearly meant the death of their society?
* I was once arguing with a Zionist about the right of return. And he said: ""Of course we can't offer them a right of return. It would mean the end of the Jewish nature of Israel."" He was right of course — that would be the result. He was also right to imply that *obviously* Israel is going to implement policies that protect it from being overwhelmed demographically; obviously, Israel is going to behave with the instinct towards self-defense that all functioning societies do. But to him the Palestinians were simply not human enough for him to have to consider the obvious: the entire existence of Israel is predicated on the Palestinians having been denied the right to do this very thing, to protect their society's integrity
* Far smaller rates of immigration create tremendous controversy throughout the developed world. Think about how controversial Muslim immigration into Europe is. Right now Muslims represent around 7.5% of France's population, after 80 years of immigration. In Palestine, in less time, Jews went from 2% to 30% of the population. And it's funny: most of the folks that are pro-Israel are also anti-immigration. They would absolutely lose their minds if they were made to tolerate the rates of immigration the Palestinians had to, especially if their immigrants were making it known they wanted their own country!
* In fact, I cannot think of a single country that currently allows the rates of immigration seen in Palestine in the early 20th century.
* I cannot think of a single people in history that has willingly allowed such a massive demographic change to take place on its land. If you can think of one, please, by all means, share.
* I cannot think of a single people who have willingly traded away any of their land for the sake of others' national aspirations
* I expect to hear the common Zionist talking point that ""There never was a Palestinian state, and Palestinian identity only goes back to the early 20th century."" This is undoubtedly true, but, for the life of me, I cannot understand what the implication of this is supposed to be. Are they saying: ""because the Arabs of the land of Palestine never had a nation state, it's okay to swap out their society for another one""? This logic looks remarkably like that used to colonize the Americas and Africa: they don't have a state, so they don't count politically. If this means something else, please let me know. But I can't make sense of it."

And I think that those who have problems dealing with that fact or direct confrontation be from one's parents, relatives or anyone else, normally seek emotional shelter in animals, which probably only aggravates the problem, or may be where the problem started.

Because animal relationships with humans lack that judgement, people who have many / deep feelings for animals are normally bad at dealing with humans.

Ex: That person who calls their dog ""son"" as if that was her kid, keeps showing photos of him for everyone to see, like it was their baby taking his first steps.

Animals like dogs are used in therapy for people who have trouble in relationships and social skills (like autistic therapy).

Bias:

This is mostly based on my own experience on how people feel about their pets, considering that 9 out of 10 people who have pets that I know said they don't know how important their dog / cat is for them, often comparing what happens to them as if it happened to their parents or someone important to them.

I don't actually like animals, I just can't imagine how someone might be that affectionate towards something that does nothing besides existing, it can't talk, can't help you when in trouble...it's not useful, besides emotional support (but that can be replaced for another person or an object), which makes me look at animals just like tools, because that's the only way we use them, humans are just much better at everything.

If you may ask how I feel about animals when they suffer like in other posts, I don't really feel anything, but that can also be said to how I feel about general people. I only care about what's important to me, if it's not my family, I don't care. Not saying that I wouldn't help or look at it as wrong, I just would feel something much more if it was done to something close to me."

 Let's face it. The police aren't there for you, they exist to clean up after your messes and provide repercussions, not to prevent them. At the end of the day you are responsible to protect yourself/family/community at whatever capacity is necessary, including the possibility of a life or death situation. And if potential criminals are privy to the expansive use lethal weapons, one can assume absolute idiocracy of those who wish to test their firearms on citizens in streets, stores, crowds, and homes.

Yes, it’s a small country, but it’s the same continent!

And bearing in mind, some of these were said by students at top Universities.

In fact, their attitude is quite embarrassing since they do not know about their own continent. Not to mention the rest of the world (a man convincing the other that the Taj Mahal is in Abu Dhabi, which also happens to be the capital of India apparently). In fact, the only thing Brits might know more about is the US, since they seem to align themselves more closely to them.

They might know something little about western Europe, like France bc of proximity or Spain bc of holidays, but that’s about it.

Trump is beloved by many New Right Christians, yet has slept with prostitutes, cheated on his wives and has had multiple wives (all arguably similar level sins to homosexuality). 

Liberal Christians ignore moral issues and embrace liberalism when the bible prohibits such.

Truly, Christians in America are interpreting the Bible based on their own moral belief, ones that they would still hold if they were not Christian.

You can search up any Bible quote that seems out of date or a bit extreme for today's standards, yet Christians base their belief not on their religion, but on what they already believe in.

I understand that having children is a choice and people will want to have children regardless. This is not me limiting what people can do, but I do think this is what they should do. The thing is, having a child is a huge, massive amount of responsibility. I think to raise a whole other human being from infanthood, with so much control over every little aspect of their life and the life that they have is insane. You can't just have to be human to do that, you have to be a superhuman!  
For me, there's no point in creating a whole new person if I'm not going to give them the best life possible. If I'm going to have a child in the far future, I'm not going to be doing it mostly for myself. It's going to be primarily for the child I'm having. It's not: ""I want a child"". It's: ""I want to give my child the absolute best life possible so that the love they'll experience will outweigh the pain they will inevitably experience as a sentient human on planet Earth"".  
So, I would want have at least 1 million dollars before I do that. If not, I'm just causing strife to myself, as I'll have to do so much to care of a child and also to the child, since I won't just be finacially stressed, I also won't be able to give them full emotional care if I'm not appropriately wealthy when it comes to having a child.  
Now, this not me insulting parents who aren't finacially wealthy. I'm sure A LOT of them are extremely and purely loving and good to their child. I'm sure they are extremely, extremely good parents. And I'm sure their child feels a lot of love and happiness with them. I just think that when you want to have a child while not finacially stable, you should deeply think to yourself: ""Am I capable of raising this child with my finacial struggles while giving them to best physical and emotion care that they need and deserve while always loving and not feeling resentment towards this child?"" This also applies to finacially stable parents. This should also ask this question, just that the finacial stress part of it is alleviated already."

Like most people, I used to get hammered and go partying every Friday and Saturday night throughout high school and college (even a lot of wednesday and thursday nights too), plus I experimented with other party drugs during those times. I'm just as guilty of partaking in drinking culture as most people. Luckily I never became an alcoholic, but I don't hold any negative judgments towards people who developed drinking problems or addictions, because I feel like that's a very easy trap to fall into.

Anyway, I've started to really question why drinking culture is such a big thing (I'm mainly talking about the US and Canada since that's where I grew up, but this is a problem in many countries all around the world). A huge part of social life revolves around drinking. Whether it's small get togethers, house parties, bars, or clubs, pretty much all the main social events on Friday and Saturday nights revolve around drinking. Obviously anyone can choose not to drink if they don't want to, but it's kind of hard when drinking is just kind of the social norm, especially when you're young and wanting to participate with your friends and peers.

Obviously it's a good social lubricant and it makes things more exciting on a surface level, but honestly it's kind of silly that so much of social life revolves around just getting together and consuming poison together. I think most people out grow this by late 20s and early 30s, but from ages like 16 - 25 this is pretty much the standard. Hell, even a lot of people in office jobs are obsessed with going to happy hour after work. It's just kind of lame. It's unhealthy and often makes you feel like shit the next day, it makes people do stupid and embarrassing stuff, and honestly it's not even that fun to be drunk. The fun part is socializing, but you can do that without drinking. Also, maybe this is just me, but I'd be happy if I never again had to listen to some mediocre bearded guy ramble on about whatever craft beer he is into, or listen to some frat bro or sorority chick tell me about how wasted they got last night. It's really not very interesting. 

It seems like people have just been drinking alcohol for centuries and centuries to the point that it has become the social norm and people just accept it because it's tradition. It's basically just the standard that going out and getting drunk is the main social activity, but I'm really not convinced that this is actually beneficial to society."

188,2024-01-29,"CMV: Men are expected to change to make themselves better for a potential partner and told to lower their standards, when women are told this by men they are called misogynistic and incels. This is a double standard.",u/GorrilaRuffy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aefd9h/cmv_men_are_expected_to_change_to_make_themselves/,changemyview,"So I think this is a pretty common double standard when it comes to giving out dating advice, especially online, but also in IRL. If a man comes online talking about his dating woes, the immediate assumption is that there is something wrong with him and his failures are his fault 100% of the time. (settle down before you start your comment). It is automatically assumed that there is something wrong with him. He has bad hygiene, he's fat, he's a misogynist, he's expecting a mommy bang maid, etc. Things of varyingly bad qualities he has based on nothing except the fact that he struggles to attract women. He's told that he is the problem and he needs to fix himself. He's told he needs to stop pursuing women he's attracted to and pursue unattractive women. Like even if you go to the most bluepilled dating advice sub you'll find this sentiment.

When a woman comes online, does she get people telling these things, to lower her standards to date men she's not interested in, that she's the problem. The thing is, those people who do that (typically men) are immediately labeled misogynistic incels who resent women and want them to compromise their standards for them. Fault is never placed on the woman seeking advice. She is never told ""you are unattractive"" because all women are beautiful and deserve a prince charming. 

So I think this is a clear double standard. I don't think people are wrong to tell men to work on themselves and whatnot. I think people are wrong to tell women that they're perfect. I also have a more controversial belief. The blackpill is ""right"" meaning there is a non-zero number of males that are so unattractive that within their lifespan they will not find a partner. Dating is an activity where you are relying on others for success. 

You could possibly do everything in your power right and just be unlucky and never find someone who finds you right. Most people also aren't perfect and most people still have sex and find partners. I say this because I think the expectation that men have to be perfect for a woman is also harmful for this reason. People have the belief that no good person could struggle dating. If they are there must be something horrific wrong with them. I think young men internalize this. There is a belief that's so common that men have to constantly blame themselves for not succeeding in dating when that's not entirely true and there's no way to know for sure if it's really them."

236,2024-01-29,"CMV: The problem with Capitalism isn't with Capitalism itself, but de-regulation",u/JosefVStalin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aeg6ke/cmv_the_problem_with_capitalism_isnt_with/,changemyview,"First off, I am all for regulation. I am no ancap who wants McMilitia's fighting it out with the Royal Burger Army in the streets. I am also (basically) left leaning, at least in the American sense. However I will say that this anti-capitalist mood I have observed in recent generations is downright dangerous to world prosperity. Capitalism, when controlled by robust regulations is the best economic system in human history hands down.  Ill outline my reasons down below:  
1. A economically free society is a politically free society. A state that holds tight controls over the economic engines of the nation will grow its bureaucracy to do so, said state control will invariably, history has shown us, expand further than the economic sphere. Political rights will be curtailed, freedoms will be rolled back and the people will be oppressed. Look to the Soviet Union as proof of this. They used their total control of the economy and its processes to effect political atrocities, most notably the Holodomor when Stalin exported grain from famine-wracked Ukraine to starve as many of them to death as possible.  


2. Firms in a *regulated* Capitalist economy will be rewarded for increased innovation and efficiency, thereby incentivizing both. This not only pushes technology forwards but invariably benefits the consumer. Again look at the Soviet Union and its '[Era of Stagnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Stagnation)', or [America during the late 1800s and 1900s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age) when the economy was dominated by monopolies or, for a more recent example, look at when [AT&T was broken up in the 1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System). In the Communist nations total government control effectively suffocated innovation and economic growth, leading to the stagnation if the 1970s and 1980s and led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. China adapted by allowing limited Capitalism into their country and their economy took off, growing an [average of 9.5% a year](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html) through 2018. Other communist countries like Vietnam followed and began to prosper or didn't, like North Korea, and well, didn't. Though I will admit there are also other...extenuating circumstances pertaining to North Korea. Speaking of North Korea actually, South Korea is a perfect example of this as well. Their GDP was was behind North Korea's until the '[Miracle on the Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_the_Han_River)'.

&#x200B;

3, There are no alternatives. This one is pretty simple. There is simply nothing better. Communism has failed, several times. Fascism has failed, several times. The world is dominated by free market economies for a reason. There is the famous Winston Churchill quote ""It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others that have been tried"". I believe firmly that the same quote can be applied to Capitalism, well regulated.

1,2024-01-29,CMV: not letting psychiatric hospital patients smoke is counterproductive and an abuse of their rights,u/mirrorworlds,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aegapk/cmv_not_letting_psychiatric_hospital_patients/,changemyview,"So this is in regards to psychiatric hospitals. In my country many in-patient facilities don’t allow smacking anywhere on the premises at all. In some there isn’t even an outdoor area they can smoke in.

From what I can see, a newly admitted patient in a mental health crisis not being allowed to smoke seems like a really stupid thing g to enforce on them in that time. 

I understand that hospitals need to priority health of all forms, but this kind of rule in this situation I believe is actually hurting their mental health more in the moment.

I also think, it’s their right to smoke, if they can do it some place away from others, it is not causing harm to them, just themselves. I also think, if they are self medicating with cigarettes and it is legal - what right do others have to prevent you from smoking? Also, it’s not like alcohol where it could worsen a breakdown - at worst the cigs wouldnt do anything to help, but I would guess mostly they would calm people down.

Also arguments about potential health care costs from smoking don’t really factor into the immediate scenario here, and I think efforts to stop someone smoking should me made after they are through the worst of their mental health crisis.

Are they any positive reasons for this ban that I am overlooking?"

My argument boils down to the fact that most of the ""situationships"" women are complaining online, is just them trying to get with a guy out of their league, and because he has so many more options (and the male sexual drive to pursue them), he does not commit. ""Situationships"" is just an excuse for the guy to not commit and to fuck (literally) around.  
This leads to all these women to believe they are in a relationship, when they are nothing more than the guys' personal harem. IF they really were in the same league, he would settle for her.  
This would explain the number of single young men to single young women.

I don’t understand how it’s “hard” to date as a man nowadays, especially with the accessibility of online dating making it even more easier because people are so willing to hookup no strings attached, as long as you put yourself out there.

1,2024-01-30,CMV: Commemorations of Holocaust Memorial Day should be specific about what is commemorated,u/El_dorado_au,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aekj55/cmv_commemorations_of_holocaust_memorial_day/,changemyview,"When commemorating Holocaust Memorial Day, details specific to the event being commemorated should be mentioned. First Minister of Scotland Humza Yousaf’s speech [broadcast](https://twitter.com/ScotGovFM/status/1751183373446353029) during this year’s event is an example of a failure to do that (sorry I can't find a transcript, but the video has subtitles). He didn’t say who were the victims of the Holocaust, only gave the vaguest of numbers involved (millions), and didn’t mention any specific prejudices, ideology, governments, or locations. He could have been equally talking about the Armenian genocide, except that most politicians are afraid to mention that one.

The things that Yousaf did say were not themselves bad - that there are many genocides in the world, and that often they are preceded by losses of freedom, though it’s frustrating that he didn’t give examples of how the Nazis stripped the Jews, other oppressed groups and the general population of their freedoms.

To pre-empt some responses. Yes, groups other than the Jews were systematically murdered by the Nazis, such as people with disabilities in Aktion T4. No, we can’t just assume “everyone knows” what happened, some people don’t even know it happened or deny or downplay it, and regardless we have to be prepared to explicitly say what happened. And if Yousaf wants it to be about all genocides in general, then he should not be calling the event Holocaust Memorial Day. Also, I’m not claiming that Yousaf is anti-Semitic, and I’m aware other politicians have failed to mention the Jews when commemorating the Holocaust, including Trump (who at least named the Nazis as the perpetrator of the Holocaust) and the Prime Minister of Canada.

1,2024-01-30,CMV: Implementing a UBI would be detrimental to society,u/GladAbbreviations337,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aeo1v9/cmv_implementing_a_ubi_would_be_detrimental_to/,changemyview,"Funding a UBI program would require colossal financial resources. Let's break down the numbers. Suppose a modest UBI payment of $1,000 per month per adult citizen. In a country like the United States, with approximately 209 million adults, this would total to over $2.5 trillion annually.

To fund this, governments would need to significantly increase taxes. This heightened tax burden would disproportionately affect the economically productive segments of society, potentially discouraging investment and entrepreneurship. Isn't it counterproductive to penalize productivity for a program that might disincentivize work?

Injecting such vast sums of money into the economy could also lead to inflation. When everyone has more money, prices rise. If the value of money decreases, doesn't this nullify the very purpose of providing additional financial aid?

A UBI could lead to a decline in labor force participation. Why? Because it removes the primary incentive for work: financial necessity.

If people are guaranteed an income without the need to work, a portion of the population will inevitably choose not to engage in employment. This decline in workforce participation could lead to a decrease in overall productivity, an essential driver of economic growth.

UBI could potentially create a dependency culture, where individuals rely on government handouts rather than seeking employment or creating economic value. Isn't a society where a significant portion of the population is unproductive and dependent fundamentally weaker?

The psychological implications of a UBI are profound and concerning.

Continuous, unconditional financial support could erode intrinsic motivation. The challenges and rewards of meaningful work are key drivers of personal growth and satisfaction. If these are removed, wouldn't society risk fostering a population less driven to achieve and innovate?

Employment isn't just about income; it's also about social interaction, contributing to society, and a sense of purpose. UBI might inadvertently reduce these non-monetary benefits of work, leading to issues with self-esteem and social cohesion.

Isn't it wiser to invest in education, skill development, and job creation, thus empowering individuals to contribute to society, rather than making them reliant on state handouts?"

To further explain what I mean, think about insects. Most people (including me) won't hesitate when killing that cockroach under your bed, or that mosquito on your arm, or those ants eating the spilled drink on your table. This is despite there being research that insects can feel pain. However, most people react differently when it comes to a monkey, or a dog being harmed. This is because we recognize those animals have a higher emotional intelligence and capacity for suffering similar to us due to the complexity of their brains.

I don't think we need to feel bad about killing some animals, such as fish or shrimp, any more do I think we need to feel bad about killing a fly or an ant or a grasshopper. I think it's worse to kill chicken and pigs, because those animals are higher up on the hierarchy and have a greater capacity for suffering."

Unfortunately, these people would probably struggle in 2022 too. My guess is that people who complain online are only applying to highly competitive environments like the entertainment industry which will always be difficult to get into even during labor shortages. If you're a qualified individual, you are very likely to find a job in tech. The latest big name layoffs are skewing people's perception. The US is working at full capacity, possibly beyond it."

But that's assuming the people could have afforded the shoes in the first place. even if they could have, now maybe they have money to pay for something else domestically, like maybe paying for their electricity, more money for food, etc.  
  
If it were actually true that free shoes were bad for the economy of poor countries, that would mean that as soon as a shoe donation got shipped into Africa, the economically rational thing to do would be take all the shoes from the recipients and set them on fire.

1,2024-01-30,"CMV: Biden should activate the National Guard in Texas (and any state ""threatening to secede"") and put them to work doing absolutely nothing.",u/Simon-T-Vesper-1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aesas1/cmv_biden_should_activate_the_national_guard_in/,changemyview,"This is regarding the (very recent) broo-haha around the American-Mexican border and Texas' ""threat"" to secede from the Union. Obviously, I don't consider it even remotely serious, as I'll lay out below; and yet, it's obviously *very* serious *if* the President's response isn't carefully measured and considered.

Argument #1: we know Abbott is bluffing. Secession in the modern world would inevitably lead to the collapse of economic relations with the defecting state. Furthermore, Texas doesn't produce enough on their own to make it a viable course of action. They import a significant amount of resources just to keep the state active. *Also* also, Texas is home to several active duty military bases, and the federal government simply isn't going to allow their operations to be f-ed over like that.

Rebuttal: Texas can (and would) receive economic and military support from other states who have signalled their intent to join them.

Counterpoint: This doesn't really fix the problem, it just exacerbates it. The federal government controls the military *and* will not allow a state (or states) to usurp that control (*especially* if it's done through the National Guard because their weapons and bases are ultimately part of the Army as a whole).

Argument #2: Abbott doesn't have the support and/or resources necessary to actually fight a war against anyone (or to sustain the constant flaunting of federal authority). More importantly, I don't believe he has the public on his side; and of his supporters willing to endanger their lives in a fight against the US military, I strongly suspect that far too many of them are like myself: middle aged or older, with a modicum of military experience (like, just enough to be confident in their abilities but not enough to be humble in their assessment of a given situation).

Rebuttal: Biden (and Congress, more generally) has an equal amount of support for pushing back against Abbott's BS; i.e. apart from people who are already in the Army, it's unlikely that anyone is going to sign up for a conflict like this, regardless of where their politics lie. This means the chance of an armed federal response is *very* small (unless the White House wants to put non-military agencies up against the military).

Counterpoint: Abbott knows this and it's partly why he's willing to bluff like he is. He doesn't think Biden (or Congress) has the balls to call him out, meaning he can bluster and do or say whatever crap he wants . . . so Biden should meet him where he's at and play his stupid game.

Argument #3: The whole shebang, clearly, is a politically motivated publicity stunt, with the objective being to normalize this kind of thing and to give just enough fuel to the right wing media outrage machine (because it makes it easier for them to lie about the state of the country and the upcoming election). Doing nothing ~ or equally as bad, doing anything less than demonstrating the full authority of the office) ~ only plays into their hands and lets them continue to f- with the country as a whole.

Rebuttal: It's *not* a ""stunt,"" though, because there *is* a crisis at the border and the federal government isn't doing anything about it.

Counterpoint: I don't believe that. The reports and data I've seen do not support these ""border crisis"" claims. Any reports that claim the opposite almost universally come from right wing sources (i.e. their credibility is highly suspect). Furthermore, even if is a ""crisis"" I would argue that the very concept is highly subjective. There are people seeking a better life in America because conditions in their home nation are super bad and f-ed up. We should be looking at these folk with compassion and empathy, and we should be providing emergency resources until they can find a new home (whether in America or somewhere else). Instead, what Abbott wants is to make things worse *for everyone* by using the ""great replacement"" conspiracy theory as seedlings for sowing discontent and division. If the federal government's response allows for the right perception, Abbott and the far right will spin it as a sign that the feds are taking away people's rights (or some similar nonsense), which helps fuel the fire and so on, until ""someone"" gets angry enough to ""do something"" on their own (like the God's Army convoy that's headed to the border right now).

Conclusion: Biden's best course of action is to activate the National Guard under federal orders and put them to work on *anything* that keeps them away from the border. Deny Abbott (and other right wing lunatic politicians) the ability and opportunity to use their Guard units for further political BS like this*. Hell, they could even do something constructive, like rebuilding Texas' infrastructure (roads, power, cable, etc.). This would show the nation that the President has things under control *and* it would highlight just how childish and misguided people like Abbott truly are.

(*within reason, of course. if a natural disaster happens in Mississippi or something, then clearly the federal government would release Guard units back to state duty to deal with that situation.)

Summary: My opinion is that Biden should play Abbott's game by yanking a critical resource out from under him and putting that resource into good use, for the betterment of the state and the nation *as a whole.* What I'm looking for is an explanation for how a different response would ultimately be the better course of action.

Change my view.

(p.s. while I haven't provided any citations for my claims, if you disagree, please ask and/or provide opposing data. it's much more difficult to reject an argument when there's solid evidence behind it. also, in case it isn't clear, I don't have much respect for right wing political views and will be *highly* critical of them; but I will also do my best to not dismiss them out of hand.)"

The film has a A plot, and a B plot.

The A plot is the satire. A piss take on virtue signaling white liberalism. What is ""black"" in the media world, and what sells as black.

Stereotypes of gangsters, slavery and downtrodden black trauma.

The B plot deals with (more authentic) family trauma. The death of a sister. Gay brother. Relationships. The simple burden of putting mom in a nursing home.

As the film is about to end, the audience expects the finale ""speech"" to give the answers, explanation, conclusions and tie it all together.

It cuts to black, and we get a Monty Python ending.

The main character was in a quasi-dream sequence writing a movie script. He delivers what an audience would want... he is killed in a police shootout.

That's the joke. The B plot is left hanging mostly.

I explained this all clunky and not very articulate, so if you haven't seen the movie, it wouldn't make sense.

My view is that neither the A or B plot were very interesting. The ending of the film also hurts the movie, as the joke is too blunt... though, shot very funny.

You've taken the audience on a 2-hour ride, and you pull the chair away at the last moment."

I’m a registered nurse. I spent my first 10 years in trauma hospital watching the ravages of alcohol. G.I. bleeds, liver failure, pancreatitis, alcohol poisoning, drunk driving (cars,  boats, motorcycle, jet skiis) domestic violence from alcohol, bar fights from alcohol… Not to mention the other long-term risks of heart disease,cancer, liver failure, GI bleeds, Warnicke’s encephalopathy… Suicides were also often drunk.

OVERDOSE:

https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm

“The CDC reports that nearly 88,000 alcohol-related overdose deaths occur each year. “

Marijuana near 0

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE/CRIME

Substance abuse is commonly associated with domestic violence, assaults, and crime. Marijuana reduces that risk rather than increasing the risk of IPV. 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25134048/?version=meter+at+5&module=meter-Links&pgtype=article&contentId=&mediaId=&referrer=&priority=true&action=click&contentCollection=meter-links-click

“A study on marijuana use and intimate partner violence found that couples who used marijuana had lower rates of intimate partner violence in the first 9 years of marriage. “

ACCIDENTS:

https://drugabuse.com/blog/marijuana-vs-alcohol/

“Besides alcohol, marijuana is the most commonly detected drug in drivers involved in car accidents. One study found that marijuana increased the odds of being in car accident by 83%. You may think that 83% is high, but when alcohol was involved, the odds of being in a car accident increased more than 2,200%!”

CANCER:

Even moderate use of alcohol has been shown to increase risk for cancers including: Mouth, Esophageal, stomach, Colon, breast, bladder, pancreas. 

https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/alcohol/reducing-excessive-alcohol-use/index.htm#:~:text=Cancer%20Risks%20Linked%20with%20Alcohol%20Use&text=Alcohol%20is%20a%20carcinogen%20(something,breast%2C%20mouth%2C%20and%20esophagus.

“ Even one drink a day increases the risk of developing cancers of the female breast, mouth, and esophagus.”

OTHER HEALTH EFFECTS:

Pancreatitis, Mallory Weiss tears, esophageal varices, Warnicke Korsakoff syndrome, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, alcoholic cardiomyopathy liver failure…

CARDIAC:

Both cause vasoconstriction with deleterious cardiac effects. The link between alcohol and heart disease is more firmly established. Including the risk for cardiomyopathy. I think it remains to be seen the effects of marijuana on cardiovascular health long-term.

https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21994-alcoholic-cardiomyopathy#:~:text=Alcohol%2Dinduced%20cardiomyopathy%20commonly%20causes,that%20can%20indicate%20a%20problem).

“Excessive alcohol intake can lead to high blood pressure, heart failure or stroke. Excessive drinking can also contribute to cardiomyopathy”

THE BRAIN:

Use an adolescent seems to cause some possible long-term brain effects. But use an adult alcohol causes structural changes and issues in the brain that marijuana does not.

https://sph.lsuhsc.edu/press/alcohol-damaging-brain-health-marijuana/#:~:text=Their%20findings%20linked%20alcohol%20consumption,term%20effects%20on%20brain%20structure.

“Their findings linked alcohol consumption with long-term changes to the structure of white matter and gray matter in the brain. The use of marijuana, however, seemed to have no significant long-term effects on brain structure”

This is not accurate for the adolescent brain. Adolescent should not be using marijuana:

https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/what-are-marijuanas-long-term-effects-brain#:~:text=Some%20studies%20suggest%20regular%20marijuana,people%20who%20do%20not%20use.

“Some studies suggest regular marijuana use in adolescence is associated with altered connectivity and reduced volume of specific brain regions involved in a broad range of executive functions such as memory, learning, and impulse control compared to people who do not use.”


In conclusion: oral ingestion of marijuana  (smoking does have some increased risks to the lungs and esophagus) is far superior drinking in terms of safety."

I enjoy working with my hands, and I think some trades such as electrical work sound very interesting on top of that. However, one thing always stopped me. When I was younger, I used to work security on a few construction sites and noticed something that put me off the trades permanently.

The work culture was just beyond awful. Plenty of verbal abuse (screaming curses, insults, and slurs) from bosses towards the apprentices, plenty of racist, sexist, and homophobic talk, and plenty of generally nasty behavior across the board. It didn't matter which site I was at, or which company was working there, there was a similar trend.  This was only half the issue though - the other half I noticed is that for all these construction companies and tradespeople complain about their dying industry, none of them are even willing to train anyone as an apprentice unless they're a family friend or paying for it through school which presents the same issue of accessibility as university. Half the people at those sites were perfectly competent men who were working for total peanuts as temp laborers in the desperate hope that they'd get chosen as an apprentice.

And, you know, who honestly wants to do any of that?

You can call me weak or a snowflake, and that's fine, but the fact of the matter is that younger generations overwhelmingly don't want to deal with that kind of work culture. I am sure many people would be willing to do a trade, if it was actually accessible work without grinding away your body at dangerous temp labor work in the vague hope of getting chosen and if the industry wasn't rife with casual bigotry of all kinds. If the trades are so desperate for new blood, they should work to be a more welcoming and less abusive environment.  I am aware that making mistakes in trades work is much less acceptable than some other industries, but employers don't need to be abusive in order to get this point across and should be focused on teaching and fostering new talent to continue the most important work in human society instead of pushing away anyone they deem emotionally weak because of dudebro locker room culture."

Guys checking out other girls while holding hands with their girlfriend, following provocative instagram models, older men staring longingly at younger women when they are no longer attracted to their wives…

Me and my friends have discussed many times how when we are in love with someone, we don’t have eyes for anyone else. We wholeheartedly believe our partner is the most handsome man in the world, and everyone else is invisible. I can’t even watch porn while in a relationship, I prefer to imagine my partner and I instead. 

I’m sure there are exceptions, but I have yet to see them. My good friend is in the healthiest and happiest relationship I’ve witnessed, but I noticed even her boyfriend has wandering eyes. I know that just looking is harmless, but what bothers me is that a lot of women don’t even check other men out while in a relationship.  

I know my viewpoint is based on myself and the women and men I know, and that there are women who cheat or even just fantasize about other men while in a relationship. It just seems that the more prevalent scenario is men not reciprocating a woman’s pure, unwavering, loyal love. 

This brings me to a second point that I don’t believe men can truly be monogamous. I’ve been told by multiple men that every guy would want to have more than one woman if they could, but don’t because they love and respect their partner, implying that they are attracted to women other than their girlfriend/wife. But for me and other women I know, we don’t stay loyal just because we love our partners, rather we simply don’t have eyes for anyone else while in a relationship. We wouldn’t WANT to have more than one man, even if we could.

I would really like someone to change my view on this because I would rather be alone for the rest of my life than be with someone knowing they will never love me the same way I love them. This makes me sad because I want to have children and a family, I just don’t know if it’s worth the nagging, depressing feeling that I will never be enough for a man. Additionally, I don’t want to always be so cynical and project this onto others. I want to see love as a beautiful thing like I used to."

While that may be personally for me I don’t see any importance of significance of having friends in this world. 

Now before some of you people say to me that it’s just me that I don’t have any friends let me tell you it ain’t me and it’s always been them as they’ve never accepted me. Ever since I was a child from Primary School, Secondary School to College people have never seen me as one of them on their friendship group.

Sometimes they be antagonising me and when I get angry they laugh in shock and try to say that they aren’t making fun of me and I go wild at them suddenly I’m the bad guy.

I’ve been very conflicted about my feelings in life on the opinion on friends as they always say friends matter most.

There's no denying that the Axis were evil, Imperial Japan in particular isn't getting enough flak for what they did, but the Allies weren't exactly good guys either. 

British occupation of India and Ireland has caused severe famines that claimed tens of millions of lives, the population in Ireland hasn't even recovered to pre-famine level. Britain also suppressed the Kenyan uprising and Malayan communist forces by moving hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians into internment camps. 

America wasn't exactly good before or after the war either. They conquered Hawaii, Phillipines, toppled governments in Central and South Americas, propped up dictatorships across the world for their own interest, carpet bombed Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. American interventions were at best questionable, at worst genocidal.

And there's the USSR, which brutally occupied Eastern Europe before and during WW2, by methods of ethnic cleansing and genocide, violently suppressed any uprisings against them for decades, and of course the presence of Gulags.

From 1937 to 1945, the Allies were undoubtedly behaving better than the Axis powers, but that's not because they were the ""good guys"", it was because of how evil the Axis powers were. But if you zoom out the timeline further, you begin to realise that the Allies were actually committing some pretty horrific shit around the world not that long before or after the war.

I believe the cultural obsession with Taylor Swift and Travis Kelley as a couple ultimately boils down to the way in which these two people, and their combination, perfectly reflects America’s regressive and problematic  adoration of wealth, power, traditional masculinity, feminine beauty standards, and whiteness.

To be honest I always felt that most of the factors underpinned Taylor Swifts massive and enduring individual celebrity in an era that was (in my opinion) genuinely more creatively dominated by black artists like Rihanna and Beyoncé.

I believe that, combining her celebrity with the NFL brand has created a supercharged and ultra marketable symbol of “traditional American values” that people are latching onto particularly after an era that was heavily marked by cultural awakenings about race, class and many other privileges in this country. I don’t know think it is a coincidence. I think the white American public likely finds great relief in this cultural adoration for individuals that very strongly exemplify “the good old days”"

- he was not an organizer, it's not his fault that the arena he performed at was smaller than it should've been and that there was basically no security controlling who was entering and what they were bringing, people expect travis to be all knowing and keep an eye on literal teens and adults when he's 20 ft away from them performing (on drugs,too) with loud music blasting and various flashes and bangs being thrown in the arena

-some people may say that he advocates for mosh pits and rule breakings, but it's just a cheap way to just get all the blame on one man, I'm sure that if someone said to those people to jump off a bridge, they wouldn't, so I don't see why the same argument is used for what a rapper says

-if you've ever been to a travis concert you'd know how it is; there's people constantly screaming, travis keeps an earpiece and the speakers are loudly blasting music, most people act childish at concerts so it's kinda understandable as to why Travis didn't give much thought to people saying ""stop the show""

While both can be about looks, I think pretty is less sexualizing and objectifying, and I think it’d make someone feel good about themselves in the context we are talking about a stranger or friend, if you were to say someone is sexy when you don’t know them or you do but in a serious matter than it could make someone feel weirded out, I know I’d feel uncomfortable.

But if you guys are engaging in let’s something intimate being called sexy/hot could feel great, but I would still like to be called beautiful as it feels like their really appreciating what’s in front of them, and it’s just soft and sweet. Especially if you took the time to put in effort on your appearance, like art work. Sexy/hot too me just don’t seem as more a appreciative compliment, I wouldn’t think about it in a few days or it wouldn’t make me more confident.

Of course there’s nothing wrong if you like being called that, it’s just my opinion and preference!  Guys have called me both before and I couldn’t care less about it, but beautiful/pretty sticks with me.

I do not agree with this sentiment. 

First, a look at the critical consensuses of the games (mainline platformers only, not going through like 150 games).

Sonic 1 is considered ok, but nothing special. Sonic 2 is considered phenomenal, as are 3 and Knuckles. CD has a mixed reception. Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 are critically acclaimed. Sonic Heroes has a mixed reception. Shadow the Hedgehog is widely derided. Sonic 06 is widely considered one of the worst games of all time. Sonic and the Secret Rings is considered horrible, and Sonic Unleashed is considered solid. Sonic and the Black Knight is a marked improvement on Secret Rings, but still not great. Sonic Colors is generally liked, whereas Sonic 4 is widely disliked.  Sonic Generations is beloved, but Sonic Lost World is considered underwhelming. Like 06, Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric is widely considered among the worst games of all time. Sonic Mania is beloved, whereas Sonic Forces was panned. Sonic Frontiers and Sonic Superstars were each considered allright.

See what I'm getting at here? There are some fantastic Sonic games, but the sheer quantity of shitty ones justifies the amount of hate the series gets. I played Secret Rings several years ago and good god, it is truly detestable.

Don't even get me started on the fanbase, either. A dissenting opinion is quickly silenced with an avalanche of unwarranted hatred, causing this community to be among the most toxic in all of gaming (seriously up there with Smash Bros and League of Legends). The OCs are famously cringey much of the time, and the r34 is even worse.

Not to mention, character designs in the Sonic series are bizarre and off-putting. There is just a certain look to them that isn't quite right to me. I mean, birds have feathers and NO FINGERS but they had to invent fingers for birds just so Wave the Swallow, Jet the Hawk, and other bird characters could fit the motif of every character arbitrarily wearing gloves.

And let's not even get into the lore. Just... what even is this supposed to be? I don't know. You don't know. He doesn't know. She doesn't know. NOBODY knows. That's how batshit insane the story of these games is. Very nearly at Kingdom Hearts levels of WTF (Princess Elise... need I say more?)."

Also, Jim Crow is defined here as the systematic discrimination against African-American after 1877 until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, reaching its nadir between 1893 and 1940, though it's echoes still reverberate.

Jim Crow found ways to destroy family wealth, tear families apart, sow mistrust in institutions like police, courts, education and medicine, provide a safe space for lawbreakers White and Black within inner-city ghettos.  Meanwhile Northern and national gaslighting told them they were free and equal.  Whatever skills in the trades or medicine were developed within slavery  were locked away from African-Americans.  

If one cannot be sure of their possessions and property, of what use are the work and sacrifices required for their accumulation?  If the police turn into an army of occupation at worst, or are feckless when the lynching begins, why not f*** them?  If the trades are closed, why fit yourself for them?  And if a decent education could be secured in childhood (not likely) the recipient was that much more likely to attract unwanted attention for ""rising above his place.""

Redlining meant that properties within the fatal line could not be purchased at reasonable interest, closing off a font of intergenerational wealth.  (That adjuncts of redlining,  withdrawal of city services and blockbusting, installed grievances among the people joining the White flight)

Optional conspiracy theory:  The argument for reparations for slavery has to deal with who owes what to whom.  This is not encountered for many of Jim Crow's depredations.  The people expelled after riots often had records of the value of property loss.  Anti-union people should jump at holding the unions that enforced Jim Crow responsible.  In short, it's victims, having suffered losses whose nature is relatively well-defined by case law, have remedies that throwing everything on slavery makes harder to carry out."

Black Americans (**I am not referring to recent immigrants to America from Caribbean isles or the African continent who happen to be black**) are probably the **oldest group of continuous Americans** in the country bar the Native Americans.

The vast majority of Black Americans are descended from people who were brought to the land that is now the US, since it was a British colony. Meanwhile, many white Americans seem to be mixed with people who or have only been American for a couple generations. Many are children of very recent (late 1800s-1900s) successive waves of European migrations & haven't been in America since the start.

So how is it, that Black Americans get classified as ""African"" as if they are some foreign entity to America, and I've never heard white Americans being called ""European Americans""?

Black Americans are not even culturally African in **ANY** way, there's literally nothing African about them except their skin colour & superficial attempts at ""reconnecting"" which were started in the 80s at best."

Suggesting that it's like a 60/30 split of single young men/women. I am a very statistically minded person, so I can accept this as a fact, but, to me, it doesn't mean that this is a unique problem that we have never experienced multiple times in the past 100 years.

Looks like it did spike in recent years: [https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/rate-of-single-men-in-the-us-looking-for-dates-has-declined/](https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/rate-of-single-men-in-the-us-looking-for-dates-has-declined/)

Male singleness went from 51% to 63% while female singleness remained quite similar... but a gap of 20% vs 30% is still very indicative of a major trend, women date older guys. When has this ever not been the case/trend?

I feel like women dating older guys has been a thing for a VERY long time. In fact, it may have been more pronounced/extreme in the early 1900s, where society didn't care as much about guys being extremely creepy about the age gap between men and women when dating & marrying. 

I just don't see any data that suggests that 63% of single young men was uncommon in the past. Sure, if news headlines use this they can get good clicks on the plethora of single men, but I think the cycle will just continue. They'll get older and they'll find better success with women as they become more established financially. I feel like it is plausible that young male singleness has varied from 40% to even 70% over the past 100 years. I don't know for sure if it ever got as high as 70%, but I don't see why it wouldn't have, and I haven't seen any data suggesting this never were the case (i.e. if someone showed me that young male singleness was 20% in 1980, 30% in 1990, 40% in 2000, 50% in 2010, and 60% in 2020, then I'd start taking the statistics more seriously, but as of now all I see is a 2019 comparison to 2023 which could merely be a normal fluctuation). Women generally are attracted to men who show traits of providers (as in men who show that they can offer protection and who own property) (see the incredible Cambrige study: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/sex-differences-in-human-mate-preferences-evolutionary-hypotheses-tested-in-37-cultures/0E112ACEB2E7BC877805E3AC11ABC889;](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/sex-differences-in-human-mate-preferences-evolutionary-hypotheses-tested-in-37-cultures/0E112ACEB2E7BC877805E3AC11ABC889;) that goes into evolutionary explanations of interesting statistical results concerning male & female attraction across 37 countries), and older men are more established and can better provide protection/security and have more property than most due to better finances I think that it makes sense that 63% of young men are single. I just don't know if it is a unique problem that we haven't seen like 20 times in the past 100 years.

Just as a tip, I am not swayed by personal experience usually. Generally, data and statistics get me to change my view. I can't argue against facts."

These are people who were gleefully shitting on men only a few years ago the way every progressive was back then ('kill all men', 'men are trash', 'male tears', ect). For years the only message that we got from progressives was 'fuck you' but now we've supposed the believe that they give a shit?

The funny thing is that 'men are trash' rhetoric is still everywhere on the left. It's just slightly more obscure and subtle and where it does show up, it's never contested by anyone. When trying to understand the change it makes sense to consider how the issue has changed, obviously the situation for young men is abysmal in terms of the suicide rate, number of incels, and everything else. 

The reason given for these figures by leftists , entirely come down to 'toxic masculinity' which is partially to blame but the consequences of things like stratification of communities and lack of purpose are just as much to blame, as for the multi-year demoralization campaign (all of the anti-male, girl boss media, articles and everything else) no one seems to want to talk about the effect that it has potentially had on the rate of male suffering. Even if it hasn't been a factor I think that openly shitting on men when things like the suicide rate is so high is bad optics and thus, the sudden bleeding hearts from people who seem like they shouldn't care."

This is likely to continue and increase even more in the foreseeable future, especially when the climate crisis is taken into account. Even without recent anti immigration legislation and actions by both political parties we would still see the situation at the border deteriorate drastically just based on this alone. When you bring in the xenophobic reaction of America’s politicians it could escalate into something resembling genocide very quickly- think 10-30 years. 

I believe we must change the way we think about immigration from the southern border quickly. Things like;

- An immense increase in the funding to immigration facilities at the border.
- A similar increase in the accepted amount of applications for citizenship with reduced barriers.- essentially if you’re a non criminal you’re in. 
- Direct, positive nation building policy towards  our southern neighbors- both to combat climate change together and with the goal of increasing QOL in this countries to a level similar to our own.

One claim I find kind of dumb is the 2 trillion dollars claim. I've never actually seen, well, any proof the US lost 2 trillion dollars before 9/11. And even if they did, why does it HAVE to tie in with 9/11? I mean, why would they pay terrorists that much money, or what could they possibly need that much money for? I really don't think getting some terrorists to fly some planes into buildings would cost THAT much.

It is a logically correct conclusion to make in any life, throughout time as it has occurred in history. For someone to say that they have never experienced a scenario that they could logically conclude that suicide is a favorable outcome would be admitting that they have also never experienced or fathomed life to its fullest. This point is made more true than false because there is more suffering in the world to experience than there is joy. The reason there will always been more suffering is because the scale at which suffering has become deemed so that it is comparably suffering rather than not has shifted proportions to even smaller amounts of 'ultra' rich wealth occupying much larger amounts of sustainable growth than that of living under the growing population of poverty. 

&#x200B;

What this means to say is a majority that is doomed to a life of exploitation that substantiates people they may never be entitled to interact with. Given the scales at which one must climb and the purposely restricted profits at which they would benefit disproportionally require extraordinary ability or more likely the case which is willingness to connive against peers of equal ability.

&#x200B;

These statements come from a place of extraordinary privilege that I've had the luxury or opportunity to explore. I've had this somewhat unique experience because I am one that grew up within the 'super' wealthy, I've had opportunity to experience the standard brutality of child raising that of roughly 50 years ago (much worse the further back you go), and I have the opportunity to experience the absolute fullness of human technology and infrastructure. These are things that are undoubtably life changing, but it all exists on one thing which is human competence. The competence that congregates in these places of wealth do not originate here usually, they come from all over the world; it's a melting pot of the world's most successful. Successes that inevitably resulted from some failures along the way. There are areas of ultra competent because they practices around the world, learning, and sometimes getting it wrong; with the intention of helping but without the legal repercussions of getting it wrong, or lying as far as research goes.

&#x200B;

I'm very sorry to say, the science the basic population lives off of is basic science. It is often created to maintain status quo and profit. It is not to specifically aid the purchaser any more than a placebo would, because ultimately the results are the same: a satisfied customer. It's an extremely predatory environment gatekept by what would otherwise only be attainable knowledge from PhDs in the field with a similar opinion. I don't mean to convolute the areas of belief and known science, but you would imagine that the more in-depth the science is, the more unknowns, the more room there is for conflicting theories. Anyway the super nerds will often compete with their studies to out prove the other, usually at any cost.

&#x200B;

The bottom line is, you are a tool. Someone knows exactly how you operate you as a tool better than you do. The best course of action of many lives would be to dedicate themselves to the system of exploitation to hasten the resulting money-up system to ultimately create a better world than if they just went about enjoying their lives. You have two clear means of approach, hopefully you could find a way to do both; enjoying what little you have while attributing to the system efficiently. Many don't do this, evidently. Most, typically enjoy a life that is a little more self pleasing, as ought to be expected. It would not be expected exactly to just dedicate yourself to the idea of a machine. So, many live their lives they way they want to, exhibiting behaviors at their discretion. Freedom of choice is the perfect location for predatory marketing schemes (so long as the placebo benchmark is maintained). You can live your life happily, mostly when you aren't aware of it.

&#x200B;

A counter argument would maintain that all we have achieved is a result of what could otherwise be described as suffering. Suffering is an inescapable part of life, you must find the joy where it exists. But what if you are satisfied with your contribution to society because you've already done more than others achieve in a whole generation of an impoverished family. Is it my duty to sacrifice more blood for a child to have another go in a world I detest?

&#x200B;

At what point may a human say that they have sufficiently contributed and the suffering imposed as a result of simple existence is not an acceptable trade?

Now, before you dismiss this as just another complaint, please let me know. I'm open to changing my mind, but the trends I'm observing have left me concerned about the direction Reddit takes.  
We can all agree that some level of moderation is necessary to keep the platform functioning smoothly. Removing spam and irrelevant content is a no-brainer. However, my bone of contention lies in the growing tendency to stifle dissenting voices and create echo chambers. Let's discuss why this might be a problem and why I'm not convinced otherwise yet.

Before I get into some personal examples, I have noticed that some subs have banned words, phrases, or topics before they are even posted, which destroys the discussion before it can even get out there.  
Take, for instance, a recent experience I had on r/australia. I posted a question, genuinely seeking understanding. I asked why people would want to live in Australia if they favoured abolishing the state. Instead of engaging in a constructive discussion, my post was labelled spam and deemed out of context. How can we foster an environment for open dialogue when even genuine inquiries are dismissed?  
Here's another incident that raised my eyebrows. An older person was reportedly arrested for wearing an Australian flag on his hat, supposedly for 'inciting a riot.' This happened amid thousands of anti-Australia protesters. Surprisingly, the post discussing this incident met a similar fate – flagged as spam and out of context by the subreddit moderators.  
I'm genuinely open to understanding the rationale behind such censorship. Change my mind – convince me that suppressing certain viewpoints is necessary for the greater good of the community. I want to believe that there's a justifiable reason behind these actions, but as of now, it seems to be silencing legitimate questions and concerns.  
Censorship not only stifles open discourse but also turns subreddits into echo chambers where only one side of the story is heard. It limits the richness of diverse opinions that makes Reddit a dynamic platform for discussions.  
Now, I understand the need for rules and order. But, there has to be a balance between maintaining order and allowing for a variety of perspectives to coexist. How do we ensure that Reddit remains a space where people can freely express their thoughts without the fear of being silenced?  
If you've had experiences that changed your mind about the necessity of censorship on Reddit or if you have arguments that could shift my perspective, I genuinely want to hear them. Let's engage in a respectful and open conversation about the challenges and benefits of moderation on Reddit.  
Convince me that the rising censorship is a positive force, and let's collectively explore how we can strike a balance that keeps Reddit a vibrant and diverse community."

I asked this same question on r/askmen and there isn’t one answer even close to all the hearbreaking answers I got here on r/askwomen.

While men mostly (and fairly) complained about being stood up, being used for money or just a rude behavior, too many women had « rape » as their worse date.

There is a huge gap between the two.
And men complaining about how hard dating is for them can honestly go cry me a river because I really can’t care less anymore.

There weren’t a huge amount of comments but those illustrated one of the reasons why I don’t bother to find the energy to contradict women who say « all men ».

Men, I know that just because a gender has it harder in an aspect of life doesn’t mean that the other gender isn’t allowed to complain. I’m just saying it’s hard to feel bad for y’all.

Some be crying about not getting any coochie while we be sending our location to our bestie in case we never come back from the date. I swear some single men genuinely be tweaking when they haven’t fucked for a while and some extremists start to mumble about females and wild ideologies (fantasizing about killing some) while single women get on fine with just a vibrator and some snacks. And don’t even get me started on « women have easier access to casual sex », you have access too, go pay a hooker and spare us the whining."

Let's call a spade a spade, this is textbook ethnic cleansing. It's no different from when the US ""asked"" Native Americans to move to reservations, or when Soviets conducted population transfers in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. There's no ""voluntary"" here when their homes have been destroyed by the IDF.

The people attended this conference were not some fringe figures as well, Ben-Gvir and Smotrich were both there, they are the Minster of National Security and Minister of Finance respectively. They are also in the war cabinet. Despite the fact that the government has denied these plans, it remains true that these people have real power and real influence in the government. 

When it comes to public perception, the plan is not deeply unpopular or fringe as well. 33% of Israelis support the resettlement and annexation of Gaza and 56% oppose it. Governments all around the world have implemented policies much less popular than 33%, just ask Netanyahu's protestors last year. A proposed policy that only a slim majority of Israelis oppose has a very good chance of becoming actual policy if the political climate changes, even slightly.

If you're a Palestinian, I think it's valid to have fears of being ethnically cleansed from your homes when the climate in Israeli politics is so in favour of such a policy. We need to recognise that and take concrete steps to reaffirm that that's not going to happen, by drawing red lines, or punishing problematic officials, etc."

Then years down the line, get mad because they feel like the person switched up on them, when really, they were always was like that. Everytime i questioned people, it always came down to ignoring red flags. I also noticed, alot of people will marry the person in their head not their beds. Meaning, they have a different perception of the person even though the person never was like that. So they end up placing expectations on who the person is, when they never was like that.  Its like your romanticizing the person instead of accepting for who they are. Its like marrying a turtle thinking he can fly, then years later realize, he cant fly and get mad and say he switched up. Are these people hidng who they are or they are or they finally showing their true colors? I just believe people fail to vet or they dont build a safe space for them to show their true colors.

Our immigration system is completely broken and the crux of the matter falls on illegal immigrants claiming asylum when they have no valid claim, and then disappearing into the US interior for years while they await their hearings (if they even show up).

This is known to illegal immigrants as the loophole to take advantage of to get in.

We should completely end our asylum system entirely.

The Talking Heads were allegedly offered 80-million dollars to reform for a few shows. Another nugget from the article was how Coachella was right on their heels as well. A bit of a greasy article that showed how this insider stuff happens. How acts like No Doubt and Sublime were pursued as well.

With regard to David Byrne, he has never stopped playing Talking Heads songs.

He will often feign that he has little use for nostalgia, but he dines out on the Talking Heads legacy with glee.

His solo tours are mostly Talking Heads songs.

He performs Talking Heads songs on most television appearances… always has. This dates back to SNL through the Arsenio Hall Show.

He tours with St. Vincent and they play Talking Heads songs.

Likewise, he created an entire Broadway musical, and it's mostly Talking Heads songs.

Similar to Morrissey or Robert Plant. More men who claim they don't want to talk about the past, yet just play their old songs as the main attraction without irony.

My view is that you've already gone 95% of the way. Why not just let your former band members play with you? David Byrne isn't retired from playing live music. This isn't an impossible request. Just reunite. It's not about integrity at a certain point… it's something else that no one can figure out.

However, much sooner I see the job requirements becoming increasingly harder due to the amount of skills required to sustain and advance the latest technological development. This will require the people either to adapt and uspskill themselves or face the possibility of falling behind out of the market. 

At the same time the industries largely dependent on the manual labor, and especially the minimum wage will be the latest and the slowest ones to adapt to the changes due  to the cost efficiency. Since it will be much cheaper for them to keep the low wage workers rather than implement the costly new technologies. 

In the end it will basically mean for many that if you cannot keep up with the technological race speed you'll get a chance of being stuck with the low wage job without that many chances to grow up out of it.

Beans:  I'm not a pest.

This time is different from the last few times.  This time, I feel certain I'm wrong, but I just can't see how.  I need people to help me think outside the box.

The two different definitions are these:

1) racism here in the US is the inability, or unwillingness, of white guys to fall in love with, and potentially marry, black women.

2) racism here in the US is the perception of a status difference between blacks and whites.

(NB:  I'm not saying individual white guys are racist; I'm saying this tendency, in Americans, is what makes the American people a racist people.  Racism is a group thing, not an individual thing.  And I know, the group is made up of the acts of individuals... but single ants don't build nests.  Ant societies do.  That's how racism is.  It's something our society does.)

(NB:  I know, individuals feel like they're racist or feel like they're not racist, or at least way less racist than those other guys.  Whether you feel like you're racist or feel like you're not, has nothing to do with it.  These are conscious fantasies about what is a subconscious phenomenon.  Our subconsciouses do not tell us what they're up to or why.)

Both definitions are equally true, because correcting either would reduce, and ultimately eliminate, racism.

Both definitions are almost equally significant; the first is more significant than the second, because the first points to the cure (raise that marriage rate) while the second says nothing about a cure.

But they're mutually exclusive:  by the first, blacks cannot be racist, while by the second, they cannot be anything else.

And please, let's not discuss whether there are other races, in the US.  It's not the CMV.  Let's just assume, for the purposes of this post, there are only two races in the US, and you're either white or black, and if you're not black, you're either white or going to be soon.

What confuses me is that people are already saying that this means that Pitchfork is officially dead and are asking for suggestions for alternative publications to follow.  

The layoffs by GQ weren't massive and a GQ spokesperson has stated that they have no plans to even re-brand the magazine, let alone shut it down completely.  And since the news was announced, the Pitchfork website has continue to post reviews and articles at the same rate as before.

I think Pitchfork is so popular because it is the best at what it does, which is provide a steady stream of thoughtfully-written (if not sometimes painfully over-written) reviews, covering a broad range of genres and levels of popularity.  I think they have a unique niche which should make them valuable indefinitely.

It also talks about the existence of concentration camps and genocide against the Uyghurs. In reality that does not exist, but rather it is a myth. You yourselves can even check information from previous years and observe that the birth rate of Uyghur ethnic group has grown proportionally more than that of Han ethnic group, shouldn't the opposite be true? In that region you can also find many mosques that you yourselves can visit if you ever visit that region, aren't they supposed to have been removed by now? The supposed concentration camps are nothing more than centers where people are treated, educated and investigated due to the terrorist attacks that arose from there. After the application of these measures, terrorist attacks were considerably reduced. The Xinjiang region along with Tibet was even granted autonomous region status and high-speed trains were also built to encourage its development.

This transcends the political divide. Whether you're a liberal or conservative, you're annoyed at just how old the people running America are. 

Oh yes. The hated 21 drinking age. Hardly the worst, but certainly the most common thing older generations impose on us. At 18 we're old enough to take out literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans, but God forbid we drink. That's off limits. This is a product of a larger culture surrounding alcohol in the U.S. that makes it taboo. It has religious conservative roots and much of it, such as open container laws, has no actual basis and is simply a relic of archaic temperance era laws. 

As for why I think this attitude is bound to die eventually, it's because it already declined once during the Vietnam War. Around 1972, the drinking age was lowered across most of the country and many alcohol laws were loosened as it was very questionable to tell young men to go fight for a country that restricted their liberties so heavily back home. Of course, this was reversed in the mid 80's because of the imaginary ""drunk driving epidemic"". The MADD propaganda was that of menacing drunk teenagers turning the roads into war zones. And the 1984 MLDA law cured this problem (sure just ignore the fact that seat belts were introduced at this same time, it couldn't have been them reducing the road fatalities). So the attitude was revived because of fear mongering.

But with the rise of increasingly autonomous and even some self driving vehicles, the drunk driver argument will soon be obsolete. Which will leave only the ""alcohol is bad for young people"" argument. And I think this is where our generation will wake up and see that it was never about protecting us. If it was, we wouldn't have nonstop school shootings. If it was, we would have a mental health system that worked. It has always been about older people wanting to restrain the youth so that they can feel safer, but having no interest in the wellbeing of youth. And I think we'll be well too aware of this to care enough to preserve archaic societal expectations that no other country has. Seriously, in Germany and Belgium 16 year olds are free to socialize in beer gardens. Are their societies collapsing? It doesn't look like it. 

I have not found a single reason to believe my generation will have any interest in preserving such archaic customs. But old habits die hard, and I'm open to considering other factors at play here. "

It is a federal district which offers those citizens living within it little benefits and many disadvantages. I care not for the historical reasons it was not originally created as a state, I only care the facts as they stand today.

* D.C. is just over 60 sq miles which is quite a bit smaller that the smallest state, Rhode Island at over 1,200 sq miles.
* It has a population of 690,000 which is larger than two states.
* The nearly 700k people living in D.C. have no federal representation in congress besides a non-voting member (who aggressively advocates for statehood).
* Despite not having representation, they still need pay federal taxes like any other citizen.
* Over 80% of D.C. citizens want to become a state.

Firstly I would argue that there is no action without emotion. Rationalism might seem be at the wheel but ultimately the irrational is the engine. Human rights movements wouldn’t exist if the thought “slavery is bad” was the sole incentive to act accordingly. 

Secondly as nice as utilitarianism sounds it is impossible to predict an actions utility in the long run. It’s impossible to know how the world would look now if Hi*ler would’ve been shot in 1930, although today most people would say that it would’ve been a good thing. It’s impossible to say how society would be like now. Same on an individual level. Society tries to force ideals and false promises on individuals. “Get your Highschool diploma, Bachelors, Masters, good job, happy family happy life” when in reality this is a false promise. A lie founded on the false ideal of materialism. There is no certainty that following this prefabricated path will end in a happy and fulfilled life, yet people would call someone unreasonable whose goal is to work a some low wage job, presuming that it can’t result in a fulfilling life. 

Thirdly if you ask yourself “why am I doing this?” often enough you’ll realise that it ends in a circle. At the end there is no rational answer to what we do. Yet people tend to follow a prefabricated path created by society often out of fear of being shamed if they swam against the current or maybe believing societal promises and alienate oneself from one’s passion although the outcome is uncertain either way, just as followed path is equally irrational.

My arguments in short:
1. The irrational is the engine of our doings
2. Reason has its limit, a limit which tends to be overlooked or even denied
3. Even reason itself at its origin is irrational"
1,2024-01-31,CMV: Property Taxes should be Abolished.,u/The_Sad_Punk,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afri76/cmv_property_taxes_should_be_abolished/,changemyview,"I don't think it's right that even after you've fully paid for your home, you never truly own it due to property taxes. This basically means that even after you've paid off your house, the government can do whatever if you don't make the payments. What else do you own that you must continue to pay taxes on until the day you die?

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for increased taxes in other areas to cover the costs of all the things property taxes pays for in the community. Gas or whatever it doesn't matter, but it just shouldn't be attached to your home."

But here me out, they may look like a ridiculous statement but there is fair amount of evidence to support this statement.

Let's go over it.

Who is the most common client of male prostitutes? it's other men.

Who enjoys male only fans content? Again other men 

Who is the biggest consumer of play girl magazines that has sexualised men in it? Other men.

You seeing a pattern here? Other men are the ones who find men sexually attractive.

Meanwhile women also say all the sexualised men in the media are for other men.

They also say that they don't go to male strip clubs to enjoy the male dancers but to simply have fun with the other women. 

The most searched porn category by women turns out to be.......lesbian porn.

Most supposed ""straight"" women make more lesbian fanfics 

And many women seem to be completely and utterly uninterested in men at all. 

I mean have you seen, how many straight women utter ""I wish I was a lesbian""?. It's a pretty common thing to hear. 

Then you have bi women on twitter who tweets something like "" I'm bi which means I'm attracted to one type of guy and literally every women in existence""

The people who admire the male body are almost always gay men. Not a single woman in sight 

Hell women also say if men want compliments, they should compliment each other and what not 

These are my points and arguments, I want to change my view on this."

1,2024-01-31,CMV: Bell towers are a nuisance and shouldn't be rung anymore.,u/VesperBibs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1aft2kd/cmv_bell_towers_are_a_nuisance_and_shouldnt_be/,changemyview,"For context, I live in a small-ish village in the south of France, there is a bell tower I'd say about 50 meters from our doorstep.

It starts ringing at 7am(even on the weekends), ringing seven times at about a two minute interval and then once at the half hour mark. This goes on throughout the day, the number of rings depending on what time it is, until 11pm. 
It is a fucking nuisance and has somewhat become a source of anxiety, not to mention the reason sleep past 7am or a nap during the day is out of the question. I don't see why this is necessary. It helped keep time back in the day but it's redundant now, everyone has tons of other ways to tell the time on them or around the house, even the Pharmacy has a digital clock display outside for those who might need it. Sure tourists love how quaint it is but it's an absolute nightmare to live near one. They shouldn't be in use any more. 


I'd like my view changed because clearly the fucking bell tower isn't going anywhere, so I'm hoping to find at least one good reason to help me cope."
1,2024-01-31,CMV: China deserves Taiwan,u/hamsterdamc,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afu850/cmv_china_deserves_taiwan/,changemyview,"Let's start by their blatant refusal to declare independence and continuing to insist on the status quo of the defunct and defeated Republic of China. 

Imo, they were defeated and if you don't want independence, the country that defeated you has all rights to claim you because you have totally refused to declare independence and become independent. Choose one: Are you Republic of China or Taiwan? Can't have your cake and eat it too.

Taiwan foreign policy is also neither here nor there. Do you want independence or not? Hiding behind ""status quo"" signals a very unserious position of the future of your enclave. 

Declaring independence should be the first action that they should do if they want to be taken seriously. If there is war, great. Fight it and be done with it instead of keeping countries hanging. 

China last fought a war in the 1970s, and they were beaten badly and retreated and claimed that it was a ""learning experience."" The worst scenario that is highly unlikely to happen is being nuked, which won't happen because China too would be nuked.

At this point, the poor Palestinians are more courageous and deserving of a state than the Taiwanese. At least they are putting some pressure and effort towards getting one even if they are among the poorest in the whole world and less affluent than the Taiwanese. 

Taiwanese are just bitch*ng in Western capitals and refusing to declare independence while complaining that China is ""bullying"" them, yeah China deserves to bully you because you have totally refused to take the initiative to secure your future. 

You won't manufacture chips forever and America is slowly decaying and it's forever wars would reduce its impact in the world arena and the ""island chain"" argument won't hold water for long since US Navy won't be powerful for that long.

1,2024-01-31,"CMV: Art cannot be anything, or it ceases to be a concept.",u/tfwnolife33,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afuhen/cmv_art_cannot_be_anything_or_it_ceases_to_be_a/,changemyview,"One of the more popular stances people have when it comes to art is that anything can be considered art because there are no hard rules for what can and cannot be art. To me, this can't be true because concept involves categorization. There are things that are inclusive to a concept, but on the other side of the coin there are things that are excluded from it because it doesn't fit a concept's general idea. For example, there's happiness and sadness, freedom and restraint, chaos and civility, etc. Every idea is paired with another opposing idea that illustrates a general ruleset of what can be grouped into a concept. So why should art be any different? If we can consider art to be anything we want, then at that point art simply becomes synonymous with ""anything"" and thus has no unique traits to warrant it being it's own concept. It becomes an utterly meaningless concept.

You've probably heard of sayings along the lines of ""if everyone is \_\_\_\_\_. then no one is.""  That's pretty much the general idea I'm laying out. Art has no value as an concept if we can just label anything we want as art. There has to be restrictions. Random noises cannot be art. Random scribbles cannot be art. Art has to have intention, technique, and meaning from the creator - and there needs to be a creator in the first place. It wouldn't make sense to say something like ""the Sun is art"" because no human being had any involvement in the Sun's creation. Art has to be an intentional form of self-expression."
70,2024-01-31,CMV: Tipping culture needs to end,u/Cbsanderswrites,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afui0f/cmv_tipping_culture_needs_to_end/,changemyview,"I have worked in the service industry and relied on tips. But tipping culture is out of control for a variety of reason: 

1. 20% on top of EVERY transaction is an insane amount. It used to be 10%, then went to 15%, now it's outrageous. We're blind to how much extra that cost is and how quickly it adds up. 20% for delivery, hair cuts, a latte, a massage, an Uber ride—the list goes on and on and freaking on. 
2. Companies keep saying they'd have to raise their prices if they pay workers a standard amount. But they already HAVE raised their prices. CEOs already ARE making record profits for themselves. WE ARE PAYING MORE FOR GOODS AND SERVICES AND STILL TIPPING 20% ON TOP OF THAT. Why is there no outrage from consumers? They're using the old rhetoric they used for years when talking about increasing minimum wage. ""Prices will go up for customers."" But they're going up anyway! They ARE UP. 
3. It's just confusing and I'm tired of having to Google who I'm supposed to tip. Even for my wedding, I found out I was supposed to bring cash envelopes for basically every vendor—DJ, Caterers, Photographers, etc. WHY? Just give me the price. I already have too much to plan and consider. It's a flipping headache. 
4. Even if I don't need to tip or shouldn't tip (like a regular cashier)—I feel incredibly guilty not tipping. Buying anything anymore is a guilt-ridden and emotionally charged experience where I have to remind myself they're handing me a Diet Coke and I don't have to tip for that. 

I still tip because so many are underpaid by their employers, and I've been there. But I am so tired of it. I've traveled in Europe a lot. It's so much less stressful and more relaxing to not have to THINK about tipping all the time. "
1,2024-01-31,CMV: Choosing not to participate in local politics is reasonable if you favour centralisation and no local devolution,u/EwanWhoseArmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afun4x/cmv_choosing_not_to_participate_in_local_politics/,changemyview,"So my view on politics and voting in general is that national stuff I will make some effort to vote in (will never join a party though, I can't stand people who make politics more than that thing) but anything more local I have no interest in. 

My reason for this is twofold 

1. Disagreement with local devolution - The government has seemingly randomly brought in directly elected metro mayors despite multiple referendums rejecting such a thing. As the current ""mayor"" is a failed ex-MP desperate to stay relevant, I don't want to go so far as endorse any candidates as my opinion is for the office to be dissolved 
2. Futility of any election having any impact - For some reason my council does elections for 1/3rd every year (3 out of 4 years have a local election) , which means the council is constantly unable to decide anything since it is constantly in a state of flux. Ousted councillors just crop out in the next ward over next year. Its absurd 

TLDR - Prefer centralisation, hate localism. Find local politics a waste of effort "
1,2024-01-31,CMV: Music platforms such as Spotify and YouTube should remove the music artists who are accused or convicted of sexual assault or domestic violence,u/Alive_in_95,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afvh4v/cmv_music_platforms_such_as_spotify_and_youtube/,changemyview,"There should be no reason why those accused or convicted of sexual or domestic violence should have a platform or voice in society, and no reason they should be allowed to continue to make money, especially off of people who might be unaware of their crimes

If you’re accused of a sexual offense or domestic violence, streaming services should first suspend the accounts. Then, if found guilty, remove the account and any fan videos of said artist.

Ideally also physical retailers should be compelled or encouraged to stop stocking these artists once convicted also.

This would still be in line with the first amendment, but it would also erase these artists once convicted off the social atmosphere.

Consider the way that objects of hate such as the Confederate flag aren’t banned per se, but incredibly hard to find or purchase.

Why shouldn’t we do the same with artists who hurt others?"
413,2024-01-31,CMV: America is both overhated and underrated,u/nowlan101,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1afvqlm/cmv_america_is_both_overhated_and_underrated/,changemyview,"When America helps people or helps the world, nobody really shows any gratitude. And if we help in *too* much or in the wrong ways we get called cultural imperialists sticking our white noses into brown/black people's business and messing up their countries. If we don’t help enough, as the case shows in Rwanda or the current Latin American refugee crisis, we’re a callous, settler-colonial nation who couldn’t give two shits about the plight of the black man or the brown man suffering just beyond our borders.

The history of human life on earth is in large part a study of the various empires we created over thousands of years and based on our predecessors, I’d say if America is an empire, we’re by far the most benign and just the world has yet seen. We’re grading on a curve of course but does anybody else here reasonably think we’d be better under a Pax Russia? Pax China? Pax Britannia? How about the slave empires of the antiquity such as Rome, Greece, or any of the Islamic Caliphates? 

There should be some middle ground between giving the appropriate credit to countries that have made enormous strides in terms of lifting their citizens out of poverty, ending hunger and raising the standards of living while also acknowledging the role, where it’s appropriate, of the US in facilitating it. For example, China lifting hundreds of millions of citizens out of poverty is a major humans rights achievement. China is/should be very proud of it. But it never would have happened with out the aid of US markets, US credit, and US help. And we should take pride in that as well. But liberals think they’re above the low hanging fruit of patriotism, “why do we even need to be proud of our country? That’s weird.” — because it’s so associated with the political Right. 

So they go the opposite direction and constantly harp on all the wrongs America may or may not have done.
