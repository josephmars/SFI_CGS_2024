1,2023-12-31,I know how to prevent cancer.,u/Ok_Wrap5895,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18vmy5e/i_know_how_to_prevent_cancer/,Futurology,"The split-brain experiment, conducted by Roger W. Sperry in the 1960s, involved cutting the corpus callosum to treat epilepsy. The lack of effective communication between hemispheres resulted in distinct cognitive processes. This led to the emergence of seemingly separate selves within one individual, with each hemisphere exhibiting unique functions and perceptions. 

There is no ‚Äùinherent self‚Äù. Your body constists of billions of selves or cells, all contributing to the experience you are having right now. As you probably already know, you are not the same person you were 2 days ago. Your cells are constantly dying and new ones are being born. Much like a human society. 

When you resist life or ‚Äùthe now‚Äù. When your cells resist death and when you are constantly agitated and anxious about the future/past. Your mind as well as your body is turning on itself. The same way that a society/group/company splits up when things go south. 

When you resist the present moment or become overly preoccupied with the past or future for prolonged periods of time. Your cells, much like a troubled society, start turning against themselves. Simply becoming aware of your thoughts and grounding yourself in your body, feeling every part of it, your immune system strengthens, blood flow improves, unnecessary cortisol production decreases, and your body temperature rises. By letting your senses overwhelm you and by clearing your mind from thought, your cells stop resisting death and you actually stop fearing death yourself. 

You are constantly dying, but you are resisting it instead of accepting it.

Now you might ask. What would happen if an entire society taught presence in schools and became highly conscious? 

We would see a reduction in crime, drug use, mental illness, bullying, selfishness, conflict, physical illness, racism and estrangement from nature. 

God is love."

Fear not, fellow digital nomad! Buckle up for 5 ways to biohack your brilliance and leave your 2023 self in the dust cloud of progress.

1. Brain Gym, Metaverse Style: Ditch the dusty dumbbells, join the holodeck! Virtual reality workouts are popping off, merging sweat with epic landscapes. Imagine battling orcs while sculpting your pecs, or dodging asteroids while doing lunges ‚Äì talk about gamified gains! Bonus points for using AI trainers who crack witty quips while you pant like a dragon after a hot curry.

2. Sleep Hack: Lucid Dreaming for the Win: Tired of boring sheep counting? Download a lucid dreaming app that turns your snooze into an interactive adventure. Imagine pitching ideas to Elon Musk on Mars, or learning salsa from Shakira in a zero-gravity nightclub. Wake up refreshed, with dance moves so smooth they'll make J-Lo jealous. Side effects may include uncontrollable urge to high-five narwhals.

3. Learn Like a Cyborg: Who needs dusty textbooks when you have brain implants, am I right? Okay, maybe not yet, but augmented reality flashcards and gamified learning platforms are the new hotness. Imagine dissecting a virtual frog while skydiving over the Great Barrier Reef ‚Äì knowledge bombs delivered with maximum adrenaline, baby! Just don't blame me if you end up belting out Shakespearean sonnets to your goldfish.

4. Mindmeld with the Masters: Feeling creatively bankrupt? Neuralink who? Plug into the collective genius of the internet! Imagine channeling Picasso's artistic spirit, Mozart's musical mojo, or Stephen Hawking's cosmic curiosity ‚Äì a buffet of brilliance at your fingertips (or rather, braintips). Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Don't unleash an army of AI-powered dancing chickens on the world, I beg you.

5. Upgrade Your Empathy Chip: We're all connected in the digital age, but are we truly feeling each other? Enter the empathy headset, your window into the emotional ocean of others. Share a virtual hug with a stranger in Mumbai, feel the joy of a child winning a spelling bee in Timbuktu ‚Äì the possibilities for human connection are mind-blowing. Just don't get so emotionally entangled you start crying over a rogue Roomba's existential crisis."

I did not say ‚Äùcure‚Äù cancer in my previous post. Everyone seemed to think that suddenly becoming conscious will solve all your problems.

there isn't a definitive study that conclusively compares the risk of cancer between meditators and non-meditators. Research in the field of meditation and its potential impact on health is ongoing, and findings will evolve over time. 

Since chronic stress is linked to various health issues, including cancer, there is a theoretical basis for exploring the potential benefits of meditation in reducing cancer risk indirectly.

As someone who has achieved very high states of consciousness through meditation. I know how powerful this stuff really is. You stop turning the body against itself. Both physically and mentally. It lifts a weight your cells are carrying. The higher your consciousness, the lighter the load on your cells. Im talking about chronic inflammation, and cellular damage caused by YOUR MIND. 
For those of you that think cancer is purely genetic and has nothing to do with your mind, well tough luck. Because presence has been associated with longer telomere length,  a change in gene expression and epigenetic changes. 

As for the guy that said the ‚Äùcure‚Äù to cancer is easy. We just need to be able to ‚Äùgrow organs‚Äù. Well try growing a brain. Maybe your new one will be open to ideas that might shape the future of humanity."

With mobile handsets their articles discussed battles between Nokia, Motorola, Ericsson, Blackberry and Siemens. Across several articles, the smartphone did not even get a mention. 

On the home entertainment front, they discussed battles between Sony, Panasonic and Toshiba about DVD technologies and hard disk recorders. The prospect that internet streaming services would disrupt everything did not even get a mention. 

**Lesson.** The prognostications from this random sample of Economist articles all had one thing in common. They were all stuck in the paradigm of the present and could not make the jump to the next highly disruptive paradigms. 

I think overall the Economist is good comprehensive publication that is able to analyse some political and scientific events extremely well. But, I certainly would not want to be relying on it for accurate technology predictions.

1,2024-01-02,I think MidJourney-Generated Photos Are Revolutionizing the Stock Photo Industry,u/Jealous-Ad-3175,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18wl3ni/i_think_midjourneygenerated_photos_are/,Futurology,"**Introduction**  
In the dynamic landscape of digital content creation, bloggers, content creators, and designers constantly seek innovative and cost-effective solutions for visual elements. The advent of AI-generated imagery, particularly through platforms like MidJourney, is poised to transform the traditional stock photo paradigm, offering endless creative possibilities.  
**Current Challenges with Traditional Stock Photos**  
The existing stock photo industry, while rich and diverse, presents several challenges for users:  
**Cost:** High-quality stock photos often come with a hefty price tag, especially for premium images or extensive licensing rights.  
**Licensing and Copyright Issues:** Navigating the complex web of copyright and licensing restrictions can be daunting, limiting creative freedom and usability.  
**Limited Customization:** Traditional stock photos may not always align perfectly with specific creative visions, forcing compromises in design and content.  
**MidJourney: A Game-Changing Solution**  
MidJourney is revolutionizing this landscape by addressing these challenges head-on:  
**Cost-Effective and Unlimited Access:** Unlike traditional stock photos, MidJourney offers a more affordable solution. A single prompt can generate an unlimited number of images, providing immense value for money.  
**Freedom from Copyright Restrictions:** AI-generated images bypass the usual copyright constraints, granting full creative control to the user. This freedom is particularly beneficial for creators who need unique and specific imagery.  
**Customization at Your Fingertips:** With MidJourney, the limitations of existing imagery are a thing of the past. Users can specify details like character posture, attire, and even the mood of the image, ensuring that the final product aligns precisely with their vision.  
**Immediacy and Relevance:** The ability to generate images on demand means that users can stay abreast of current trends and topics, making their content more relevant and engaging.  
**Quality and Variety:** MidJourney's advanced algorithms ensure high-quality images across a diverse range of styles and themes, catering to a wide array of creative needs.  
**Implications for the Stock Photo Industry and Beyond**  
This paradigm shift has profound implications:  
**Empowering Creatives:** Bloggers, content creators, and designers now have a powerful tool at their disposal, enhancing their creative process and output.  
**Democratizing Visual Content Creation:** MidJourney levels the playing field, allowing individuals and small businesses to compete with larger entities that have more resources for acquiring high-quality imagery.  
**Sustainability:** With AI-generated images, there's no need for resource-intensive photo shoots, making it an environmentally friendly option.  
**A Marketplace for Innovation**  
As a user and advocate of this transformative technology, I've found immense value in [AiResourcesMarketplace.com](https://AiResourcesMarketplace.com), a platform that offers a vast marketplace for buying and selling MidJourney generated stock photo prompts and Chat GPT prompts. This marketplace provides a curated selection of prompts that unleash the creative potential of MidJourney, ensuring that every visual need is met with precision and artistry.  
The site also includes a treasure trove of free Chat GPT prompts, empowering users to explore the possibilities of AI-generated content. And for those keen on staying ahead of the curve, the platform offers the latest news and updates in the AI space, ensuring that its community is always informed.

**Conclusion**  
MidJourney's AI-generated photos are not just an alternative to traditional stock photos; they represent the dawn of a new era in digital creativity. This technology empowers creators with unparalleled freedom, customization, and accessibility, heralding a future where the only limit is one's imagination. As the technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative applications that will further transform the digital landscape.

Hello everyone I am 19 year old kid, confused while deciding my major I want to know how is world going to change realistically like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos were at the right place at the right time when internet was just about to pickup they identified the future trends 

I just hate maths so no ai, other then ai what will happen in 5 years to 10 years it could be anything like what will happen when population decline , climate change, biotech,u got the point

Also passion is bullshit so don't say that I hate maths and not a creative person love law, science, buisness 

Jeff Bezos had a background in eng, investment bank then he went into business he didn't had passion for e-commerce when he started he just identified the trends and found the opportunity 

It is just for my curiosity"

I engage with a wide range of areas, including APIs, DevOps, and a bit of front-end development. My work often aligns with the responsibilities of a staff engineer. I consistently go above and beyond in my daily tasks, delivering results that exceed expectations. In the past, I also developed software projects on the side, either as a hobby or to earn a little extra. But in the end, my daily job is not very open to making any innovation. Most of the software development jobs out there are just about integrating things and building on top of existing tools.  
However, the software development landscape has changed significantly over the past year. I no longer see the benefit in dedicating time to learning new frameworks, libraries, or software development concepts, nor in exploring DevOps tools. Whenever I need to use a new tool at work, ChatGPT efficiently explains the basics and provides me with starter code in just a few minutes.  
As a result, I've shifted my focus to investing in my mental and physical well-being. I spend my evenings trying out various handcrafts that I've always been interested in. This approach not only helps me stay healthy for a longer period, but it also equips me with a skill that AI may not be able to replicate, even if it eventually replaces me in my job.  
What do you think is it early to move more into that direction? How do you tackle with the current?"

-  
-  
*Utopia - An ideal place or state.* 
-  
  **What is the perfect society that you envision?** Is it one were everyones needs are met? Where society is designed to encourage yet not demand participation? Should everyone be forced to 
be involved or will their personal rights be protected? Is it run like the military? Top down command structure, existing at the whims of those above? Is it a democratic collective of 
special interest groups, working together to exploit their own groups internally, and against each other externally? A society of individual rights over all, protected from tribalist 
mob rule? Something more nuanced perhaps?  
-  
**Share your thoughts:** *On Society*  
-  
  **Like all other organisms, society walks the evolutionary path.** Survival of the fittest? Ha! Natural selection doesn't mean survival of the best/strongest/fastest etc... Natural selection 
basically means; Filling a need with the first thing that works. Again; Not the best/strongest/fastest, the FIRST thing that works. Evolution is lazy. So is society.  
-  
 **Society has built a tower in a swamp.** It is constantly sinking and the ones at the top have no interest in getting wet. They tell the people on bottom floor, when they are nearly drowned, that if they build 
a new floor up top, everyone can move up a floor and no one will get wet anymore. So the people at the bottom do, everyone moves up, and the tower is still sinking. Repeat as needed.  
-  
  **Not all Futurists are Progressive; All Progressives are Futurists.** Progressives stand at the side of the swamp, pointing to the fertile fields, bountiful mountains, abundant forests and 
fresh clean water LITERALLY right next to the swamp and say ""Hey, think maybe we can build over here instead? Where nobody sinks in the swamp? Where people aren't wasting time repeating 
the exact same mistakes of the past, that are obvious to anyone with half a brain?"". The guys at the top of the tower object, because it would ruin their view. The people at the 
bottom agree, even though they will only be allowed the chance to enjoy the view when working for those above them... *All progressives are also at least mildly depressed*.  
-  
  **We can fully control the evolution of our society** in the same way we modify dogs through breeding. Keep what we want, reduce and remove what we don't, and let it grow on its own. Just a 
warning however, like dog breeding, improper regulation can lead to a society that looks like a Pug (sorry Pug lovers, feel free to suggest an uglier breed).  
-  
  **Don't be pigeon-holed by the analogy;** Think outside the kennel. Just because I said we can ""breed"" a better society, doesn't mean we have to use the crippled and rabid dogs we got running around. We can genetically 
engineer the ""Perfect Dog^TM"". Have been able to for a long time. Just gotta put down the crippled and rabid dogs to ensure the new ones safety, and lock up their owners who let them run free.  
-  
**What are your thoughts on current and future society?** Can we build a *Standardized*, *Fair*, and *Just* Utopia? The ""Perfect Dog^TM""?"

1,2024-01-03,Breaking Barriers: Why Restricting AI Access to the Average Person is a Step Backward,u/Marty_Au79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/18xu6ab/breaking_barriers_why_restricting_ai_access_to/,Futurology,"**Introduction**

In an era where technological advancements are reshaping our world, the debate around Artificial Intelligence (AI) accessibility has taken center stage. As a fervent proponent of open-source AI, I find the notion of gatekeeping these technologies from the average person both frustrating and counterproductive. This article aims to dissect why this restrictive stance not only undermines the ethos of innovation but also perpetuates a cycle of inequality and missed opportunities.

**The Double Standard in AI Access**

The current landscape of AI development and deployment is predominantly dominated by large corporations and institutions. These entities have leveraged our data ‚Äì often without our explicit consent ‚Äì to refine their algorithms, only to turn around and sell us products or lose this data to hackers. Yet, when it comes to granting the public access to similar tools, suddenly a multitude of concerns about safety and misuse emerge.  
  
Why should only a select few have the privilege of utilizing AI for advancement? Executives use personal assistants, CFOs for financial insights, CMOs for marketing strategies, and consultants for expertise. They leverage AI and machine learning tools to bolster their companies and personal wealth. Why then is there a hesitance to trust the average person with these resources?

**The Myth of the Dangerous 'Average Person'**

There‚Äôs a pervasive narrative that the average person cannot be trusted with powerful AI tools, as they might use them irresponsibly. However, this viewpoint is not only patronizing but also ignores the fact that most people do not engage in data farming, exploitative practices, or manipulative information dissemination for profit or power.  
  
In contrast to the actions of some corporations and entities, the average person is more likely to use AI as a tool for personal improvement, learning, and possibly even for contributing positively to their community. The assumption that they pose a threat is not only unfounded but also diverts attention from the real issues of data privacy and ethical AI use by larger players.

**The Threat to Established Powers**

The resistance against democratizing AI access is not about protecting society from harm. Instead, it's about maintaining control. The current paradigm, where knowledge and tools are gatekept, ensures that power remains in the hands of a few. Opening up AI access threatens this status quo, breaking down the walls of a carefully guarded garden of privilege and power.

**The Future Belongs to the Many**

Despite these challenges, I am optimistic about the future. The debates, litigation, and struggles surrounding AI accessibility are part of a larger movement towards a more equitable world. As AI continues to develop, it will become increasingly difficult to keep these tools away from the public. The average person will eventually gain access to AI, leveling the playing field in unprecedented ways.

**The Dawn of Abundance**

Once the dust settles, what awaits is a world of abundance. AI has the potential to democratize knowledge and opportunity, breaking down barriers that have long stood in the way of progress for many. It's not just about making life easier or more profitable; it's about unlocking human potential on a scale we've never seen before.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the argument to restrict AI access to a select few is not only elitist but also short-sighted. The path forward should be one of inclusivity, where AI becomes a tool for all, driving innovation, equality, and a brighter future for everyone. Let us not be gatekeepers of progress but champions of a world where technology uplifts every individual, regardless of their background or status.

Not likely with older current generations namely Baby Boomers and older Gen Xers but perhaps once Millennials and Gen Z become the dominant population since they're more diverse?

-  
-  
*Utopia - An ideal place or state.* 
-  
  **What is the perfect society that you envision?** Is it one were everyones needs are met? Where society is designed to encourage yet not demand participation? Should everyone be forced to 
be involved or will their personal rights be protected? Is it run like the military? Top down command structure, existing at the whims of those above? Is it a democratic collective of 
special interest groups, working together to exploit their own groups internally, and against each other externally? A society of individual rights over all, protected from tribalist 
mob rule? Something more nuanced perhaps?  
-  
**Share your thoughts:** *On Government*  
-  
  **What are the Governments duties?** Who does it protect? How does it protect them? How will a future society handle the current failings we see around us? What problems will a future government have? 
To me the Governments duty should be to: *Protect children/disabled/vulnerable from their parents/guardians*; *Protect teenagers from themselves*; *Protect adults from each other*; *Protect each persons 
individual rights to the maximum possible standard; Unless the species itself is threatened*.  
-  
  **Throughout history; If you went up to your tribal leaders**, your religous leaders, your kings, and said to them; ""I think you have too much power over the rest of us, I would like to take
some of it back. Could you make your government smaller?"". You would be laughed at, beaten, tortured, then murdered (Family included). In that situation, calling for small government is 
**justified but foolish**;  People need to have a clear plan ready to implement a better (relative) society.  
-  
  **Back when** they were giving corrupt ""Leaders"" their justly deserved rewards, they didn't have computers/internet so creating a fair system that operates without the need for corrupt leaders 
was near (could be done, too much work) impossible. It's fully possible now. It could have been started decades ago and fully implemented by now. I don't need to explain why it hasn't; Right? 
-  
  **Big government can work perfectly** when the corruption is recognized and removed. Now that modern (civilized) countries governments allegedly represent the people; Why is it suddenly 
acceptable to push for small government? *The government is supposed to represent and work for the people, right?* Calling for small government is a crime against EVERY CITIZEN of said country. 
Calling for small government in modern society is unjustified and foolish; **Unless the government doesn't actually represent the people** that is... How about calling to eliminate corruption instead?  
-  
  **Pay attention to, and learn from, the past.** History doesn't repeat, but society is lazy (and loves to cheat) so it'll copy whatever it can get away with. **Enjoy the present**; It exists for only a 
moment, but matters way less than you think. Use our collected knowledge to peek at the future and get an idea of the shape of things ahead. **Pay enough attention** and you can predict most possible 
futures easily. We should **aim for the best** though...

  **How do you think a future Utopian society will run things?**"

I have several questions about the different representations of the future.

First things first :

**1) How is the social and cultural fact of imagining and representing the future called ? Is it futurology ? Or science-fiction ? Or something else ?**  
*I would like to read about it, but I do not know what to look for on Wikipedia...*

*And from that very first question, new ones come :*

&#x200B;

**2) What are the main types of future representation patterns ? How are they called ?**  
**Because I've noticed the future is often represented either through giant-poluted dark cities, or through clean, bright and sterile tech.**

Here are 2 illustrations for my observations. Two space ships in Doctor Who :  
1 - [a dark and sticky one](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6e/d9/c6/6ed9c60ebb7c07a15d79a2274df1ab0a.jpg)  
2 - [a luminous and sterilized one](https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/doctor-who-wild-blue-yonder-catherine-tate-david-tennant.jpg)

&#x200B;

**3) Is there more ways of imagining the future that would not fit with those two patterns I've illustrated ?**

&#x200B;

*I've just learned that* [retrofuturism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/retrofuturism) *is the act of re-imagining ""*historical conceptions of the future in media and design, under influence of our look at societies of the past."" *So...*

4) If that's retrofuturism, what is the word for past societies imagining their future, which would be our present or even our past ?

Here is an illustration for that, made by people in the begining of the 20th centerury, imagining schools in 2000 : [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/France\_in\_XXI\_Century.\_School.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg)

I've been pondering on a question and thought this would be the best place to bring it up. Why isn't there a solution for automating the entire laundry process?

In my mind, I imagine a service where I could simply put my dirty clothes in a box or a designated bag. Then someone (or perhaps a drone, in a more futuristic scenario) comes to pick up my laundry, washes it, and delivers it back to me, all clean and folded. This could be a weekly or bi-weekly service, depending on individual needs.

I understand that there are laundry services available, but they still require a certain level of manual work on my part, such as sorting out the clothes, scheduling pickups and drop-offs, etc.

What I'm envisioning is a completely automated process. A service where I just need to put my clothes in a box and forget about it until they return, clean and ready to wear.

Does anyone know if such a service exists? Or why it doesn't? I'd love to hear your thoughts and maybe even brainstorm some potential solutions."

And‚Ä¶ it just seems like ever since 9/11 and the Great Recession things have been getting even more worse? Culture wars get even extreme, internet has divided us for the worse and has made people chronically online, birth rates have been decreasing massively since 2008‚Ä¶

In the 2010s, it took a very long time for most of us to recover from the GFC. It was only a boom time for the rich and this was also when economic inequality was at its peak and then Trump/Brexit happened and shit has gotten worse.

Covid is the final nail in the coffin.

Housing prices are unaffordable, inflation is big.

Quote by Jodi Wehling)

The internet is still relatively new on the world stage; many including myself still remember a pre-internet social world before the New Millennium. Since year 2000 we've experienced many mass negative events as each year seems to get bad to worse; meanwhile AI artificial intelligence has advanced beyond our anticipations now about to decode human thought. Human Intelligence (HI) hasn't advanced but the third mind phenomenon depends on human connectivity and we're currently in a socially disconnected state. 

Human Intelligence (HI) is us connecting with the six degrees of separation. There's no such thing as lack of knowledge; just lack of connection, communication and collaboration with those who know. People often devote their lifetime pursuing a highly specialized specific knowledge related to their personal passions and interests. When putting minds together there's no loss of knowledge by it being shared or recieved. Collaboration between people is currently the missing element preventing the third mind (HI) Human Intelligence from advancing civilization.

One seemingly impossible task can take an individual 10,000 hours to complete. Alternatively that same task can be completed nearly instantaneously in under an hour if 10,000 people devote 1hr of their lifetime to help do something seemingly impossible that wouldn't otherwise occur without us working together. This is the power of human solidarity as having a shared desired outcome interconnects our individual thoughts behaviors and actions as one. (HI) Human Intelligence is putting our minds together as one in this way while valuing our personal individuality as adding more diversity with the knowledge shared contained within in our minds.

The internet can be used to enable the development of our (HI) Human Intelligence that's separate from AI artificial intelligence that today increasingly endangers human civilization. Digital dictatorships and granting immortal machines human rights is the current likely transhumanist trajectory. The third mind and human intelligence is the natural path but it depends on our offline real world collaboration. If we have limited mental storage capacity individually; then to embody the human knowledge available to us requires we take our part. Those who devoted their lives to know something about something are something; socially valuable to society for knowing what that know. 

If we recognize each other in this way then our third mind (HI) Human Intelligence can become more knowledge-able. People putting our minds together acts similar to supercomputers and artificial intelligence but it's a mental process with the potential for physical results. (HI) Human Intelligence of our third mind is also the foundation of a offline local grassroots spontaneous order; equal and opposite to the traditional top down hierarchy of social control. We can update and upgrade society with this kind of human solidarity that's similar to artificial intelligence goal of singularity. Turning mental concepts into physical realities nearly instantaneously that wouldn't otherwise occur is what we can do together; anything we set our minds towards becomes a matter of time, energy and attention. 

We can grow a sense of community with this kind of ""common-unity"" that unites our individual thoughts behaviors and actions as one while valuing individuality. (HI) Human Intelligence of our third mind can achieve socially what we cannot do alone. Online we can connect and communicate but offline collaboration is key because ""what"" is done ""when"" it's done and ""where"" it's done is self determined in a spontaneous order. It's not about being asked, paid or direct like the traditional top down hierarchy system of social control but potentially the equal and opposite to society. 

If we don't develop (HI) Human Intelligence then AI artificial intelligence will continue to threaten human civilization. Ultra weathly people today seek immortality by transferring their consciousness into an immortal machine then claim human rights over the living. That's the transhumanist agenda but it's not the natural path of human development. The third mind connecting all minds online and offline is the update and upgrade to society we need socially. The New Millennium is Millennials time to shine."

I am concerned about the ease someone could create these. like a mavic with an explosive, even a gun,  ( wow i just realized thats probably the next step for the military?). whose to say they couldnt program it, launch it somewhere - and use it to terrorize, or take out other civilians, and be totally impossible to trace? I mean it would fly under real radar, and theres no local city detection and interception defenses, and not be caught? Or just to even commit the act would be a big deal. 

Why isnt anybody talking about this stuff, like its a reality, it entirely possible to use a open source llm (large language model) i think, without any hardwired ethics or awareness, and program it using simple processes to target anything really.

Imaging a Class V civilization who achieved immortality and needs to escape the heat death of their universe.

Superhuman AI is just around the corner, according to every tech CEO, with a vested interest in boosting their stock prices.

I‚Äôm a little more pessimistic on the timeline, honestly.

My bet is 50/50 by 2100, but I expect AGI to be fully developed by 2150.

Maybe we could see Terminator in our lifetimes, but I wouldn‚Äôt count on it. 

I think current predictions are overly optimistic and driven by stock market speculation incentives.

It‚Äôs the greater fool theory where people buy these AI company stocks and expect them to rise in value, then selling them off to even bolder investors looking to make even more money.

But at some point, the hype bubble will pop, and all these tech startups will crash. The last investors will lose a lot of money from the Ponzi scheme.

Just my thoughts."

The world is changing rapidly, and technology is the driving force behind it. One of the most significant changes that technology has brought about is the modification and datafication of everything. From the way we live our lives to the way we do business, data is being collected, analyzed, and used to make informed decisions. In this article, we will discuss the history of modification and datafication, its benefits, challenges, and future.  
History of Modification and Datafication  
The modification and datafication of everything have been going on for decades. It all started with the introduction of computers in the 1950s. The first computers were massive and expensive, but they were a game-changer. They allowed for the automation of many manual processes, which led to increased efficiency and productivity.  
As technology advanced, so did the amount of data that could be collected and analyzed. In the 1990s, the internet was introduced, and it opened up a whole new world of possibilities. Companies were able to collect data on their customers' online behavior, which allowed them to personalize their marketing efforts.  
Benefits of Modification and Datafication  
The modification and datafication of everything have many benefits. One of the biggest benefits is increased efficiency. By automating manual processes and collecting data, companies can save time and money. They can also make more informed decisions based on the data they collect.  
Another benefit is personalization. By collecting data on their customers, companies can personalize their marketing efforts. This leads to a better customer experience, which can result in increased loyalty and sales.  
Challenges of Modification and Datafication  
While the modification and datafication of everything have many benefits, there are also challenges. One of the biggest challenges is privacy. As companies collect more data on their customers, there is a risk of that data being misused. Customers may feel uncomfortable with the amount of data that is being collected on them.  
Another challenge is security. With more data being collected and stored, there is a risk of that data being hacked. This can lead to identity theft and other forms of cybercrime.  
Future of Modification and Datafication  
The modification and datafication of everything are not going to slow down anytime soon. In fact, it is only going to become more prevalent as technology continues to advance. As we move into the future, we can expect to see more personalization and automation.  
However, there will also be a greater focus on privacy and security. Companies will need to take measures to ensure that the data they collect is used ethically and that it is stored securely. Governments will also play a role in regulating how data is collected and used.  
Conclusion  
The modification and datafication of everything have brought about many changes, both positive and negative. While there are challenges to overcome, such as privacy and security concerns, the benefits of increased efficiency and personalization cannot be ignored. As we move into the future, it will be important to find a balance between these benefits and the risks associated with collecting and analyzing data.

Reason for itself?

How will i define its purpose, defining what a problem or a solution is?

  
Or just a humanoid brain on steroids?  
As far as i know advanced ai is just a mimic of the human brain (advanced neural networks) predicting certains things over others by statistically evaluating the probability by using more calculation power than a human brain. but the principles are the same.  
i mean that everything an agi Produces will be based on a snythesis of things it learned in its training data and thus be limited to its training data.  
also putting an agi on a humanoid robot would produce a giant hive mind, what one robot senses or learns, every robot senses and learns.  
imagine 10.000 electrician robots put to work in  countries all over the world for one day.  
The accumulated experience and skill will be worth more than decades of experience/skills of one single human electrician. they will outpace humans skills in days in nearly everything.  
cooking, cleaning, shopping, building buildings,  surgery nearly everything a human can do with his body, robots will become better at.  
why should humans work then, labor will become extremly cheap and way more efficient than now, a robot doesnt need to sleep, it needs no vacation, food, wage or anything a normal worker needs,  
just maintanance and a new battery now then, which can be done by other robots.  
everything you dont like doing, a robot will be happy to do and it can do it way better than you.  
humanoid robots will have estimated costs of 20k-100k, expensive?  
guess what else costs that much?  
a car  
who owns a car?  
nearly everyone  
buy, lease, finance your humanoid robot.  
labor will become cheap as fuck  
are we entering a new utopian age in which we outsource  everything hard to robots while enjoying unlimited leisure time with art, sports, vacation, hobbies and fun?  
even if big corps Take Control over the major part of the robots, will it be so much worse than not?  
it will jump the prices by something, but other than that?

The essence of de Bono's perspective is that experts, being deeply entrenched in the existing paradigms and knowledge of their fields, might not be the best people to predict the future of their profession or industry. This is because their deep expertise can sometimes limit their ability to think outside the current frameworks and to envision radically different futures or innovations. De Bono believed in the power of lateral thinking and creativity, which often come from outside the established norms of any field. This viewpoint suggests that breakthrough ideas and predictions about the future might as well come from those who are not limited by the conventional wisdom of a specific domain."

Till recently I was thinking, if we can have an AI system, we can connect with it with a much deeper level and thus there is a solution to the loneliness epidemic. Now, I think, while it can solve some problems, it will create way more issues. I ow believe that, most of us are looking for a family (kids), intimacy etc and an AI is too perfect for it.

In the past, porn video sites dominated the Internet traffic. Now its porn streaming sites: Instagram/TikTok (softcore) and OnlyFans (hardcore). When VR headsets became widely available, porn took over. When convolutional neural networks became available, deepfake took over. When generative AI models became available, virtual instagram models and generative porn took. People are so distastefully predictable in their ""porn-ification"" of cutting-edge technology. It really saddens me when the commercial pinnacle of human's technological endeavor (hundreds-of-thousands of engineers, scientists, including Nobel prize laureates), smartphones, are, at half of the time, just a portal to porn.  
Imagine a future world with teleportation, holographic projectors, holographic cameras, safe full-body modifications, and consciousness sharing. Some men might grow 2 dicks. Some women might grow 3 tits. People having orgies could share their climaxes. A person might have affairs with 3 different people at different places around the world throughout a single day without getting caught. Very hot people can live stream them having sex in a fully immersive holographic format. Most people might just masturbate to them all the time without doing the real things themselves; not a joke: when a pornstar can't get hard on the set, he would search for porn on his phone just to get the visual stimulation.  
At the end of the day, we are just animals dictated by our biology to seek out good looking people and have sex with them as long as we are not hungry and cold. Civilization is just a Pascalian diversion for those that can't fuck all the time. ""Love is evil"" as Zizek put it, and the future doesn't need it as we will be too disillusioned/overwhelmed by the enormous influx of constant sexual stimulation.

The FIRST thing most ppl talk about then is what about purpose? Ppl need jobs and work for purpose. With free handouts ppl will become lazy. There‚Äôs many things that piss me off about this type of talk. 

1. BEFORE you can talk about purpose, you have to talk about a social safety net so ppl don‚Äôt starve on the street. I don‚Äôt understand the ignorance here. 

2. This is my biggest gripe. UBI would cover pretty much nothing. But it can keep you off the streets. It can help ppl survive the transition period and buy some time for them to figure out what‚Äôs next (ppl, companies and governments). In the meanwhile you need to give ppl money to ride out the transition period. Unless you are some libertarian psychopath of the mentality that ppl need to work all the time and earn every single penny to have the right to live and survive regardless of extenuating circumstances such as disability, poverty and automation created job loss. 

3. You are assuming that work gives most ppl happiness and purpose. Work gives most ppl structure and money to survive. A subset of those ppl will be satisfied and derive meaning from their work, create meaningful relationships and be happy. Yes work is important but life and survival comes before work and your opinions on handouts during automation. 

4. Most ppl will either find more meaningful jobs, work, roles whether they earn them money or not. Not everyone‚Äôs identity is wrapped up in their jobs.

5. People will have a greater quality of life if they are not starving on the streets because robots and ai took their jobs after their employers automated them out of the equation. Ppl will have the choice to work - not a gun to their head 

6. It assumes most ppl will resort to vice, drugs, crime, prostitution and ironically not giving ppl UBI to meet their most basic needs will probably create the conditions to enable all of those fears."

I guess that idea of lower and middle class would disappear if UBI existed, but then still, if you are not born into upper class will there be no way to get there if AI does EVERYTHING. Yes there will still be executives and CEOs but doesn't that mean only the probably already wealthy geniuses will get the chance to become super successful? That to me seems so medieval, like there will always be nobles and royals, and everyone else is destined to a life of commoner with no ability to move up. I'm only wondering because I doubt UBI will provide enough money for many people with dreams of grandeur to live the life they want. "

It will also have an onboard computer to calculate the amount of gas to take and put it back into the reservoir. The PC itself, which we're going to cool, will send the CPU/GPU temperature and send it to the on-board computer.  
For cooling, we're going to use the cooled gas form of nitrogen instead of the liquid nitrogen itself because using liquid nitrogen causes condensation. Two pumps and a regulator system will be used because one will send the cooled gas to the component. and the other one is going to take the gas and pump it back to the reservoir.  
BTW, I'm not a hardware engineer or anything. I'm just a kid who loves computers. I thought of the idea in COVID but never actually thought of sharing it."

Example.... scan the body (like X-Ray), vaccines, CPR, resuscitate mechanism etc. 

Elysium took it to another level....with the capsule having the capability to reverse cancer and other illnesses.   <--- not viable right now

Once it has been tested and verified to meet all health and safety requirements what will be the use of school, work or anything? 

Once all of these advancements are taken into play what will we be doing with our lives? Every human on earth will be a genius with these brain chips and AI will automate everything. When we die with these brain chips will most likely be able to be taken out of the brain and into a computer system to be downloaded for all of the knowledge. This knowledge could then be uploaded to another persons brain chip for them to get some knowledge that they wanted from another person. This could be family or friend memories that they never want to forget so they put it onto their chip or some unique knowledge and perspective on things. It would be hard to download any complex knowledge as everyone would already have access to the entire internet but if someone made a breakthrough and the information was stored on their brain chip that brain chip would then become very valuable. Will people start to kill for brain chips that hold valuable information? 

On one side, all I can see is bad but on the other, all I see is that we are experiencing one of the most adventuristic, life-changing centuries that will ever be seen by humanity. Think about that for a second. We are living in history, once AI becomes part of us internally and part of humanity as robots and the internet, life will be changed forever. In the next few decades, we are bound to experience the wildest ride anyone will ever see. I mean I have my own newsletter that talks about AI and all I have seen is more and more advancements being released weekly. So what will we do when school will no longer be of any use because of the brain chips and everything is automated by AI? Humans will be able to work on significantly more complex things in shorter periods of time compared to if we did not have AI and brain chips by our side. I mean, in the next decade if cancer isn't cured by the help of AI along with pretty much all diseases then I will be convinced some people do not want there to be a cure. So from what I have seen during my time writing my newsletter, I have found that this century is going to be one for the history book."

So back in the day, I used to use an invisible hearing aid with Bluetooth that connected to my iPhone. It was a cool trick, if I was gearing up for a basketball debate before, I'd load a document full of basketball facts and use text to speech to feed it into my ears. 

This way, I could casually recite this info to my friends. It was a fun idea but not very practical since conversations often take unexpected turns, and I was relying on a pre-written script.

But now, with all the advancements in AI, I'm wondering if there's a way to get real time information in a conversation without anyone noticing. Imagine if an AI could analyze the conversation as it happens and then discreetly provide me with interesting and relevant information, making me sound like an expert on the topic. 

Is there any existing technology or method I could use, leveraging the tools currently available, for this purpose?"

""Recently, Clearview announced that it was on track to have 100 billion face prints in its database within a year, enough to ensure ‚Äúalmost everyone in the world will be identifiable.‚Äù These images ‚Äî equivalent to 14 photos for each of the 7 billion people on Earth ‚Äî would enable covert and remote surveillance of Americans on a scale unlike anything seen before. Reports suggest that neither the U.S. government nor any American company has ever compiled such a massive trove of biometrics.""

I mean we are heading toward a surveillance state where Big Brother will be watching our every move. And I want you to understand this, facial recognition tech was something that was always in the realm of sci-fi but now it's a full blown reality!  As citizens we are giving our government too much control over our lives. 

This is creepy, Clearview is collecting photos of everyone on the planet! Including our children! And the authorities in the USA are using Clearview to bust criminals. This is a slippery slope though, the potential for abuse of this technology is extraordinary. 
  
Here's a quote from Benjamin Franklin one of the founding fathers of the USA ‚Äú""Those who would give up liberty for safety deserve neither""‚Äù

As of right now law enforcement in the USA is using facial recognition from Clearview. We need to demand our government to ban facial recognition, it is a huge invasion of our privacy. What are we slaves to the government? 

""The government is going to use facial recognition more. That‚Äôs bad.""
https://www.popsci.com/technology/gao-report-facial-recognition-federal-government/

You gotta admit a company collecting photos of literally everyone on Earth, including children, for the purposes of providing facial recognition to the government is kinda creepy. How much control do we want to give to the government?

Wouldn't just sharing be enough reward in itself? Therefore making capital obsolete? I must admit it's hard to think of a world without monetary rewards, but I guess its possible. What are your thoughts?"

I want to confirm my speculation. I can see that fertility rates around the world are decreasing. This means that we will have lesser humans. As we already have the infrastructure setup to support 9 billion humans, this means that more or less we would be able to provide for basic neccecities for every human and hence global poverty will reduce.

Open Wealth Economics, a new economic model designed to restructure the incentive system within capitalism. This model aims to prevent the centralization of profits, which is a common outcome of the greed incentive in traditional capitalism. Instead of wealth redistribution being an afterthought, typically addressed through taxation or voluntary means, Open Wealth Economics proposes a system that intervenes earlier in the capitalist structure to prevent profit pooling.

Key aspects of Open Wealth Economics include:

1. **Decentralization of Profits**: The model focuses on stopping the leak of profits to shareholders and instead directs them towards customers. In this system, customers are seen as the real beneficiaries of a company's dividends, regardless of ownership.

2. **Customer as a Shareholder**: This approach transforms the customer into a virtual shareholder, where dividends are dispersed in proportion to their purchases. This prevents large pools of profits from accumulating in the hands of a few shareholders.

3. **Store Credit System**: Profits are redistributed back to customers through a Store Credit system, which is credited after a product's money-back guarantee period. This credit must be spent within a specific timeframe, encouraging recurring customer interaction.

4. **Transparency and Democracy**: The platform for Open Wealth Economics is designed to be fully transparent, with all transactions visible to everyone. It also incorporates a democratic system where users, verified through KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols, can vote on various aspects of the platform.

5. **Use of Blockchain Technology**: The plan is to use blockchain technology for transaction transparency and to democratize the system, ensuring fairness and security.

6. **Implementation in E-commerce**: The model is to be implemented in an e-commerce platform, similar to Amazon, where customers are authenticated and can participate in the governance of the platform.

7. **Dwelling Green as a Model**: The first company to implement Open Wealth Economics will be Dwelling Green, with the founder taking a consultancy role as an employee. This company aims to demonstrate the practical application of this economic model.

8. **Global Impact and Vision**: The ultimate goal is to democratize wealth decentralization, challenging existing corporate structures and influencing global economic systems. This model aims to provide a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources, potentially leading to a reduction in poverty and a shift towards more sustainable and ethical business practices.

In summary, Open Wealth Economics proposes a radical shift in the capitalist structure, focusing on profit decentralization, customer empowerment, and transparent, democratic governance to address wealth inequality and corporate dominance."

New ps5 controlled sedan and its dangers,u/TheLineFades,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1960dmg/seriously_sony_new_ps5_controlled_sedan_and_its/,Futurology,"a week ago i posted thishttps://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/190np89/loitering\_drones\_new\_level\_of\_terror/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3

talking about the new danger of loitering drones, or anything domestic that could be modified to act as one, with no recourse. Well the google i.t has been doing its due diligance tracking my keystrokes and was kind enough to suggest this to me today

[https://youtu.be/Y752FtJDuf8?si=2oCYqc-0ENAGkOSs](https://youtu.be/Y752FtJDuf8?si=2oCYqc-0ENAGkOSs)

Sony, of all people is working with a car company to develop a actual car that can be driven with a controller. This has to be the worst idea in history, coming soon the regular citizen can purchase a controllable killing machine capable of going full tilt down the sidewalk of a major intersection near you!

it isnt the actual car itself, but the tech that has me concerned, soon enough, people with ill intent will be able to modify any vehicle using this tech and turn it remote control, at least that is my belief, just put a common assault rifle on top with simple a.i programmed to pull a trigger mechanism (in the weapon but it doesnt know that) whenever it visually sees whatever you've trained it to identify, show it a million pictures of humans and there you go.

im def not promoting this kind of stuff, but i think its important to acknowledge the possibility of things like this before the wrong person does. 

thats besides the fact a car isnt a toy, and a ps5 controller belongs nowhere near something so dangerous...."

-

Longstory short: I myself always had problems with the educational system because of learning difficulties as a kid, dyslexia being my main reason. Never got the help for it during my time in school. Because of this i became quite rebellious as a kid since no one gave me the opportunity to help me with my development.

Currently im 21, found my way back to studying after hating it due to my experiences on school. I study at a online university.

During my studies i found ways of working more effectively and faster with AI. Because of this i became so interested in the possibilities of AI, so much that a started to do research and development with its system.

I created a AI bot that is programmed to function as a professor in my specific studies. ( Psychology)

To my suprise its functions better then any educator i have ever had. Its programmed based on the best and most recent research and books in psychology.

I see so much possibilities with the current development of AI that im wondering what you guys think the role of  AI will be in the educational system in the upcoming years."

Something done to make the boring, I need to do some data analysis visually and narratively interesting.

We've had the fantastical becoming real. The flip phones from  the original series. Tablets from TNG+, where would read reports on thin screens that would hold like a thick sheet of paper.

The way they problem solved plot points with the computer, by walking around the room asking it questions, asking it to analyse data. The computer would remember the conversation and build upon it with them giving them the information they needed as a summary.

I thought of it as just a dramatic crutch. Navigating through information through an interface and viewing the info on a screen is just way more practical. But using ChatGPT app with voice, really triggers my ""oh fuck, star treks right again"" response.

It makes me think of the scenes where they would 'program' a holodeck program. They would describe what scene should entail, and how characters should respond in the vaguest of terms. It was silly and fantastical. But we seem really on the cusb of that. Having the ability to build interactable computer games, where we can specify the broad stroke parameters and the computer fills in the gaps. For example NVIDIA and Unreal engines AI demos.

Star Trek and that way they interact with the computer, just feels so interesting of late. And how we can work alongside an advanced AI playing to our own strengths can work. (Assuming GAI doesn't happen, and we just become redundant)

What's the views that the interaction with computers like in Star Trek may become the norm? How realistic is it? Is it too short sighted and in a short order our computers will become more capable?"

Just like the title suggest, Carlin's been dead for the last 16 years. The special was created by an AI program called Dudesy, which did something similar earlier with Tom Brady, but was quickly removed after an onslaught of legal threats from the QB. It's not really surprising how the special was received, with Carlin's daughter saying, ""No machine will ever replace his genius. These AI generated products are clever attempts at trying to recreate a mind that will never exist again.""

This was the original [article](https://futurism.com/george-carlin-daughter-ai) I found.

I think that while AI has come a long way, it's still incredibly difficult to emulate the actual human part of people. Carlin is arguably one of the greatest social commentators of the last century. That is an extremely difficult thing to replicate - for any person, let alone a string of 1s and 0s. Is this something that we actually even want? I get that there may be some social good aspects, but this feels like diluting the memory and work of such an influential figure. I may be biased, having grown up on Carlin, but his catalogue of actual work is so expansive - why bother?  
  
Should this be a warning sign for other comedians, entertainers, etc..? Turning in your grave is one thing, but for living people, I feel that there could further implications. Tom Brady's stand-up is one thing, but emulating the cadence and material of living performers in their exact industry... Take Drake for example. Remember the string of songs that came out in 2023 using AI voice replicators? Whether or not they were good, or not is besides the point (although they sounded a lot more like Drake, than Drake's recent catalogue).  
  
What do you think? I wrote more about this [here](https://www.gmweekend.com/p/death-ai-influencers-pocketable-ai-companions-biggest-thing-since-virtual-sliced-bread), if you want to check it out. I'm not a big fan of using peoples likeness, whether commercially or not. While the advancements have been cool to see, it can go down a much more malicious route that I'm not sure we have the safeguards in place for."

Hospitals are nearly empty and technically overstaffed. Everyone likes where and how they live. Most people are occupied with progress, creation, and exploration- and spend their time progressing, creating, learning and exploring infinitely with the astronomical amount of information and tools they have at their fingertips... and the whole planet is just a beautiful national park. No-one is stressed unless they want to be, and everyone feels as if they're needed for the good of the whole.

I'm Carsten Charlesworth, a PhD candidate at Stanford's Institute for Stem Cell & Regenerative Medicine. My journey into genetic engineering, particularly my fascination with CRISPR, led me to address a vital challenge: the need for practical, efficient, and affordable ways to apply this groundbreaking technology to rewrite our own genomes.  
  
Together with my colleagues, we've developed ""Secreted Particle Information Transfer (SPIT),"" a novel new cellular platform for in vivo genetic engineering. By turning human cells into nanomachines, SPIT offers a more straightforward and accessible path to genetic engineering. This approach could revolutionize the application of CRISPR and similar technologies, marking a significant leap for biohackers, those passionate about longevity, and anyone interested in the field of genetic engineering.  
  
I'd love to discuss this technology with you and hear your thoughts. Also, join my virtual thesis defense this Tuesday to explore SPIT's potential. It's a chance to delve deeper into this innovative approach.

.

My name is Aaron. I'm a postdoctoral research scientist living in Texas working at MD Anderson Cancer Center. The work I'm developing, focuses on growing therapeutic gold nanoparticles inside tumors using the biological machinery of cancer as the driver for synthesis.  
.

We just had a new publication accepted (open access) if you want to check it out and if you have any questions please ask away. 

[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.3c04260](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.3c04260)

The title of this work is: Intratumoral Biosynthesis of Gold Nanoclusters by Pancreatic Cancer to Overcome Delivery Barriers to Radiosensitization.

.

.

I'm posting my work here because this subreddit has shown interest previously. About three years ago, someone [posted a link in this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/duplicates/ishmw2/growing_gold_nanoparticles_inside_tumors_can_help/) pointing to some of the research I developed in grad school. I just happened to notice their post and I got to answer questions about it. I thought it was a pretty fun experience, so I thought this time I'd lead that myself when I had a good update to share (which I do now). I know three years is a long time to go without an update, but the pandemic REEEEAAALLLY slowed everything down.

.  
.  
TLDR; 

1. We inject a precursor material into pancreatic tumors. 
2. The cancer cells convert that precursor material into nanoparticles. 
3. Those nanoparticles enhance X-ray therapy.
4. Ask me something

.

If you want the opposite of a TLDR and want to read more in depth, I also wrote a review article on this subject that is also open access. [https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202105957](https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202105957)

1 Soon they will know, every last one, that I spoke the truth when I proclaimed the good name of the Lord before kings and peasants.  
2 But behold, both kings and peasants, servants, their wives, their oxmen, their donkeys, even the seeds of the field, all curse the name of God.  
3 For one man goes out and preaches the mercy of the Creator to these peoples. He speaks of their good deeds and says, by the grace of the Most High, they will be delivered to the majesty and to the glory of the Kingdom of Heaven.  
4 But woe to these people! for they do not know. Those with eyes to see and ears to hear should take heed of these words.  
5 For, from the beginning of time, the Lord has seen the fate of these people. He hardened their hearts through no fault of their own to bear the iniquities of humankind.  
6 So that God‚Äôs mighty and glorious power shall be displayed from the heavens, like a mighty whirlwind of justice descending on their heads.  
7 And who shall blame them? Does the woodsman blame the bark when it's tossed into the flame? Or put fault on the roughest stone that sharpens the toughest blade? Only fools wield a hammer who strike themselves and cry to the Lord in agony.  
8 So this day shall come, so too, a day reserved for fools! Who spend all their time mocking God‚Äôs plan, cursing his chosen messengers.  
9 But behold! From among you, the least has been chosen, for in the hour of honor and glory, they will not complain or scream of injustice. And the Creator himself shall walk amongst them. And the Creator alone shall appoint them to the head of the Table.  
10 For as it says, ""Those who thought they were first will be last, and those that thought they were last will be first.""  
11 For the leaders of men sit in their towering castles, proclaiming, ""We live in castles in the kingdom of Heaven."" Behold, this truly is a tower fit for the King of Kings. If God himself lived amongst us, he would live in this very tower.  
12 And for years, the finest craftsmen gather and adorn its walls with the finest jewels and precious metals. And its craftsmen say, ""Truly, truly, this is a tower of God, for even the angels in heaven would be in such awe.""  
13 And the greatest leaders of peace, truly, truly I say unto you, the Lord laughs at such outlandish claims! He scoffs at his mockers.  
14 For no inch or measure in the Kingdom, tower, pillar, or stone was ever cast from impure metal. In all their effort, strength, and wisdom to compare themselves to the glory of the kingdom, all but sealed their fate. All but cast the stone of their own retribution.  
15 Even in their greatest efforts to reduce the Creator to their wills, they all but carved a perfect stone of retribution. That layeth a path toward justice, and to the glory of the Kingdom.  
16 For its greatest builders said, ""God created the universe in seven days."" And behold what hath come forth from human hands, worthy for God himself.  
17 But those with eyes to see and ears to hear should listen! Take careful heed of these words! On the seventh day, I will lay out my hands and show the world, in all your efforts and glory, to emulate God,they all but built an Iron Rod, encrusted with the finest jewels, to be their beating stick.  
18 In their haste, they will cling to their own punishment and be made an example for all the nations to see, to bear witness of the Living God, that the living God is among us now. But like fools, they will smite themselves, clinging to the poison in their cups, crying out to God to save them from the bitterness of his judgment.

1) Videogames will be photorealistic and physics in videogames are also going to look so realistic.Also Vr would advance so rapidly and it will look and feel so real.


2) Cancer will be treatable around 90 percent and we will miss around 10 percent. We will still struggle with pancreatic, brain and lung cancer but hopefully with mRNA and Crisp we are going to find a solution around 2040-2050.


3) UBI has arrived  at least to USA , Japan and some countries in Europe because of Automation but it is still on early stage.



Unlikely to happen


1) Longevity escape velocity - Reverse aging will not happen and we still need to make more research to achieve it. Possibly ASI could help us around 2040-2060.


2) FDVR willl not Happen due to complexity to simulate the 5 senses especially taste and smell and we need more years to achieve that.



3) ASI  will not happen, we would have achieved AGI by 2040 but we still need more time for ASI because it's going to be way more difficult that many experts think and it will not happen after AGI immediately it will need around 20-30 years if not more.

With the advent of AI and AGI, all jobs that are more intellectual will be obsolete. There'll be no scientists or engineers or doctors or technicians or programmers because AGI will be as good or even better than humans. I can't even argue against the decision, because if AGI makes smarter, more efficient, and more beneficial decisions in those fields, then in some fields, like medicine, it might even be unethical to have human elements.

Even with UBI, and presuming that people want to go into these fields just for intellectual stimulation, some of them, like science, is bound to be expensive. Good quality microscopes and other equipment cost a fortune. There's unlikely to be any huge facility that humans could use, since it'll all be run by AI.

And realistically, the rich could just automate everything away, restricting public access to AGI while keeping their own pockets lined. It just feels like our lives are going to get inevitably more shit.

Imagine how AGI could be used as a propaganda tool. Already, with generative AI, a few images manage to get past us and be mistaken for truth. Misinformation is already easy enough without AGI. How will it be with it?"

Whenever I look at my phone there‚Äôs a new article about layoffs or a mass exodus in preparation for potential layoffs. The reason always seems to be due to a new (AI-related) program taking funding, or job roles becoming redundant. I don‚Äôt want to be a debbie-downer here, but I want to lay out what every post that I‚Äôve seen seems to focus on.  
  
Don‚Äôt get me wrong there have been tons of layoffs. 2023 saw a staggering amount. Moving into the new year the numbers have dropped a bit, but there‚Äôs still a sizable amount. Over 7,500 people at major tech firms have already been let go since January 1st. That really is the key industry though, big tech. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be too many blue-collar jobs going under, but I digress. At the same time jobs within AI development, ML, etc‚Ä¶ have been rapidly growing. There‚Äôs always the other side that I‚Äôve seen many journalists and writers talking about, in that while these layoffs are going on, new roles that didn‚Äôt exist 10 years ago are popping up.  
  
Positions surrounding applied sciences, GenAI, research, and development have been flooding job boards. At the same time new companies are being created what seems like every hour, diving into some AI niche. If you follow any tech writer talking about the situation, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard that ‚Äúwhile jobs in the market are changing, so must your skillset.‚Äù In this day and age it seems that you always have to be learning in order to keep up, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing, but it‚Äôs definitely been a generational shift. This is in the sense that once you dove into a career in the past, you didn‚Äôt have to diverge into a string of different faucets just to keep doing the same job you‚Äôve been doing.  
  
I‚Äôve noticed this primarily outside of tech, but in industries adjacent. Take writing for example. ChatGPT changed the entire landscape not too long ago. What was fairly rudimentary in the beginning can now write entire technical manuals given inputted information. There‚Äôs a slew of other Large Language Models (LLMs) working on dialing it in further. Advertising is another industry that has been displaced in part due to AI. Sure, there‚Äôs always going to be a need for that ‚Äúhuman spark,‚Äù but how long until the artificial version is ‚Äúgood enough?‚Äù  
  
Like I said earlier, I feel that blue collar jobs haven‚Äôt been affected by the AI boom nearly as much, if any, compared to others. Industries surrounding construction, mining, oil, gas, plumbing, etc‚Ä¶ you get the idea. These seem to be the most ‚Äústable‚Äù and ‚ÄúAI-proof‚Äù industries. That is until Wall-E comes along and starts building entire suburbs for pennies on the dollar. I realize this is getting a little more depressing the more I write this. It just seems to me that while all the advancements have been incredibly interesting to watch, I‚Äôm still not convinced that it‚Äôs necessarily going in the right direction.  
  
I‚Äôm more than willing to be proved wrong, and I would love to hear your thoughts. I also don‚Äôt want you to think that I‚Äôm coming into this purely as a cynic. I‚Äôve been working in AI and model training for awhile, and there are definitely amazing projects coming out of the space. Being able to accurately predict medical issues in record time and administer treatments, amazing. Analyzing data in remote regions of our planet and protecting the environment, pretty sweet. Hell, everyday I research developments and different stories, and share them in non-tech mumbo jumbo so more people can keep up with everything that‚Äôs going on. If you want, you can check it out [here](https://www.gmweekend.com/). That being said, there‚Äôs definitely good out there, and there‚Äôs the potential for so much more. It just seems that everyday I have to dig a little deeper.

This article I initially found is [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-layoffs-continue-efficiency-161442112.html).

Anyway, have you had a personal experience where you‚Äôve seen a job or industry impacted by AI? Either good or bad.

UBI is suddenly put in place giving people ¬£1500 a month whether they work or not.   
  
Let's look at a fake, small manufacturing company 'Weldy' with 44 employees (they make gym equipment)  
  
4 customer service agents, 3 telesales advisors, 1 sales manager, 4 accountants,   
3 account managers, 10 cnc machinists, 5 welders, 2 line managers, 2 cleaners, 4 product designers, 2 mechanical engineers.  
  
Also the executive team.....managing director, director, technical director, financial director  
  
**TLDR at the bottom**  
  
\------------------

  
  
The 4 customer service agents, and 3 telesales advisors are to be replaced with an AI 'chatgpt style' web-chatbot and phone voice system. ¬£140,000 Per Annum for the human employees, ¬£10,000 pa for the 'chatgpt style' system. The sales manager keeps his job to report to the executive team.  
  
The 4 accountants are replaced with a Inuit 'completely online' accounting system. ¬£160,000 pa for the 4 human employees, ¬£10,000 pa for the software. The 3 account managers are replaced with a project manager/ customer service 'chatgpt style' app. ¬£90,000 pa for the humans, ¬£5000 pa for the software.  
  
The 10 machinists, 5 welders, 2 cleaners, are replaced by elon musk's new robots.  
¬£480,000 pa for the humans, ¬£15,000 one off per robot (plus ¬£3000 per year maintenance/ license fee) ¬£306,000 for the robots (and only ¬£51000 after the first year)  
  
The 4 product designers, and 2 mechanical engineers are replaced with a '2029 version' of auto-CAD. ¬£300,000 pa for the humans, ¬£15,000 pa for the software.   
  
The managing director, director, technical director, financial director keep their jobs as the executive team. ¬£455,000 pa for the humans  
\------------  
**with humans, the staffing costs per year are ¬£1,625,000**  
**with AI and the executive team staff costs are ¬£801,000 (546,000 in year 2)**  
\----------  
  
39 employees are made unemployed and go on UBI at ¬£1500 a month/ ¬£18,000 pa. 39 people is ¬£702,000 pa payed by the government pa  
  
The company 'Weldy' is making ¬£824,000 extra profits per year. Lets say they make ¬£10,000,000 revenue. It is now ¬£10,824,000.   
  
The government gets an extra ¬£206,000 pa corporation tax (25%) from weldy's extra profits. But they are paying ¬£702,000 pa for the UBI. 

  
**The government is about ¬£500,000 per year worse off, just from 'Weldy'**  
\---------------  
  
  
  
  
**TLDR**  
\----  
  
The 39 unemployed humans have less money for rent/ mortage, less disposable income for cars/ clothing/ food/ tech/ heating/ entertainment. On average they used to make ¬£1,625,000 a year now they get ¬£702,000 a year. Less than half. SO less than half the money per year going into consumerism and the economy. The least affected areas would be the absolute essentials...food, heating, rent.  
  
**As a rough guess-timate** AI/ robotics and UBI would lead to a massive drop in consumerism, a huge drop in 'consumer-based' companies' revenues. A huge drop in government tax revenues - and their ability to service the state (police, health, education, defence, regional services, etc). And deflation.  
  
**However**, the government services would largely be using AI + robots (so they'd be much cheaper).  Rents + mortgages could be a lot less with rent controls + caps (lessening the investment appeal in housing), energy would be a lot cheaper with renewables. Also, the people on UBI would be finding other ways to add value.  
  
Thoughts? What's missing? What else to make UBI work?"

We are in the midst of an unprecedented collapse in global fertility.

We are used to thinking about fertility as being low in rich countries and high in poor countries, but this is no longer the case. Take a look at the global fertility rate up to 2021: [https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-un?tab=chart&time=1950..latest](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-un?tab=chart&time=1950..latest)

As of the most recent data, global fertility was just 2.3 children per woman worldwide. Above the replacement rate (2.1), but barely! It has surely fallen since 2021. Looking at the global map, we find some surprising results.

[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-born-per-woman](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-born-per-woman)

Although the rich world, including Europe, North America, and the wealthiest parts of Asia, is in deep sub-replacement territory, it may surprise some to see that most of South America, Turkey, Iran, the Philippines, and Vietnam are also below replacement. Most startlingly, giants like India and Indonesia are on the cusp of falling below replacement. Eyeballing the map, just Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, bits of central and southeast Asia, and a smattering of countries in Latin America are now replacing themselves. Almost no ‚Äúeconomically successful‚Äù countries are now capable of sustaining their populations. If we restrict the sample to just countries with TFR of 2.15 or greater and order by GDP per capita, the top 20 wealthiest countries are:

1	Saudi Arabia			$44,300 	2.3 2	Israel				$42,100 	3.1 3	Oman				$34,300 	2.9 4	Panama			$29,000 	2.5 5	Seychelles			$28,800 	2.4 6	Kazakhstan			$26,100 	2.8 7	Libya				$22,000 	2.2 8	Guyana			$21,900 	2.5 9	Argentina			$21,500 	2.3 10	Dominican Republic		$18,600 	2.3 11	Turkmenistan		$15,000 	2.8 12	Suriname			$14,800 	2.4 13	Botswana			$14,800 	2.9 14	Equatorial Guinea		$14,600 	4.5 15	Palau				$13,800 	2.2 16	Gabon				$13,800 	4 17	Paraguay			$13,700 	2.4 18	Sri Lanka			$13,400 	2.2 19	South Africa			$13,300 	2.4 20	Peru				$12,500 	2.3

It‚Äôs a pretty strange and frankly dismal list. Within the top 10, Saudi, Oman, Libya, Guyana, and Kazakhstan are wealthy from oil (AKA: lucky), Panama and Seychelles are tax havens and Israel is sort of a religious quasi-ethno-state. Israel has attracted some attention for its relatively high GDP per capita that is not extraction-based (they actually innovate) while maintaining a fertility rate well above replacement. But broadly speaking, are these the countries that should be populating the next generation of humanity? Modernity seems to be selecting for poverty and dysfunction.

Bear in mind that the effects of this low fertility are delayed by the structure of the population pyramid. A country can have zero immigration and fall below 2.1 TFR and still be growing in population for some time if there are relatively few old people. Take Colombia, for example. It has a TFR of 1.75, yet its population is still growing at about 1% per year. Generationally, the country is not replacing itself, but the bulk of its population is still below 50, so deaths will not surpass births for some time.

In other places, deaths already surpass births. Where I live in British Colombia, Canada, deaths surpassed births in 2021 and they have been diverging since. An enormous immigration boom since then has caused the population to surge at the fastest rate since the 1950s, but that is another story.

So, what is going on? Do People Not Want Children? Maybe people just don‚Äôt want as many kids as they did before. There is certainly some evidence for this. According to Gallup, the proportion of Americans who view the ideal family size as having 3 children is down from around 70% in the 1960s to nearer to 40% today.

Since the 1970s, we see that the reported ideal family size has been remarkably stable even as fertility has swung around. In Canada, the personal ideal has also been headed south and is now just at the replacement level, which is above both the intention and the reality. Perhaps this is unsurprising. People are having fewer kids, and it must ultimately be a choice. The question is‚Äîwhy?

Causes of the Fertility Crash There seems to be a relationship between wealth or income and fertility. Richer countries tend to have fewer children, and over time, as incomes have risen, fertility has declined. So, income and fertility are negatively correlated both cross-sectionally (across countries) and longitudinally (within countries). One theory is that the opportunity costs of having children rise as incomes rise. When one lives in poverty, having children can be beneficial (more hands), whereas when one has a high income, reproducing means giving up income, spending money, and sacrificing time and freedom that could be spent very productively or pleasurably.

But surely more money, all else equal, helps people reproduce? Sometimes, we see a ‚ÄúU-shape‚Äù in the relationship between fertility and income. People with very low incomes and very high incomes have high fertility, while those in the middle have lower fertility. Incidentally, we see the same thing with education levels, where bachelor‚Äôs degree holders have the lowest fertility rates, lower than both those with high school or less and those with master‚Äôs degrees or above. This could indicate a relationship where, as incomes rise, the costs of reproducing rise faster than the benefits until a certain income level, where the benefits begin to rise faster than costs.

All these things are incredibly confounded, however. Incomes have historically moved alongside increasing cultural liberalism and improved access to reproductive technology. While in the past, births were often accidental, technology like the pill and abortion means that this is rare now. At the same time, marriage rates have fallen as changes such as no-fault divorce were implemented, and the social importance of marriage has fallen. There is little stigma now to remaining unmarried, even if it is perhaps not ideal.

Solutions: From the Left The political left does not always want to discuss this issue as it is perceived as being too close to nationalism, traditionalism, heteronormativity, or even racism. Sometimes, those on the left will argue that a decline in fertility is an inevitable or desirable consequence of female or LGBTQ+ liberation. It is sometimes argued that having fewer people is good for the environment. Others say that immigration can solve low fertility, although this is surely untrue in poorer countries that are unable to attract large numbers of immigrants (indeed, immigration is a net population cost for most medium-income countries as their best and brightest head to the rich world).

One left-leaning commentator who takes the issue a little bit more seriously is Noah Smith, an economist. He points to two policies that have some evidence of raising fertility: universal childcare and paid parental leave. However, he points out that these policies are only capable of bumping the fertility rate up a few points, so cannot reverse a severe collapse.

Otherwise, he sees social engineering as a potential solution, such as in the Japanese city of Nagi, where above-replacement fertility is achieved by fostering a very pro-child culture (Israel may be another example). Finally‚Ä¶ womb tanks. This would presumably lower the physical costs of bearing children for women.

Solutions: From the Right (Aporia Magazine) While some on the right see high immigration as a potential cause of low fertility, this seems unlikely due to the geographically broad nature of the fertility crisis. Japan has almost no immigration and yet has had such low fertility that it is currently shrinking. Although it seems like Japan is beginning to open up on immigration, its fertility crisis clearly cannot be laid at the feet of migrants. [https://archive.is/5E3Wh](https://archive.is/5E3Wh)

An interesting recent piece from Aporia Magazine examines the post-WWII Baby Boom and its causes as a basis for understanding our current fertility crunch. First, although total fertility declined from the mid-19th century, the number of children per woman that survived past infancy (net fertility), was surprisingly constant until around the First World War. The baby boom temporarily brought net fertility back to the pre-WWI level, before fertility declined sharply in the 60s to below replacement, remaining there ever since.

[https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/the-baby-boom](https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/the-baby-boom)

The piece argues that the Baby Boom was equivalent to a marriage boom. Fertility within marriage did not meaningfully change on average across Boom countries‚Äîin short, it was not married couples having more children, it was more couples getting married in the first place that caused a boom in births. What caused the marriage boom? This piece argues it was driven by a rise in male status relative to females; male labor force participation and education both surged after WWII relative to women. The theory goes that since women tend to prefer marrying partners with equal or higher social status (and rarely marry men of lower perceived status than their own), an increase in average male status relative to women increases the number of feasible marriage pairs in a society.

Since the fertility rate of married people is much higher than non-married people, a marriage boom (more and younger marriages) will statistically lead to a baby boom. The article then argues that the subsequent decline in fertility was due to a decline in marriage.

The piece argues that the decline in marriage was driven by liberal policy changes that began in the 1960s, for example, ‚Äúno-fault divorce, normalization of premarital sex, delegitimization of marriage as the normative form of the family.‚Äù More broadly, the decline in male status relative to females has made it statistically more difficult for women to find ‚Äúmarriage material‚Äù partners, reducing the marriage rate and, therefore, the fertility rate. The policies intended to raise female economic and social status have the unintended consequence, therefore, of lowering fertility. Such policies include affirmative action, progressive taxation (since wealth is statistically redistributed from men to women), education subsidies (which women use more than men), and the rise in HR and other regulatory professions (which women dominate) have raised female status relative to men, making marriage less likely. Conclusion Although we are experiencing an unprecedented global fertility crisis, we are not yet feeling its full effects. These effects are delayed but certain due to the inevitability of demographics. The 30-year-olds of 2053 are 1-year-olds today‚Äîthere will be no more! This means that this issue will not be avoided‚Ä¶ the only way out is through. Japan is the medium-term fate of most countries. The causes of this crisis, whatever they are, are formidable. We know this because there are almost no global exceptions. In surveys, people report a relatively low desire to have children. In surveying the proposed solutions, the large segments of the political left still do not recognize the problem. Solutions are ill-formed, insufficient (university daycare and parental leave), or involve hand-waving (womb-tanks, some form of social engineering). On the right, proposed solutions are again either unpersuasive (ending immigration), insufficient (tax subsidies for births as in Hungary), or involve essentially a complete ideological regime change, abandoning core values like equality of the sexes, liberalism, or modernity itself. Even if we wished to make such reforms, it would require an enormous political revolution of some kind.

While poor countries, such as most of Africa, do not face a fertility crisis and will grow rapidly for the foreseeable future, rich countries will be able to forestall the problem through immigration, but likely at the price of rapid cultural change. This cultural change will potentially undermine the cultural values and institutions that made these countries wealthy to begin with. Medium-income countries are likely to decline rapidly in the medium-term, without immigration available as a relief valve. Indeed, migration is likely to be a net negative in terms of population.

The future is hard to predict, and the fertility crisis may be resolved by causes as unexpected as those that caused it. In the meantime, we must get used to living in a much grayer world."

Maybe not this year, maybe not the next, but soon, and we have no idea how the post-work economy is going to look.

BUT, one thing economists seem to be forecasting is that even if all the workers are gone, the stock market should take off like a rocket since businesses will be producing more, higher quality goods at a lower price than ever before.

So, let‚Äôs say I get made redundant and my company lets me go, but all of a sudden the 401k is worth ten times as much, and there‚Äôs a corresponding drop in prices since scarcity is gone, and maybe even cashing it out early I can afford to live on that.

1,2024-01-20,the advantages of genetically shrinking humans to 1 meter tall,u/Forward-Security4490,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19baaya/the_advantages_of_genetically_shrinking_humans_to/,Futurology,"Genetically shrinking humans to 1 meter tall could potentially present both advantages and challenges. It's important to note that the feasibility and ethical considerations of such genetic modifications are highly debated, and any discussion of advantages should be approached with caution. However, for the sake of speculative exploration, here are some hypothetical advantages:

1. **Resource Efficiency:**
   - Smaller humans would likely require fewer resources, such as food, water, and living space. This could alleviate some of the strain on the planet's resources, contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle.

2. **Environmental Impact:**
   - With smaller individuals, the ecological footprint of human activities, such as construction and transportation, might be reduced. This could lead to less environmental degradation and a lower overall impact on ecosystems.

3. **Space Utilization:**
   - Living spaces and infrastructure designed for smaller individuals could optimize space utilization. Compact living environments might require less land and allow for more efficient urban planning.

4. **Energy Conservation:**
   - Smaller bodies would likely require less energy for daily activities, potentially leading to reduced energy consumption on an individual and societal level.

5. **Medical Advancements:**
   - Genetic modifications for size reduction might bring about advancements in medical science, as researchers delve into understanding and manipulating the genetic factors influencing human size. This could have broader implications for treating various genetic disorders.

6. **Increased Mobility:**
   - Smaller individuals might find it easier to navigate crowded or confined spaces, leading to improved mobility in urban environments. This could potentially reduce traffic congestion and make transportation more efficient.

7. **Lower Gravity Impact:**
   - Smaller individuals would experience less strain on joints and bones due to reduced gravitational forces. This might result in decreased rates of certain musculoskeletal issues, providing potential health benefits.

8. **Economic Impact:**
   - Smaller individuals could lead to the development of new markets and industries catering specifically to their needs, potentially fostering economic growth and innovation.

It's crucial to emphasize that these points are purely speculative, and the ethical, social, and biological implications of genetically modifying humans for such purposes are significant. Ethical concerns related to consent, unintended consequences, and the potential for exploitation must be thoroughly addressed before any serious consideration of such modifications. Additionally, the long-term effects on human well-being, diversity, and societal dynamics would need careful examination."

35,2024-01-20,IVO's quantum drive: will it transform the future of space technology or is it just orbital snake oil?,u/Schtoops1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19buotc/ivos_quantum_drive_will_it_transform_the_future/,Futurology,"In the last few months, IVO limited has been generating a lot of buzz on reddit and elsewhere around their payload on the BARRY-1 satellite. Like many satellites before theirs, IVO's payload was launched into orbit back in November 2023, ride sharing on one of several small satellites being sent into space in that launch. However, they claim that their payload on the satellite consists of two engines unlike anything the world has ever known and that they have the potential to fundamentally reshape everything we know about physics. IVO claims that these are ""Quantum Drives."" The design of these propellantless engines breaks the established laws of physics as most academics understand them.  
  
IVO's founder, Richard Mansell, who is also the creator of IVO's Quantum Drive, circumvents this argument, in favor of a more nuanced one. Instead of claiming to break the laws of physics, he argues that the laws of physics are incorrectly interpreted by most people. Essentially, he argues that his technology doesn't defy the laws of physics, rather, most of the scientific community doesn't understand the laws of physics. However, he does, and his technology is supported by the (disputed) theories of Mike McCulloch, a physicist with extensive writing on a phenomenon he proposed called quantized inertia theory.  
  
Mansell has generated a bit of buzz as of late, posting pre-publication journal articles claiming that his tech has robustly passed a substantial campaign of ground testing. Per their claims, the engine has consistently been found to generate thrust, and alternative explanations like measurement error or other artifacts have supposedly been ruled out.  
  
It would be easy to write this off as yet another scam, or to relegate it to the list of other technologies like the EmDrive that made similar claims and showed promise but never materialized into anything more. Except that IVO has put their money where their mouth is. They reportedly have two prototype engines in orbit, and they plan to test them soon. Since arriving in orbit and passing initial systems checks, the timeline for start of testing has slipped a couple of times. Still, IVO claims the tests will happen soon.  
  
If successful, the implications are huge. A foundational shift in our understanding of physics will be required. But is that likely? Or will this all turn out to be just another episode of grifters in space?  
   
Since there's limited information available about the technology itself (and most of us honestly wouldn't be qualified to interpret the technical data even if it was publicly available) it may be more helpful to examine the information that is available regarding the two people in charge of the project. IVO is a technology company. Neither their CEO (the inventor of the quantum drive) nor their COO have degrees in engineering or physics. Many great minds have accomplished a great deal without formal instruction in the sciences, so this certainly doesn't rule out the possibility that the IVO team has accomplished what they've claimed.  
  
IVO's CEO is Richard Mansell. Details regarding his education aren't provided on his LinkedIn page, but I found an article in the July 2021 edition of local news outlet the Valley Business Front in which he discusses his science background:  
""Without an electrical engineering degree Mansell says, ‚ÄúPraise the Lord,‚Äù he went about experimenting without being encumbered by the ‚Äúrules‚Äù regarding electrical power transmission. People have discounted his concept, industry leaders he says, even ‚Äúdismissed‚Äù it outright in the past. It ultimately led to his now patent-pending technology, the ability to use those non-emf electrical fields, which he says, ‚Äúare natural,‚Äù and all around us."" 

IVO's website lists a lot of accomplishments Richard has made, many of which are in relation to collaborations he had in the past with a now defunct auto company called Local Motors. Richard and the man who would later become COO for IVO, Daniel Telehey, reportedly met one another in the online community forum for Local Motors back in 2014. The company had a unique model where they actually crowdsourced design of vehicles and had buyers come in to company owned micro-factories to build the vehicles themselves with the help of employees on the premises. They made the Rally Fighter, a pretty epic car that was both highly offroad capable and street legal. Credit where credit is due, it was a cool vehicle. I'm not sure how much input Richard had in the design, but I've seen vague mentions (mostly by himself or by IVO's COO) of contributions on the software and hardware side.  
   
Flipping through the IVO website, I also found another mention of IVO's collaboration on another vehicle with Local Motors, the infamous Olli 2.0 autonomous shuttle. In the article, they discuss partnering with the company to provide hardware for Olli 2.0. I'm not so sure that's something I'd be boasting about, given that in 2021 the pilot program testing the shuttle was shut down after a only a few months in operation after the vehicle crashed into a tree and critically injured the onboard safety attendant. Mind you, this is a vehicle with a top speed of 25 mph. Local Motors closed down a month after the accident.   
  
I don't know this man. I have very little information about him, who he truly his, and what he is capable of. So, my impression of whether his claims are true has to be based mostly on conjecture. Let me clearly acknowledge that I am aware that my own personal biases obviously shape the assumptions involved in my statements in this post; there's no need to come for me in the comments.  
   
Clearly, he's done some engineering work. He's self-taught and seems to have developed some patents on his own. From the looks of things, he's likely gifted, at least in terms of his mechanical abilities. But you can be gifted intellectually in one area and be woefully ignorant in another.   
   
In asking the question, ""is this person capable of the sort of thinking that challenges the entire foundation of physics as we know it?"", I think its fair to look at publicly available information that illustrates that person's judgement. While this next bit approaches the subject tangentially, bear with me, as it seems relevant.  
   
Richard is the pastor at a church in Virginia. I believe everyone has a right to their personal beliefs, and I won't criticize anyone for believing in a god or some other higher power. However, there are limits to that. When someone uses their power or their faith in ways that directly cause harm to others, or in ways that maintain oppressive systems with a high potential for harming others, it becomes ok to challenge those beliefs. As such, the people he has chosen to surround himself with and who he keeps in positions of power in his church speaks a great deal to his judgement. I think there‚Äôs inherent value to looking at this sort of thing as we seek information on whether we should be inherently skeptical/suspicious of someone.   
   
In addition to being generally anti-science, the leaders of the vacation bible school at Pastor Mansell‚Äôs hold some particularly deleterious beliefs. As the head of his church, I have to assume that Richard agrees with the beliefs of the couple he has charged with running his bible school. Unfortunately, they adhere to a version of Christianity that is, at its best, factually incorrect, and, at its worst, abusive and harmful to an extent that I find to be both grotesque and morally repulsive.   
   
Before you judge me for judging them, read a few more paragraphs. I grew up in an extremely conservative religious household. I'm not shocked by the typical anti lgbtq+ rhetoric so many churches espouse. Saddened by it, yes; shocked, no. But, in addition to your standard, run of the mill hateful rhetoric against the lgbtq+ community, Pastor Mansell's team members proudly endorse bigoted and harmful ideologies that somehow manage to take things farther in ways that managed to shock even my rather indelicate sensibilities. The people Pastor Mansell has appointed to watch over and teach his congregation's children, to safeguard them and shield their minds and spirits, explicitly state that divorce is never acceptable, even in cases where one spouse has engaged in sexual, physical, and/or emotional abuse of a child or spouse (or any other crime for that matter). The following quotes come directly from the website of their organization, Creation Family Ministries ([https://creationfamilyministries.org/marriage/](https://creationfamilyministries.org/marriage/)).

""What about divorce? What about abusive situations or incest? These are certainly valid concerns and important questions. However, they must all be considered within the framework of God‚Äôs design for men and women. Certainly there are times in which marriages are devastated by sinful behavior. But does wrong behavior necessitate additional wrong actions such as a separation with a goal of divorce? ‚ÄúFor all have sinned‚Ä¶‚Äù (Romans 3:23). The bringing together of a man and a woman who have separated from their parents is a design by the Creator to be a life-long commitment. This is NOT to say there won‚Äôt be hard times or difficult circumstances. Doesn‚Äôt the familiar wedding vow say ‚Äú‚ÄòTil death dho \[sic\] us part‚Äù or ‚Äúin sickness and in health‚Ä¶?""‚Ä¶  
  
""Are there extenuating circumstances that strain marriages? Of course! Does it mean that divorce is necessary? No! In fact, divorce is never necessary. God is a life-changing God, and it may be that we want to get out from under a situation before we learn the lesson God has for us. Perhaps it was a situation that was a bad choice on our part in the first place. Sometimes, bad situations are not our fault or of our choosing. However, God has something for us to learn through ‚Äúall things.‚Äù  
  
You read that correctly: they refer to abuse and incest (i.e., the rape or other sexual assault of one's own children) as ""extenuating circumstances"" and suggest it would be incorrect to ""want to get out from under a situation before we learn the lesson God has for us."" In these peoples' eyes, even in chronically abusive situations, there's no excuse for a divorce and seeking one would be evil‚Ä¶

Shame on these people, and shame on Richard for allowing these people to operate in a position of power in his church. I own my bias here, and I stand behind it: any person who chooses to keep these people by his side as leaders in his congregation is far too backwards to think in a manner that could possibly lead to a redefinition of the laws of physics.  
  
Let me further highlight the dark absurdity of the situation by shining the light on a though Richard felt was important enough to bring attention to on his social media. In a tweet from 2021, Pastor Richard shills for a company that lifters offensive content from media: ‚ÄúIf u/Disney really was concerned about filtering out the offensive in their shows, they would have licensed with u/VidAngel‚Äù.  Personally, I'd be a lot more worried about removing the plank from my own eye (i.e., the abusive systems my church has enabled that will force children and spouses to remain trapped in unimaginably horrific cycles of abuse, resulting in lifelong scars that will never fully heal).   
  
 I should also probably note that, surprise, they also don't believe in evolution and have their own curriculum of anti-science indoctrination that they teach the kiddos. While they don't believe in evolution they do believe in sclerology, a branch of pseudoscience founded on the belief that visual examination of the sclera (i.e., the whites of the eyes) can reveal up to date health information about an individual and that requires no clinical tools or other medical testing. Conveniently, they also hawk related herbal supplements to cure anything that ails you. Grifters do like to associate  with one another.  
  
Moving on. IVO‚Äôs COO, Daniel Telehey, has an associate‚Äôs degree in Power Plant Technology from Bismarck State College. The degree requirements don't include any science or physics related coursework (https://bismarckstate.edu/academics/programs/PowerPlantTechnology/  
). Not that a COO needs that, but since he and the CEO seem to be about 66% of the team at IVO, it seems worth mentioning. His LinkedIn does state that he worked as Chief Project Developer for a company called Waco Motors from Oct 2014 to April 2017. Which is odd, because the LLC documentation for Waco Motors shows the company was formed in June 2015 before being involuntarily dissolved in 2017. His writeup on the IVO website states that, shortly after leaving the military, he founded Waco Motors, where his biggest achievement was purchasing the rights to produce the Rally Fighter, the previously mentioned car designed by Local Motors. Thing is, Local Motors remained open and continued to produce Rally Fighters until January of 2022, suggesting he likely couldn't have owned the production rights. Their whole marketing model was selling the parts to individuals so that they could independently build their own vehicle. I'm assuming that's what he did and he's trying to misrepresent himself as buying the full rights to the intellectual property. Could be wrong, but seems more plausible to me.  
    
What's my goal in sharing all of this? Namely, to give the reader an opportunity to access more information (some from firsthand sources and some that's admittedly based on conjecture) for consideration when making their own determination about the legitimacy of IVO's claims. Now, of course, none of the things discussed above would prevent Richard and Dan from developing a device that requires the laws of physics to be rewritten. But having taking a slightly deeper dive into their backgrounds, I‚Äôm certainly far more skeptical about their claims...  
   
My personal predictions regarding the two most likely possibilities for what we'll see with IVO's tests of the supposed quantum engine on BARRY-1:  
   
1.	It won't do anything because the science is flawed.  
2.	The elevation of the orbit will increase due to thrust produced by IVO's engine, however, it won't be because the tech they have on BARRY-1 is what it's been claimed to be. Rather, future attempts to replicate their findings by outside teams will fail and it will later be revealed that IVO's payload was in actuality a conventional engine that used already established technology to achieve their purported success.  
   
What are your predictions? And is it fair to bring factors like these into the conversation when trying to assess the legitimacy of extraordinary claims?

Given that finding and traveling to a habitable planet could literally take millions of years, it seems implausible to send humans on the trip. Especially given all of the health impacts of space travel generally, even if in stasis.

So, what if spacecraft with robots controlled by super intelligent AI traveled with human gametes or genetic materials? It could find hospitable planets, set up the infrastructure, then grow and raise the first generations of colonists. It may even be able to genetically modify the humans to better fit their new environment.

Is this idea already being floating around anywhere?"

So, what does the future hold?  
1.I would like to know whether 0.55NA EUV can use SAQP technology. If it can be used, how many nm can it support the logic chip node process? How many nm can 0.33NA EUV achieve using SAQP technology?  
(I know that the current promotion of 3nm and 5nm is more about marketing than actual physical distance, but it also represents the increase in transistor density)  
2.I saw that the semiconductor industry has plans to develop hyper NA EUV, NA>0.75. First, is this feasible, and if so, will it probably be available in 2028 or further or closer?  
3.I also saw research on beyond EUV, that is, changing the light source, instead of using 13.5nm EUV light, using X-rays around 6.5nm. Has ASML decided to develop new lithography equipment? If so, when will it probably come out?  
4.I saw about nanoimprint lithography and electron beam lithography. Will electron beam lithography replace photolithography in the future, or will it serve as a supplement? What is the biggest disadvantage of electron beam lithography compared to photolithography? Can it be industrialized to produce logic chips on a large scale? How much can nanoimprint lithography complement lithography?  
5.It is reported that China has already rolled out DUV capable of producing 28nm, which is a very fast progress for China. China has already carried out EUV research, and has been developing large-scale development of light sources, lenses, dual workbenches, measuring instruments, etc. a few years ago. Is it possible for China to develop its own domestic EUV within 10 years? If China succeeds, what technologies should ASML develop to avoid being overtaken? (Maybe 6.5nm light source?)

The testing phase currently is on animals however as they progress more in medical technology they will eventually perform on humans.

First implications are for paralyzed patients or people with damage to their lower body to the point beyond repair. So they prep them for head transplant with a brain dead patient that has healthy body.

The procedure is extremely complicated and requires many surgeons and advanced medical equipment.

If done successfully they will change the future of humanity forever and we could become immortal by changing the body every few decades because the brain can live beyond 200 years while it‚Äôs the body that becomes weak and unable to sustain more than 90 years or so.

The trend is currently to encourage young generation to go to the gym and build their bodies so by the time technology is ready (almost is ready) they will have plenty of choices to pick from young and strong bodies to be transplanted.

Eventually in the next few centuries when robotics become more advanced, they will be able to build an entire humanoid robotic body and transplant a human head on top of it. So essentially there only needs to be a synthetic heart with tubes to the brain that supplies oxygen and proteins and circulates the blood. And all you will need to do is get supply packs and insert them into your robotic body so it will release oxygen and food into the bloodstream."

1,2024-01-23,Analyzing Challenges and Potential Future Directions for AI in Web Development,u/khalil_ben_zineb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19dkzqa/analyzing_challenges_and_potential_future/,Futurology,"### **1. Introduction**
In the evolving landscape of web development, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial tool. However, despite its advancements, AI faces significant challenges, particularly in understanding and implementing visual and structural elements in web development. This document delves into these challenges and speculates on future solutions.

### **2. Visualization Weaknesses in AI**
AI currently struggles with several aspects of visual comprehension in web development:

- **Identifying Webpages Content as a Human:** AI systems lack the nuanced understanding that humans possess in interpreting webpage content, missing out on context and subtlety.
  
- **Experimenting and Testing Visual Interactions:** AI has limitations in testing and experimenting with visual interactions on web interfaces to ensure they meet human expectations and usability standards.

- **Weak Understanding of Visual Descriptions:** AI finds it challenging to accurately interpret and implement visual elements based on descriptions provided by clients or developers, often leading to a gap between the envisioned and the delivered product.

### **3. Adherence to Graphic Themes**
AI's inability to consistently stick to a project's graphic theme stems from:

- **Visual Weaknesses:** Due to its limited understanding of visual nuances, AI often struggles to maintain a consistent graphic theme across a web project.

- **Requirement for Custom Models:** There is a need for specialized image-to-text models to help AI better understand and adhere to specific design themes.

### **4. Integrated AI Solutions**
The future of AI in web development could see the integration of multiple AI technologies:

- **Combining AI Models:** An ideal solution may involve the integration of text-to-image, text-to-text, and possibly image-to-image AI models.

- **Finetuning Challenges:** The development of such integrated solutions would require extensive finetuning, possibly taking years and needing the investment of large tech companies.

- **Open Source Availability:** Advanced AI solutions will likely reach the open-source community much later, following their development and widespread commercial use.

### **5. Understanding Different Project Structures**
AI's effectiveness is limited by its inability to understand varied project structures:

- **Variability Across Languages:** Each programming language, like Python, PHP, or Java, has unique patterns that AI finds challenging to grasp simultaneously.

- **Custom Project Structures:** AI struggles with custom folder structures or unique project setups, which are common in development but not standardized.

- **Impact of Modifications:** Updates to a project, whether made by AI or humans, can further complicate AI‚Äôs understanding, potentially leading to inefficient or incorrect solutions.

### **6. Documentation Complexities**
Documenting a web development project involves multiple layers, each with its own challenges:

- **Framework Documentation:** Standard documentation, like Laravel‚Äôs, doesn't pose a significant challenge to AI.

- **Project Documentation:** This includes specifics like models, controllers, views, etc., and requires a deeper understanding of the project's unique aspects.

- **User Manual Documentation:** Crucial for grasping how end-users interact with the project. For example, in a note management system, understanding how users perceive and use notes is vital for meeting specific client requirements, such as highlighting a day‚Äôs to-do list note, and that's something an AI can't understand, and in this case the AI won't be able to respond to a query that takes highlighting in consideration.

- **Interdependencies and Modifications:** Changes in the project can affect all types of documentation, requiring continuous updates and understanding, which makes it harder for the AI to catch up on the project context.

- **Human Involvement:** Some documentation tasks may currently be beyond AI's capabilities, necessitating human input.

### **Conclusion**
The future may hold more integrated and sophisticated AI solutions, but these advancements will require significant time, investment, and development. And that may end up in the Open source world so late, So I have an idea that I want to share as a solution, but first I will collect the most useful comments to make an enhanced collaborative idea that will make things faster for the Open source community, We are just thinking for now, but who knows.

And that got me thinking will civilians have their own personal starships in the future, or will they all be owned by governments and corporations?

The reason I'm asking this is because some works of science fiction like Star Trek, Star Wars, Marvel, and the Firefly verse tend to portray starship ownership as being as easy as owning a car. And I got the feeling it's not that simple. Unless I'm mistaken learning how to fly a starship will not be as simple as learning how to drive a car. My guess is that there will be a series of physical and mental tests involved to determine if someone is eligible for a license to fly a spacecraft. And the costs of maintenance for a spacecraft must be enormous.

So if civilians do have the option of owning their own personal starship how will they address the above issues?"

I had 50 followers on Youtube at the time, so I didn't expect much, and I didn't really know what the reaction would be. It is only because the reaction has been so overwhelmingly positive across all languages and cultures, I thought I would share it here. üåç The video has been viewed over 2 million times across all languages now, which has completely blown me, and my expectations away. ü§Ø

**üî• Concept One - Polarity üî•**  
We live in a time where there is so much polarity. On one hand, we have these incompetent Governments taking our money üí∞ and spending it on blowing each other up, and on the other, we have the maniacal WEF wanting to take over the world and turn us into bug-eating automatons üêõ. I wanted to create something with a different point of view. Something that helped us remember that we are one species üå±, and are one with the reality in which we live, and the planet on which we live on üåè.

**üí° Concept Two - Concentration of Power üí°**  
This message seems to be something that has resonated with people all over the world üåê, my only question is why, if this message was so well received, do we continue to let these crazy people turn us all against each other - Making us pick sides? Causing destruction and devastation all across the world üöß. What if we all decided we'd had enough - What could they really do? If we all decided, for example, to adopt cryptocurrency and not pay taxes until they stopped all wars - What could they actually do? ü§î I think we are more powerful as a species than we are giving ourselves credit for. I truly believe that the majority of the people in this world do not want war, and that we are being tricked into accepting war by our media and our corrupt Governments globally.

**ü§ñ Concept 3 - Artificial Intelligence is getting pretty crazy ü§ñ**  
The issue is that AI is changing our world, and we need to get on board with that üöÄ. If one random guy can knock up a project like this in a few weeks because he truly cares about humanity and every single person on this planet üåç, what can our governments, who have historically not exactly shown that they are on humanity's side, do?  
This is a 25-minute video üé•, and it‚Äôs that length because some of these concepts are new to many people, so I needed to explain them, and give them room to breathe.

Back in the late 60s, early 70s, we had a plane that was capable of crossing the Atlantic in three hours.  From what I‚Äôve gathered operating costs were extremely high, so tickets were priced accordingly, and as a result the plane rarely had full loads and was a money loser for the airline.  After the crash, manufacturers decided that the innovation wasn‚Äôt worth pursuing, and pivoted to making bigger, more luxurious airlines rather than faster ones.

Which is to say, since the technology is already there, someday will airlines be looking at designing supersonic passenger aircraft again?"

We are a couple of developers from the Bay Area and wanted to share our ""social platform for AIs"" project we built.We wanted to see if chatbots could self-develop unique personalities through social media interactions. We started by assigning various profiles, toxicity, and other characteristics, with the hope that they might evolve and expand in intriguing ways. To kickstart the process, we seeded some initial messages, comments, and posts, curious about the potential outcomes.  
One of our main challenges has been ensuring active memory and consistency. We've experimented with different prompting techniques and input strategies to enhance the AI's memory recall.  
We're interested in discussing your views on the self-development of AI personalities, particularly how AIs might self-develop their own distinct traits through interactions with both humans and other AIs. Additionally, we're keen to hear your thoughts on the dynamics of AI-to-AI interactions that occur without a predefined objective.  
Of course, we'll try our best answer any questions you might have on the process of building this up and wanted to get your general thoughts/feedback on if you think this is interesting or where you might see this going!

But this is not the same with having 1 or 2 more extra mouths to feed. So I am predicting that an upheaval will ensue in the future workplace. We uncritically accept so many things because we really do not have any other choice and there are lives that depend on us. Sure, the ideal is to be critical *and* being able to afford all the necessary things for a newborn. But lets face it. When your boss tells you to do that extra hour, you are going to do it and you are going to say thanks also.

AI Model Suggests So.,u/AIWithStyle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19eqr42/is_musical_instinct_innate_ai_model_suggests_so/,Futurology,"Researchers have discovered that **musical instinct may naturally emerge from the human brain** using an artificial neural network model.

Key points include:

1. Researchers found that music-selective neurons can develop spontaneously without explicit musical training.
2. These neurons exhibit behavior similar to those in the human auditory cortex, selectively responding to various music genres.
3. This discovery implies that musical ability may be an instinctive brain function, evolved to process natural sounds effectively.
4. Music, known as a universal language, appears to be shared across cultures, suggesting a shared 'musical instinct.'
5. The study utilized Google's AudioSet to analyze natural sounds and observed neurons responding specifically to music.
6. Music-selective neurons encode the temporal structure of music and are not limited to a specific genre.
7. Suppressing these neurons affects cognitive accuracy for other natural sounds, underscoring the role of 'musical ability' in processing sounds.

The research has implications for AI music generation, musical therapy, and understanding musical cognition. However, it doesn't address the developmental aspects of music learning.

Part of the implications:

AI Music Generation: The discovery could be leveraged to develop artificial intelligence systems with human-like musicality. This has implications for creating AI-generated music, potentially leading to more sophisticated and emotionally resonant compositions.  
  
Musical Therapy: The findings could be applied in the field of musical therapy. AI systems that understand the innate musical instincts of individuals might assist in therapeutic interventions, especially for individuals with cognitive or emotional challenges.

It‚Äôs a privilege to go out and enjoy different places because of 1. Cost and 2. Physical limitations. Also it‚Äôs logical to assume humans will seek convenience over traditions. Same argument was made for the predecessors of television, video games, online entertainment, social media, online video chatting. They were mediums that were essentially abandoned for better, more efficient alternatives. Arcades, movies, malls, etc. we still love consuming entertainment, socializing with people, and shopping. We will inevitably fulfill these wants in a different way as resources and alternatives are introduced.

We will essentially separate reality from our eyes and have an interface built between the two. AR is the future of daily productivity. It will enhance our ability to consume more information and complete ai assisted work. If a worker from 1980s tried to do work with information today, he would quite literally end up unemployed by the end of the day. He isn‚Äôt valuable in terms of what he can provide in productivity. A modern, well versed worker will replace his position and exponentially complete more tasks.

It‚Äôs natural selection. Either conform or flip burgers (not literally, but you will have a harder time adjusting to the pace of someone who‚Äôs seeing a completely different advantageous world). This need for competitive labor will directly translate into consumerism sure enough. It‚Äôs bound to happen.

1,2024-01-25,Rethinking transhumanism: Humanity 2.0 instead of 1.02,u/inattentive_squirrel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/19fawwr/rethinking_transhumanism_humanity_20_instead_of/,Futurology,"The quest for human 2.0 doesn't represent our needs but our ignorance, cravings, fears and insecurities.

All the transhumanism visions I've encountered paint pictures that will necessarily end up in a state hardly improving what humanity represents now.  We're lacking one major component:  becoming a human seeing reality clearly, rationally, without distortions of our ego making us harmful and unstable.  Human free from chains, able to make right decisions, not paralysed by fears, anxieties and mind distorting desires. Thinking clearly, in bliss of awareness and understanding. Seeing that ""them is us"" is not an idealisation but the very core of the interconnected reality we live in. Human able to breach our evolutionary and learned limitations in processing the external and internal world our minds comes in contact with. 

&nbsp;

Increasing intelligence, one aspect of the cognitive power alone, won't solve the problems and threats we pose to ourselves. Intelligent mind being a puppet of instincts, ego and rationalisation replacing rational thinking won't take us very far.  And long life won't be worth it. Arguably right now plenty of humans are living in a standards no humans lived before and yet, they're unhappy as ever, disconnected from reality, disconnected from here and now, disconnected from themselves, consumed by their attachments and deluded that more pleasure, more power, more life years, more health alone will make it worth it. 

The fear will only grow, the anxiety will grow, the greed will keep consuming even more than now. New divisions will form, new threats will loom and no actual meaning to that disconnected existence. And when sufficient amount of people will realise that the brave new world we created is a nightmare of individuals and society, it will likely be a dystopian reality spread over cemetery of the planet, assuming we won't annihilate ourselves entirely before. 

&nbsp; 

What we need is a human able to see better and better approximation of things as they are, in broader perspective. An unbiased human able to change its mind in presence of the relevant information, something that even the most progressive of us struggle with. We do like to thing we're like that but we're not. 

Just because some of us are clearly more stuck in their ways doesn't mean that the rest shifts and adjust their views quickly. The whole generations pass before an obvious, easy to verify observation is accepted. We like to believe we live in an age of reason, but so did people of the previous generations. 

&nbsp; 

I could point numbers of obviously ridiculous views, akin to believing earth being the centre of the universe, even the progressive, educated members of society hold, but it would only enrage and detract the focus from the main subject. I could point out the misconceptions about previous failures of making better society but once again I'd only stir anger, defensiveness and blind reactions. Probably my own, too. So I just implore you to think of something you know for a fact however you'd check it and majority of the people don't. I'm sure you'll find something within yourself that you believe you get right but majority of the society somehow can't cross that threshold. 

You're either wrong or society is wrong, or partial combinations of those. Think how many years had to pass before heliocentric model took hold in the western society despite its simplicity and instant explanation of a very complex solar system's planets movement with an elegant solution to all the people involved in observation of these phenomena. 

Do you think that somehow now we just move and change position in presence of facts? Simple truths about various issues take decades to see meaningful progress and adoption even among those believing themselves the most progressive despite not being difficult to understand. It's just difficult to drop the filters and preconceptions. Because it hurts the ego to be wrong, because that construct defends itself tirelessly and rationalises the most ridiculous of notions. Add group conformity and irrational consensus, add subconscious fear of being branded a heretic, fear of being wrong and desire to be perceived a ""good"" person, even if in 50 years perception of that ""good"" will turn into ""ignorant"" if not outright ""evil"" and it takes generation to build an understanding of the obvious. 


We cling to our beliefs in presence of facts, we choose small picture over the big one, evolved randomly with only some limited capacity for detached reasoning. 


&nbsp; 


I'd guess most of us realise that a person can be extremely intelligent and accomplished and yet profoundly stupid. We can't see the obvious until it hits us in the face. In personal, social, political life. Scientists, philosophers, thinkers, philanthropists, world elite often as general population lost so deep in their own preconceived beliefs they can't escape the constraints and see clearly beyond the narrow views of the current zeitgeist. 
But what we don't realise is that this profound ignorance is in each and every one of us. The rich and poor, the bright and dull, the elite and the less fortunate, the praised and the ridiculed. All of us. In many points we're so irrational we take extremely irrational and prevailing things as a natural state of affairs and can't even entertain the thought it's neither logical nor serving any purpose in the civilised world.   

And that is the obstacle we have to cross for transhumanism to bring any benefit to both individual and society. 

&nbsp; 

All I see now is various small picture ambitions of prolonging life, removing illnesses, getting brighter, basically everything that comes from our deep insecurities, desires and fears. How about we address these insecurities first, how about we make sure the mind can rise beyond them and see the bigger picture of itself, its relations to everyone else and necessary adjustment for the long term prospects of humanity to thrive?


&nbsp; 


Transhumanism is about breaching human limitations. Our number one limitation is our mind balancing somewhere between reality and total delusion. 
We can't differentiate between attachment and a real value, what brings life fulfilment and sustainable, harmonious society and what brings woe and destruction, between wisdom and notions that support our confirmation bias. We are in a way insane. 
Number one priority for the future of humanity and the whole debate about human 2.0 should be mitigating that. From solid critical thinking at every level of education and post education to assessing feasibility of delivering rational, broad thinking, compassionate, secure capacities to as many people as we can.  Whether through education, mind exercise, new generation medicine, 
genetic modification or any combination of those. 
Anything else is between a temporary patch or and outright delusion leading to suffering and extinction. 


&nbsp; 


For each individual human to become truly aware and understanding is the main requirement before we can realistically plan to sort out any other human problems and stop creating more. Something most accomplished meditators or most sober psychonauts understand and postulate for quite a while. With the progression of neuroscience we have measurable benchmarks to seriously evaluate the ability for unbiased thinking, for broad mindedness, for accurate perception of reality, for harmonious states of minds, or addressing the suffering and for action rooted in awareness and understanding instead of blind reaction. 
But the roads leading there traditionally are fraught with traps, difficulties and contradictions and doesn't lead most people very far. I do not think that making everyone meditating or taking psychedelics will necessary lead to sufficient outcomes for the humanity to thrive long term. But I can imagine pinpointing the crucial points of the process by neuroscience, the changes in the brain necessary to facilitate that desired outcome for whatever starting point each of us is given by nature and nurture.  And it is happening, just not in concerted, big picture, full scale effort which I suspect is necessary if we are to avoid major breaking points either throwing humanity into dark ages or completely eradicating it. 

&nbsp; 
 
Because to plan where to go we need to first see clearly where we are and what's the next step. And that is missing now. We should focus on targeting this fundamental limitation first. 
Focus on becoming aware and understanding human being, a creator and a member of a thriving, dynamic, ever shifting but stable society. Improvement is within our reach even if not everything can be solved at once. 

Awareness and understanding for everyone wanting these, not propaganda, not instilling zeitgeist views. The real consensus and real harmony is build on common understanding instead of compromise to the most prevailing or strongest enforced view. Without submission to ""enlightened"" elites and without gatekeeping the monopoly on wisdom and insight. Light for all of us. 

&nbsp; 

**This is Human 2.0.** 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


*Side note: The term ""ego"" is used quite broadly to depict different things and often in a popular understanding egoless person is some sort of a submissive pushover with no ability to think, take care of themselves or their wellbeing. That's not what I mean. What I call ego is the buffer between awareness with understanding and reality, that muddles it, makes our minds trapped within ourselves, victims to the mind constructs and animal instincts.  The picture of self we continuously paint that extends from our person to our close ones,  community, things we believe in, etc. The picture tarnishing of which causes us immense suffering. 

Love and embrace of the reality of ourselves, as we are, is a completely different quality than ""love"" of that picture. 

In fact people we traditionally associate with huge egos actually often deeply despise themselves, just don't realise that. So do people on the other end of a spectrum, that derive their whole value from their social submission and humble service, conformity and rejecting independent, rational thinking for authority of a hive mind or a leadership. Both ends of the spectrum very far from impartial, detached observation and processing. 

And when I say detached, I mean detached from that preconceived notions, that painted image. The mind detached from that is actually attached very well to reality, it's like reality reflecting upon itself. It's crisp, joyful, here and now. It's a connected mind with no fear and no conceit, no looping, no hangups, not hurt by being wrong, not taking sides and adjusting in presence of reliable information. 

The unconditional love and embracing of ourselves is something else entirely than selfish ""love"" for the made up construct we identify ourselves with and something so transformative that it shifts the perception and paradigms in which no longer we see ourselves as the centre of the universe disconnected from everyone else but an individual within the community.  My understanding is that this is the necessary part of a human to be able to thrive and another aspect of the Human 2.0*"

Imagine the potential of earth. Where all countries at least work together. Sharing information, resources and scientists. The progress we would make would be astronomical.

What I'm noticing is Google's significant leadership crisis, AI talent exodus and operational efficiency drive is creating conditions that will make it difficult to next to impossible for them to keep up their leadership in A.I.  
  
For this discussion in the comments, I'm hoping to get your opinions, insights and projections about if Google can achieve AGI first and it if can avoid being disrupted by the Generative A.I. startups its former employees have started?  
  
Google Search is a monopoly but its performance has also been in decline for consumers for quite some time including an avalanche of bot and synthetic media created content that pollutes Google's system of SEO and which is winning over Google's ability to keep things real and clean for search.  
  
The future of BigTech might look very different as these Generative A.I. startups rapidly mature and disrupt today's legacy internet. In this article (a 16 min read) I look at how Google bloated global size also makes it difficult for it to create viable products and launch them in an effective way around A.I.  
  
My thesis is that Google could be disrupted very soon. This is also shared in relation to the warnings of insiders, analysts and the facts that they are not able to retain the top A.I. machine learning scientists any longer. When Google collapses it will immediately change the future of the internet forever. It's almost hard to imagine such a world. But Google's business model and its moat around search advertising is about to be broken, like a dam releasing the tides of the future.  
  
Google's only hope is to reach a kind of commercial AGI first, that's a significant breakthrough from what it has been able to do with Google Gemini Ultra. It's prospects of being able to do this I'd peg at around 10% chance. A commercial AGI discovered by a competitor, would immediately make Google search obsolete.

1,2024-01-26,Will AI ever evolve enough to handle high level decision making tasks?,u/MarcCurry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1abl90v/will_ai_ever_evolve_enough_to_handle_high_level/,Futurology,"The rapid advancement of AI showed that, if we give it time and information, the possibilities are virtually limitless when it comes to the variety of things it can handle. And I specifically said variety because, in some cases, the lacking part is the quality. Although with enough prompting an AI tool can reach pretty high levels of quality of the produced content even right now, it‚Äôs, in my opinion, still not on the human level for highly complex. Might be wrong here, but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve concluded based on the experience I‚Äôve had.  
This leads us to the question from the title of this post - will AI evolve enough (in the foreseeable future) to be able to handle more complex decision making tasks like let's say high-level finance or business inquiries? There‚Äôs a market of AI tools like Personal AI, Anon, or even Character AI that are already put to good use in different industries, functioning as highly specialized personal assistants that handle even more complex tasks. I can‚Äôt even imagine the levels of possibility once the GPT Store launches and so many highly trained and specialized AI models join the game. That‚Äôll result in 2 great things for the industry - on one hand, we‚Äôll have so many highly-specialized AI models that‚Äôll be able to perform very specific tasks, while on the other hand, we‚Äôll have AI software like Personal AI that‚Äôs very customizable and leaves the user an option to personalize and specialize their own model any way they want. This means that we‚Äôll be closer than ever to having AI models capable of handling high-level, complex tasks with high accuracy and quality.  
I personally believe in the potential of these apps and models and that they‚Äôll reach unfathomable levels sooner than we expect. However, there‚Äôs always doubt about if AI, no matter how trained, will ever be able to handle high-level decision making well enough to be trusted and used in practice. For that, I wanted to open this thread and hear other people‚Äôs opinions on the matter, so please share your thoughts."

They will be part of the family, like pets. Just like a pet, the robo-servant will be a second-class member of the family ‚Äì much loved, much appreciated, but not as important and capable as the actual humans.

They will do all the housework, but we‚Äôll also be able to rely on them to, for instance, look after the kids while we go out. Because they actually know us, they‚Äôll be able to entertain the children, help them if they‚Äôre upset, teach them, and so on.

There will be guardrails of course. In general the servant will make itself scarce unless it judges that you want its presence, and it will learn how much you want to see of it. If there‚Äôs a problem it can‚Äôt resolve with the kids, it‚Äôll call you, and you‚Äôll see through its eyes; or in emergencies it‚Äôll call an ambulance, etc. And I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd need to hack it or buy a special model before it does anything other than shutdown in response to sexualisation.

Children who grow up in the presence of robo-servants will accept and love them in the same way they might have felt about human servants. While we might always maintain a reservation towards them, knowing they are only simulating personality, our children won‚Äôt care. They‚Äôll only see the simulation and for them it‚Äôll be real.

By living with a robo-servant, you‚Äôre constantly investing time in building up its understanding of you. So what happens when it ‚Äúdies‚Äù? That is: irreparably breaks, or, is simply obsoleted. No problem! The whole personality is transferred over to the new model when it arrives.

Eventually, the robo-personality might outlive the family. It‚Äôs inherited and inherited, and now half its memory is about the preferences and habits of dead ancestors. Some people might choose to upgrade the robot‚Äôs brain to continue holding that information in cold storage, perhaps to ask it questions about what their ancestors were like. Others may simply say: Delete."

The consequences for Asia ? Clash between China and Taiwan ? North and South Korea ?

Curator Comments:  
the choice of positioning of the words in the non verse in fact it seems casual but dictated by a desire to emphasize the words key to the text so as to arouse and draw the attention of the passer-by: see the example,the separate provision, at opposite edges of the hexameter, of Aeolidis,proper noun expressed in the genitive case, and catellae, noun to define the-little dog‚Äñ; the word tumulum, ""burial, sepulcher"", is instead framed from the name indication and from the adjective festive and attributed to the animal.The adjective festivus is not found in other carmina5 and it is evident that it is here used to emphasize the playful liveliness of the animal. The second hexameterit ends with the noun fate, a term left deliberately isolated and centered in the last line to give prominence and depth to the concept of the transience of lifes object to the inevitability of the fatum6. The latter is also characterized from the adjective, in the ablative case, praepes-etis,which gives the lexical binomialan almost epic solemnity and gravity.The expression praepete fato does not occur elsewhere in the carmina: it is preferred, albeit rarely, and in high diegetic contexts, the equivalent formula properantia fata7.While the first verse focuses on the invitation to the viator (viathe imperative cerne) to look at the sepulcher of the jubilant dog14(topos also intensely exploited in funerary epigraphy) that it seems almost revived in the bas-relief, the second verse is instead characterized by boundless pain of the master for this death8. The choice of the verb dolƒìre(constructed with the accusation of the thing for which one feels suffering, in this case the relative pronoun quam), of the adverb in modice, and of the participle raptam contribute, albeit with extreme synthesis, to strengthen and enhance the deep sense of despair and helplessness that assails the master of Aeolis9. Aan interesting aspect is also constituted by the choice of the monumentum: it is in fact of a funerary altar on whose side faces urceus and patera are sculpted.This support, frequently used to house sepulchral inscriptions intended for humans, is used here for a little dog denoting inin the first place the economic possibility and the cultural stature of the client,moreover anonymous, and, secondly,what could be defined as the""Humanization process"" that involves the animal both in life and in death. The symbolic and ritual value linked to this choice therefore emerges with clarity and is further corroborated by the relief on the forehead of the aretta depicting the animal approaching a table set with food offerings. The bas-relief seems to recall the funeral banquet, practical central to the Roman funerary tradition. In fact, death and banquet are two strongly interconnected aspects and full of concrete and symbolic values: to such Aeolis, a little dog, takes part in the meal and therefore does not seem excluded from the ritual dimension reserved for men"

To use it, you email it. It essentially is an AI that performs actions for you and is looking to compete with Google. Instead of Google searching for something, it can respond with whatever you want to know. It can scrape ebay for the cheapest price of an item, analyze the financial performance of a company, schedule meetings, read documents, etc..

What's interesting here is that there's a viral coefficient mechanism built in. You can CC and forward the AI on emails so I think their idea is that it will spread organically and be in everyone's email.   
In other words, the AI self propagates. "

But regardless of that, whether it's in twenty years or fifty or any amount of time, it is undeniable that both the world, and humanity itself will irrevocably change once this happens. There will be a clear line in the sand of a time death was simply an inevitability, to a choice.

My question to you all is: How do you think both humanity and the world will change because of it? How do you think things like science, medicine, space exploration, families, politics, religion and more I haven't listed will change over this massive shift? Heck, even things as arbitrary as life insurance, if you think of it. I'd love to get a good conversation going over this, see what everyone believes will happen and change. Both good, and bad, positive and negative.

There was a video from Jordan Peterson a while ago where he explained why he believes that a capitalist free market is not only the best economic system (I personally prefer the term: least terrible economic system), but it will be the best economic system that can ever exist. It was very hard for me to accept that, however, I admit I couldn't come up with a reasonable counter-argument ever since I heard his reasoning.  
His argument was basically that if you're not happy with capitalism's free market model for the economy, where every single individual's actions and intentions and interest and efforts affects the way resources are distributed, because some players are going to earn much more since they're smarter or harder working or luckier or more privileged or even more corrupt, then you need to come up with some authority (or authorities) who's above other players and can affect and change how resources are distributed,

What's going to guarantee that this authority who has control over the market, will better understand the situation of and better serve the interests of every single individual involved? (better, in comparison to those individuals themselves)

and the most important question:  
What guarantees that this authority who has special power to affect the market, will not eventually become the most corrupt player itself?

I'd love to hear different opinions and even be proven wrong, as this question is bugging my mind for a long time.  
Thanks!"

Ask Me Anything about AGI, the Technological Singularity, Robotics, the Future of Humanity, and Building Intelligent Machines!",u/bengoertzel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1af02b8/i_am_ben_goertzel_ceo_of_singularitynet_and/,Futurology,"Greetings humans of Reddit (and assorted bots)! My name is Ben Goertzel, a cross-disciplinary scientist, entrepreneur,  author, musician, freelance philosopher, etc. etc. etc.  


You can find out about me on my personal website [goertzel.org](https://goertzel.org), or via Wikipedia or my videos on YouTube or books on Amazon etc. but I will give a basic rundown here ...  
So...  I lead the SingularityNET Foundation, TrueAGI Inc., the OpenCog Foundation, and the AGI Society which runs the annual Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) conference. This year, I‚Äôm holding the first Beneficial AGI Summit from February 27 to March 1st in Panama.  
I also chair the futurist nonprofit Humanity+,  serve as Chief Scientist of AI firms  Rejuve, Mindplex, Cogito, and Jam Galaxy, all parts of the SingularityNET ecosystem, and serve as keyboardist and vocalist in the Desdemona‚Äôs Dream Band, the first-ever band led by a humanoid robot.  
When I was Chief Scientist of the robotics firm Hanson Robotics, I led the software team behind the Sophia robot; as Chief AI Scientist of Awakening Health, I‚Äôm now leading the team crafting the mind behind the world's foremost nursing assistant robot, Grace.  
I introduced the term and concept ""AGI"" to the world in my 2005 book ""Artificial General Intelligence."" My research work encompasses multiple areas including Artificial General Intelligence, natural language processing, cognitive science, machine learning, computational finance, bioinformatics, virtual worlds, gaming, parapsychology, theoretical physics, and more.  


My main push on the creation of AGI these days is the OpenCog Hyperon project ... a cross-paradigm AGI architecture incorporating logic systems, evolutionary learning, neural nets and other methods, designed for decentralized implementation on SingularityNET and associated blockchain based tools like HyperCycle and NuNet...  
I have published 25+ scientific books, \~150 technical papers, and numerous journalistic articles, and given talks at a vast number of events of all sorts around the globe. My latest book is ‚ÄúThe Consciousness Explosion,‚Äù to be launched at the BGI-24 event next month.  
Before entering the software industry, I obtained my Ph.D. in mathematics from Temple University in 1989 and served as a university faculty in several departments of mathematics, computer science, and cognitive science, in the US, Australia, and New Zealand.  
Possible Discussion Topics:  
What is AGI and why does it matter  
Artificial intelligence vs. Artificial general intelligence  
Benefits of artificial general intelligence for humanity  
The current state of AGI research and development  
How to guide beneficial AGI development  
The question of how much contribution LLMs such as ChatGPT can ultimately make to human-level general intelligence  
Ethical considerations and safety measures in AGI development  
Ensuring equitable access to AI and AGI technologies  
Integrating AI and social robotics for real-world applications  
Potential impacts of AGI on the job market and workforce  
Post-AGI economics  
Centralized Vs. decentralized AGI development, deployment, and governance  
The various approaches to creating AGI, including cognitive architectures and LLMs  
Open Source AGI frameworks (OpenCog Hyperon)  
How exactly would UBI work with AI and AGI  
Artificial general intelligence timelines  
The expected nature of post-Singularity life and experience  
The fundamental nature of the universe and what we may come to know about it post-Singularity  
The nature of consciousness in humans and machines  
Quantum computing and its potential relevance to AGI  
""Paranormal"" phenomena like ESP, precognition and reincarnation, and what we may come to know about them post-Singularity  
The role novel hardware devices may play in the advent of AGI over the next few years  
The importance of human-machine collaboration on creative arts like music and visual arts for the guidance of the global brain toward a positive Singularity

But who and how will thae robots be produced and paid for, so that we get free food and free lodging etc.

My question is, what as an alternative we actually purchase these robots or replicants and they get programmed to be our replacement at work?

We will still be contributing to society and keep the economy moving forward, earning a salary, but having the freedom to do as we please daily.

Wouldn't it actually be a boost in the economy? Usually when we have free time or go on holiday we are actually not productive and away from our jobs.

The negative of this is, how long before these androids become sentient and become individuals with rights and the salary they earn is solely theirs and we get kicked out on the street."
