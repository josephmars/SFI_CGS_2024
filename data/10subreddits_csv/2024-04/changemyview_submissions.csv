Let's take the U.S. for example where jews represent 2% of the population but have 10% of US senat, 5% of House representatives, not to mention other ministerial positions like Blinken and others.  
It goes the same for most banks/investment banks take Blackrock which is by far the largest one ever with a Jewish CEO, other banks such as JP morgan and others have only had Jewish CEOs other banks have a majority jewish board of executives.  
Same for Media agencies if you search for any media company let's say CNN which is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery which is then owned by Advance Publications which is also owned by Newhouse family which is a JEWISH family and they own thousands of Media brands and the list goes on.  
At this point, is it unfair to say that people of jewish decent are in almost every industry and control a good chunk of it?

298,2024-03-31,"CMV: The Gaza Health Ministry Talley is Wrong, but in Ways Both Sides Find Awkward",u/WinterinoRosenritter,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bsqb8y/cmv_the_gaza_health_ministry_talley_is_wrong_but/,changemyview,"A lot of discussion about the current war in Gaza centers around the death toll with the most bandied about numbers being the Talley kept by the Gaza Ministry of Health. It claims the vast majority of deaths in the conflict are civilians, and is frequently used to justify claims of genocide against Israel. The current number stands at around 32k Dead, of whom half are minors. 

Here's the thing, the number is wrong. I think people directly quoting the number are making a mistake. It's wrong. It's obviously wrong. But, the specific way it's wrong is awkward for everyone. 

The reason why is this. The GMH Talley is accurately tracking confirmed deaths. Most of the people on the list (there's an actual list of names) are dead. It's just undercounting the actual death toll.

It's awkward for Hamas because: 

Hamas and ""resistance"" deaths are not being accurately tracked in the page. The list is exclusively composed of people reported to the ministry or who ended up in the hospital. There's basically no evidence Hamas/PIJ is telling the GHM accurate casualty tallies. 

Soldier/terrorists lost behind the lines, killed in airstrikes, buried in collapsed tunnels, are not being added to the list. The 7-8k Missing category that the GHM mentions is probably disproportionately fighting age males. 

One of the clearest indicators of this is the fact that terrorists killed during the Oct. 7 offensive do not seem to show up on the list. We know that between 500 and 2000 fighters died in ""67 Israel"" during the offensive, but the early list didn't ""jump"" at the start with fight-age male losses. 

The incentive for ""the Resistance"" is obvious. They plan to claim victory/they fought off Israel after the war ends. It's the same reason they publish their absurdly fake Talley of Israeli casualties and the videos of RPG ambushes that don't show impact. They can't honestly admit to the Palastinian people that 2/3rds of their battalions have been smashed. 

It's awkward for Israel because:

Israel actually has killed an absolute fuck ton of civilians. The ratio isn't quite as lopsided as the GMH Talley suggests. But 12k dead Palastinian children is a lot. The evidence that they've killed so many people is extremely well documented and the attempts to deny it or claim it's staged are really emberassing lies. 

The thing is, Israel is probably aware of this. They do go around claiming the GMH is false, but they can't actually admit that the real reason why is that it's just incomplete. 

Technically speaking, if Israel actually has killed 10k-15k resistance fighters and 25k-30k civilians, this isn't a *good* Soldier-Civilian death ratio. The US broadly achieved 2:1 in the seige of Mosul, so Israel with 1:1.5 - 1:3 still raises a bunch of uncomfortable questions. But, the fact they can't admit this leaves them open to the GMH charge of something ludicrous like 1:6 or worse. A 1:2 ratio is an exceedingly bloody war, but within defensible bounds. A 1:6 ratio is a much more credible genocide allegation. 

Conclusion:

We're left with the Gaza Ministry number because it's the only Talley of the dead that's detailed and data driven. It's not a lie, but it should not be taken as a representative. It's still useful as an absolute floor of deaths. Still, I don't think people should be using it to actually discuss the death ratio in Gaza."

My entire life, I have never known a single woman who hasn't been hurt by a man. All of my female family members have been raped. I have been raped before aswell. Whenever I tell a man about it, I am treated as though I am ""damaged goods"", a slut, even. As though I have lost my value due to being defiled. I've had an aunt get cheated on and divorced because her husband was no longer attracted to her post-pregnancy body. A pregnancy the husband insisted on, I might add.

I usually try to stay away from social media, but whenever I expose myself to it, there's tons of men complaining about women. Tons of men making negative comments about women. Too many men threatening to rape and murder women. As though their brains have rotted out with porn.

There's a lot about it that gripes me. Honestly for some reason I seem to be bombarded with men claiming that women's genitalia reveal their promiscuity. I'm sure you can derive what I mean by this. Such remarks have caused me to shut myself away from any possible romantic interaction. 

I see men complaining about how their wives have headaches or stomachaches, how they nag. That a perfect woman is nothing more than a lone pair of legs. I see men replacing their girlfriends for newer, more attractive ones. Like replacing an appliance with a new model. I see men demanding sex from women. It's always about sex. It's always sex. I always see that the most. A type of ""entitlement"" to sex.

I've dumbed down myself to a useless vessel, a whore, a nagging bitch, practically all of the terrible words you can think of because of this.

I've been treating all men as though they are out to hurt me, that their ultimate goal is to get a good lay and throw me out when better comes around. That who I am as a person doesn't matter. I treat all of them as though they are sick, disgusting deviants. It's caused my relationship with my father to strain aswell.

I am desperate to lose this view. I want to see the good in them. I want to believe there's men out there that care about me, that want to listen to what I have to say, and are genuinely interested in me as a person. I don't want to be scared or intimidated by them. I don't want to think my own father fantasizes about raping me. I want a man to think of protecting me after hearing what happened to me instead of stating my loss in value. Ive stopped being vunerable, I've stopped talking about things that will make me sound like a ""nagging bitch."" Ive stopped wearing any shoes that show my feet, because what if a random man sees them and sexualizes me? I want to be able to love a man again, properly."

I got some good responses from that post, with many people, most of them left-leaning, arguing that progressives will always advocate for the rights of the oppressed, even if the views of the oppressed conflict with those of progressives. However, I have an issue with that reasoning, and that is that the Palestinians, in my opinion, aren't truly ""oppressed."" Let me explain.

In my view, the Palestinians only have themselves to blame for their woes. They don't have their own state because they rejected deals that would've created one. They are denied entry into Israel and Egypt because neither Israel nor Egypt want to have to deal with more Palestinian terrorists. They are losing many of their own because they decided to attack Israel and kill all of the Jews for the umpteenth time. No Arab country wants Palestinian refugees because Palestinian refugees either nearly or fully destroyed their countries. In Jordan, Palestinians assassinated the king. In Lebanon, Palestinians started the Lebanese Civil War. In Kuwait, the Palestinians supported Saddam Hussein's invasion. The Palestinians destabilized Egypt as well. The list goes on. The sole thing Palestinians are known for is terrorism. Their entire national identity is centered around killing and raping innocents.

When you look at the ""Palestinian question"" this way, I'd argue that the solution is not to give Palestinians rights, but the exact opposite. The solution is to *punish* Palestinians by *denying* them rights. Over the last few decades, the Palestinians have repeatedly forfeited their right to self-determination by rejecting deals that would've given them a state and attacking Israel. No rational person should consider giving the Palestinians their own state at this point, especially since a Palestinian state would inevitably threaten Israeli security and endanger non-Muslims and LGBTQ+ people especially. Instead, Israel should give the Palestinians a choice: submit or face the consequences.

I base this idea on the Paradox of Tolerance, which states that perfect tolerance only helps intolerance and allows the intolerant to destroy tolerance. Therefore, a tolerant society must not tolerate intolerance in any way. It's why laws against employment discrimination and hate speech exist. As the vast majority of Palestinians are extremely intolerant of practically everything, especially non-Muslims (particularly Jews), women, and queer people, I believe that the Paradox of Tolerance most certainly applies to them. Thus, for the sake of tolerance, Israel must ""oppress,"" if you will, the Palestinians after the war is over. This can mean denying them basic rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of the press, due process, etc. To an extent, Israel already does this to Palestinians in the West Bank. However, I even believe that Israel should consider resorting to more draconian measures if necessary, such as forcing them to live in their own quarters or deporting them to re-education camps. If Israel's goal is to ensure a lasting peace, which it is, then Israel must consider every possible solution (other than, say, genocide).

I know these ideas are going to be unpopular, but I seriously want people to try to change my view without resorting to appeals to emotion or outright antisemitic lies."

0,2024-04-01,CMV: Judging people’s character isn’t reasonable or fair because they have no control over it,u/Delicious-Schedule-4,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bsv1be/cmv_judging_peoples_character_isnt_reasonable_or/,changemyview,"Sorry in advance if this has been posted before or is a hackneyed thought (eg we’re living in a simulation and nothing matters). I believe a person’s character is defined by their thoughts, urges, and actions, which in turn is just a product of two things: brain chemistry and external stimuli. Upon receiving an external stimulus (which could be outwardly physical like the five senses or mental like a thought or emotion), the brain produces an output, like a thought, urge, or action, and then rewires itself based on the perceived reward (how good/bad something feels, also based on neurochemistry). As a person grows, this brain chemistry and input-output relationship becomes progressively built upon and defines what a person will do, think, or feel at any given moment. The state a person ends up in is thus defined by their starting brain chemistry, the method of rewiring, (both genetic/nature) and the environment they are in (circumstantial/nurture). This is just my understanding from my limited knowledge of how the brain learns, with some concepts from reinforcement learning thrown in—very open to believing this could be wrong. But in this framework there is only the illusion of control and not control itself.

For example, imagine you had infinite computing power and some incredible simulation tools that could create a computational learning agent that would interact with a dynamic world around it. You initialize like a thousand of these agents by putting them in different environments with different starting variables, and let them loose and observe (to be fair this is almost already a reality!) The programmers/observers would likely say that any behavior is not under any moral guidelines, and understand that an agent’s output and action are just a product of the code/math, randomness, and the environment. To me, our DNA operates extremely similarly, with a similar conclusion to be drawn about our behavior. If a person commits first degree murder or another heinous crime, they had no control over whether they would have the thoughts to commit the crime, or whether they lacked the neural guardrails to prevent them from doing it. Less drastically, many don’t view addiction as a moral failure, because it’s just brain chemistry—some are inevitably more susceptible than others. Likewise if someone is “morally good” it can be argued that they were just lucky that the product of their brain chemistry and environment aligned with societal values.

Things and actions can still be judged good or bad, but they are evaluated in the context of whether they help you or not and not in the context of mortality. Therefore someone who is selfless, kind, and honest is considered good because they are less likely to harm you, while those who take pleasure in hurting others, lying, and death are more likely to harm you and are therefore bad. When expanded to the societal level, this creates cultural and social norms and laws, which are just a product of the people living in it (what people view as good and bad based on that brain chemistry) rather than some moral absolute. People are punished not because it’s fair or moral, but because of power from collective interest.

So in practice, I understand that this shouldn’t change most of how we live our lives—we still undeniably have the illusion of choice, and shouldn’t just let go of all accountability of ourselves. People should still be punished, and order should still be held. However, if we want to “rationally” maintain some construct of fairness, rather than viewing some people as good or bad, lesser or more, based on their character (those thoughts, urges, and actions), we have empathy by realizing everyone just is a person and a product of things out of their control. Rather than demonizing “evil” and casting them aside with 0 remorse, it’s something we look at with pity in that they were dealt a life of pain and suffering, both in what they received and caused. It’s reasonable to think “I would rather have this person on this earth than that person to live with for a happier life” but unreasonable to think “I am better than this person because if I were in their exact circumstance and had their same experience I would pick the more socially acceptable option” because according to this model, you really wouldn’t. It’s basically impossible to put yourself in someone else’s shoes as an exercise to think that that person should have taken a different action. Likewise, for people that are a stereotypical “saint,” that is the hand they were dealt. 

Very interested in hearing counterpoints from the scientific and philosophical angle, as admittedly it’s the best model of humanity that I can think of (and I’m not a philosopher so I probably can’t think of a lot). Also admittedly, this probably does sound like a big religion influenced-“everyone deserves love” idea, which I’m sure has some criticism. Thanks everyone!

For example, taking English which is spoken globally in hundreds of varieties, I would argue that British Standard English is the better than all others.

My reason for this is that I believe the purpose of language is communication and a dialect’s quality can be measured as its success rate when being used to communicate with other speakers of the language regardless of dialect. Due to historical factors like colonization, cultural imperialism as well as continued global presence, British English is usually sufficient to communicate with speakers of other English dialects. 

The same cannot be said, at least to the same extent, for other dialects like African-American English, Australian English, Southern American English, Caribbean English etc. To be clear, I’m not saying these dialects are wrong (whatever that would mean) or worse in some technical sense like the grammar rules but from a purely utilitarian sense of they are less understandable to those not familiar with that dialect.

To change my view, please explain to me why either I’m wrong in my understanding of some dialects being more universally understandable or that this standard itself is an inappropriate measure to use. Thank you!"

I think the majority of Americans reject a power grabber, a bully and a hate speaker.

Oh I know the GOP arguments very well. “He’s just rough around the edges.”  

I disagree. Trump’s careless disrespect and dangerous words that he spews regularly toward the courts, judges and government officials shows contempt and total disregard for the safety of his targets as well as their family members. 
It’s hate speech.  It’s foolish, childish and reckless.

I think the majority of Americans who don’t hate him so much as they reject him as a leader because of his hateful rhetoric and dangerous actions.

Then there is the matter of power-grabbing by bullying his own VP to overturn the election as well as Georgia’s election official Brad Raffensperger.

I anticipate his supporters have their own narratives that usually goes like this: “It’s a witch hunt! He’s a victim. THEY are picking on him!”

Trump once famously said I could shoot someone in the middle of Manhattan and my supporters would still be loyal.  Unfortunately MAGAs seem to have lived up to that statement as one would think of religious cult members.  Exactly who are the brainwashed ones here?  

I’m not sure who is scarier, Trump or the cult members who will jump off a cliff if he tells them they should?

Reality check  #1: 
“They ALL have it in for Trump.”  Explain to me how is this narrative believable.

Who are “THEY” exactly? Be honest. Take a look at just a small sample of the GOP names below:

House chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, former VP Mike Pence, his hand-picked former Chief Justice Bill Barr, his former attorney Sidney Powell, former General David Maddox, former White House aide Cassidy Jacqueline Hutchinson, Brad Raffensperger, Chris Christie and even his former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. C’ mon now, I mean these aren’t Dems or Libs.  These are his hand-picked people.  Help me and non-MAGAs everywhere try to make sense of your narrative!?

Let me get this straight.  So even the jury’s, a mix of GOP & Dems are picking on him too?  Republican judges & American juries!  

So when jurors have decided to find him guilty it means it’s a political witch hunt?  But wait!  What if the jurors are Republicans?

WOW!  Now THAT is a helluva conspiracy alright! They’re ALL in on it, ay?

Btw, speaking as someone from a military and law enforcement family; Trump called a legit war hero “a loser.” So now he’s also calling Capitol Police Officers “thugs” and “murderers”.

Sure I have no problem saying I think Biden has cognitive decline. That said, is it really that hard to understand why the majority of Americans like me reject this candidate as their leader?

What I mean by maximising profit is the way companies try to introduce unnecessary additional pricing, or reduction in quality to barrel-scrape the most profit.

additional pricing are value added ""features"" in their products that are either not related to improvement in quality or for things that should've been there in the first place, e.g. microtransactions in single player games, subscription for carplay/android auto in cars.

reduction in quality, think Boeing.

I would argue that for the most part, unpopular profit maximising strategies is not a good way to increase shareholder value in the long run. At most, the extra profit or share value gained are short term and a money grab for the current C-suite lineup. This is because the unpopular decisions they make is likely to catch up to them in the long run.

Boeing's shares are only half from peak, and even if we could reasonably expect it to bounce back in the future, it creates uncertainty, insolvency, and lost interest for shareholders at the very least.

From what I can tell, even if these strategies work most times (people don't know or eventually don't care, and media scrutiny dies down), they need to be lucky every time for it to translate to long term shareholder value. Only one truely unpopular/illegal practice might bring the whole operation down.

Be it corruption, rape, murder, robbery, etc.
But justifying a crime does not change the fact that it is a crime.

Digital piracy is a crime not because a person takes something without paying for it, no. This is a crime because a person takes something from someone without permission. This is the same reason why we consider slavery a crime, but voluntarism does not.

In general, people need to be taught from childhood that they cannot take someone else’s thing without the owner’s permission. Let's say on the street I find the latest model gaming console, say Playstation 5. It can be any thing, clothes, car and money. 
Of course I can take it, and of course there are many people who will not feel guilty or ashamed for this, unfortunately. And of course, if the police don’t catch me, I will be clean before the law despite the crime I committed. 

Of course, I agree that there is no need to go to extremes and cut off someone’s hand or head for stealing a piece of bread, but why it was impossible to ask for permission and help, that’s what surprises me.
But my mother taught me that you should never take someone else’s thing without permission, and especially against his will. And I think this is the best way to live. After all, the best life is a life without the oppression of guilt, shame and regret."

With that being said, the most common and well received argument I've read against the decision or ethics of suicide, is one that invokes nature. 

The most fundamental instinct of all organic life, is avoidance of death. I believe this argument to be an inadequate one, for much of the same reasons statutory rape exists. 

An inability to accurately asses the weight of one's actions. It wouldn't matter if you placed the average person in an objectively hopeless situation, they would likely still avoid death as much as humanly possible. 

In pointing to the starved and exhausted, diseased and depraved, you're only further emphasizing the irrationality of it all. Effectively proving the exact opposite point, that a mind maybe most lucid when distanced from it's immediate morality. 

Barreling towards fate is inferably distressing, not soberingly eye opening. What deters suicide is fear, and the rationalization comes after. Death maybe most virtuously imposed, given an external analysis of your circumstances. 

Or at least playing the devil's advocate."

This measure is essential for safeguarding the well-being of both the children and the parents. Too often, children are raised in challenging circumstances due to parental mental health issues, financial instability, or other factors. By prioritizing the upbringing of children in healthy and supportive environments, we can foster a brighter future for society as a whole. This approach not only reduces societal ills like crime and suicide but also nurtures individuals who will positively impact our world.

Conceiving a child should not be regarded solely as a personal freedom, as it encompasses the responsibility of nurturing a human life. Children deserve to be recognized as individuals with their own needs and rights, rather than mere extensions of their parents. The well-being and rights of the child must always take precedence over the desires of the parent.

Some may argue that such legislation could lead to eugenic practices or selective breeding. However, the intention behind this proposal is not to promote a superior race but rather to ensure that all children are born into environments conducive to their growth and development. This is about providing every child with an equal opportunity for success, regardless of their background or ancestry.

This is the core of why most purported solutions are bound to fail:

1 state: Jews in Israel are reasonable to fear what would happen with an Arab majority. 

2 states: the Palestinians won't accept Israel existing. Israel would also be unwilling to repatriate 700.000 settlers.

This year, we weren't so lucky when using Carbon Taxi, though we did luck out with the fact that there was a greater abundance of rideshare.  
  
When I called Carbon taxi to reserve some rides, I got this message:  
  
***You've reached Carbon Taxi. We are no longer in business and cannot help you. You can thank Joe Biden for this because nobody wants to get off their fat asses and go to work.***

0,2024-04-01,CMV: Class-based affirmative action would have almost identical problems to the race-based version,u/AuroraItsNotTheTime,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bt84zw/cmv_classbased_affirmative_action_would_have/,changemyview,"There are some common arguments against race-based affirmative action that interest me:

1. Affirmative action is actually racist *against* black people. It demonstrates a bigotry of low expectations, that its supporters don’t expect black people to achieve as much as white people do, so they feel the need to patronize them and treat them as inferior.
2. Affirmative action would put many black people in situations that they are not intellectually ready for, and in which they are operating at a disadvantage compared to their more academically successful peers without the affirmative action boost.
3. Affirmative action undermines the success of any black person, because people will think that their accomplishments are only because of affirmative action.
4. Affirmative action, in providing a boost to black people at the expense of other races, is literally racist.
5. By acknowledging race, rather than trying to ignore it, it just causes MORE division between the races rather than less. The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race, the story goes, is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.

My interest in these arguments is that I think they would also apply to class-based affirmative action, which seems to have a great deal of support across the political spectrum. People act like class-based affirmative action is way better and solves all of the problems, but I don’t think it addresses any of them.

A class-based affirmative action would be a big neon sign that says “we don’t think poor people are smart enough to do it on their own,” and it would give poor people access to colleges where they are the dumbest ones in the room, and where they are more likely to fail out. Every poor person’s accomplishments would be undermined, because people would think they were just affirmative action cases that couldn’t cut it on their own merit.

Not to mention that in favoring one class over others, it would be literally classist (unless of course “reverse classism” isn’t real classism, or if classism equal “prejudice plus power,” two arguments that are widely rejected and mocked in the race context). And acknowledging class instead of ignoring it would just sow more discord and division between poor people and rich people, instead of less. Isn’t the best way to stop class discrimination to stop discriminating on the basis of class?

So what are people talking about? What am I missing? Does it solve ANY of the problems? I don’t think so. It just swaps “poor people” for “black people” in all of them.

122,2024-04-01,CMV: It's never a good idea to start smoking.,u/vuzz33,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bt8wue/cmv_its_never_a_good_idea_to_start_smoking/,changemyview,"I've never smoked, and I'm the minority in my circle of acquaintances. It remains a mystery to me why so many choose to start considering all the drawbacks that come with it. I post this CMV not to make me consider smoking (of course) but to learn if there are good aspects that might somewhat compensate the downsides.

From what I've seen and learned there are basically two phases for a smoker:

1. You start smoking because of others, either by peer pressure or to help integrate.
2. You then continue to smoke because of habits.

Not a very great premise and it gets worse when comparing the drawbacks with the benefits:

* **Increased risk of cancer.** Probably the worst of the list but often disregarded because it's not 100% certainty and only appears after years or decades.
* **Breathing problem.** Whatever physical activities you do, smoking will always badly impact your performance.
* **A plethora of other health issues.** (Not wanting to do an exhaustive lists)
* **Large expense.** Cigarettes are (depends of the country) very costly, and their price continues to increase. I've trouble imagining how excessive a montly expense for a heavy smoker must be. To make matters worse, it contributes to enrich one of the worst and unethical industries that exist.
* **Disturb everyone around.** And that not even mentionning the risk of passive smoking. I personnaly hate when someone smokes next to me.
* **Nasty smell.** Even after smoking the odor sticks to you. One of my colleague next to me smoke a lot, it's really awful.
* **Environnemental impact.** That point doesn't directly impact the smoker, but without even mentioning the industry, just seing all the stubs on the ground is enough to make it on the list.
* **Hard to stop.** Probably the nastiest effect of them all, it creates, like any other drug, a dependence. Making it especially hard to quit it. And even if you do, the risk of relapse will always be there.

As for the benefits (imo):

* **Relaxing effect.** It seems to help to loosen up and reduce stress. But as any other drug, effects become less effective as time passes. In reality, it creates a need that wasn't there at the origin. So I don't think I can even consider it as a benefit.
* **It helps socialize.** I admit that cigarette breaks at work, at parties or elsewhere is a good moment to chat.
* **Taste?** If you are wealthy enough to buy quality tobacco, then you might find enjoyable and slightly less toxic varieties. I did taste an expensive Cuban cigar once and even then it probably would have been more pleasant to lick a piece of coal.

So to resume, smoking has short and long-term self-destructive effects as well as being a disturbance non-smokers, all for a couple of benefits. I have been asked several times why I've never smoked, well the answer is here. And as of now, I don't understand why anyone would want to start after pondering over these points. Anything I missed?"

So often, people I meet say that the world is “fucked”, and humans are responsible. 

Some examples of the things we should apparently feel guilty for: 

	1.	The systems we’ve built (usually liberal, democratic capitalism),

	2.	Our treatment of the environment and animals, and

	3.	Our treatment of each other (war, persecution), etc.

It’s implied, even stated, that the world might be better off without humans or that we need to overhaul our systems entirely.

Briefly, here’s why I disagree with each:

	1.	Humanity has made significant progress in disease reduction, food provision, social acceptance, and empowerment. Although we’ve had setbacks, overall, progress trends upwards. Most importantly, mistakes have taught us valuable lessons: generally speaking, we know what works. 

	2.	Climate change and environmental damage are real and urgent issues, but we have the tools to address them. Fossil fuels enabled incredible achievements and extraordinary improvements in living standards that would been simply impossible without them. Moving forward, technology will help us develop more sustainable ways of living and protect vulnerable species.

	3.	The natural world without humans is bleak; animals face constant threats and live in fear. Despite the horrors of war, we’ve improved significantly, with deaths from conflict dropping considerably throughout the 20th century and most of the 21st. Diplomacy, peace talks, and collaboration have proven effective in preventing conflicts.

Why does any of this matter? 

A common theme throughout my argument is the idea that we have learnt lessons from our mistakes.

In short, we know what works. We know how to build healthcare systems that keep more infants alive. We know how to regulate chemical industries in ways that mean fewer environmental accidents happen. We know how to prevent nuclear war between superpowers from occurring.

Guilt encourages radicalism, which in turn encourages us to forget what we’ve learnt and attempt new, untested and potentially dangerous approaches. "

Europeans have had a huge hand in the writing of modern history, and they wrote the history of Africa WHILE the slave trade was going on in the 17-18th century. This likely means that they literally could not indicate publicly that Africans were at any point more sophisticated than Europeans. This would obviously destroy the European worldview on race dynamics constructed over the last 300yrs in Europe. Secondly, indicating that slaves or black people were capable of any feet of sophisticated civilization would very likely be used by  abolitionists against slave owners putting their multimillion dollar slave industry at risk.  As a result, the conclusion by early Europeans was that “Africans didn’t do anything 😇”.

Interestingly is seems that many Europeans traveled to Africa in the 18th century with the express purpose of disproving the idea that black Africans were responsible for any of the advanced civilizations in North and East Africa during Africas humid period. This is when the Hamitic hypothesis was proposed which stated that the Hamites (A Hebrew reference to black Africans) were actually Caucasians with black colored skin and all the advancements in Africa were actually constructed by white people who pitched civilization then disappeared into the local African populations. As bazar as that sounds this was the leading theory of the origins of African civilization and it was from this theory that the ongoing race of the Egyptians debate kicked off. Scientific racism was used to rebrand Africans as being subhumans in an attempt to further validate the conclusion that SSA have nothing to do with the advanced NA communities or with the modern world at all despite the Abrahamic religions as well as manuscripts from Greeks and Romans that say otherwise. 

Something that also bothers me tho is that even tho mainstream archeologists at the time concluded that Hamites were Caucasians and totally distinct from negros they still used the curse of Ham as a justification for the ongoing enslavement of Africans. So they put in history books that Hamites were Caucasian so the achievements of the Hamites (Kushites, Egyptians, Libyans, Canaanites) are that of white people but when asked why they enslaved the negros the response from Antebellum slave owners was because the negros were Hamites. Do you see the disconnect here? When it comes to the success of the Hamites = obviously white people but when it comes to the idol worshiping race of African Canaanites who were cursed to be slaves for life in the Bible = clearly black people. 

Being that the curse of Ham was the justification of the Saharan and Atlantic slave trade. The focus of black history and African history should be analyzing the origins of this Abrahamic tale indicating that blacks are slaves. Once learned focus on how the story of Ham was used by multiple different people groups following Abrahamic faith to enslave Africans and destabilize African communities throughout history. Basically, as long as the Abrahamic religions were around there were groups of people actively looking to enslave blacks and loot their resources in the name of Hams (Canaans) curse or at the very least treat black Africans poorly.  Finally, do a close analysis of the Hamitic people and their origins. They accomplished some very impressive achievements in history that have greatly contributed to larger global society.  Finding out if they were actually Caucasians or Negros as indicated by slave owners, should be extremely important for the black community. With the above I feel like we have a more solid foundation to address modern racial issues and their origins. Also it’s an avenue to actually teach the history of Africa (Hamites) in school so the only thing we no about Africa isn’t 1pge on Bantu migration and 12 chapters on slavery.

If I were the judge in charge of sentencing I’d probably give SBF 12 years and EH 18, that would seem fair to me."

But I believe good economic policies will be more beneficial to preventing gun violence, and most other crimes, than any bans or restrictions on gun ownership.

Giving people the means to live comfortably will take away their need to resort to crime and violence in the first place. There will still be some crime and violence, but the countries with the least poverty also have the least crime and gun violence.

We can’t have rising cost of living with stagnant wages and wonder why crime rates are rising. If everyone has their basic needs met and gun violence is still high then we can talk about assault rifle bans and magazine limits. "

Firstly having Chef be Eric Cartmans father would have been ironic and funny because Eric Cartman a obessed, white, racist fourth grader who has been spewing hatred over the years. The idea Cartman is born to a white mother and black father would have been game changing for the young boy and hilarious as he goes through a drastic turn. Second of Cartman's true father Jack Tenorman has never been in Cartman's life to discipline him nor guide into becoming a better man, Jack Tenorman and Liane Cartman are one of the many reason why Eric Cartman is evil he has no proper parents to keep him grounded, Cartman needs a positve male role model in his life. That male role model that comes in is Chef as out of all the characters in South Park Chef is arguably one of the few sensible characters on the show. Throughout his existence Chef has always been guiding Cartman, giving him advice and helping him along the boys. Evidence to further prove this is when Chef was going to join the super adventure club, Cartman was distraught and weeped showing the care Cartman has for chef while Stan, Kyle and Kenny comforted him. 

So ultimately those are the reasons why I think Chef should have been revealed to be Cartmans true dad not Jack Tenorman, anyways I hope you enjoyed my point and please try to change my mind thanks. "
0,2024-04-01,CMV: Nietzche's will to power is the only philosophy for morality that makes any sense in an atheistic worldview,u/FreakinTweakin,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1btg31h/cmv_nietzches_will_to_power_is_the_only/,changemyview,"Please read this all very carefully, so I don't have to straighten out things that ive already clearly stated.

Premise: human rights is a moral statement, and morality can only come from a divine source. i.e human rights (outside of legal and social constructs) can only come from god. There are many claims that morality comes from elsewhere, but these philosophies are blatantly incorrect. Morality implies a set of higher eternal unchanging truths existing separately from ourselves, whereas things like empathy are biological components of the flesh (which not everyone has mind you). What does this mean? It means that oppressing people is *not morally wrong*. So while religions might say some things are a sin and oppress people for that reason. Under atheism, believing in human rights is also in andof itself contradictory.

>furthermore

Nietzsche seeked to create a form of morality in a world without God. And he failed. Instead, he came up with the only logical conclusion that is actually there. The only thing humans really have as a guide that is real, is a will to power. It is the driving force of the Ubermensch's life. And that the ubermensch should reject what he calls ""slave morality"", aka the belief that the weak and downtrodden and the lower classes are morally superior to the upper classes and they should be sympathized with (he calls Christianity a slave morality religion btw). And that we should instead embrace master morality, and seek to embody the will to power.

This is the only thing that really makes sense in a truly atheistic and materialistic world. Every alleged source of ethics outside of God is a cope. 

I expect this to be a very controversial thread.

0,2024-04-01,CMV: Male dogs should not be neutered by default,u/hwulfrick,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bth223/cmv_male_dogs_should_not_be_neutered_by_default/,changemyview,"With ""by default"" I mean something like ""without taking into consideration first if it’s really medically necessary"".  
I feel like this ""neuter by default"" attitude is quite prevalent, even within vets and other care staff, and I've received more than the occasional disapproving look/comment when vets notice that my male dog is intact.  
I understand that there are some benefits to neutering, but I see them mostly as benefits for the dog owners more than for the dog. Yes, my male dog sometimes has an attitude, and I understand that I have to be extra careful around female dogs, especially if they are in heat. But I see that as part of the complete package of owning a dog, and I love him dearly for all that he is (1.5 yo Shih Tzu btw).  
The argument of neutering as a preventative measure for potential future problems also doesn't hold a lot of water for me. For example, most women do not choose to get mastectomies even though breast cancer is the most likely cancer for many (some women certainly do, to be clear, but most don't). Why not? because the risk-to-benefit balance does not justify doing so in most cases.   
Here are some of the downsides to neutering that I foresee:  
The dog goes through a traumatic, invasive procedure that causes him pain and fear for several days.  
He has to wear a collar/cone and take medication for several days, which can be a battle for some dogs, mine included. More pain and fear and frustration for all parties.  
Extreme and permanent changes in hormone balance, metabolism, energy levels, dietary needs, and who knows what else (I know lack of testosterone fucks you up real good from seeing my father battle prostate cancer for 10+ years).  
All that without his consent of course because dogs can't consent DUH. I feel incredibly selfish just considering it. I want that if/when the time comes to neuter my dog, that it be medically necessary and for HIS benefit.  
The reason I'm in CMV is of course that I want to know if I'm making a grave mistake. At the end of the day all I want is what's best for him. [Dog tax](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Ftk7lw8tmqfdc1.jpeg). Thanks for reading."

75,2024-04-01,CMV: The death penalty should continue to NOT exist in Canada.,u/owooji,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bthvng/cmv_the_death_penalty_should_continue_to_not/,changemyview,"Admittedly, I am entering a debate for this topic soon. I personally do not think that the death penalty should exist. I would love to hear other's opinions on this, as every site of information arguing for the death penalty does not seem to change my opinion.  
Thus, my reasons for why the death penalty (also known as capital punishment) should not exist in Canada:  
  
Death is irreversible. Courts cannot 100% prove the accused is guilty, and will never be able to do so. Having even one criminal falsely executed would put the entire death penalty argument to rest.  
  
The death penalty may actually be a ""better"" punishment for criminals compared to suffering behind bars, as it prevents their possible torture and frees them mentally. The criminal does not have to reflect their actions or suffer the inhumane conditions within a prison.  
This logic can also be applied to the ""providing closure for victims/families"" argument.  
  
No individual or group should have the power to kill other individuals without consequences.  
  
Canada has a well established justice system and ample resources to imprison criminals adequately.  
An argument that I have recently come across FOR the death penalty is that in some societies, they lack the resources to imprison individuals. However, we are all aware that Canada is not one of those societies.  
  
If possible, I would love to hear rebuttals for each reason."

Person A then replies ""I would never do such thing!"" while Person B replies ""I don't have a gun"". Both of their replies are essentially negative, but we do know that B's answer has implications that A's doesn't.

An example of something similar happening in reality is when people deny that certain parties or politicians are either far-right or fascists by claiming that ""They don't even advocate for a holocaust or \*insert any other policy that they could only do at the height of their power\*"".

Which brings us to the issue at hand: Is racism against a white person even possible? The answer we get is usually ""Non-white people cannot be racist against white people because they're not in power"", but for me that's like responding that you wouldn't shoot a dog because you don't have a gun.

Now, there is a certain logic to this argument: ""Race"" was an invention of the modern age to justify hierarchies and power relations of the time, to the point that laws and structures were made with that exact purpose, some of them that survive (Or, at the very least, the spirit of them) to this very day. Those laws and structures were made to benefit the ruling class of the time (Which was white) at the expense of every other group, that much is a fact.

The issue is that modern power relations are way more complex and intersected, in a way that it is highly possible for one person to be an opressor and an oppressed at the same time: The small kid at school is subjected to the wills of the big kid due to his size, who is subjected to the wills of his mother due to her parental status, who is subjected to her husband because he has the financial power, who is subjected to his boss because he controls such financial power, who is subjected to the state because it makes the laws.

In this world where it is possible for a lot of people to have ""small powers"" over ""small domains"". Racist laws, historically, often limited the amount of ""small powers"" and ""small domains"" that people of color could have (Or whether they could have them at all), but nevertheless those exist today, and nothing inherently prevents a person of color to use such to discriminate either other people-of-color or even white people.

Which is why the phrase ""Non-white people **CAN NEVER** be racist against white people"" never seemed to make sense to me."

The reason for this anticipated ""Doom"" is usually some combination of climate change and/or economic uncertainty.

It is basically YOLO for people who think the world is ending.

This trend makes no sense and is often counterproductive, especially for people who believe the ""Doom"" is economic uncertainty.

Climate Change is absolutely real and will cause numerous challenges.  But, those issues will continue to manifest over the course of decades and centuries.  We are not talking about an imminent cataclysm like an asteroid impact.

You know what will help you weather and react to those changes?  Savings.

Savings makes it far easier to move to a new state, country or just to higher ground if you are concerned about that.  

Designer luxury goods are probably not going to help you in any serious environmental crisis.

Doom Spenders fearing economic uncertainty make even less sense.

The best way to mitigate economic uncertainty is to have an emergency fund and a savings/investing rate that allows your wealth to compound over time.

One of the best hedges against inflation is investing aggressively into broad market stock indexes.  Those underlying companies will eventually raise the prices of their goods and services to match inflation and your shares will appreciate as a result.

Doom Spending makes a person less prepared and more vulnerable to whatever ""Doom"" they believe might be coming.

[US senator Lindsay Graham called statements critical of Israel denying aid into Gaza as 'blood libel.'](https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1772722472309190757) Blood libels were the belief in medieval Europe that Jews were using Christian blood for rituals. I have no idea of the connection between Israel denying aid shipments and Jews using Christian blood. Again, Graham is a goy. 

[President of the ADL compared to keffiyah to a swaztika](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGH95F8BiKM). That is insane. Imagine if the head of a Palestinian organization in the US compared wearing a kippah to a swaztika. 

I've also experienced it in my own life. I'm an elementary school teacher. I signed a petition supporting Boycott, Divestment Sanctions in 2022 - on my own time, off school property. A member of the community found out from a newspaper article, called the principal of the school to complain. Two gentile administrators called me into the office to discuss my ""antisemitism."" For the record I'm a Jewish person whose university degree is in Jewish history. So the conversation was a little silly. 

I worry that the trivializing of the term antisemitism, and the implied connection between all Jews and the Israeli government from it's defenders, will render the term meaningless. Boy who cried wolf. "
22,2024-04-01,"CMV: Unlike what we see in mainstream politics, there is no inherent tenet within Conservatism that prohibits 'big government'.",u/Vincent-_-Leo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1btmcn5/cmv_unlike_what_we_see_in_mainstream_politics/,changemyview,"For the purposes of this CMV, I want to define 'big government' not as a government that is *excessively* large, but simply a government that is *larger* than what we perceive to be a 'small government'. An example of a 'big government' would be a government that has a high tax rate and that provides substantial amounts of social services. 

In the modern (American) political field, the largest party that represents ""Conservative"" beliefs would be the the Republican party. It has become apparent that one of the core beliefs of this party is the concept of a 'small' or 'limited' government. 

In 2018, the (current) house speaker Mike Johnson published the ""[7 Core Principles of Conservatism](https://mikejohnson.house.gov/7-core-principles-of-conservatism/)"" where he outlined what he regarded as the most important tenets of Conservatism, and how the Republican party should shape itself around these principles. Principle number two is ""Limited Government"". This principle is defined as: ""for individual liberty to be championed, government must be reduced."" This is a commonly shared view among much of the republican base, and it has now made it's way into the speakership. 

I consider myself to be a Conservative, and I take particular issue with statements like this. Conservatism itself does not have some inherent belief that government has to be small or limited. On the contrary, Conservatism is built atop several ideas that *require* a larger government to be successfully implemented. 

What I would perceive to be the most important principle of Conservatism is the idea of the social contract or the consent of the governed. This principle is often invoked when expressing the desire for a limited state, conflating the idea of a population's consent for a government with a population's desire for a limited government. One such case of this occurring would be in the same document that I previously cited, where Johnson declares, ""only by the consent of the governed, and is more efficient and less corrupt when it is limited in its size and scope"". The reason that this previous conflation is incorrect is because the governed could simply consent to a bigger government. Many governed people throughout history have willingly consented to the government encroaching more and more into their lives. Take a city with large social programs funded by extensive tax rates. These policies were oftentimes voted into place, demonstrating the consent for what is perceived as 'big government'. How does this violate any social contract? Why should Conservatism (or at least the Republican party) be opposed to something like this?

I feel as though this comes without the need to express, but there is a flip side to this. There are certainly societies where the government has expanded beyond the role that social contract has allotted it. In such cases, Conservatism would (rightfully) call for a limiting of the government. My argument is against this becoming a sort of default that we see in this modern day.

Furthermore, there is another universally-recognized element of Conservatism that would require a 'big government'. That would be the desire to ensure social cohesion. The best way to ensure social cohesion is for the government promote traditional institutions and traditional culture to its constituents. In modern America this would translate into a promotion of the nuclear family, the military, organized religion, and rule of law. Most Conservatives (even those that argue that Conservatism necessitates a limited government) would agree that the promotion of social cohesion through these means is a good thing that follows the tenets of Conservatism. Citing Mr. Johnson again, Principle #3: ""The Rule of Law"" Principle #4: ""Peace through Strength"". The only problem with this is that all of these things- promoting institutions and culture- are universally considered tendencies of a 'big government'. How can Conservatism necessitate the limiting of government, but also desire the upkeep of a nation's social cohesion that will require tendencies of a 'big government'? It is a manufactured hypocrisy that would be completely eliminated by following the actual tenets of Conservatism. 

All in all, my grievances lie with the way my beliefs are portrayed in the mainstream. To any attentive onlookers, it is easy to spot hypocritical sentiments within this mainstream version of Conservatism that I believe turn many off to the movement. ""How can Conservatives support expanding the military but be against any extra spending in social programs?"" they may ask. ""How can Conservatives support the rule of law, but also be against any suspected encroachments of the 'social contract' in the name of the ultimate personal liberty?"" they may wonder. In my view, these hypocrisies are not inherently found in Conservatism, but just in the way Conservatism has been butchered by the Republican party."

Let it be clear that I think that the situation happening is really bad, with a lot of innocent civilians being harmed. But I find it very weird that some people claim that zionism is worse compared to nazism because it kinda downplays the horrors brought by Nazi Germany duing WW2.

A quick google search shows that the innocent casualties of the Israel-Hamas conflict is 31000 people. Posts online would often emphasize that a lot of these casualties are children.

Doing another quick google search on ""how many children were killed by nazi germany"" will give you a number of 1.5 million Jewish children from the first result of that search.

Again I would like to emphasize that both situations are bad with many innocent people being hurt. But please be objective on the numbers. Saying that Netanyahu is worse when compared to Hitler is nonsense."

I think we really need to change our form of democracy and I think it’s shit. The Checks and Balances system has worked for the last two centuries, but it’s gotten unmanageable now. If you ask the average voter whether or not we should get all the 65+ Senators to do mandatory IQ tests for them to stay in power, and that they’d be fired if they cannot show themselves competent enough to rule, it’s likely they’ll say yes. Now, if you were to propose a bill that mandated this, it would die in the Senate. 

And it’s always the Senate. I think the Senate shouldn’t exist and that it doesn’t represent the population’s position as well as the House does. I think without a Senate, the USA would be easier to reform. 

There’s another thing about this, the two party system. While the USA doesn’t officially have a two party system, the public is divided mainly between two major parties. It has been this way since the beginning. The only election where a third party has gotten enough votes to make a difference, 1912, it simply resulted in one of the two parties winning. Many people consider voting for a third party to be wasting your vote, meaning the average person will vote either Republican or Democrat, Red or Blue, or Elephant or Donkey. Then so much of the country is gerrymandered to by the two major parties that a few states decide entire elections.

TL;DR The Government won’t allow any meaningful change that threatens anyone’s position, and there isn’t much of way to change this because they’ll shoot down any reforms."

I'm a recent graduate from a tradeschool for electrical and currently working in the field but I've begun to question if this is really want to do for the rest of my life. I have constant fears of all the health risks that come with working in construction and I'm not a fan of getting up in tight spaces and getting all dusty and dirty. The company I am with now is a good company and I got in through a family connection.

I've thought about changing careers but I have no idea what else I would want to do. Schools never really been my thing but I think I would be willing to give it another shot if I was to go back to college if I found a program that interests me. To be fair since second semester of Grade 10, my high school years were messed up due to Covid so I didn't learn much as it was all online and super easy to cheat my way through, now I look back and wish I would have taken it more seriously and actually paid attention and put in the effort

But the issue is I cant seem to find something that interests me and I'm scared of wasting time taking something and then ending up not liking it and then that's time and money that was wasted. Growing up I've always been interested in electronics and computers and the way things work, never would I have ever thought I would have gotten into electrical.

 My parents get frustrated whenever I mention how I don't think I like what I'm currently doing and they call me lazy and think that ""I just don't want to work and I want everything handed to me in life"" which is not true, I would love to work but I also want to enjoy what I do.

Ive been working part time at a grocery store since Grade 11 and when I first started there I hated it but it grew on me over the past few years. So maybe my current job will grow on me, but I'm not sure if I constantly worry about all the health risks involved and don't like getting all dusty and dirty

I think my issue is I just have a poor mindset where I have a hard time accepting failure and I quit easily and being too afraid of the unknown thus holding me back. I get told all the time ""you are so young you have so much time"" but it doesn't really feel like it, its so expensive nowadays to live in Canada it feels like if I don't take on a high paying career I'm not gonna make it in life. Many people always tell me how smart they think I am but most days I feel like the dumbest person ever who cant think for himself and constantly has to get others opinions or approval.

The vast majority of Westerners (especially Americans who live an ocean away) should shut up about this conflict because none of them know what they are talking about. 

They all formed opinions on it because it is a big news item and they get a bunch of social media and feel good points for strictly taking one side and pretending the other side are all terrorists and baby killers..

I had someone try to tell me today Israelis are white. And descended from Europe. Like all of them. 

And no amount of y'know, FACTS mattered to this person. Because both sides can say whatever they want and get immediately reinforced even if it's bullshit. And question anything, and I mean ANYTHING and you either support genocide or support terrorism. 

And I'm frankly sick of it dominating conversations everywhere and just watching people spew bullshit they don't know about and, most importantly, WILL NEVER EFFECT THEM FOR EVEN A SECOND. All their bullshit opinions do nothing except make it easier for all the people in power. Hamas. IDF. Whatever. The dumbass online rhetoric only helps them and their propaganda. Doesn't do dick for the regular people who just would like to go to bed without worrying about if they're going to die (and don't come in telling me ""ONLY MY SIDE WORRIES ABOUT THAT"" they are two sides both living in an active war zone and fed propaganda that the enemy is ready to strike any minute THEY ALL FEEL THAT FEAR). 

Shut the fuck up and worry about your own shit. I don't think we should be providing anything to either side. And frankly that's all just a political game that has nothing to do with that conflict anyway. No leadership in America cares about Palestinians or Israelis.

0,2024-04-02,CMV: We could all benefit from from white people engaging in positive ethnocultural communities.,u/OhDeliaDelia,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1btpi1q/cmv_we_could_all_benefit_from_from_white_people/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I am a white person.

That said, I'm only a white person in that I'm not anything else. In my opinion, whiteness should only be defined as what it is not, because there never has been a unified 'white identity,' contrary to the teachings of ideologies which build on this myth. I only ever want to be a  'white person' when discussing topics such as race and ethnicity, e.g. here and now.

With that out of the way. Many people are drawn towards extremist, isolationist, supremacist ideologies because they lack support systems, and feel they don't belong within existing communities. The longer they are indoctrinated, the less they are going to question rhetoric, etc.  
In my country (Australia) most white people know barely anything about their family histories going back beyond a generation or two; on my dad's side, I'm one of those people: I'm told that I have English/Irish/Scottish/Welsh roots, but nothing qualifies this besides the few surnames I know. 

For most of us, I'd say this situation is not ideal but also not a serious problem. For a certain percentage, however, this lack of ethnocultural identity can turn toxic. A lot of white people (mistakenly) feel that they are being asked to feel guilty or ashamed of histories and identities they have little connection to and no perceived control over. I don't agree with this perception, but I also won't deny that it's a recurring phenomenon. And the really dangerous aspect of this is that some of those people are targeted for radicalization by white supremacist groups.

Using my own country as an example, I'd like to see more x-Australian communities, i.e. Irish Australian, German Australian, Italian Australian, Polish Australian, etc. which focus on the positive aspects of these cultures. The 'dark side' of histories and cultures shouldn't be, well, whitewashed, but put in perspective so there is more to bond over than a shared sense of culpability. Of course, there should be NO tolerance for supremacist rhetoric, and people of any ethnic or racial background should feel free to contribute. This could provide a 'healthy alternative' for a vulnerable demographic.

To be clear, I'd also other ethnocultural communities celebrated, not just European ones. I wouldn't describe this as an unopopular opinion, however.

So what do others think? Is this a terrible idea? Is it one of those ideas that could work in theory, but in practice turn toxic? I have my doubts in this regard. Might setting up inclusive, anti-discriminatory spaces prove useful, or provide further opportunities for radicalization?"

The very idea of somebody governing somebody else is inhuman.

Government is a game, the ugliest and the dirtiest game in the world.

But there are people in the lowest state of consciousness who enjoy it: these are the politicians. The only joy of a politician is to govern, to be in power, to enslave people The greatest desire of all those who have reached to the peaks of consciousness has been the dream that one day we can get rid of all governments. That day will be the greatest in the whole history - past, present, future - of man, because getting rid of all governments will mean destroying the ugliest game, the game the politicians have been playing for centuries.

They have made man just a chess piece, and they have created so much fear, fear that without government there will be anarchy, disorder, chaos ... everything will be destroyed. And the strangest thing is that we go on believing this nonsense.

Just look at the past five thousand years. Can you conceive that if there was no government at all in the world things would have been worse? In what way? In three thousand years, five thousand wars have been fought. Do you think more would have been possible without government - that more chaos was possible, more crime was possible.

What have these governments done? They have not done anything for the people except exploit them, exploit their fear, and set them against each other. A continuity of war somewhere or other on the earth is almost an absolute necessity for politicians to exist.

Adolf Hitler, in his autobiography, has many insights; and he is a man worth understanding because he is the purest politician - I mean, the dirtiest. He says that war is an absolute necessity if you want to remain in power. If you cannot create war people start thinking of you as nobody. Only in wartime are heroes born.

Is it not ""cruel and unusual"" to force a dying animal to stay alive just because you dictate it should, and because it would make you personally more happy? It is. So, why is it different for people? 

And I'm not just talking about the terminally ill. It should be every human's basic right to leave an existence they did not choose to be a part of if and when they choose to leave, rather than forcing them to live until old age.

And, what I mean by ""forcing"", is that if you attempt to take your own life and fail, you don't really get any support. You get locked away and have other liberties stripped from you. That and there is no government mandated 100% safe and certain way to end your life. You're forced to take matters into your own hands with a large margin of error. See my aforementioned point on why that's not acceptable.

There should be a mandated, safe, quick way to leave an existence that you did not get to choose to be part of. If you don't get to choose to be born, which you don't, it should at least be your basic right to leave when you want and in a peaceful, safe fashion. "

I always wondered why their legs were a different color until I found out that it’s basically a sock covering your entire legs up to your waist and that’s hot. I wanted to try that myself. Then it progressed to panties and lingerie and seeing that round curve fit perfectly made me hard. And I always wondered why my private parts always went hard when thinking about these stuff.

Then when I got older, I looked up pictures of naked women and initially it was something I can come out of anytime. Until a guy randomly asked if I watched porn and I didn’t know what that is until I found out. Ever since that, I can’t quit. It did drop from time to time, especially when I found the alternative of looking at plus size supermodels. But for these few months, porn has become a daily staple that I can’t back out of. I have now come to terms that maybe the male brain is designed to want sex thanks to hormones and the features of the female body trigger this to allow the sexual attraction and ultimately reproduction. So I could never stop the thoughts on my head.

Now porn is controversial, but it taught me how to have sex. Because otherwise, if I found myself in bed with someone, I actually would have no idea what to do besides kissing and making out like shown in the movies. I wouldn’t expect her to take off her bra. 

Side note: it’s also strange that the male brain also separates the craving for sex vs love. Any time I catch an attractive gal in public, sex is not what comes to mind. It’s romance

I also found out that I’m not the only one guilty of horniness. I expect a lot of people around me to be innocent and doing something like this is unthinkable. Turns out, many guys I interacted with have seen erotic content and enjoyed it."

I've come to the conclusion that it's technology and its development that is the primary factor.  
People living in the 1200s had backwards views to us because they were a comparatively backwards society technologically.   
People living in the 1800s would have viewed the views of people living in the 1200s as being backward and savage.  
Just as we today commonly view the societal views of people living in the 1800s as being backward and savage (with maybe a little more understanding or common ground than the 1200s)  
The basic constant of change between all of these time periods was technological progress. When technological progress slows or goes backwards, social and moral degradation slows or goes backwards.  
So,  
1. Technological development always ultimately results in the erosion of social and moral traditions, regardless of the speed at which such changes happen.  
2. It is impossible to truly stop technological development without wiping out the human race. The passage of time will eventually result in technology being developed in any civilisation, even if it happens extremely slowly.   
3. One of political conservatism's fundamental tenets is to preserve social and moral tradition.  
4. Therefore, the only thing that conservatives can do is temporarily slow the erosion of social and moral traditions through legislation that one way or another will eventually become irrelevant or will be overturned.   
5. Therefore, conservatives are hypocrites, especially in the Western world, because they cheer technological development and an economic system that is designed to hasten technological development as efficiently as possible while also supporting the preservation of social and moral traditions.  
7. The only purpose that conservatives might serve in a society is to slow the erosion of traditions. However, conservatives rarely directly acknowledge this. The implication of this truth is that conservatives would eventually have no problems with controversial issues such as abortion which they take principled and absolute stances on today.

8. Religions, that to a social conservative should provide an objective grounding of moral beliefs and principles that do not explicitly condemn technological development also do nothing to seriously preserve social and moral traditions. As previously stated, technology will eventually progress and the values associated with the religion, or the religion itself, will cease to exist.   
9. A hypothetical religion that explicitly condemns technological development would not be guaranteed to succeed in preventing progress either. History suggests that given enough time the religion will be rejected or reformed.  
Which makes political conservatism without an acknowledgement that eventually their positions will be eroded a completely pointless venture. It also makes taking principled moral stances on various issues infinitely harder, when you know that, *eventually,* you'll lose. Whether it's tomorrow or in 100,000 years."
104,2024-04-02,CMV: the theory of patriarchy and feminism is trumped by the theory of class,u/oftankoftan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1btvpu8/cmv_the_theory_of_patriarchy_and_feminism_is/,changemyview,"so first, definitions:   
Patriarchy: a system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it.  
2nd definition: Within feminist scholarship, patriarchy has been understood more broadly as the system in which men as a group are constructed as superior to women as a group and as such have authority over them.  

So given this, we can all easily name women in positions of power, and we can probably name quite a few women that are vastly richer than you and I as indivuduals are.  
We can name instutitions like custody courts where the odds are stacked against men, as well as prison sentences being higher for men.

Somone said that these things exist because it's rooted in the patriarchal idea that men should be providers and that women are inherently more ""innocent"", hence the aforementioned injusticies...

...I just think it's all negated once we look at men, and women who have ""fuck you""-money, and today there are both men and women that are self-made in the upper echelons of society, collectively fucking over both sexes. Therefore I think the definitions of patriarchy are flawed.

The very idea of somebody governing somebody else is inhuman.

Government is a game, the ugliest and the dirtiest game in the world.

But there are people in the lowest state of consciousness who enjoy it: these are the politicians. The only joy of a politician is to govern, to be in power, to enslave people The greatest desire of all those who have reached to the peaks of consciousness has been the dream that one day we can get rid of all governments. That day will be the greatest in the whole history - past, present, future - of man, because getting rid of all governments will mean destroying the ugliest game, the game the politicians have been playing for centuries.

They have made man just a chess piece, and they have created so much fear, fear that without government there will be anarchy, disorder, chaos ... everything will be destroyed. And the strangest thing is that we go on believing this nonsense.

Just look at the past five thousand years. Can you conceive that if there was no government at all in the world things would have been worse? In what way? In three thousand years, five thousand wars have been fought. Do you think more would have been possible without government - that more chaos was possible, more crime was possible.

What have these governments done? They have not done anything for the people except exploit them, exploit their fear, and set them against each other. A continuity of war somewhere or other on the earth is almost an absolute necessity for politicians to exist.

Adolf Hitler, in his autobiography, has many insights; and he is a man worth understanding because he is the purest politician - I mean, the dirtiest. He says that war is an absolute necessity if you want to remain in power. If you cannot create war people start thinking of you as nobody. Only in wartime are heroes born.

So you've probably heard ""Atheism is a religion"" before. I've read the jokes ""and abstainance is a sex position"", but i think there is a misunderstanding in definitions when atheists respond such a way.

Atheism (as you know) can be defined as lack of belief in sufficient evidence for GOD/S.

Religion however, doesn't depend on a God (Buddhism and Taoism for example) although they may believe in ""supernatural"" spirits, energy, whatever. Religion is defined as following a faith, 'ascribing to something of supreme importance'.

Atheism also relies in belief and faith of sorts as we rely on the validity of science and human perception to understand the world. Unless of course you're a crazed nihilist (understandably) and believe nothing- but then i don't get how you could criticise other beliefs

-----

So TLDR, no, lack of belief in God in itself isn't religion - it's what you put faith in instead that is religion. In the end i truly believe everyone is 'religious' making leaps of faith to believe in X, Y and/or Z. 

I truly think most atheists can wrap their heads around this argument, so why are they so reluctant to call atheism religion and other religions as just as valid but instead claim their faith to reign supreme? and if you do agree, do you also share some frustration that other atheists don't see it the same way?"

0,2024-04-02,CMV: women aren't better at sex,u/psykeshamaani,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1btxofe/cmv_women_arent_better_at_sex/,changemyview,"
All my life I've been hearing how terrible their partners are at bed, but I think the issue could also be in them (don't want to generalize) But listen what I have to say.

It took me 20 whole years to figure out that women don't really find men sexually appealing, at all. Majority don't really like looking at male bodies or get almost no reaction. The idea of a penis seems to be more repulsive than attractive for many women and they don't really like looking at it, basically how men view penises.

It destroyed my world for a while to learn this, and don't get me wrong I'm not insecure, just disappointed. I'm not saying sex should be about visuals, but it seems that the idea isn't a turn on for them either. This changed the whole view of sex to me and it all made sense then.

It seems to be about perfection. It's what you do to them. It's how you make them feel. 

For men it's completely opposite, we really (or me) don't care that much is it good or not, we are super turned on by being with a woman and a person we like or love. It's so sexy. Even with gay men it seems to be like this. Sex for us is not only about romance and movie like perfection, just fooling around and the idea of the act. Be honest, it's admirable.

Idea of having sex with a woman who thinks my dick is ugly and I'm ugly must be one of the most repulsive things I can imagine. I feel bad for the women who went along with it, finding the snake to be yucky and the whole act. Sorry, but maybe you weren't supposed to be a sex god.

I know that there are men who finish in a minute and go to sleep, yes. But I wouldn't be surprised if they just don't know what a woman likes and wants (tbh they just suck let's b real). I've had a partner who was clearly disgusted by me having a penis and didn't want to put it in her mouth. For girls sex is mostly about oral so don't be surprised when some men aren't flattered by the idea of licking your box either. You aren't really allowed to blame it on your partner if it's the case Imo.

Long too short, our biology kinda sucks. If clitoris was inside vulva sex would be way better. Vaginal sex seems to be boring and even painful for some women. Add the fact that many don't like giving you oral and couple minutes of fcking a corpse seems to be really common. Really disappointing, when I've built all my sexual fantasies so so far away from the reality. No one to blame here, I think you could blame penises and men biologically as well.

Don't take this too seriously, I could be wrong as well.

Firstly, if AI does not know how to think, but only imitate thought, then in principle it is strange to think that it is capable of solving problems.
Turing and other AI enthusiasts did not see a problem with this part, believing that imitation could replace real mental activity, which is currently only capable of humans of all species known to us. 
So there is no reason to assume that AI poses a threat to novel writers, musicians, etc... And for those who don’t believe, try writing a novel or at least fan fiction using GPT 4 and publishing it on the Internet. You will be disappointed...

Secondly, It is difficult to imagine what will happen if people make decisions based on information from this AI. Much has already been said that GPT and other bots make mistakes and give out information that makes no sense. And this is not a problem that can be solved by scaling AI, as the transition from GPT 4 to GPT 5 will not change anything in principle. All the problems that exist in GPT 5 will also be in GPT 5. So it seems to me that GPT and other AI will be toys, but to replace workers in an office, factory, etc. There is really no point in discussing this.

Thirdly, if AI does not think and is not capable of solving real problems and creating, then the question arises: why is all this necessary? AI is a huge scam the size of humanity and a bubble that will collapse sooner or later. There is and cannot be any AI, just like any uprisings of machines from science fiction plots. What can we say if robots cannot even replace people at work and can only work in ideal conditions, like in a factory? In fact, AI is a useless toy that cannot even perform an entertainment function.

So I think it’s pointless for us to speculate about what will happen if AI gains consciousness, etc. "

The Catholic Church actively discourages homosexuality and promotes homophobia.  However, we now know that 80% of the Holy See, the leadership of the Vatican, is gay. Why would a gay priesthood condemn homosexuality?  I believe the success of Christianity is due not to the wisdom of its theological message, but rather to the use of homophobia by the Catholic Church to recruit a childfree workforce.   
  
For more than a thousand years, the Vatican has persecuted homosexuals among parishioners.  Simultaneously, it has identified them in the confessionals and offered them sanctuary in the church.  This was not done intentionally to create a childless workforce, but rather to recruit more pretty young homosexuals into the ranks.  However, the strategy yielded an army of childfree workers, artists, and scholars within the church.    
  
Most of the great minds of the Renaissance were homosexual priests or employees of the church.  Under their guidance, Christian art, science, and math built upon and surpassed the work of the Greeks and Arabs.  Christian Europe built better weapons, ships, and economies.  When the New World was discovered, Christianity was in a position to take unopposed possession.  It conquered North and South America, became the largest religion on Earth, and spread homophobia over the world.

47,2024-04-02,"CMV: The union between the media and politics has crippled people's ability to protest, making change almost impossible. ",u/Puffinpopper,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1btztdy/cmv_the_union_between_the_media_and_politics_has/,changemyview,"Once again, I have come to this thread to challenge redditors to give me some hope (insane, I know). 

Preface by saying I am only speaking for Canada and the US as these are the only countries I have lived in.

Thanks to the polarizing nature of politics and the media perpetuating it, the possibility of a united protest by the people in either country is damn near impossible. 

Everything becomes political. Protesting against the unfair treatment of truckers? Congratulations, it's been turned into a movement that's anti-vax. Want to protest the treatment of black people? Huzzah, we'll spin it and talk about crime rates on the rise because police are being hobbled! Oh, people are complaining about the unfair wage gap and *both sides are agreeing?* Let's bring back abortion! Haha, try unifying now peasents!

It just keeps happening. The teachers protest in Canada is another great example. They were vilinized  because it meant parents with young children had to take time off work , which no one can afford. Instead of being mad at the system that made it so missing a few days off work put you at financial risk, people got mad at the teachers because destroying their protest would get them back to work quicker. 

It feels like there's no way out. Workers can't unite because the media will hyper focus on how their protest hinders the average citizen while the government will somehow turn the debate into conservative vs liberal, further splitting support. Sometimes it seems like violence is the only answer as it's the only thing a few people can engage in that has a huge impact. I hate that. I hate that looking at all the shit going on in politics has me staring at the news thinking, 'the only way anything changes is if someone turns a senate meeting into a school shooting and kills both sides.'' 

I know that's messed up and not the answer. It'll probaby just make things worse. What are people supposed to *do* though? Between gerrymandering, fear mongering, and the endless push of 'us' vs 'them', how is change supposed to come about?

They love to torture and humiliate someone. They love to cause pain. They love to feel superior by humiliating and hurting their partners. (I am talking about doms.) By this logic I can kill someone who wants to be killed because they give their consent. If I killed someone who wants to be killed would it make me a murderer? Absolutely yes. Even if they give their consent it doesn't change the fact that I am a homicial person. You can find an oppurtunity to feed your sadistic fantasies in a legal way but you can't change what you are. Also it is very open to the abuse and manipulation. After all if someone enjoys to torture themselves both mentally and physically how can their mental health be perfectly fine?

I believe it is also found offensive because a particular group of men purposefully use it to degrade women, rarely referring to men as males in the same manner.

  
My question is, why do these two points make the word offensive? For the first reason, would it also be offensive to call people Homo sapien or primate?  I don't see anything wrong with calling a spade a spade. Why does your very own biology upset you? The fact that there's also overlap between people who find the term ""female"" offensive, while seeing nothing wrong with calling some people ""uterus owners"" or ""birthing people"" is very worrying. If you take offense to being called what you are, that sounds like more of a personal issue. Now, let's not be ignorant here. Words carry vested and rooted sociocultural connotations that just can't be swept away. For instance, the N-word. A non-Black person could call a Black person this word and invoke the very same reasoning I'm using to justify it. However, the issue and history behind this word is *much* more insipid and vile than something as innocent as a biological descriptor. I simply do not see a world in which ""female"" is a slur.  


As for the second point, why does the fact that some fringe, incel-y men use the word in a deragatory way dictate the meaning and connotation of the word? I find that part somewhat deliberate, almost like they're looking to get offended. Of course sexually frustrated, toxic, and hateful people on the Internet are going to look to demean women. That's kind of what they do. Now the question is are you going to let that sample size speak for everyone? I don't think you should. Now, this is in no way me trying to wave away or casually dismiss the very real socio-cultural threat that sort of manosphere group poses to women. Just speaking for this specific instance.

I also find it worth noting that all of the women I've met/spoken to in real life have absolutely no problem with it. In fact, they often use it themselves in the same casual manner that most men do. Is this just a  online thing?

I just find it all very contrived. I'm a male, you're a female. The average dude referring to you as female is probably not out to demean or degrade you. It's often just simply used as a synonym. Ignoring the aforementioned connotations and backhanded implications from fringe groups online, if this makes you uncomfortable or upset, you should probably do some introspection/reflection.

I work as a male stripper , and I encounter a lot of evil, manipulative and predatory women in my line of work. They are more common in the rich and “high profile” parties/clients . 

And I find it odd how no one talks about it. And how it’s low key rewarded by society.


When I first started modeling and dancing, I was good at my job where I ended up being invited to more high profile parties to just perform. I was in my early 20s. Perform to rich , famous people sometimes even.

And my first encounter with sexual harassment was in one of these parties by one of these rich/popular women.

I froze and let it happen. 

But then when I told my manager and colleagues , I was always told to “man up” or “you should feel lucky” or “many guys would pay to be in that position” and so on.

I guess it didn’t help that these clients held a lot of power in terms of money and influence that the managers would side with them and just train us to let it happen and enjoy and shut up about it . 

Being a nobody who was young , being paid good and peer pressured into it being a good thing . You get used to it. 

Because to society , when a woman is the predator , it’s seen as hot.

And it’s not even about me being a man , it happens to female dancers as well , and the response is very different when its a woman taking advantage of her power compared to men. 


I just find it odd . Maybe I’m wrong but I just felt like sharing my point of view

The idea is that there's nothing novel about anything that they generate, it's based on data scraped from the internet without the creators' consent. I think that they don't derive enough from any specific source to be considered stealing.

&#x200B;

From a legal perspective, copyright law requires any infringement to A. show substantial similarities to the original work and B. the infringer must have had access to the original work. While it's obvious that they had access to the original works in question, I don't think that any art produced by them is inherently stealing. Sure, if you have Midjourney make a picture of Aang from Avatar in the style of the original animators and sell that for money, that would be an issue. But you can also ask Midjourney to create an image of a vampire riding a unicycle, and it wouldn't have any clear-cut connections to a living artist.

&#x200B;

Of course, law and morality are different, and our opinions shouldn't be legislated. Why don't I personally think that it's theft? Because if AI is theft, every work of art since the Stone Age has been theft. Today's writers and artists were influenced by yesterday's, and will influence tomorrow's. Samurai movies and Westerns were constantly influencing each other. Almost everything that Shakespeare ever wrote was based on earlier stories, and his style was based on Ovid and Seneca. The Renaissance was jumpstarted with the rediscovery of Classical art and philosophy. And this is to say nothing of the works of people like J.R.R.

0,2024-04-02,"CMV: I don't believe the federal government getting an extra $500 billion per year more will result in any noticeable change (""taxing the rich"")",u/ZeusThunder369,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bu1qg0/cmv_i_dont_believe_the_federal_government_getting/,changemyview,"The $500 billion per year is just one of many estimates of extra revenue from taxing the rich; My view isn't about that specific number.

My views on this subject don't fully align with the majority of any one political label, so I'll clarify them below:

1. I do believe ""the rich"" should pay more. However just raising marginal rates on income isn't the right approach. AGI should be changed so that it includes things like treating loans against your stock that isn't a 401k as income so that it can be taxed. As well as other tax code changes.

2. I'm not in favor of a ""wealth tax"" because just like with income tax, this will eventually trickle down to not rich people who own property. And in principle I don't think you should pay a fee just for having assets.

3. I would trust other non-US governments to better use extra funds. It's the US government I don't trust.

4. If our government wanted to have awesome public services, we would have them. It will spend money it doesn't have on many other things, so it's not missing a little bit of revenue that's the blocker. Even if all income over $500k were taxed at 100% (and we assume that income doesn't go away), we'd still be slightly short of covering the 2024 estimated deficit.

5. A majority of the extra funds would go to for profit companies, administration, and bureaucracy. Very little of it would actually end up in the hands of the population.

My view is that essentially yes we should tax the rich more, but before the government asks for more revenue, it has a duty to ensure all current revenue is being spent wisely; Which our government has very little interest in doing. EG - Despite the Pentagon having such poor records an audit can't even be completed, they still get increases to their budget every year.

In my ideal world, on this issue progressives, liberals, and conservatives would all act like libertarians; They'd strongly feel that any money taken from people by force (taxes) should be well accounted for.

0,2024-04-02,"CMV: people focusing on the ""genocide"" or ""ethnic cleansing"" in Palestine are no different than people saying ""white lives matter""",u/A_Weird_Gamer_Guy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bu1rex/cmv_people_focusing_on_the_genocide_or_ethnic/,changemyview,"Both stances are factually correct, but ignore the major problem.

White lives matter, just like any other life does. But the bigger problem is with the murders of African Americans, so by focusing only on white lives, they take the attention away from the actual issue.

And just like that, I believe that the deaths of palestinain civilians caused by the war and the occupation are a tragedy and we should work to stop them.

But framing this situation as a genocide or ethnic cleansing detracts from the meaning of those phrases and takes attention away from actual genocides and acts of ethnic cleansing.

If the current death rate continues, the palestinain population will still grow in 2024. (Around 5 million palestinains with an average 2.4% growth rate; 40-45k casualties in 6 months)

I'm not sure what the exact definition of genocide is, but wouldn't it have to include a significant decrease in the population?

He’s in his 50’s and looks bigger now than when he was in his 20’s or 30’s which makes no sense for a life time natural.

He definitely uses some type of steroid or illegal substance to boost his physique and testosterone. 

He has denied using them on multiple occasions which should make him feel ashamed especially when his physique is such a big part of his brand. 

The rock and all the other celebrities and athletes  that lie about using steroids should stop lying and admit it especially when they promote their ier body and lifestyle.

Up until the early 1900s, only men could vote. The downfall of society began once women were able to vote. Am I against women having a voice? No, but let’s look at what happened. 

(For context: by “societies downfall” I mean young generations not being able to think critically, not knowing practical life skills, insane inflation and sky-high living expenses, increased divorce rates, etc.)

Women get the right to vote -> women vote themselves the ability to work -> now men AND women work -> twice as much taxable income, growing the government (always a bad thing) -> also, now with both parents working, where do the kids go? Public school! (AKA government schools… because taxes pay for them) -> kids get indoctrinated by whatever the state (gov) wants them to learn -> families spend less time together, growing apart -> husbands and wives intermingle with the opposite sex at work, flirt, have affairs, and get divorced-> family unit is now destroyed -> single parent families raise children more likely to commit crimes and less likely to finish school and go on to something good

Of course there are exceptions. I’m not saying it’s ALWAYS bad. Obviously. Don’t waste your energy commenting about an anecdotal exception. I know. I’m casting a broad net here.

Benefits for the Environment:  
  
With fewer people, there's less demand for resources. This translates to a smaller carbon footprint, potentially less strain on natural resources like water and land, and a chance to move towards more sustainable living practices.  Imagine less crowded cities with lower energy consumption!  
  
Economic Opportunities:  
  
A smaller workforce could push these countries towards increased automation and innovation to maintain productivity. This might lead to a shift towards a service-based economy or a focus on high-value industries requiring a smaller but more skilled workforce.  
  
Improved Quality of Life:  
  
Think less crowded cities, more affordable housing, and the ability to invest more in social programs and infrastructure.  A smaller population could also lead to a better work-life balance for citizens.

I dislike HOAs, but they're private contracts, so I have nothing against them in principle.

The US is a country that prizes personal freedom, property rights, and small government. Based on these principles, I find that single family zoning is an intolerable intrusion into the rights of the owners to build whatever they want on their land.

Restrictions on freedoms must serve a compelling government interest. There are around four reasons why you would legitimately disallow certain buildings:

1. Safety concerns
2. Sanitation concerns
3. Noise concerns
4. Capacity (infrastructure) concerns

All these above reasons are legitimate government interests.

I will address the common objections one by one:

**Objection 1: This Means You're Ok with an Oil Refinery Next Door**

No, an oil refinery would not open next door. An oil refinery would violate all four needs of safety, sanitation, noise and capacity. Same goes for a dumpster next door. This is one of the most common retorts against eliminating single family zoning, and it's also the easiest to dismiss.

**Objection 2: People have a right to Live in a Quiet Community**

I'm sorry, but they do not. People have the right to use their own property as they wish. There is no right to sunlight, no right to have few other people around you. You have no right to insist that other people live as you do. If you want, you can get together with like minded people, purchase a bunch of property and sign a contract to live in a certain way - that's fine. It's an HOA.

But the *government* has no business protecting your preferences, and single family zoning is a government imposed restriction, not a private one.

**Objection 3: I Don't Want my Property Values to Be Impacted**

This is so easy to dismiss. You have no right to a certain property value.

**Objection 4: I have a Right to Maintain a Certain Neighborhood Character**

Again, no, you do not. You can maintain whatever character you want within the enclosure of your property.

**Objection 5: The Local Community/Government Gets to Decide What they Want**

Local communities cannot violate our personal rights just because they're ""local"". If the local government decided to ban long hair, it would still be illegal, wouldn't it? If the local community decided that people with children were ""spoiling the character of the neighborhood"", could the government enact a law saying that people with children couldn't live in a certain area?

If not, then why do you feel the government can enact a law telling people what they can build on their property just because they're ""local""? Local government tyranny is still tyranny.

What's actually puzzling to me is that the support for single family zoning appears to come from conservatives, and not liberals. Conservatives are the first to defend our rights, defend us from intrusion by the government, and defend any intrusion into the free market. Single-family zoning, while not communist, exactly, definitely has a strong flavor of socialism, which I would have expected conservatives to be highly repulsed by.

But such is not the case. Instead, in this case, it's the liberals who are usually in favor of free market capitalism via removing single family zoning, and the conservatives who want the government to pick winners and losers in the housing market.

Anyway, all this to say that single family zoning should be illegal. Please CMV!

**Note:** This is NOT to say that single family homes should be illegal. The *zoning* should be illegal. You're perfectly free to build a single family house on your property if you want."

I will admit, the scene where David is falling thru space was pretty cool visuals… again, especially for that time. However, that’s it.. best character from that movie was a computer (shoutout to HAL he a real one lol) and it just felt like the movie was trying to have a deeper meaning.

The last 40 mins was legit silence, no dialogue and the ending where buddy is reversed back into a baby and the aliens (I’m guessing the monoliths were a sign of extraterrestrial beings) sent him back to earth as a baby I just thought to myself damn.. that’s a waste of 3 hours. Weird backwards evolution shit going on. Experiencing time all at once must be a trip, though.

* I'm not actually a comic reader, so if the plotline I'm going to describe (or similar) actually exists, I haven't heard about it yet and pointing me towards it is a delta in itself. 
* Superman is a fictional character and as such exists to tell the stories the writer wants to tell so this isn't a Doylist argument I'm making.

Now the main point is that I think a superpowered person on the level of Superman could stop wars by making them futile; they could destroy weapons, overpower soldiers trying to fight without weapons, and similarly sabotage or obstruct war operations. I also think this super could then leverage their power to negotiate peace.

I don't think that this plotline negates or contradicts the characterization of Superman or Superman-likes. This plotline revolves around saving people; it's idealistic, but in a way that's aspirational; and it has elements of both action and communicating with each other. 

This also isn't that far off from an actual Superman style story. Politicians can be very Luthor-like. Innocent civilians being saved is easily integrated. People confronting their actions in the midst of desperation when faced with a paragon is practically a free bingo spot. "

So after Rittenhouse Acted in Self-Defense Fatally shooting Rosenbaum he tried to run-away which resulted in some people thinking he's an active shooter. Which resulted in a crowd chasing Rittenhouse. 

In This Case Rittenhouse DID act in self defense. Just because people think your an active shooter does not mean you do not have the right to self defense.

My argument essentially is that Fog of War. 

The argument would be boiled down to is it reasonable to expect people to chase what they consider to be an active shooter.

Part of Self-Defense argument is that what is considered a reasonable element of how an individual reacts.

Hypothetical:

if a 12 year old boy that is 6 ft tall wears a scary masks and starts chasing with a rubber knife screaming Nigger I would say like a small women probably has the right to shoot this 12 year old boy because its reasonable to assume for an average individual especially women is in danger. 

Likewise my argument is that it is reasonable for people to act unreasonably in this situation and chase after what they believe to be an active shooter even if that is not the best course of action."

I’m tired of see all the anti-Fortnite, it’s a kids game, I shoot someone once and they build a skyscraper, etc. People don’t understand what Fortnite truly is and how difficult it is at the highest level.

Fortnite Pros need to have a pixel perfect drop to ensure surviving off-spawn, follow a timed lootroute to ensure they get out of their drop early enough to get storm surge.

Storm surge is Epics way of making the games interesting for the viewer. There’s a limit to the amount of players that can be alive at a certain moment. If more players are alive, storm surge will start dealing 25 damage to the teams with the lowest damage dealt until the player count is below the threshold. This happens multiple times throughout the game and requires top teams to loot fast to get a good position to farm damage. 

They also have to account for a ton of RNG, where do zones pull, what loot they get and if you happen to be near a team that is below on storm surge (more likely to try to fight you). All while managing their heals, materials, ammo, rotates and their own storm surge. 

Fighting in Fortnite is advanced, it can be a chess match at times, it can be RNG other times, or it even can be laggy and unplayable. All things the T1 pros have to constantly keep account for. 

We haven’t even talking about endgame, 40-50 players in a small circle made up of any amount of different layers. Players all looking to survive and keep moving forward. 

Then the meta, constantly changing not even just season to season. Epic will change the entire competitive scene a week before a major tournament or the day before. They will add insane items that never should be in any competitive game. But players just have to deal with it, constantly be adapting, learning, and improving. 

Teams plans can change from Game to Game. Players can hop in replays, counter a strategy you’re doing and you have to be ready for the change and develop your own counter.

I haven’t even covered a million different things regarding how difficult it is to be consistent. But all of this is in my opinion what makes Fortnite the hardest mainstream Esport. The randomness is what makes it difficult, you can die to something completely out of your control, your entire tournament strategy could be destroyed by a poorly timed update, being able to adapt to a constantly changing atmosphere and to consistently place at the top is insane."

1,2024-04-02,CMV:Ministries should come directly through elections.,u/tajdinr,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bu6fsn/cmvministries_should_come_directly_through/,changemyview,"The public is emotional and easily polarized. Especially since the invention of modern communication techniques, party technocrats and advertisers often work to convince people not of how good their candidate is, but rather of how bad the opposing side is. Because creating hatred is the easiest emotion, parties and the system benefit from it. This is why we often end up with terrible individuals as presidents or prime ministers because parties and the system exploit this.

But what if this changed?

Imagine you're the CEO of a large company and you need to appoint a manager for your accounting department. You have three candidates:

The first candidate goes to a tanning salon regularly, has a strange way of speaking, and also sexually harassed an intern before entering the room.

The second candidate falls asleep in the middle of the interview, wakes up, stares at the wall for 10 seconds, then turns back.

The third candidate is a MIT graduate who completed his master's and doctorate at Caltech, specializing in mathematics.

Which candidate would you choose? Most likely, 99% of the public would choose the third candidate.

Voter masses are not as stupid as they are often portrayed. However, as mentioned earlier, sociopathic campaign managers manipulate their emotions aggressively to win elections.

What if, instead of choosing emotionally driven candidates, we could rely on their capabilities?

Close your eyes and imagine a ballot paper for the Ministry of Environment:

There are four candidates:

Former PR specialist of a lumber company. A politician who has done nothing but sit in the Senate. A radical environmentalist who might have been an eco-terrorist in the past, promising to shut down farms. A respected environmental conservation organization manager who has also chaired the United Nations Environment Assembly and is an academician. Which one would you choose?

Most likely, a significant portion of you would choose the fourth candidate.

Similar examples can be constructed for ministries such as economy, justice, tourism, and many others.

The main idea is simple: There won't be a thing called the government; ministries will be elected by the people, and the existing powers of the Prime Minister (or President, as in the case of the United States) will be distributed to the ministries. Instead of a Prime Minister, we will choose a neutral Head of State, responsible for reconciling ministries and representing the country. Additionally, the Head of State may have autonomy in foreign policy, allowing for quicker action in diplomatic crises and war situations.

Furthermore, the legislatures will continue their tasks such as preparing budgets and proposing legislation. In addition, when ministries face crises, they can make final decisions through voting, and if ministers are considered to have made wrong decisions, they can be voted out.

It's a magnificent system where meritocracy meets democracy. Knowledgeable technocrats, with public support, can take long-term steps independent of the government's desires, and these steps will mostly be designed by knowledgeable individuals.

It might seem like an extravagant example, but imagine a society that believes the first human on Mars must be sent by America, and a former NASA scientist runs for the position of Minister of Science.

We'd probably be on our way to Mars by the mid-2030s."

My opinion/view - I think we need to be cautious about applying black & white rules to all situations. I think the above statement about ""apologies without change is manipulation"" can only be applied to a subset of situation, such as blatant mistreatment and abuse. Since 69% of disagreements are unsolvable, I think that the majority of apologies do not need to come with an apology, and that insisting that someone should change just because you're unhappy with something is verging on controlling.

JAPAN: 
Japanese citizens had to consent to some extent their government openly and repeatedly attacking neutral powers without a proper declaration of war

The Japanese army perpetrated a mass genocide and rape in China with a death toll that exceeded 20 million individuals.

They were allied with the Nazis, and shared similar beliefs regarding racial supremacy.

American imperialism leading up to WWII is considered unethical 

Americans to some degree had to consent to their government placing Japanese in interment camps by the truckload 

Americans to some degree had to consent to their government using a weapon of mass destruction vs Japanese civilians and then doing it a second time in the days that followed

Americans placed African Americans at the front lines at a disproportionate rate. The American populace had to have known this and been okay with it, to some degree.

It's not about how industrialism and alienation, I think it's even worse than that. I'm beginning to think that the level of knowledge and self awareness, and the time we can dedicate to it, ultimately point us to despair and depression. Much of the comfort we live leads us to delusional beliefs about life and what it entails.

In a world with scarce resources, you had to fight for your life. It truly was nothing personal when it came to war. You had to live by the day. There was no time to wallow in sadness and despair. It was eat or get eaten. Your partner and tribe were the only solace you could find in your life. You couldn't decide to go look out for something better, because there was literally nothing better. If you let yourself get distracted, your life's journey ended in an instant.

In a world were resources are plenty, you don't fight for life, you fight for control over life. Control over your own well-being. This sounds good, until you understand that this also mean that whoever has the hands on the sink knob decides how much water to pour, and whoever has that control, might as well decide not to pour any. For all the rest, all their physical needs are satisfied. There's nothing to fight for. We get too comfortable, too demanding. We start hoarding. Because there's no life threatening situation, we can reflect upon our own life. We are trapped in our heads. This can only breed delusions.

Delusions of grandeur, which convince you that the world owes you something, and drive you to hoard more resources and gain more power. Delusions of meaning, where you pick and choose your beliefs and convince yourself that you're an essential part of some greater design, effectively designating something or someone else as the most important thing, but ultimately you're doomed to never see this grand vision materialized. Delusions of nihilism, which convince you that there's nothing you can or should do to change your life for the better, trapping you in a cycle of depression that convinces you how you aren't worth greatness. You go through these steps, if things work well, you don't end at the last one.

On an objective level, there's nothing special about us, about this world and about our lives. This excessively comfortable life we're living forces us to face this cold hard truth, and we're just left to cope while the planet around us barely keeps us alive. If we renounced our desire for more, we would start living what we're truly meant to be: simple creatures. If you're meant to live, you will live, if not, you die.

Admittedly, I'm living the most depressing and nihilistic phase in my entire life. This seems to be the most objective fact about life I can think of right now."

1. Charge your partner $1000 per month to live in your home, paying the mortgage of $500 and keeping the remaining $500. You are responsible if anything breaks.
2. Live in the rented accomodation and split rent 50-50 so that you pay $1000 each. Rent out your house for $2000, pay the mortgage of $500, pay the rent of $1000 and profit $500/mo. You are responsible if anything breaks in the house you own.

My point is what I have said in the title. All Abrahamic religions advocate that God has no gender - God is 'GOD'. I have also seen some people from these religions advocate that since God is not associated with either gender, God should be referred with they/them pronouns. 

Isn't that what being non-binary is about? That you are an individual who doesn't identify with either gender. 

I guess some can argue that ""you are thinking of God as a human being, God is God they are not humans"", which then begs the question, are you implying that God is not a living being? Which can be a viable answer, but then that would imply God is merely a consciousness. A lump of consciousness is data, and therefore in that case, isn't God just AI or like a robot? A non-living thing that cannot be associated with either gender but has a consciousness. Or if God has no body, then they are just a lump of data.

I think the only difference in variations of a product should be what their name means and suggests, or is at least related. Note that I don't include the hardware or net limitations in my insight as I see them as  exception.

So a difference between a physical and a digital product should be that one is digital and other is not.

I can see the argument of a huge loss for creators in here, so I can suggest a limitation on the amounts a digital copy can be shared or sold by consumer.

And also, this also comes as an economic friendly benefit, as this will kill any of other benefits physical copies have other than physicality.

I'm not here to give a history lesson or anything, but I'm sure many people know about the racial injustice that the U.S. has been founded on and for how it kept that standing for a couple hundred years.

Nowadays, we don't have that issue anymore. However, people seem to think we do. Minorities cry about *equality*, but won't say what exactly they aren't equal in. They'll speak about *racism*, but they are the main ones promoting a racial divide. It doesn't make sense to me.

[A study conducted in 2019](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/04/09/race-in-america-2019/) states that approximately 78% of black people in America believe that the U.S. hasn't gone far enough in giving blacks equal rights with whites.

It also states that nearly a 52% majority of black people in America blame ""being black"" in hurting their ability to *get ahead*, whereas white, hispanic, and asian people all have a minority opinion here.

(I think that blaming your skin color in preventing you from succeeding is the such a lack of accountability it's pathetic.)

Lastly, it states that a 52% majority of black people in America see ""being black"" as an extremely/very important part of their central identity, in comparison in white, hispanic, and asian people who all have a minority view here.

My issue is, people who are so obsessed over their own race and tell themselves that everyone is out to get them and every failure in life is due to their skin color, aka the whole ""everyone is racist!"" perpetuation, are the REAL problem in the U.S.

I think that classing people on race is stupid, as well as any form of affirmative action (which I benefit from as a hispanic) because trying to give ""reparations"" or to ""even things out"" is just racism in itself and isn't going to make out country less racist.

I'm not trying to say historical context isn't important, but it really isn't an accurate representation present in modern day America like people try to say it is. After-effects exists, sure, that goes for literally everything ever, but every human knows that you have to play with the cards you are dealt, rather than claiming the cards are fixed and demand you deserve some advantage based on your delusion alone.

If more people focused on class and tried to stop making everything about race, we might actually have more coherent people in our country that use that intellect to get out of poverty by actually remaining in school and doing well, rather than saying the system is against you and not caring about it.

If you can never escape this endless loophole of you believing you are always the victim and allowing race to be your scapegoat excuse for crime, failure, and lack of success, then you are genuinely a lost cause."

Additionally, the ever increasing divorce rates, increased infidelity rates and increased levels of “situationships/friends with benefits” makes me further question whether it exists. Because how can you “love” someone for years and simply leave or cheat on them. Also, how can people simply get into multiple relationships and say “I love you” in every single one.

The debate over the illusion or existence of free will is one of definitions. Beliefs are notions people feel some personal need to accept, endorse, or depend on for one reason or another. These notions hold some personal or categorical significance to their adherents, and their ability to accept other notions may depend on these. Beliefs can be deeply personal, shared within a community, or widely held across cultures. They form the basis of knowledge, religion, philosophy, and many aspects of social identity and cultural practices. Beliefs can be based on empirical evidence, reasoning, tradition, or faith, and they can change over time as individuals encounter new information or experiences. 

Free will is a faith-based belief, similar to belief in a soul, which is only real to those who believe in it. Convincing someone who has believed in free will their whole life to abandon the belief is like telling someone they’re living in the Matrix and that reality is just a simulation. It just instinctually feels like it’s true, therefore it is. Many adherents of free will also believe it is dangerous and personally detrimental to believe otherwise because it’s integrated with their beliefs about punishment and reward. This is why free will is such a sticky idea, even stickier than ideas about heaven and hell. Free will in baked into practically every legal system on earth. For that reason it’s not going away anytime soon.

How did this belief evolve into existence? I would guess there must have been an evolutionary social advantage toward people who emphasized the role of personal agency and the importance of individual choices in daily life, versus those who did not, thereby facilitating the cultural transmission of the belief in free will worldwide. 

Consider that 84% of the world affiliates with a religion, which in different ways have the belief of free will baked into their religious dogma. For free will to cease to exist, it would have to lose enough adherents and degrade into merely an idea, or a notion that people don't hold a personal stake in, such as witches controlling the weather or epileptics being possessed by Satan.  

Bottom line, while I agree with Robert Sapolsky and Sam Harris that it doesn’t exist in any scientific sense, and that the world is actually a better place without free will, the belief will always persist."

I would guess there must have been an evolutionary social advantage toward people who emphasized the role of personal agency and the importance of individual choices in daily life, versus those who did not, thereby facilitating the cultural transmission of the belief in free will to most human beings. 

Consider that 84% of the world affiliates with a religion, which in different ways have the belief of free will baked into their religious dogma. For free will to cease to exist, the religions would have to fundamentally change in an impossible way. The belief would have to degrade into merely an idea, or a notion that people don't hold a personal stake in, such as witches controlling the weather or epileptics being possessed by Satan.

Criteria for changing my view: Offer a plausible explanation for how the belief in free will eventually dies. Or offer a scientific study or evidence for the existence of free will that contradicts Sapolsky and Harris.

Bottom line, while I agree with Sapolsky and Harris that there’s no scientific basis to free will, and that the world is a better place without it, the belief in free will, will always persist.

But I don't understand why people claim they are all equally damaging. 

One example is a female teacher sleeping with a male student. Again, it's still absolutely disgusting. But only a naive person would claim this damages the male in the same way a male teacher sleeping with a female student damages the girl. For one, a young male is likely a very willing participant. It is their dream to sleep with the hot teacher. Also important is the social aspect. A male student who sleeps with the teacher is treated like a hero. They gain tremendous social status. The opposite would be true of a female student. 

I don't really know what male SA victims of female abusers go through. But given that males are in a different class in terms of strength, I'd imagine they would suffer less trauma and anxiety going forward. A female SA survivor likely has greater fear of men in her daily life, and continues to imagine how scenarios could go bad. But female abusers are far less common, and men should have less fear of any situation involving a woman going badly. And most importantly, they know that they have the ability to end almost any scenario where they are the victim of a woman.

This is a view that I really wish to change because it makes me somehow treat female SA victims as considerably more victimized than male ones. But logically I know it's probably not true. But all the points I laid out make it hard for me to see it any other way. For example, I really doubt if my Spanish teacher slept with me I'd have any problems then or now.

0,2024-04-03,CMV: pursuit of a fixed ideal of a future society is an inherently conservative position,u/Guns-Goats-and-Cob,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1buk4xm/cmv_pursuit_of_a_fixed_ideal_of_a_future_society/,changemyview,"Striving for a fixed idea of the future is a conservative notion, and reflexive defenses of an ambiguously defined ""progress"" must rely on inherently conservative means in order to reach their ends, e.g. the suppression of alternatives and human autonomy. This framing of ""progress"" suffers from the fact it is tied to ecocidal, colonial, and industrial paradigms that prioritize economic growth, technological advancement, and centralized authority at the expense of human freedom, ecological sustainability, and social justice.

At the most fundamental level, rigid adherence to predefined visions of the future can inhibit innovation, creativity, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

Primarily, fixed ideas of the future often stem from a desire to maintain existing power structures, social norms, and modes of governance. By clinging to a predetermined vision of the future, individuals and institutions may resist or dismiss alternative possibilities and pathways for societal transformation.

Following from this, fixed ideas of the future can lead to inflexibility in response to unforeseen challenges, opportunities, and emergent trends. It can prevent individuals, communities, and even whole societies from adapting to new information, evolving social dynamics, and changing environmental conditions, potentially resulting in stagnation or decline.

Striving for a fixed idea of the future can serve to *reinforce* existing inequalities, hierarchies, and injustices within society instead of **challenging them**, particularly if it prioritizes the interests of dominant groups and institutions while marginalizing or excluding alternative visions and voices, perpetuating systemic injustices and oppression.

By limiting imagination and possibility, fixed ideas of the future stifles innovation, experimentation, and collective imagination. They narrow the range of potential futures that individuals and societies can envision and work towards, constraining the capacity for transformative change and social renewal.

By contrast, embracing uncertainty, complexity, and plurality of visions can foster a more dynamic and inclusive approach to imagining and shaping the future. This perspective benefits from acknowledging the fluidity and contingency of social life, inviting participation, dialogue, and collaboration in co-creating alternative futures that reflect diverse values, aspirations, and needs.

Therefore, rather than striving for a fixed idea of the future, it is more productive and liberating to embrace openness, creativity, and adaptability in navigating the complexities of our shared world.

15,2024-04-03,CMV: 98% of meetings are useless meaningless wastes of time and we only still do them because of tradition. ,u/RealisticLime8665,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bukobf/cmv_98_of_meetings_are_useless_meaningless_wastes/,changemyview,"I have long been fascinated with the concept of what I can only describe as ""meeting grooming"" that many or most of us have been victimized by in our formative years. It can be understood as the process by which organizational traditions, norms, and expectations shape and solidify the practice of “holding meetings”, to the point where their frequency, structure, and perceived necessity become largely unquestioned. 
This concept parallels other“grooming” behaviors in social and biological contexts, where certain actions are repeated and perpetuated through learned behavior or social conditioning. 

Take for example church gatherings. This grooming process not only reinforces the tradition of holding these meetings but also embeds them deeply within the cultural and operational fabric of the organization, and associated it with being a “good person”thus making alternative methods of communication or decision-making seem almost inconceivable or even “bad”.

One can observe that churches, like many organizations, often adhere to long-standing traditions that dictate not only the structure of their services but also the way in which administrative, planning, and other types of meetings are conducted. These traditions are deeply rooted in historical practices, theological considerations, and community expectations. Over time, the repetitive nature of these meetings, coupled with a lack of critical evaluation of their efficacy, can lead to a situation where meetings are held out of habit rather than necessity. 

The efficacy of meetings is often not proportionate to the amount of time and resources invested in them. The blind inertia of tradition plays a significant role in the perpetuation of meeting cultures. In the context of churches, for example, congregational meetings, committee meetings, and other gatherings are often seen as integral to the fabric of communal life. They serve various purposes, including spiritual edification, community building, and organizational governance. However, the assumption that these objectives can only or best be achieved through traditional meetings is seldom scrutinized. 

This societal ""grooming"" process ensures the continuation of this practice, as new members of the community are socialized into accepting and participating in these meetings without necessarily considering their actual utility or exploring alternative approaches.

This is not to say that all meetings are without value, but I will say that even what most might consider the very best meetings have almost no value. The challenge lies in discerning which meetings serve a meaningful purpose and which could be modified, replaced, or eliminated altogether to better serve the organization's goals. In an era where digital communication tools offer a plethora of alternatives for collaboration and decision-making, the adherence to traditional meeting formats highlights a significant gap between potential efficiencies and the status quo.

Critical examination of meeting practices, especially within institutions as tradition-bound as churches, like law offices, requires a willingness to question deeply held beliefs about the nature of community, governance, authority and communication. It also necessitates a consideration of how technology and modern communication strategies could be harmonized with the values and objectives of the organization. 

Confronting this silent and insidious phenomenon of ""meeting grooming"" involves a deliberate and thoughtful exploration of how we can align our practices with our priorities more effectively, ensuring that time and resources are dedicated to activities that truly enrich and advance the organizational mission and improve productivity, maintain a flow state and focus on what matters the most.

We all know that lesbian porn is by far the most watched genre of porn by straight women, solo female as well. There's all kinds of excuses to this, more foreplay, more oral sex, more romance. Sure, but I've seen many many many videos of straight porn that are exactly like this. Most women don't buy magazines of hot men or watch them, but most watch lesbian. You'd think that straight women would be all over to see some dick there as well, but it really does not seem like it. They seem to prefer it without it. 

If you go to reddit, or pretty much any forum, and ask women what they think of penises, 90% of comments will be

""Ewwww"" ""Fuck no :D"" ""Helll nahhhhh"" ""Only my husband, but not visually""

Which really does not sound like they like them. I've heard all kinds of comments like this in real life as well. I've heard women who prefer their men with clothes on and don't even like to look at them naked. I've heard many women call women more beautiful and better to look at.

It just seems that women are lying to others, but to themselves as well. I would never ever just disrespect and call vaginas ugly, or watch gay porn because they give better oral, as a straight man.

My friend once told me, ""If your girlfriend had a dick, would you suck it? Women view dicks the same way""
I thought it in my head, maybe, maybe I actually would to make her feel better. But I wouldn't really like it."" Ding ding ding. Almost every answer ever gave by a woman. (Not some horny gals in a bar, gay men exist as well)

I've had good sex experiences, but it seems that most women like the sex with a man only because it's their partner. I never got why women have sex so differently, but they need foreplay to get them okay with the idea of dick, they don't get excited by the man being there. Foreplay and good feeling for them. 

Am I wrong? Please don't only look at norms and what you've been told. I hope I'm wrong or I will never have sex again and stand there with my ugly worm looking stupid."

In order to achieve this goal God/Moses unleashes a series of divine disasters, which include bioattacks (converting water to blood, boils), and hostile fauna in the form of the frogs, lice, locusts and wild animal attacks on people and food supplies.

Fire and ice as hail rained down, similar to a drone strike on the Egyptian population, and psychological warfare tactics in the form of days of darkness falling over the land.

Each time Moses went to negotiate Pharaoh famously hardened his heart, ie he does not negotiate with terrorists.

However, eventually and after a mass slaughter of men and boys during the death of firstborn, Pharaoh agrees to the demands.

My view is that this episode in the bible describes possibly the first ever terrorist attacks, and the framing of God as the culprit makes the biblical God the first terrorist in this context.

If you have any possible earlier examples I'd be interested in hearing them, and changing my view. Open to other, more abstract arguments as well, but I don't think redefining terrorism will be perticularly convincing."

Considering how huge of an influence WPATH is in medical community with regards to health practices & procedures it establishes, the release of WPATH files **not** being reported or discussed is no fluke - dismissed as if the story simply wasn’t newsworthy.

They take away income from the local population, distribute drugs, and rape our women and children. They reduce the price of labor and after a while control the construction industry, farms, etc. These are, as a rule, uncultured sections of the population of their country, prone to impulsive behavior. The only ones who benefit from immigrants are businesses that make a profit due to the cheap labor of immigrants compared to the labor of the local population.

If we imagine that immigrants stop coming to the country for some reason, then this will radically improve the lives of the country’s citizens. The country's economy will no longer depend on the disenfranchised immigrant workforce and the unemployment rate in the country will decrease, which will have a positive impact on the public life of the country. If immigrants stop coming to the country, then we will stop spending huge amounts of money on their deportation, integration and regulation. In general, everyone will be fine except business.

Of course, I'm only talking about the case if immigrants stop coming to the country. These are thousands of doctors, programmers, engineers, teachers, entrepreneurs, artists, and other highly qualified specialists in their field. On the other hand, what difference does it make, because in other countries the quality of education is usually low and, accordingly, the qualifications of these specialists are in doubt. In any case, we need to be vigilant and demanding of immigrants so as not to endanger the citizens of our country."

Calories are a unit of energy.

Body fat is a form of energy storage.

If you consume more calories than you burn, body fat will increase.

If you consume fewer calories than you burn, body fat will decrease.

The effects are not always immediate and variables like water weight can sometimes delay the appearance of results.

Also, weight alone does not always indicate how healthy a person is.

But, at the end of the day, all biological systems, no matter how complex, are based on chemistry and physics.

(Louisiana governor is threatening to require participation in the national anthem or scholarships worth up to six figures would be revoked, plunging students into massive debt or forcing them to quit school.)

But why on earth is this even a thing in the first place?  I get something like playing a winning nation's national anthem at the podium ceremony for an international competition like the Olympics.  It's a global contest and the playing of the song is a salute to the winner.  

But why does a high school or college game between two teams from the same country have to be precluded by everyone rising and removing their hats for the playing of a song?  Where I live, this happens before *every* game.  Not just major playoff or championship contests.  Every.  Single.  Game.

3. A drone operator can go rogue and use 3 missiles against an ""enemy combatant"",

4. The intel they receive is absolutely horrendous and doesn't go through the proper checks, especially with regard to aid workers. 

If any one of these is true, it shows that the IDF is completely incompetent and merciless. Remember that we only hear about this incident because the aid workers are not Palestinians, more than 200 aid workers have been killed but we don't hear about them because the MSM trust the IDF to operate in a competent and professional manner. This single incident exposes how rotten the IDF is, and how they completely ignore international law on combat.

This is far from the only incident either, there is the [Flour massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour_massacre) where they open fire at a crowd swarming for food, [a journalist](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/07/journalist-issam-abdallah-killed-by-israeli-tank-firing-in-quick-succession) murdered by the IDF tank shell in Lebanon, the murder of 3 Israeli hostages, and recently [the murder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_David_Ben_Avraham) of a Palestinian who converted to Judaism in the West Bank.

I used to hold the opinion that while there are some trigger-happy reservists, the IDF in general is competent and professional such that they can execute the will of the state, but now I do not think so.

I have to add tho that should not happen often  or on a regular basis and that if your child gets violent to often, that you as a parent did a lot wrong to get to a point where your child gets so angry and violent that you cant control it anymore.

Also please read the whole thing. I acknowledge different dialects from different regions, but I still stand that even those dialects are now cemented. Final note: I'm not speaking about new words, but a complete evolution in Grammar and standardized words. For example, ""Thou"", ""Thee"", ""Thine"" and ""Doth"" will never be standard again. And will never change from what they currently are: You, yours, does. And so on.

~1,000 years ago Beowulf was written:      

""ēof lēodcyning, longe þrage
fōlde gefræge. Fæder ellor hwearf,
aldor of earde, oþþæt him eft onwōc
hēah Healfdene""


Which would have been pronounced roughly like This:     

""Thah wass on bur-gum Bay-oh-wulf Shield-ing-ah,
lay-ohf lay-ohd-kening, long-eh thray-geh
foal-deh yef-ray-yeh. Fay-der el-lore hwairf,
al-dor off ear-deh, oth-thet him eft on-woke
hay-ah Half-day-neh""


Which translates to this:       

""Then was in the boroughs, Beowulf the Scylding,
beloved king of the people, a long age
famous among the folk. had gone away earlier,
the prince from his home, until afterwards bore him
high Healfdene.""



As you can see, theres a drastic difference between ""pronounced like"" and the modern translation pronunciation.   

The language evolved and changed and pronunciations varied by region and over time, differences in phonetics and the absence of standardized spelling during the period.

And so the English language was left to it's own devices. People in Ireland speak a different English than people in England who speak different vs American English etc. But those changes are done. 

Now due to standardization and formal education, compounded with instant global communication, all major languages will no longer evolve to be drastically different than what they are now. Any changes to the language are nothing more than a fad or slang. Such as saying ""groovy"", or ""rizz"". Words that will go in and out of popularity (who says 'swag' anymore these days?), don't fall within the context of my view. 

Any would-be changes are beaten back in-line by language educators. ""No, you say this word and pronounce it this way to mean this thing. Otherwise, you are incorrect, or less correct."" You will never write ""lol that's so steez"" on an essay. 


I acknowledge that by saying ""never' I'm opening the door to the most absurd newtons flaming lazer sword you can think of. Who knows what Martians from Earth will be saying 87,000 years from now. I'm talking about modern languages here on earth as they are currently taught and used."

I cannot *legally* steal your car.

Someone younger than whatever the AoC is in their jurisdiction cannot *legally* consent to sexual activity.

But while we'd all agree that despite the illegality, I'm still perfectly capable of performing the first two actions if I choose to, people seem to perceive the AoC as though it literally removes the ability of the young person to choose to consent to sex even though it's illegal for him or her to do so. This would be the same as saying that because it's illegal to steal a car you shouldn't worry about leaving your keys in the car with the engine running while you go grocery shopping since the law's existence makes it literally impossible for people to steal cars. I'm wondering how exactly this came to be societal perception.

My first sexual experience took place shortly after middle school with another middle schooler in a state with an AoC of 18 and no close-in-age exemptions (meaning that in this state and the very few others like it, any minor consenting to any sexual act whatsoever - even with another minor - is committing a crime). I fully consented to it even though it was against the law for me to do so. I hate to speak for her, but I'd have to imagine she did as well considering the whole thing was her idea. To the letter of the law, neither of us could legally give consent and either or both of us could have been charged with a sex crime against the other. But the fact that it was illegal for us to consent doesn't change the fact that we did.

I'd have to imagine many of you also engaged in and consented to sexual activity during a time in your jurisdiction when you were not legally capable of it. Are you all looking back at the sex you and your friends were having in high school as a bunch of teenagers raping each other just because that's how the law perceives it? And if not, then how do you explain applying that perception to others? Because in the conversations I've been in or witnessed, it feels like what's being said is, 'I was capable of consenting to sex even though the law said not to but this random person on the internet isn't.'

To state my view as concisely as possible, something being illegal does not make that thing an impossible thing to do and it feels like society would agree in all cases but the AoC.

Deltas are available to anyone for convincing me either that it's actually I who is perceiving the law strangely or that you're not.

For lawyers specifically - I've done a lot of research on this topic and am fairly confident in my understanding but if you can expand or correct either of these statements there's deltas available for them:

-As the AoC is directed squarely at those younger than wherever it draws the line in its jurisdiction, it is only those younger than where that line is drawn who are capable of violating the statute.

-In a case in which legal action is taken, neither party is actually 'charged' with violating the AoC statute, it is simply used to invalidate the young person's consent and then the defendant is charged with a different crime."

perception. 

Those who will see it will be thought of as insane.

We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the
connection between us. 

We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive.
Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring
suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing 
the changes as they occur.

We will always stand above the relative field of their experience
for we know the secrets of the absolute. 

We will work together always and will remain bound by blood and 
secrecy. Death will come to he who speaks.

 

We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while 
pretending to do the opposite.

We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle
ways so they will never see what is happening.

We will use soft metals, aging accelerators and sedatives in
food and water, also in the air.

They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn. 

The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will
promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will
feed them more poison.

The poisons will be absorbed trough their skin and mouths,
they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems.

From all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal 
this information.

The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them,
in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear.

can see far. 

We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images
and musical tones.

push our poisons.

will grow accustomed to them and will never know
their true effect.

When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood
of their children and convince them its for their help.

We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will
target their children with what children love most, sweet
things. 

When their teeth decay we will fill them with metals
that will kill their mind and steal their future.

When their ability to learn has been affected,
we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other
diseases for which we will create yet more medicine.

We will render them docile and weak before us by our power.

They will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they
come to us for help, we will give them more poison.

We will focus their attention toward money and material goods
so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract
them with fornication, external pleasures and games so they may
never be one with the oneness of it all.

Their minds will belong to us and they will do as we say.
If they refuse we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology
into their lives. We will use fear as our weapon.

We will establish their governments and establish opposites within. 
We will own both sides. 

We will always hide our objective but carry out our plan.

They will perform the labor for us and we shall prosper from their toil.

Our families will never mix with theirs. Our blood must be pure

Religions attempt to prove those claims by appealing to their own trustworthiness. They're telling people ""I always tell the truth. Can you prove that I ever told you a lie? Look at all the good things I've done and trust that I'm always telling you the truth."" That is a fallacious argument.

You have to take each claim on its own merit, and you have to substantiate every claim you make with evidence that's proportional to how extraordinary it is. 

Let's say I've been your best friend all your life, we are inseparable. I've never been known for lying to you or misleading you. Now I promise you that I will never ever lie to you, everything I'll ever say to you will be true. Then one day I tell you that I got a new cat. That's not an extraordinary claim at all, it's normal for people get a new pet, and cats are a popular option. You'd be right not to doubt me, and believe me by that evidence alone. Maybe I'll show you some pictures of the cat, or you'll see some fur stuck on my clothes and case closed, you now believe that I have a cat.

The next day I tell you that I won the lottery and now I'm a billionaire. Would you take it at face value just because I've never lied to you? The claim is extraordinary. People win such a huge sum incredibly rarely. Therefore, you'd have to dig for some serious hard evidence. See the new luxury items I'm buying, see the sum on my bank account and so on. Even then, you could think that I inherited the money and I have my reasons for not telling you. Because inheriting a large sum happens much more often than winning the lottery, it would be healthy skepticism for you to have some reservations until even more evidence points to the fact that I actually got the money by winning the lottery.

Then next week I'll tell you that I won the lottery because I learned the numbers and then traveled back in time. Would you think it's a credible claim just because I've never lied to you? There has never been a case demonstrated where a person actually traveled back in time. It's the highest level of an extraordinary claim one could make. Therefore you'd have to seriously doubt and criticize my claim, you'd have to strenuously look for alternative explanations. Maybe I had a mental disorder episode where I hallucinated traveling back in time and I happened to hit the numbers by luck alone. Maybe I just want you to think that I'm the coolest person ever, and I want you to never leave me and I see this as a good way to achieve it. 

You can look at my sketches for time travel, my papers also include guidance on how to treat people and how to be a good person, you agree with those. But the time travel itself won't work anymore because the undetectable energy that I've used to fuel it has run out in the Solar system. You weren't there to see the time travel in action, but I'm telling you that you should never doubt your best friend, you should be faithful, loyal. Our friendship is a miracle, it's the best miracle you'll ever need to prove to you that I'm truthful.

Does any of the things I've shown to you constitute sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim that I actually traveled back in time? I think not. You're still right to believe that I have a cat, you're still right to believe that I have a lot of money, maybe because I won the lottery, maybe by other means. But you should still highly doubt that I'm a time traveler, even though you can't disprove it. The onus is not on you to disprove the claims that I make. I have the burden of proof to demonstrate that they're true, and then you'll have a certain level of confidence in them."

You are required to draw a ball. If you pull a number, you have to guess which place in the price of a car (usually a luxury car) that number goes. Guess right, awesome, guess wrong, number goes back in the bag.

The goal is to light up the entire price of the car before pulling 3 X's. Pull 3 X's, you lose the game.

Let's look at the evidence:

At the beginning of every game, Drew shows all the balls that go in the bag: 5 (or 6) yellow numbers with three red X's.

HOWEVER, what Drew (and even Bob Barker when he hosted it, RIP) didn't do was show the bag EMPTY prior to putting the balls in.

Since 2016, this game has only been won once. The game is not that hard, which is why I suspect that they're putting extra X's in. 

Further evidences to back my claim:

* Most recent playing, the lady pulled three X's and lost. Didn't even pull a number. You can't say they're not sneaking extra X's because the odds of pulling three straight X's are 1 in 56.
* One winner in 8 years, when the game is not that hard. You have statistically higher chance of pulling a number than an X.
* Most playings since 2016, the first draw is an X, and the game is over (lost) in, on average, 7 draws. See above about statistics of draw. 
* From 1998-2009, the rule was changed where they only put one X in the bag, and if you drew it, they simply put it back in the bag. One heartbreaking playing in 2006, a guy had 4 of the 5 digits placed with no X's drawn. He then proceeded to draw the X three times in a row and lost the game. If you recently drew the X and it was put back in the bag, it would still be warm because you recently touched it.
* Most people will say that adding extra X's is a violation of standards and practices, therefore illegal. Just because it's illegal doesn't mean people don't do it. Look at guns and drugs.

What I think the producers at *Price* need to do is either scrap the game entirely if they can't get someone smart enough to win OR, show the bag completely empty before putting the balls in. Turn it inside out to prove there is ABSOLUTELY nothing in the bag before you put the balls in."

An illusion it will be, so large, so vast it will escape their
perception. 

Those who will see it will be thought of as insane.

We will create separate fronts to prevent them from seeing the
connection between us. 

We will behave as if we are not connected to keep the illusion alive.
Our goal will be accomplished one drop at a time so as to never bring
suspicion upon ourselves. This will also prevent them from seeing 
the changes as they occur.

We will always stand above the relative field of their experience
for we know the secrets of the absolute. 

We will work together always and will remain bound by blood and 
secrecy. Death will come to he who speaks.

 

We will keep their lifespan short and their minds weak while 
pretending to do the opposite.

We will use our knowledge of science and technology in subtle
ways so they will never see what is happening.

We will use soft metals, aging accelerators and sedatives in
food and water, also in the air.

They will be blanketed by poisons everywhere they turn. 

The soft metals will cause them to lose their minds. We will
promise to find a cure from our many fronts, yet we will
feed them more poison.

The poisons will be absorbed trough their skin and mouths,
they will destroy their minds and reproductive systems.

From all this, their children will be born dead, and we will conceal 
this information.

The poisons will be hidden in everything that surrounds them,
in what they drink, eat, breathe and wear. 

We must be ingenious in dispensing the poisons for they
can see far. 

We will teach them that the poisons are good, with fun images
and musical tones.

Those they look up to will help. We will enlist them to 
push our poisons.

They will see our products being used in film and
will grow accustomed to them and will never know
their true effect.

When they give birth we will inject poisons into the blood
of their children and convince them its for their help.

We will start early on, when their minds are young, we will
target their children with what children love most, sweet
things. 

When their teeth decay we will fill them with metals
that will kill their mind and steal their future.

When their ability to learn has been affected,
we will create medicine that will make them sicker and cause other
diseases for which we will create yet more medicine.

We will render them docile and weak before us by our power.

They will grow depressed, slow and obese, and when they
come to us for help, we will give them more poison.

We will focus their attention toward money and material goods
so they many never connect with their inner self. We will distract
them with fornication, external pleasures and games so they may
never be one with the oneness of it all.

Their minds will belong to us and they will do as we say.
If they refuse we shall find ways to implement mind-altering technology
into their lives. We will use fear as our weapon.

We will establish their governments and establish opposites within. 
We will own both sides.

I’m not some religious zealot who wishes to impose my views on everyone.) 

The movement to legalize euthanasia for everyone is gaining in traction, and a few countries (The Netherlands, etc.) have even gone so far as to legalize it entirely; while these initiatives are doubtless in good faith, I believe that they are misguided and rash. 

Essentially, assisted suicide enables, even encourages, someone going through a time of difficulty to merely give up. But this elides the fact that there is literally nothing more important than life, and that, invariably, however inexorable they may seem, there will be depressing, debilitating periods of your life, but that it’s _always_ worth tackling them, and they will _never_ last forever. “Suicide is never the answer” is obviously, undoubtedly true — except that in this case, we’re sort of offering it as one, no? This is ethically indefensible, because, as I mentioned above, nothing takes precedence over human life. Not transitory pain and suffering, nothing. 

I think that The Netherlands, and other countries who have taken similarly drastic positions, have seriously overreacted to the progressivist movement normalizing assisted suicide.

1st point

Socialism doesn't work in today's society unless you are willing to take away peoples freedom. Now this may not be a problem for some people but for me freedom is really important which will be taken away if socialism was to be implemented today. Why? - Because we have way too many jobs that people will refuse to do if they don't need to do it. Most desk jobs, manual labor, cleaning sewers, working on oil rigs, construction, etc. Most jobs will not be done anymore, not all of course and some small minority might still enjoy doing jobs like construction work but most won't be done. Now a consequence of this would be that there will be an insane amounts of people in stem fields and art fields and other such fields of passion but overall most jobs necessary for the survival of the human species will simply not be done.

So when can socialism be applied? - When all of these jobs can be automated by ai and machines. At this point in the theoretical future we would see a major boom in our scientific understanding, our art, etc. because almost all human cognitive resources will be focused on these areas.

2nd point

Capitalism is not sustainable in the long term, at least if you want the maximum quality of life for the most amount of people people. Jobs grow arithmetically and in many situations don't grow at all. Like in customer care for example lets say 10 more people were born, that means we have 10 more people who may use customer care. The problem is you don't need 10 people to handle these 10 people you only need 1 and this one guy could probably take care of more than a 100 people in a few days time. As the population grows geometrically the number of jobs will get less and less. A common counterargument is that its not like customer care is the only possible job you have multiple possible jobs and multiple companies and this sorts out the problem of how to give the population jobs but this argument fails because of certain reasons:

1)Jobs grow very slowly overall as compared to the number of people born and maybe not enough to accommodate for all people who are born

2)Most people with jobs continue to do their jobs into old age so availability of jobs decreases

3)Population grows at a very high rate

4)AI will take away many jobs which is the biggest problem

Over time most jobs won't even exist but the population will continue to grow.

Solution:

Capitalism as a model is great until most jobs are automated, then it would be far better to switch to a socialism/communism etc based model to provide the best quality of life to maximum number of people without sacrificing freedom."

It's more than reasonable to assume that human artists keep fans. Music is music, if you like it you like it, if you don't you don't. I'm not particularly convinced it'll be as over-bearing that most people think. Plus, I think if we're able to confirm the artist was human, we may like it more for that reason itself. Yes, it may be *able* to *make* music, but I think there will be another program that can differentiate. Knowing a human made would definitely influence the decision.

Art and music are unlimited. Everyone likes something, AI or not. There are different perspectives and feelings every human gets from something. Making music for a commercial and making music because you love it are different.

I'm also not too convinced it'll be as big of a problem with most things, but especially things that rely on opinions."

0,2024-04-03,cmv: Maoist ideologies are good,u/Stone-Of-Sisyphus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bv3p0x/cmv_maoist_ideologies_are_good/,changemyview,"So basically, for an assignment, I need to consider **Maoism** along with it’s pros and cons, I’ve got what Maoism is and it’s pros, but I need a few cons for the opposing side, I know this isn’t really “change my view” but any responses are still welcome!

It is as transcribed:
Maoism, also known as Mao Zedong Thought, is a political and philosophical ideology developed by Chinese communist revolutionary Mao Zedong. It emerged in the early 20th century as a response to the socio-economic challenges facing China at the time. Maoism has had a significant impact on political movements around the world and continues to be a influential ideology in various contexts.

One of the key principles of Maoism is the concept of class struggle. Mao believed that society was divided into conflicting social classes, with the working class (proletariat) pitted against the ruling class (bourgeoisie). He argued that true liberation could only be achieved through a revolutionary struggle led by the working class to overthrow the ruling class and establish a socialist society. This emphasis on class struggle and revolutionary action distinguishes Maoism from other forms of communism.

Another important aspect of Maoism is its emphasis on mass mobilization and grassroots participation. Mao believed in the power of the masses to drive social change and saw the peasantry as a revolutionary force. He advocated for the creation of mass movements, such as the Cultural Revolution, to mobilize the population and challenge entrenched power structures. This focus on mass participation and grassroots democracy has inspired social movements around the world seeking to empower marginalized communities.

Maoism also places a strong emphasis on self-reliance and independence from external powers. Mao sought to break free from what he saw as the domination of China by foreign imperialist powers and build a socialist state based on principles of autonomy and sovereignty. This emphasis on self-reliance has resonated with anti-imperialist movements in countries struggling against foreign intervention and economic exploitation.

Furthermore, Maoism promotes a vision of socialism that is rooted in the needs and aspirations of the working class. Mao emphasized the importance of meeting the basic needs of the people, such as food, shelter, and healthcare, and saw socialism as a means to improve the material conditions of the masses. This commitment to social welfare and economic equality has had a lasting impact on social policy in countries that have been influenced by Maoist principles.

One of the key strengths of Maoism is its adaptability and flexibility as an ideology. Mao himself emphasized the importance of applying Marxist theory to the specific conditions of each country and adapting revolutionary strategy to suit the local context. This flexibility has allowed Maoism to be adapted and interpreted in different ways by movements around the world, leading to diverse expressions of the ideology in various cultural and political contexts.

In conclusion, Maoism offers a compelling vision of revolutionary change, social justice, and grassroots empowerment. Its emphasis on class struggle, mass mobilization, self-reliance, and social welfare has inspired movements for social change and liberation in diverse contexts. While Maoism has faced criticisms and challenges, its enduring relevance and impact on political thought cannot be denied. As we continue to grapple with pressing global issues such as inequality, exploitation, and environmental degradation, the principles of Maoism offer valuable insights and inspiration for building a more just and equitable world."

Mini-vans are superior to most vehicles for everyday use. With the middle seats removed there's MAXIMUM legroom, more legroom than almost any other vehicle. There's plenty of storage space, more so if you remove the rear bench-seat or get a roof-rack. The gas mileage is usually decent and the safety ratings are usually decent. Not only that but they're not huge, dangerous ostentatious vehicles like the oh-so heterosexually named ***RAM Power-Wagon*** nor are they overpriced/expensive due to demand like a Jeep, Subaru or Bronco. Moreover once you have a family, the whole family can fit into it. The Mini-van is an all around superior motor-vehicle to almost any other vehicle one might buy for everyday use.

With the media refusing to cover trump as much, a significant group of people will have forgotten how radical and polarizing Trump was. This will chance as we get closer to election. This could hurt Trump again or help him.

Often, what people say and what they actually do will be totally different. Many people will vote based on issues that have directly affected their families before voting for issues that affect others. It's protectionism, and it's ingrained into human nature. Right now, many families aren't doing so well.

Many lower and middle income families are feeling overextended financially, and many can't even afford to buy a home. As bad as Trump was, for most of his term, a lot of people weren't having to struggle nearly as bad and there are going to be people that will vote for him that didn't vote for him before in a hopes of returning to their image of normalcy. 

You can turn off the news, but you can't turn off having to face your family when the grocery budget didn't stretch quite far enough this paycheck and having to worry. Or getting your hours cut only to find out that when you look for another job you can't find one.

People may have forgotten how radical Trump was due to the lack of media coverage, but they haven't forgotten the time when they could get a bag of groceries for less than $25 and housing prices were within reach for most. 

Deserved or not, this is what I believe will be Biden's boogeyman in getting reelected. "

But, after doing some research and even doing research here on Reddit, there are a lot of women who also follow the Red Pill ideology and want a ""high-value red pill alpha male."" For example, there are actually a lot of women who follow JustPearlyThings, and Chian Reynolds is a woman who follows JustPearlyThings and apparently likes Andrew Tate. 

I was watching this podcast called the ""WhateverPodcast,"" and a Christian woman and a Red Pill ""alpha male"" named ""Justin Waller"" were saying if he wants multiple wives or to have a family in another country and one in the USA, there is nothing wrong with that. While I personally wouldn't want that, there are some Red Pill and Conservative women who wouldn't mind that lifestyle. 

There are women who follow these ideologies and wouldn't mind her husband having a family in another country or state, even if he barely sees them. I feel like as long as the relationship is consensual and no one is being abused, there is nothing inherently wrong with that. I personally don't care about gender roles, but if a man and a woman equally want to have a traditional marriage with gender roles, then they can do them. There is nothing inherently wrong with it. So, if you are a woman and you want to have multiple husbands and kids who live somewhere else or vice versa, as long as the marriage is consensual, there is nothing inherently wrong, and I don't think that couple deserves hate. CMV.

Edit: Again, I don't like any of these people, but I feel like if a couple wants to have an open relationship, or a wife doesn't mind her husband sleeping around with other women and having multiple families, then there isn't anything wrong with that. As long as the relationship is consensual, and the woman isn't being hurt and she consents to this dynamic, what's wrong with it?"

In recent times, I've observed a trend that has been increasingly concerning to me: the prevalence of what appears to be bullying behavior within conservative circles, I want to make it clear that I understand not all conservatives act in such a way, my intention is not to generalize or disparage an entire group based on the actions of some, but the pattern I've noticed involves a significant enough portion of individuals identifying with conservative ideologies that it prompts me to seek a deeper understanding and dialogue on this issue.  


In my view, bullying takes the form of hostile confrontation, senseless rejection of opposing ideas, and occasionally personal attacks in place of productive discussion, it's an action that is detrimental to thoughtful discourse and in general to the democratic process, which depends on a diversity of viewpoints and civil discourse.  


Is this a mistake on my part, or is there a cultural or ideological component to conservatism that would promote such behavior?  


Is it possible that the actions of a select few are overshadowing conservatives who have polite and meaningful conversations?  


Are there similar patterns within other political ideologies that I am maybe overlooking due to my own biases?  


It is not my view that nothing like this happens on my side of politics but it just seems that every conservative I come across is aiming to upset someone, whether it's the glib hosts of Fox News (Sky News in Australia) That guy who films himself smirking after his half baked thoughts while eating on Tiktok or the many commenters and conservative moderators here on Reddit, they all seem to thrive on this idea that they are hurting people.

From the site - this is where they make distinctions between the two products. 

- What's the difference between Microsoft 365 and Office 2021?  

Microsoft 365:     

- is a subscription that comes with premium apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Publisher, and Access (Publisher and Access available on PC only). The apps can be installed on multiple devices, including PCs, Macs, iPads, iPhones, Android tablets, and Android phones. Microsoft 365 also comes with services like 1 TB of OneDrive storage, 60 Skype minutes per month, and Microsoft chat and phone support. With a subscription, you get the latest versions of the apps and automatically receive updates when they happen.~~

Office 2021:    

- is a one-time purchase that comes with classic apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for PC or Mac, and does not include any of the services that come with a Microsoft 365 subscription. One-time purchases don’t have an upgrade option, which means if you plan to upgrade to the next major release, you'll have to buy it at full price.

  
Literally Office 2021 is a terrible deal. Absolutely not worth the $439.99 price tag.   
  
They don’t want consumers buying the standalone option vs the subscription so I at least recognize that Microsoft isn’t going to put much effort in making the product *compelling*   
  
You’re better off just using the free web version, some compatible OSS, Google or blocking your already installed Microsoft products from being able to update (so you don’t lose access). "

So for 50% of kids if they just live at home and attend a public college, than just working in the summer would pay the full $10,000 tuition. Even if your parents decide to charge you rent, if you just worked full time in the summer and had a part time job throughout the school year, you would have enough to pay for your college tuition and rent. 10,000(summer income) + 10,000(part time job).

People can’t be trusted to breed with the animals’ best interests in mind. Yes, even “ethical” breeders. It’s not healthy nor natural for human beings to have babies back to back to back. It’s not healthy for cats and dogs to have litter after litter after litter. Too many pregnancies degenerate the mother’s bones and can cause numerous health problems, including cancer. 

Breeders, in an effort to create novel, expensive animals, will select for deformities. Whatever trait that sells for the most bang for their buck, regardless of the implications on the animals’ wellbeing and quality of life. 

I’ll even go so far as to say they defraud their buyers by claiming these deformities are normal for the breed. They don’t like to educate their customers about the vet costs and expensive surgeries their animals will have to get in their lifetimes when advertising their puppies/kittens. 

Every pure breed seems to have a much higher risk of inheriting specific congenital diseases/physical deformities. We don’t need any more of any specific breed of cat or dog. Breeding programs should only exist for endangered wild animals or working animals. Cats and dogs will not go endangered for a very long time. They’re prolific and thrive in all kinds of climates. Even if all backyard and “ethical” breeding were outlawed, we would have a surplus of cats and dogs available for families to adopt. 

If there is no good purpose of breeding cats and dogs besides personal profit, it should be outlawed. The concept of an “ethical” breeder just makes no sense to me.

Also i think non-math and non-physics theory to be essentially just politics/linguistics under guise of science and used to manipulate social structure. 

I expect the argument of rights, forced law etc. I would counter most by saying the rights of individuals that individuals hold naturally, are invested into a communist system. I also believe it is an ongoing process to define and understand our natural rights, so I include all rights that we do not even understand we have to be available to us as individuals. Regardless, acceptance of communism is essentially an investment of of some form of capital with the expectation of some sort of return on said capital. How it is practiced is irrelevant as it still operates under capitalist principles. 

Communism doesn’t replace capitalism, it is simply  an invention.

Example 1. A town votes to invest tax money for elderly accessibility. It is an investment with the expected return that our society improves. A person that vetos this, but loses, therefore has the decision to continue investing in this town, or invest in another town. The terms of the voluntary exchange of paying taxes may be broken by simply finding a different transactional partner aka moving. 

Example 2. There is a cascade of voluntary transactions that make transactions viewed independently of context appear to violets capitalistic behaviour avioir, but really do not. A union in a company is allowed under the  bargain made between a corporation and the country they are within. Everyone is dealing with everyone at all times.

For example, rather than ""my partner doesn't love me anymore,"" ""I *feel* that my partner doesn't love me anymore.""

As I see it, ""I feel"" statements are *maybe* healthy in individual sessions (although even this is debatable). When applied to other people, though, I think they're actively harmful. Take the following example:

Partner/friend A: ""I feel that your become distance and don't respect me anymore.""

Partner/friend B: ""That's not true.""

Partner/friend A: ""Don't be so dismissive. You're not acknowledging *how I feel.*""

In this scenario, B is screwed. Supposing what A says is counterfactual or incomplete, they can't acknowledge it without lying. And if they don't, A feels the right to complain.

This leads to ""emotional abuse creep."" Gradually, through this form of gaslighting, A convinces B that falsehoods are truths, and that B should feel very, very sorry for something B never did in the first place.

0,2024-04-04,CMV: 32 Hour work weeks will never work in America until lots of changes in our society are made.,u/DatRussianHobo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bves5c/cmv_32_hour_work_weeks_will_never_work_in_america/,changemyview,"I love the idea of eventually 32 shifting towards 32 hour weeks. Most people question if this would make our situations worse, if no competition of pay is made since more than likely you will just be working 8 hours less.  If this change is made in all industries then it would sound nice if the pay it compensated correctly. 

 There are issues i personally haven't heard anyone talk about that I'm sure will be become concerning if the 32 hour work week is implemented in the near future.

1. A lot of companies refuse giveing their employees full time benefits and schedule them  around 32 hours anyway. Would these said shady companies just try cutting peoples hours to the 20-24 range? I know not every company sucks to work for but there needs to be more enforcement from the government on these places that always without full time benefits like that.

On another hand would more positions that are known to be hourly start being salary and still work 5 days a week? There's nothing illegal if Walmart or any other corporaation wants to make their cashiers and other hourly employees salary if they don't want to hire a bunch of people to accommodate the change.

2. I know some industries like retail/ hospitality and health might not see much change on how operations are managed. However I can see construction projects taking much longer if workers are only out 4 days a week or less if weather is bad. This would cause future projects towns and cities were planning to develop to be pushed back future.
Also, how would the changes  in the school systems schedule would be addressed? How would kids be affected if they don't make up the 20% of the school time? A lot of kids are struggling with the pace they have been learning in currently. Would schooling need to last longer until high school graduation? So instead of the average graduate in America finishing high school at 17 or 18, they will now be graduating around 20-21 years. I'm pretty sure this would piss off everyone that hates school. Not to mention drop out rates will be much more difficult to improve or at least retain at their current rate toin low income areas.
College students probably would have to stay longer since the average time to graduate would take another year if they had an extra day off a week.  This could increase the debt taken on from students thats already high.


There are few mote things that I thought of that could be negatively effected but these situations came into my mind when I thought about the 32 hour work weeks. By no means I think it would fail or it's a bad thing at all. It just won't work right now in 2024. 

Our leaders who make a lot these decisions such as changes with scheduling the school system. I think students could just take a shorter summer or have longer school days in middle and high school. But it's not my call. I just know just having three day weekends because the teachers are off on Fridays now would not be beneficial.

Traffic will suck longer if you live anywhere that's not the middle of nowhere. Im not to sure this can be resolved if  delays in construction are an issue.

I also see the greedy companies remain greedy no matter how long the work weeks are now. Corners are always cut and some labor laws in place are easily exploited. More laws need to be passed from the federal level to prevent any hourly employees moving to salary. If that contract you sign doesn't have any ot bonuses, then technically you can be worked as much as your boss wants.

Overall it sure would be different if 32 hours was the work week. It can work if everything adaps to the change but I don't see this happening until the country is more developed. I still think 40 hours is fair for what most people do but it depends on the industry. ( Which is different everywhere)

I think the only issue with 40 hours is that there are people with horrible time management skills that claim they can't do anything because they have no time during their 9-5. What they mean by ""not having enough time"" is that they either decided to take a job that is an hour drive away for whatever reason that may be. Most people work jobs with tons of walking/ standing that probably aren't cut out for them. A lot some people never learn by going to bed at a decent hour would boost your dopamine levels so you feel more energized.

This proves that he could in fact breathe, as the knee of chavin was placed on the side muscle of his neck, not the adams apple area. After this, Floyd was 'taken to the hospital'. This is where I believe the nefarious actors inside the ambulance decided to kill floyd. 

Why was this done? It is very obvious. To get trump out of office. Covid wasn't enough to cost trump the election, as the poll numbers were still too close for comfort.

I also think it's important to mention that ""post-birth abortion"" isn't really the proper term for what I am in favor of, since that's not really a term that exist, but I quoted that in the title so more people could understand what I meant by ""child euthanasia"" in regards to the context that follows.

I believe that abortion is morally *okay* as long as the fetus/baby is still attached to the mother. Meaning, I am for abortion during any point of the pregnancy cycles, including, and leading up to the removal of the umbilical cord.

I believe that the removal of the umbilical cord officially represents the baby as an *individual* and no longer a physical dependent on the mother.

I am not dehumanizing the newborn in anyway, as I understand that they are human, but I think the mother should still have jurisdiction over the life of said child until it is physically removed from her body (usually no longer than a few minutes after giving birth at most is when the umbilical cord is generally removed.)

I live in the U.S. For people who don't know, abortion was legalized in the U.S. in [1973](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/). In [1992](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/833/), this was upheld. Then, in [2003](https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/3), a law was passed that banned certain forms of ""late abortions"". In [2007](https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/senate-bill/3), this was upheld. Finally, in [2022](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf), a new law was passed that overturned the two laws that were in support of abortion in 1973 & 1992.

In present-day, the legality of abortion in the U.S. is separated by state laws which all have the ability to make abortion completely illegal or to make any regulations regarding it as they wish. 

As you can imagine, child euthanasia is illegal in all formats in the U.S. However, this isn't the case in all parts of the world.

The Netherlands were the first country to legalize euthanasia in [2002](https://wfrtds.org/dutch-law-on-termination-of-life-on-request-and-assisted-suicide-complete-text/). Since then, many other countries have legalized it. 

Both Belgium and the Netherlands allow child euthanasia to occur for children without any age restriction, but Beligium law requires the child to be able to consent to the fact, so they wouidnt apply to my view.

In regards to the Netherlands, however, consent is not required in order to carry out with the procedure for children 0-1 years of age. The only restriction made is that the child must be ""terminally ill"" and/or have ""unbearable suffering"" that gives a medical reasoning to carry out with the procedure.

As [stated](https://www.barrons.com/amp/news/dutch-to-allow-euthanasia-for-under-12s-5a63973a), ""The Dutch protocol however says that if the child is unable to give consent, euthanasia could also be carried out with the parents' permission in consultation with a doctor.""

When it comes to late-term abortions, the NL allows for abortions up to the point of birth or shortly after (essentially what I am in favor of with the exception of not being in favor of post-cord cutting termination.)

That is my view. 

Feel free to try and change it, as I am open to discussions revolving this topic, and I wish to know more about it, as well as why people don't agree with me. 

P.S. My view is not just that I am pro-choice, so please don't try to convince me to be pro-life as that is not the discussion I am asking for.

Thank you!

0,2024-04-04,CMV: Animals don't deserve any rights,u/hotanimetakes111,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bvfnq2/cmv_animals_dont_deserve_any_rights/,changemyview,"Recently, a zoosadist who recorded videos of him torturing monkeys got 5 years in prison. I do not think that his prison sentence was warranted.

My main argument starts from the premise that human beings generally do not value an animal's will to live, as we systematically kill them for their flesh all the time. 99% of people on Earth can live a meatless life or at the very least, reduce their meat intake drastically, meaning eating meat is an optional pursuit that causes harm for unnecessary pleasure.

This is incredibly comparable to how zoosadists operate. Only that, a zoosadist hurts an animal while it's still alive, which is suddenly wrong? I don't think torturing an animal is much worse than systematically killing them for their flesh (when you don't actually have to eat meat).

So why do we have animal rights? Because people have empathy. Empathy is not a good indicator for what ought to be moral or what ought to be immoral, as it is entirely subjective and does not tell us anything about utility. For society to function (and for me to function), I need to respect the rights of other human beings. But we don't have to respect the rights of animals, whatsoever (and we generally don't, anyway, considering we literally eat them). 

We would also gain utility from not having animal rights, due to medical sciences being limited by an ethics department for non-human lab subjects.

Animal rights should be abolished.

I will make an exception for pet animals, but this is more akin to property rights. You shouldn't be able to harm another person's pet, as it is theirs."

However, I strongly disagree with the idea of “diversity is strength”. Ethnically diverse societies historically have the most violence. Multi ethnic states have historically either been extremely polarized and violent, or the ethnicities blend together and lose many of their unique characteristics and heritage. The strongest nations historically have been relatively ethnically homogeneous. That is why today we have a unified Germany and Italy but no Austria Hungary or Ottoman Empire. 

I believe people are better off separate and living amongst their own people, not because we should be divided, but because future generations deserve to be able to appreciate our beautiful variety of cultures around the world, and it would be a shame if those were lost to an ever more interconnected world. If we all become a giant melting pot, the end result will be many cultures and traditions lost. "
175,2024-04-04,CMV: Smoking (anything) should be banned in public in most cases,u/macnfly23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bvkyf3/cmv_smoking_anything_should_be_banned_in_public/,changemyview,"In most European countries and many states in the US, smoking is already banned indoors in most places, restaurants, bars, etc. and even parks in some cases. In my personal experience, despite people saying they wouldn't, these bans have generally worked very well and I think it's quite rare for someone to actually smoke in of these places and get a fine.

Some definitions/clarifications

Smoking - anything, tobacco, marijuana, whatever. Potentially vaping though not sure about that

Public - to keep it simple, public would include everywhere except someone's own house, private property (i.e. car, garden, whatever someone owns). There would be some exceptions like forests or open areas where one can reasonably expect not to meet someone else. It would however include private businesses though, as is the case now with restaurants, bars, clubs in most places I've described. I'd also be open to an exception anywhere if it's very clear that there won't be anyone around you (like 4am in the morning on a street in the suburb).

A lot of times people in CMV tend to focus on very specific things. For example here someone might say ""but how do you define open areas?"" What I'd say is that I'm open to loosening my definition and what I'm only debating here is the basic idea that wherever you have the opportunity to meet a foreign person who doesn't want to/consent to inhaling what you're smoking, you shouldn't be allowed to do so.

Now to get to the reason. I'm not expressing a view on what people want to do in their own homes or with other people who don't mind inhaling smoke. I don't think a ban would be effective or desirable there as clearly it can't be enforced. My idea is that when I walk on a public street, I don't want to inhale second hand tobacco or marijuana, so why should someone be able to ""pollute"" the street like that, by doing something that arguably is bad for them anyway (tobacco at least). Obviously the indoor bans were also controversial and it was easier to justify because there's no open air but even in open air, if there's people smoking on the street it does leave a stench and there's clearly a reason why some parks ban smoking.

A second disclaimer: **I HAVE ALL THE RESPECT IN THE WORLD FOR THE SOLDIERS THAT WERE TO FIGHT IN THE ISLANDS, IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THAT THE REASONS BEHIND IT WERE FAULTY AND OUTRIGHT FALSE, AND ALL IN ALL A POLITICAL MOVEMENT BY THE THEN LOSING POPULARITY MILITARY GOVERMENT. THEY DID SOMETHING THAT  I WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO; SHOW BRAVERY AND HONOR IN DEAD, STAND AND FACE THE BULLETS, AND FIGHT ON. AND FOR THAT, ALL MY RESPECT GOES TO THE BRAVE HEROES OF MALVINAS.**

Now that we got that out of the way, let's get to the topic at hand. The Falkland Isles are not Argentine nor do they belong to Argentina. The whys of it I will explain as a counter-argument to the arguments Argentina gives:  


**1 — the Inheritance Argument:** ""The Falklands are Argentine because we inherited from Spain"" — The Virreinato del Río de la Plata (Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata) never had authority or jurisdiction over the Islands for a prolonged time, nor was it strong enough to merit judicial recognition. There was, in fact, an attempt to stables the Islands in 1770, however, Spain didn't do much, as it had to surrender to Britain's navy, mostly due to a lack of firepower. In fact, the now contested Island weren't part of the Viceroyalty to begin with, they were ""handled"" to them by France to protect them from the British settlers. Eventually, there was an agreement, and Port Egmont was handled to Spain. However, this only lasted 3 years as the British re-stablish their sovereignty on the islands in 1774.

* Addendum: Another argument related to this one is the ""Historical Argument"", that claims that the Falklands are Argentine because of the settlers and the governance belonging to the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. The first part is very easily debunked: The claim surrounds a supposed settlement attempt by the Heroína; this vessel was a privateer, commanded by an **American** captain engaging in outright piracy, not privateering; they had to stop in Port Solitude to repair and take care of their dead; they latter left for Brazil. The second claims surrounds Luis Vernet, an entrepreneur that had a cattle and fishing business on the island.  Vernet was allowed by the British Consulate, and colony rights were granted, including a tax exception. HOWEVER, Vernet would be latter appointed by Buenos Aires, **who didn't had any jurisdiction on the isles,** as ""civil and military commandant"", this is referred by Argentinas a a ""governance"", but Vernet wasn't a legally appointed governor. When Vernet started to expropriate rights, property and built a monopoly on sealing rights, Britain protested, but Buenos Aires, as always, feign ignorance. The quality of life in Vernet's colony were outright miserable. Later, Argentina would (illegally) claim the Islands as their, which would prompt Britain to send a fleet there to put things in order. This is, in Argentina, known as an ""unlawful act of piracy by the British"", which is factually incorrect.
* Re-Addendum: Argentina renounces the claims on the Falklands, by omission, on the Arana-Southern treaty (1840)

**2 — Selfdetermination Argument:** This argument seek to render invalid the right of the island's inhabitants to be called British citizens because ""the British population appeared after 1833, and thus can't be granted said right"", and historically this is wrong, as we know of British settlement since at least the 1690s.

**3 — United Nations:** This argument appeals to several resolutions by the UN, which is just a big argument from authority, and therefore, not valid.

**4 — Geographical Argument:** This argument says ""They belong to Argentina because of administrative reasons, and because of being on the same geographical locations."" or just plain ""They are nearer to Argentina than to the United Kingdom"". That's just nonsense; with that logic, the Canarias should belong to Marruecos, and Norway be part of Sweden (not counting, of course, the Sweddish Empire that did occupy Norway for a time).  


So, change my view: The Falklands are not Argentine. Never were and never will be.

The comparison of the world’s largest modern genocide to not even the largest war taking place in the Middle East right now is fucking crazy.  


I mean, Israel has reduced civilian casualties to like 10% of the global average. It’s something like 1.1:1 ratio of militant to civilian deaths for the Israel-Palestine conflict. Average for modern wars are 1:9 according to the UN and Red Cross.  
Frankly, I don’t even know how you claim genocide when Palestinian political leaders are openly obsessed with martyrdom, having their own people slaughtered, and the other side respond with some of the lowest rates of civilian to militant deaths in modern warfare. And prior to this conflict, Palestinian death toll was down to like 200 people per year or something. Like holy fucking shit, that’s practically Auschwitz right?

The death toll for this current conflict is 1/366ths the size that of the Holocaust. Should this current war go on for the same length of the Holocaust (probably won’t), and at the same rate (most likely would), the death toll would still be 1/20th of the size of the Holocaust. And that would be omitting the tens of millions of other people who died as a result of WW II. Like, 27 million soviets died as a result of WW II. This is how fucking delusional these people are.  
And look, am I surprised at how many people are soaking up literal terrorist propaganda, written in countries where Holocaust denial is the norm?

Fake lips, fake butt, fake boobs, makeup etc.

And I wholeheartedly believe those who say this are full of it. You cannot tell when someone, of **any gender** has had plastic surgery if it's been done well. And most of the time when you are talking about your preferred '*natural*' look with makeup, it's just a full face of makeup with natural tones or something. But it's still a full face of makeup.

If you disagree, please change my view!

If you want to just discuss in the comments, cool. But I also put together a little collage if you think I'm wrong and you can tell the difference. (Link at the bottom of this post)

 It's a few photos of women with and without lip filler, with and without boob jobs, and with and without makeup. If you think you can spot a '**fake**' woman, please let me know haha

Jews and Christians have always moved out of their homes in Arab states when it no longer felt comfortable. And I would suspect they are in a better situation now.

Shouldn't the same apply to Arabs in Gaza? Doesn't it make rational sense?

I mean there are plenty of Arab states to go to. 

The world is calling for a cease fire, and a two state solution, and peace. 

But shouldn't the world really be calling for Arabs to come get their people out of the conflict area? Just like how Christians and Jews got out of Arab countries. 

What am I missing? 

And I'm only thinking from a point of view of a person trying to live, work, and raise family. Not from any geo-political macro point of view.  So reasons that have to do with history, politics, religion, ""that's our land"", don't work in the personal frame of reference. 

And I'm also not thinking from a ""Arab countries won't take them"" point of view. Because that could be solved if people would accept it as a solution to peace. 

I'm also thinking from a ""those poor people they are just being used as pawns"" point of view. So I think it would be better for people to get out of there so they are no longer used like that. 

Anyway, best to just get people out of there?  I mean, that really does seem like the real rational logical long term solution to stop the conflict right?"

Pretty basic, and far from lavish. 

40 hours a week is 24% of one's life. That amount of time should be valued enough by society to grant someone dignity and the ability to cover their basic needs. 

Looking at minimum wage jobs, a worker at McDonald's works harder than many high earning professions, doing a job not many others are willing to do, to provide a service that society would miss if no one was willing to work it. Even low skill jobs, apply stress, exhaustion, and sacrifice of time out of their lives. 

I would also argue that many minimum wage jobs are more important to daily functions of the public, than a lot of cushiony mid to higher level experience jobs, otherwise these jobs wouldn't exist.

People often use the example that a teenager in school doesn't need to make a living wage, however if they are working full time, perhaps they do. Regardless, their effort and the time committed to working said job should warrant the same pay, if they put in the same hours.

23,2024-04-04,CMV: Electric scooters are a great choice for short-medium distance commutes,u/Thencanthen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bvugup/cmv_electric_scooters_are_a_great_choice_for/,changemyview,"I have been using an electric scooter for the past 3 years, at first to commute to campus, and now to work. I love everything about it but I meet a lot of people that are against it. Their arguments usually boil down to “it looks lame” or “people who ride scooters are annoying”. I would like to make my case here and see the real reasons why people are against electric scooters.

Firstly, I recognize that there are a lot people that break traffic laws on scooters. They ignore red lights, go the wrong way on the street or on the sidewalk, endanger pedestrians and themselves etc. However, this is not a fault of the electric scooter. This is an aspect of our culture that we can change. I think the fact that people riding scooters can behave irrationally does not take away from the viability of scootering as a method of commuting, and would not be representative of your own experience granted that you are being safe and follow traffic laws. I wear a helmet every time, ride on the road or bike lanes, stop at stop signs etc. and never had a problem with any of this. Also,  I usually don’t see people who own their scooters commit these dangerous acts, it’s the people on rented scooters like Bird.

Second, there is the environmental aspect. On average I use my scooter 3000 km (1864 miles) a year. If we say that half of that is replacing a trip I would take in a car (going to the store, picking up food, going to work…) then that is 1500 km a year that I don’t use my car. That is 1500 km that I don’t burn fossil fuels to carry tons of excess metal with me. Yes the scooter and its battery have environmental impacts when produced as well, and the electricity it uses has to be generated somehow. However, overall the scooter is a much greener option than taking a car. It is essentially just an electric motor on wheels. Furthermore, the scooter does not cause any emissions itself. 10 people on scooters on the street would take so much less space and release so much less exhaust than 10 people in cars and would make the city a lot more livable.

Next is the convenience aspect. Having an electric scooter really took away the laziness factor in my life. A lot of people say that scootering is unhealthy for me because I do it instead of walking. I feel the opposite, because the convenience of the scooter actually motivates me to go out and do things. I have been to the gym every day last week because the scooter turns the 45 minute round trip uphill walk to the gym into 10 minutes of cruising. I feel a lot more motivated to go to campus, or to a park, to visit my friends, or anywhere knowing that I can easily and quickly get there and back. My social life has greatly improved because I can easily see people at any time. I never have to worry about whether I can find parking either.

Most of this comparison has been about scooters vs cars, but obvious alternatives to scooters are bikes or electric bikes. I think scooters win this comparison as well because of the convenience factor. My scooter is very light and foldable. I can easily find space for it anywhere I go, or I can find an easy place to lock it. Bikes are bulkier and heavier, and require a lot more effort on your part to take you places. Electric bikes are even more bulkier and heavier, not to mention expensive. My scooter is cheaper than any decent bike and it works wonderfully.

For these reasons (and more) I feel that an electric scooter has become an integral part of my life. I would love to hear your opinions on this."

I am NOT simply discussing promotion /relegation. Here's why:

US pro leagues are all ""closed"". You need permission of the other owners to create a team. And to do so requires purchase of an existing team for > billion dollars or hundreds of millions in ""fanchises fees"" paid to the current owners.

Someone could be the greatest, most innovative sports mind in the country but unless they're a billionaire they can't have a team. 

In England every town has a team and those teams are with families for generations. Teams don't ever move to a new town because somewhere is building them a better stadium. Not only this, but random people can start a team and theoretically have it rise to the top of English football. In the US that can not happen, ever.

The US likes to say it's a ""free market"" and ""capitalist"" yet supports sports leagues that extort money from the public to build stadiums (and often threaten to leave if they don't) and celebrates the fact leagues make it almost impossible to expand.

So reddit, if you think a closed system that keeps others out is better than letting the market decide success, CMV."

During the Stone Ages, most men would have been kept busy pursuing sex with women and providing support and resources to women and their children in exchange for affection.  Gay men would not have had these distractions.  They had the free time to count the stars, map the constellations, mark the point of sunrise each day, and track the seasons.  They became the priests, scholars, and leaders of their communities, telling people when to plant crops, when to hunt migrating game, and where to place the stones in religious and astrologic structures. 

I suspect gay men directed the placement of stones at Stonehenge, just as gay men designed the Vatican thousands of years later.  They were men who were not occupied by family obligations.  Homosexual men were the leaders, scholars, teachers, observers, and academics of the human race beginning in the Stone Ages and continuing into the industrial revolution.    "

The NFL has done such a great job with the salary cap and things of that nature. In any other sport, take the prem for example, since 1992, a non “Big 6” team has won twice.

Unfortunately, when it comes to checking a firearm, it varies from airport to airport (as with other things as well). 

Sometimes I’ll simply declare I have a firearm. I let the agent know it’s unloaded, magazines are not in the firearm and the ammo is in a separate container. That will be the end of that. Sometimes I have to open up my neatly packed bag, get the case out and they want to inspect it. In general that’s not a horrible thing but if it can be more convenient, why not? 



I think, if you are a frequent flyer with a particular airline, checking a firearm should be as easy as declaring it all the time and that’s the end of it. No guessing with different agents. 



But you might as, OP, what if someone lies about it being unloaded or ammo isn’t separate. That will easily be discovered once the bag goes through the xray machine. At that point they would call you back to open it up and correct it or your bag doesn’t fly. Either way… you would lose your privileges. 

Doing so wouldn’t put any other travelers at risk. It will move the line quicker for others looking to check their bag as well. 


This would be the case for domestic US travel. There is also no need to question me on why I bring one with me. I can, I do so and that’s the end of it right there.

Rome's engineering feats, including aqueducts and roads, facilitated trade and governance on an unprecedented scale. Additionally, Rome's law and governance systems laid the groundwork for modern societies, with concepts like the rule of law and citizenship originating there. Its cultural influence, evident in literature, philosophy, and architecture, continues to inspire and shape human civilization. Rome also played a pivotal role in the rise of Christianity, significantly impacting the religious landscape of the Western world. Moreover, Roman institutions such as the Senate and republican principles endure, influencing contemporary political systems. In summary, the Roman Empire's multifaceted influence across law, culture, and governance solidifies its position as the greatest empire in history.

I believe that in a perfect world,  social groups that are based upon social classes we can't control wouldn't ever exist. 

It would instead just be the human community (as silly as that sounds) . Or in other words, a wider community that sees people as a diverse line of individuals that are determined by what they can control and not what they can't about themselves

And while that perfect world would never exist, there's nothing wrong with striving towards that point

But I believe it starts with removing these social communities that only exist because of aspects about themselves they can't control. 

While there's definitely good intentions at heart, I believe that even if a long line of racists and racists were to never exist again, these communities made for ourselves would still exist. 

Which isn't far to newer generations in the future who don't care  about all this past of truama and genocide they can't relate to, nor isn't relevant to their individual struggles in the modern day. 

And people of these community groups are gonna keep annoying them with these warnings as if it serves any significant relevance and influence as it did before

That's why it's better to only have communities groups based on what we *can* control about ourselves. Because it allows more inclusivity and equality amongst one another, instead of constant gatekeeping and marginalized groups hating on privileged groups, and vice versa

Once we strive towards communities based on skill, hobbies, interests, personality, etc. Then we'll be more accepting and welcoming of people. Cause at that point, anyone can be anything "

I'm here to say objectively $20/hour is not a lot of money. Companies are making record profits and it's those companies that tell you they can't afford to pay it. $20/hour is $41,600/year assuming you have ZERO time off all year. 

If you're working full time with ZERO time off you deserve $41,600/year.

One of my biggest fears, due to rumors that had spread about me in high school, was to be viewed as a slut/whore by society.

To give more context, I basically was manipulated into thinking I would get into a relationship with a guy, then dropped him when I found out he wasn’t committed/was talking to other girls. He later gave me death threats, leaked my nudes and told people I was a desperate slut.

I was tormented relentlessly afterwards, with some students even resorting to scream profanities at me as I walked past. You’d think I was in a movie at this point with how far they took this bullshit. 

And when I got to college after graduation, things got even worse.

After finally mustering up the courage to (regrettably) lose my virginity to a guy that I had met in my co Ed dorm, the first thing that he did the next day was tell everyone that he finally got “it”. People treated me so differently after that.

Sure, some were still kind and sympathetic to me, but I still felt their judgement. Although I begged him to stop telling people, he told me he would stop, only to describe to his friends what my genitalia, breasts, and butthole looked like in detail. This, reasonably, enraged me and made me want to stop talking to him forever. So when I told him I didn’t want to have sex anymore, he lost his mind and went on a downward spiral (punching walls, crying, screaming, even following me when I was alone and trying to corner me)

We are no longer together. But, sometimes I think back to the moments of clarity, when I would ask these boys “are you just using me for sex/pleasure?”

They both had insisted that they weren’t. I may have been naive, but that should not excuse this. I have had interactions with men in between these two experiences that have been extremely similar but I’m much more guarded than I sound, so none of them got into my pants (ex: coworkers, strangers, friends), but the theme that remains consistent is their tendency to pretend to be harmless and friendly while harboring bad intentions. Boys like this need to learn to stop fucking lying to people and acting wounded when it is implied that they’re only around for sex, even though they know it’s true. I can only count on one hand the amount of men who have not tried to exploit me for sex.

(Please change my view, I’m hoping that there are good people out there who disagree with my take but my life experience has proven it correct almost consistently) "
0,2024-04-04,CMV: It's hypocritical to be against incest if you're pro-LGBT,u/Sky_Sumisu,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bw6cf4/cmv_its_hypocritical_to_be_against_incest_if/,changemyview,"I once was a Libertarian, and during my Libertarian days, both incest and LGBT rights seemed pretty ""open-and-shut"" cases (And long as you weren't a paleo): They're not harming anyone, so why not let sleeping dogs lie?

In time, I became a progressive, but I found no contradictions between this and that. In fact, progressive arguments can 100% defend it: If two consenting individuals love each other, why not let them?  
Which is why it came as a massive surprise to me that many so-called progressives and allies are VEHEMENTLY against incest.

Once again, not because there's a contradiction between the two positions, quite the opposite, but rather that they choose to actively not use progressive arguments when it comes to this subject, instead choosing to use some very reactionary ones: I'm talking people with gay and trans flags on their name using ""It's disgusting"" and ""It's unnatural"" as arguments, unable to notice they sounded exactly like the people that hate them.

One of the arguments I saw people throwing left and right is ""What about the kids with genetic defects?"", but that's easy to debunk:

1. Genetic conditions aren't that simple. It's just that incest makes it easier, IF your family has some very negative recessive genes, for them to appear (But once again, the same can happen for a non-incest relationship), but that's not a guarantee.
2. If ""Making it easier for your children to have defects"" is an argument, then that people should also be against women above 35 from having children, but they aren't.
3. Birth control exists. So for me their argument is no different than saying ""Gay people shouldn't marry because AIDS exists"" and sounds just as ridiculous.
4. That sounds lowkey eugenicist.

But there's more: A couple months ago I made a thread about this on a very popular subreddit to try to understand if ""I was the asshole"" in the situation and/or if I was missing something obvious, but that made me get banned from there for ""Trolling"". The thing is, when I appealed for the admins there that I wasn't trolling, but rather was a ""true believer"" on what I was saying, they just responded with ""That's even worse"".

Honestly, I don't get it, I don't get it at all: All the arguments you can use in defense of one you can also use in defense of the other, so I don't understand why incest causes such visceral reactions on people. So far, my only theory is that people just see it as something ""right-wing coded""? Honestly, I'm out of theories."

Even if that person is bad or has done something wrong, you're then equating them with anyone else who has a small penis, who hasn't done something wrong. But I'm even more worried about what this is doing to our culture. I'm a bisexual man, and I have met many guys who have 6 inch or greater penises, who are concerned about their size because they're worried that they are too small. We've created a society that's so stigmatized, even men who are above average are worried about it.

I also think criticizing small penises can be bad for women and for society in general. Have you ever seen someone buy a fancy car or a lot of guns and other people would say: ""it's because they're compensating for something?"" I think this saying can actually be true: when people feel insecure, they try to reassure themselves but distracting themselves with other things, or even by releasing their anger elsewhere. And that ends up contributing to people buying gas guzzling cars, toxic masculinity, and misogy to make up for their own insecurity.

They used to have an eating disorder, and then they went in the opposite direction, which is likely brought on by advanced algorithms and trends that induce lazy behavior and thinking, aka hyper individualism disguised as collective coalition. 

I’ve tried everything I could to be indirect and compassionate, but things are getting bleak, and part of my issue is that one day, when they get older, their coping mechanism that allows them to positively look into the mirror will one day no longer work, and they will face a bleak mountain to feel at their peak again. “It took me a while to be comfortable in my body” and “there is no such thing as bad food”. That’s great. But what you *doing* with that understanding? Likely nothing, because the abstract understanding overrides the need to become better than you currently are. 

I feel as though pushing against objectifying people and holding unrealistic beauty standards is great, but the baby is absolutely being thrown out with the bath water in this case. People are using the idea of fighting systemic injustice to completely ignore the fact that you can and should become better. Being your best self isn’t succumbing to base impulses and adhering to the path of least resistance. 

I fear many young people are victim to not only this strange mindset, but also to many other social trends born out of dubious and questionable origins with their best interest no where in sight. While the intentions are good, I think most people might end up misinterpreting the message and end up regretting life and their behavior as they end up in a hospital, don’t land a good job, or miss out on a great partner because they failed to take care of themselves when they were younger.

0,2024-04-05,"CMV: Younger Generations Are Right And Justified To Be Lonelier, Since Most Groups Of People Are Not Worth Being A Part Of Anymore",u/Born-Veterinarian639,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bwapkd/cmv_younger_generations_are_right_and_justified/,changemyview,"I am a 25 yo zoomer studying for both an M.D. and Ph.D. degree (doctor and scientist). I have recently left a few groups of friends and people I was a part of, and for one of the first times in my life I can say I have been ""lonely"" or really without friends for a significant time.

During this time, really the last three months, my life improved significantly. I feel like for the first time in my life, I'm able to do things I really enjoy while not being subjected to other people pushing me into some kind of box or assuming things about me that aren't true. 

I've come to realize that the main reason this is the case, is that most groups of people fall under what I would call ""groupthink"" or categorical thinking. You could also call this ""gatekeeping"" I guess, but it just feels like nowadays, if you don't fall COMPLETELY in line with everything a group does and every way they think, you get shunned and ostracized.

I firmly believe that due to social media, it is significantly harder to be an individual. I feel as though the internet has pushed people into echo chambers and cycles of repetitive information to the point where you can't exist outside of those groups of people. 

I am part of my graduate school's student committee. One of the saddest things I've heard is that people feel as though they can't talk about the current conflict occurring in the world unless they side with either Isreal or Palestine, and take a staunch stance in doing so. This is utterly fucking pathetic, and in my opinion a failure of our country to regulate the internet for young people.

In the discussion of politics, this is an incredible issue in modern times, and has only gotten worse as I've become an adult. Politics has effectively replaced religion in modern society. People give so much value to the labels ""liberal"" and ""conservative,"" that people truly believe having this label means they are a part of a group of people that supports them and thinks like them. Uuuuuh, no, there are not two ""liberals"" or ""conservatives"" who think exactly like each other. So then of course, this creates echo chambers when people get mad you don't completely fall in line with whatever the monolith of ""conservative"" or ""liberal"" has become, because this has become such a large part of their identities and they now have to protect that monolith. This is how we get leftists supporting one human rights violation-committing third-world country over another, and Trump supporters. Utterly fucking pathetic what modern politics has devolved into. Literally religion with extra steps, yet half of you would claim to hate religion. 

So this quite literally makes anyone who unironically labels themselves ""conservative"" or ""liberal"" incompatible to be friends with, because they will take any individual opinion I have that doesn't fall in line with their monolith and resent me for it. This already eliminates a lot of people I could potentially be friends with. But of course, since I couldn't really be myself with these people, they wouldn't really be worth being friends with to begin with, hence I'm justified. 

Unfortunately, this also applies to a lot of other groups I've recently left or dissociated from, I will list each of these groups now, and what their ""monolith"" is, meaning what concepts and ideas they use to gatekeep and siphon the individuality of people who unfortunately decided to try and be apart of these groups.

Fraternity: recently had to leave my fraternity because they all unironically acted like they were moderates, but they all had conservative opinions. They went off the deep end to the point where they started shitting on minorities after some shooting, at which case I left. Couldn't have a liberal opinion without being considered a ""libtard,"" even though I'm not a liberal, lol.

Sports Fans: you're apparently not allowed to like Patrick Mahomes and like the sport of American football, even though he's like 1 of 4-5 actual good quarterbacks still left in the league. Sports chats and communities are now filled with either people who think it's rigged by woke taylor swift or hate the people who think it's rigged. It's either people who demonize athletes or worship them. Have fun being a casual fan in 2024 while trying to be social with other sports fans, you will get thrown out of that gate quite quickly.

Doctors: Most doctors are elitist pricks who only got into med school because some family member was a doctor. They all pretty much only care about money and don't do the job for the right reasons. I doubt I'll get much pushback saying this community is gatekept and not worth making friends with.

Scientist: Pretty much every Ph.D. and Ph.D. student I've met has a massive ego and thinks they're better than everyone else. I love doing my Ph.D. and am glad I did it in conjunction with medical school, but the amount of Ph.D.s who think they're smarter than they really are is astounding. They are almost as competitive, narcissistic, and selfish as medical students, but that's an incredibly tough group to beat. Still not worth being friends with these people.

&#x200B;

This is just to name a few of the groups I've decided to leave or not make friends with. All of these were done based on observation and not emotion or bias. 

So please, tell me, how am I not justified in being lonely? Why should I go and try to make friends again when I need to sacrifice my individuality, freedom, and identity to do so? My life is the best now it's ever been, I love being myself without others assuming dumb things about me, it's liberating. Can you change my view?"

Christianity has no future,u/ImposterModAmongUs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bwbbjn/cmv_christianity_is_a_barren_religion/,changemyview,"There is nothing in Christianity which is comparable to the Upanishads or to the teachings of Gautam Buddha. Christianity is a barren religion. It has not created anything like Zen or Sufism or Hassidism, for the simple reason that it has never allowed any rebellious spirit. It has been cutting the rebellious spirit from the roots.

Religion reaches to its heights only through the rebellious people, not through the mundane, the ordinary; not through the obedient; not through those who are satisfied just to believe that they will be saved, but only by those who make an effort to save themselves. Christianity has not allowed them.

It is the most out-of-date religion so there is great fear. It has nothing to offer, and the more it resists the mystic teachings coming to the West, the more it will be in trouble because the youth, the young people, are no longer interested in Christianity. It has nothing of interest. It is a sick religion. It stopped growing the day Jesus was crucified.

The Eastern religions have been growing because the rebellious people may not have been liked, may not have been accepted by the orthodox, but they were not killed. And when they blossomed, even the orthodox had to accept that they were wrong.
It is because of this quality that the highest peaks of Zen, Sufism and Hassidism became possible. These are the most rebellious elements in Buddhism, in Mohammedanism and in Judaism.

Hinduism has no future, just as Christianity has no future. Both have lost touch with reality, both are hanging only with empty words. You cannot deceive people for long. And other circumstances are helping. For example, Tibet has been taken over by China, so all the best Tibetan lamas had to leave Tibet. Now they are all over the world... and Tibet has one of the greatest disciplines to create a new man.

Hassidism is not accepted by the orthodox Jews, but it will be accepted by the new generation.

For clarification, I'm not referring to ""well rounded stylists"", who can do all textures. No I'm not complaining that people can finally do textured hair. If you're not knowledgeable on hair and textures, please limit your response.

I am referring to people who have never had a cornrow in their life, and solely make profit off of cultural hairstyles. Yes, certain styles do belong to a culture. For example, Kimonos belong to the Japanese culture. They're not ""just clothes"". 

 These styles are meant for certain textures, and have histoy dating back hundreds of years. That's simply true. I'm not looking to change my view on that. 

It's hard for me to grasp the concept of doing styles on textures of hair that you literally don't have. I can straighten my hair and have straight hair for the time being. No I'm not trying to be white lol. There's nothing anyone can realistically do to imitate the afro texture.

It's weird and predatory to me when people that aren't a part of a culture, cherry pick certain things from said culture to make money off of. If you do everyone's hair, cool.
But going out of your way to learn things with no cultural significance to you and turning around to profit on them. Idk

Especially when said culture was taught that their cultural styles weren't presentable/acceptable. It makes them appear as disingenuous and also takes the cultural significance out of it.

In the US it's often classed as ""tangible individual products"", even though the use of pads and tampons are absolutely a necessity for women and girls. Just because the product is not used by men doesn't mean it's not essential. If there is an essential product that only men use that it should be tax exempted as well.

Additionally, federally assistance programs should be allowed to use their funds to purchase these products, because as it stands women cannot buy them with pre-tax dollars at all. It's just another way to tax an essential item when this category of products are usually exempted from tax.

Will it going to be game-changer for women and girls? Probably not, but it only takes a simple administrative correction to fix this inequality."

The main beinifts I see from this is:

1. Better access to complex subjects for amateurs in a field 
2. An alternative to textbooks
3. Diffrent ways to help people understand the subject using different teaching style
4. If this had a big library of subjects it could help poorer students gain better qualifications and education

Possible negatives:

1. It could make schools lose money on course when teachers die soon after starting
2. It could discourage schools from hiring older teachers

These issues could be solved by the course being paid for until the school breaks even on the cost of the course or until a certain period of years after release

When it comes to Russia, I get the need to ban the country and have them compete as neutral athletes. That Russia was caught with a state sponsored program is valid reason for them to not be able to send a team.

That said, I've read calls to ban anyone from Russia from competing in any event and even going so far as to ban athletes from other nations if they are of Russian origin and have been living in that country for two years or less. I think this is based on wishful thinking that Russia is somehow unique in terms of doping. They may have a sort of state sponsored program others may not have. That said, there could be any number of private orgs, labs, sponsors and others getting involved in doping in other nations.

The only workable solution is to have Russians compete as neutral athletes, allow Russians in other nations to compete for them if desired and to just treat doping violations on a case by case basis. And at the end of the day, doping programs, with the OIC or anyone else, in practical terms serve a purpose of making sure athletes don't completely kill themselves at young ages.

As such I am readily prepared to change my view after hearing the input of someone who knows better. Any insights I do have, come from reading a lot of history including military history and from like playing military strategy games. I know very little about the ins and outs of today’s military or geopolitcal strategy. I am coming here to learn, not to soapbox.

My current view is: it would be a wise move for Denmark (where I live) to prioritize building up our navy even if it’s at the expense of our forces on land

A little background and context:

- Our military in general is in a dreadful state. For example we are currently going through a hilarious scandal where an actively patrolling warships turned out to have non-functioning weapons due to neglect. And just this week a stretch of sea was ordered evacuated as a rocket was accidentally activated during repairs. It has recently come to the public’s attention that there are deep structural problems in our underfunded military.
- Denmark participated in the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions, and while the decisions to join were and remain very controversial, I think we generally have the impression our troops did a good job considering our small size
- Since then I think we have been complacent and disillusioned about military. We are a tiny country surrounded by friendly nations – why do we need defense? We don’t want to participate in another ill-advised offensive war halfway across the globe. So the issues in the military didn’t get taken very seriously. I was probably guilty of this too.
- This changed after Russia invaded Ukraine. Suddenly a lot of political attention was dedicated to getting our military up to snuff. It’s stupid that that’s what it took, but here we are.

My arguments:

Denmark should focus on it’s navy (and maybe airforce as well) rather than land army.

- Defensive focus. I believe we should be incredibly cautious of getting involved in another offensive war halfway around the globe. Even if the cause would be justified, recent history has shown it’s very hard to succesfully accomplish long-term goals through invasion and occupation.
- Who are our enemies and friends. We are not concerned by invasion from our land borders. If an invasion happened through Germany something else would have to have gone horribly wrong and we’d be fucked either way.
- We’re only a link in the chain. We’re too small to matter militarily on our own. We can’t take on another world power and win. Instead we should see ourselves as part of the alliances of NATO and the EU and focus on working well together with them. As such specialization makes a lot of sense. Let someone else be the expert in land warfare and let us specialize so we can punch above our weight in one specific aspect.
- Our internal geography. As a country we’re pretty much all coastline. A significant portion of our population lives on islands (small or large)
- Our strategic position. If Russia wants to sail through the Baltic Sea they have to come through us. We can make the biggest difference by locking down the seaways. We’d have to rely on our allies’ support too, but it would be great if our own expertise could lead the way.
- Keeping them off the land. If no hostile ships or planes reach your shores, what do you need land troops for? For centuries Britain has not seen any hostile forces on its own mainland due to its strong navy (and also later air force).
- Naval tradition. This is probably the weakest of my arguments, but Denmark has historically been a sailor nation. I don’t think that holds a lot of weight for the average Dane today, but even for us landlubbers the sea is kind of an everpresent thing in our lives."

I have thought about this for a long time since I played soccer as a little kid and I've decided that the idea of participation trophies isn't inherently bad, but they are used poorly.

**Think about this example for a second:**
A military unit comes back from deployment and they have a ceremony to award medals and a parade. Every member of the regiment is awarded the campaign medal. Five soldiers get a medal for bravery and one gets the highest medal. The regiment marches off into the parade and some armchair general says 'Look at those guys with the campaign medal, they are giving out participation trophies!'

Obviously I am not comparing a military deployment to a 6 year old's soccer game but I hope you understand the idea. At the end of the game someone has to win and someone has to loose. The best player can get their trophy, but it's not unreasonable to give everyone *something.*

It's important to teach children the importance of showing up, working hard, and putting in the effort even if they don't win. You didn't get the gold and that's okay, but you showed up and did your best.

As a kid I HATED working super hard on something and not getting any recognition because everything was ""First Past The Post.""

I'm conclusion: Not everyone deserves the same recognition as the winner, but its okay to recognize commitment.

(I’m replacing the component of it that relates to maximizing happiness/pleasure with understanding/knowledge/and wisdom)


Rationalize it this way, the only reason anything exists is because things throughout time has served some utilitarian purpose all the way down to the quantum mechanics of things, the fundamental forces and etc all served very specific functions that led us up to this point and if things served no function/purpose then reality wouldn’t exist in the first place therefore utilitarianism is the ultimate philosophy of reality, based on our current understanding of it. I’m not above thinking that I might be wrong later on once we have advanced further but that lends itself more to my argument that the essence of life is objectively more valuable than any other subjective interpretation of purpose because it’s the one value that leads us to knowing more about meaning and purpose in its totality

0,2024-04-05,CMV: Shakespearean plays would make more sense if performed in American English than Standard British English,u/Sorchochka,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bwlrn7/cmv_shakespearean_plays_would_make_more_sense_if/,changemyview,"Shakespeare’s plays were all written in the late 1500s to the early 1600s. This was during the tail end of the Great Vowel Shift happening in England and certainly before Modern British English adopted the non-rhotic (or “soft”) r sound. 

During this time, there was British immigration to the US happening and the Elizabethan dialect was also shipped out to the Americas. The USA and Canada also kept the “hard” rhotic r sound. While all dialects of English have evolved past this time, I think the dialects in North America are still closer to Elizabethan than in Standard British English.

We also know that Shakespeare has a lot of wordplay in his work, and that some of this wordplay is lost to changes in speech. For example, in the prologue to Romeo and Juliet, the line:

> From forth the fatal loins of these two foes

Has a double meaning. In Elizabethan English, “loins” and “lines” are homonyms. So he’s literally saying loins but also the family lines. Because of instances like this, I think we would get not all, but much more wordplay from performances if the language was closer. I think getting more of that would make these plays more understandable to audiences as some meaning is lost and some scenes could be less cohesive. 

One consideration I had in this argument is that *other* accents in the UK could be even better than the ones in North America, but for my argument here, I wanted to stick to the differences in RP Standard English vs Standard American because I believe what we see is mostly Standard English performances.

0,2024-04-05,CMV: Fantasy Fiction Is (Mostly) Pretty Bad,u/ThatSpencerGuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bwm6nr/cmv_fantasy_fiction_is_mostly_pretty_bad/,changemyview,"Happy Friday!

**NOTE: Yes, this is a “subjective” opinion! I am asking you to change my mind about something subjective. All of the posts in this sub are subjective, more or less. You don’t see too many posts along the lines of “CMV: Triangles have four sides.” I am looking to expand my taste and asking you for help! Make a case in favor of fantasy novels!**

I’m a big reader, but I can’t get into fantasy fiction, and every time I try, I inevitably bounce off. I’m sure that this is partly a function of which books I’ve tried –there must be some novels that I would like better than others.

But I also think this is partly an issue of orientation. I think I don’t understand the pleasures of fantasy writing. Help me out!

I’m going to lay out the issues with fantasy fiction, as I experience it:

* **Prose is badly suited to what is most interesting about fantasy**. What most differentiates fantasy from other kinds of books is its setting. As a result, I think that visual mediums like movies and TV are really well suited to fantasy stories, where you can quickly and evocatively *show* the strange world. Video games are even better, because the player can decide how much they explore the world, and the author can include deep detail (“lore”) as optional information. The strength of prose, on the other hand, is in its ability to be fully interior to characters’ experiences in a story, to really depict what it’s like to be a person in the world.
* **Fantasy books are badly written**. Despite what people say about fantasy writing vs literary writing, in my experience it’s fantasy novels whose writing is often on the purple-y, indulgent side of things. I’m shocked when I read fantasy books, because they sometimes read like prose style hasn’t changed since Victorian England. Long, complicated sentences. Dense paragraphs. Details on details on details. Descriptions of eye colors and trees and food. The kind of books I like tend to be diamond-sharp, with clear surprising sentences.
* **Fantasy books are too long**. I think this is a function of my first point above. The setting is so central to the genre, but without images authors just have to spend a lot of *words* explaining and describing the world. But I also think it’s a stylistic thing in fantasy where more = better.
* **The characters in fantasy stories aren’t very interesting**. I feel like fantasy stories often have large casts of relatively one-note characters rather than going deep on the experiences of a small number. This can be good sometimes (I really like Anthony Trollope’s books!), but I haven’t seen fantasy characters that were really insightful and surprising depictions of what humans are like.

So what do I misunderstand about the pleasures of fantasy books? Why do you like them? Why would you rather read a fantasy book than play a fantasy video game? Why would you rather read a fantasy book than another kind of novel?

**EDIT**: **I'm really looking for an affirmative case for fantasy! Please tell me why you love fantasy books!** You don't need to address my issues above except to the degree that it's helpful for you to understand where I'm coming from. **I am not trying to make you not like fantasy!**"

I'm talking about weighing the pros and cons of either system; so the cons that I can foresee with my proposal are the following:

1. More work: this is unavoidable. If laws need to be reimplemented when they expire, then that means time needs to be taken on reimplementing old laws and not just considering new laws.
2. Entrenches laws in certain situations: If a law has an expiration condition, then people might struggle to repeal that law before the conditions are met.
3. Load bearing law crisis: An old law that was integral to the functioning of other laws or even society might fail to be reimplemented causing problems.
4. The usual suspects: All political tools have to contend with bad actors and this is no different. Enough bad actors might, for example, make a law with absurd expiration conditions - a problem exacerbated by problem 2.

Despite these problems I think there are stronger positives and ways to minimize some problems. For one, I think you could make the reimplementation process such that problem 3 is minimized and that the laws you do reimplement have better expiration conditions or none. I think that this method would make the legal system more adaptable to an evolving environment which I think is preferable to having a more byzantine system that would be more likely to be replaced wholesale than to be updated.

So please help me see how the flaws I've noticed would be worse than I think or that I've overlooked flaws altogether."

That’s clearly the joker and it’s undeniable. However, I believe the the green goblin as a villain is just as good as the joker. Obviously it’s subjective and it can’t be objectively proven but I pretty much want to hear you guys out as to why he may or may not be on that level or slightly ahead. 

Batman has always been my favorite and I always loved Joker whether it’s the comics, shows, and The Dark Knight was pure cinema(!!) he literally stole the show. My older cousin argued that GG was better because he has done more psychological damage to Peter that a lot people don’t know because they don’t read the comics & they go off the movies so it’s easier to say Joker when you’re exposed to him more. I, though, don’t think lack of exposure is a fair argument since you can still pull off alot in limited action. Shit, Thanos was in 2 movies and he’s alot of peoples favorite villain. 

So I’d like to see some arguments for GG "

However, it does not protect against hatred on the basis of sex.

The act should be changed so that it protects sex. I'm fine if it also protects against hatred on the basis of gender. (A term that sounds similar to ""gender"", but is not quite the same, is currently protected)

Hatred on the basis of sex is real, and is serious like the other hatreds the act protects against. The act protecting against several groups but not sex is a noticeable omission that feels like a deliberate snub.

There is talk of a separate act (a Misogyny Act) to do with [hatred on the basis of sex](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7200756wz7o) but that's something that if enacted, will occur in the future, whereas the current act could be amended now to include sex until a law specific to sex exists. There's also no guarantee that such an act will be enacted.

According to the BBC a Scottish government spokesperson said ""Women, like everyone else, are already protected from threatening or abusive behaviour in law,"" but the same could be said for any other protected group, so by itself that's [special pleading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading).

I wouldn’t go that far. But I 100% believe that in many sports, it’s absolutely possible for a women to make it to the major leagues.

Basketball is the best example, in my opinion. A shooter is a shooter is a shooter. There are bench players in the NBA who are paid millions of dollars to stand on the 3 point line for 10 minutes a game, and let’s not act like there have never been NBA players that are 6’ or shorter. If you’ve got a great shot, coaches will go to the ends of the earth to find you. I’m convinced that Caitlin Clark and Sabrina Ionescu would be competent, if not good, if thrown onto an NBA roster as the 15th person on the roster to chuck a few threes in garbage time. Given some time and training, Clark’s ceiling definitely seems higher. Unfortunately, I don’t think any woman without a 3 point shot would have much of a chance.

Baseball is another possibility. Genevieve Beacom started pitching professionally in Australia against men at just 18, and has a mid-80s fastball with 2 good offspeed pitches. If an 18 year old can hit 86, it’s not unreasonable that we’d see a woman who can touch the low 90s, which is absolutely major league caliber with the right skillset. That’s without even mentioning knuckleballers like Eri Yoshida. There aren’t really any examples of position players, but I don’t see any reason why an elite woman couldn’t be a solid contact hitter, although I doubt we’d see any home runs. 

Will we see a woman make it to the major leagues anytime soon? Probably not. But I wouldn’t be shocked whatsoever if we saw it within some of our lifetimes."

1. The PRC gets strong enough to attempt unifying China by conquering the ROC
2. Israel vs. Hamas escalates into USA vs. Iran
3. Territorial disputes in the South China Sea spiral into a hot war
4. The DPRK attempts to exploit ROK demographic collapse to conquer it
5. Russia is emboldened from conquering Ukraine and attempts to conquer a NATO nation that it formerly owned
6. Civil war
7. Conflicts stemming from nuclear exchange assuming I survive the nuclear exchange

First, regarding scenarios 1 to 5, these potential wars are based on territorial claims. Territorial claims usually unite a nation - for example, [Russian opposition figures agree with at least some Russian expansionism](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2023/3/4/why-ukraine-is-wary-of-the-russian-opposition), while [Venezuela's claims to Essequibo unite both government and opposition supporters](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/04/maduro-venezuela-guyana-essequibo-referendum-vote-turnout). The reason I bring these up is to show that unless you can convince the people of a country to stop supporting their territorial claims, wars based on territorial claims can only be postponed. And changing the minds of an entire country is a herculean task.

Second, regarding scenarios 1 and 4, both conflicts stem from rival governments continuing to exist, and are frozen conflicts stretching back decades. This means that the factions in such a war are especially enthusiastic as they consider themselves as quashing a rebellion.

Third, regarding scenarios 2 and 7, both have their roots in balance-of-power politics. [With many factions taking sides in the Israel-Hamas War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzSRMzb_2jE), if either side were to be defeated, the factions on the losing side would be alarmed at the shift in balance-of-power and would be likely to launch a more drastic military action. Intelligence agencies are already [forecasting an Iranian retaliation for Israel's bombing of the Iranian consulate in Damascus](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-to-retaliate-israeli-bombing-syria-consulate-officials-believe/). Meanwhile, a nuclear exchange is most likely when a leader in possession of nuclear weapons feels cornered and wants to take their enemies down with them.

Fourth, regarding scenario 6, political polarisation and societal issues (e.g. homelessness, stagnating incomes, increasing cost of living) are ripping Australian society apart, and it's possible that it just keeps getting worse until it becomes a civil war. It also appears that similar phenomena are happening in other Western nations.

Fifth, the current Russia-Ukraine War has also demonstrated that authoritarian regimes can become very robust. The governments of Russia and Iran are still going strong even despite severe sanctions. They are also able to quash any dissent caused by economic problems. Even problems caused by corruption are compensated for by having a robust state that can just muster more people to throw into the meat grinder. I wouldn't be surprised if the PRC and DPRK heed this lesson when attempting to conquer the ROC and ROK, respectively.

Sixth, the USA is the main military ally of Australia, the ROC, the ROK and arguably most of Europe. With [an increasing desire for isolationism in the USA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEX2MMyK6ps), as well as rampant political polarisation, the USA is looking like it would be either unwilling to come our aid, or simply wouldn't exist anymore. Either we find a way to become militarily powerful ourselves (and that still means I get conscripted) or we face defeat.

Geopolitical machinations mean that war is imminent, even if my most-to-least-likely list is a bit off. Either my life gets disposed of in war, or I somehow survive and come back a veteran. Before you suggest ""*just leave Australia*"", most countries are either headed towards international conflict or civil war."

0,2024-04-06,CMV: Jesus never died on the cross. ,u/ImposterModAmongUs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bx9i97/cmv_jesus_never_died_on_the_cross/,changemyview,"Jesus never died on the cross. It takes at least forty-eight hours for a person to die on the Jewish cross; and there have been known cases where people have existed almost six days on the cross without dying. Because Jesus was taken down from the cross after only six hours, there is no possibility of his dying on the cross. It was a conspiracy between a rich sympathizer of Jesus and Pontius Pilate to crucify Jesus as late as possible on Friday -- because on Saturday, Jews stop everything; their Sabbath does not allow any act. By the evening of Friday everything stops.

The arrangement was that Jesus would be crucified late in the afternoon, so before sunset he would be brought down. While Jesus was still on the cross, a soldier speared his body, and blood and water oozed out of it.

The incident is recorded in the Gospel of St. John: ""But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water."" This has led to the belief that Jesus was alive on the cross, because blood does not flow out of a dead body.

 He might have been unconscious because so much blood had flowed out of the body, but he was not dead. Then he would be kept in a cave, and before the Sabbath ended and the Jews hung him again, his body would be stolen by his followers. The tomb was found empty, and Jesus was removed from Judea as quickly as possible. As he again became healthy and healed, he moved to India and he lived a long life -- one hundred and twelve years -- in Kashmir.

It is a coincidence, but a beautiful coincidence, that Moses died in Kashmir and Jesus also died in Kashmir. I have been to the graves of both. The graves are ample proof, because those are the only two graves that are not pointing towards Mecca.

Mohammedans make their graves with the head pointing towards Mecca, so in the whole world all the graves of Mohammedans point towards Mecca, and Kashmir is Mohammedan.

These two graves don't point towards Mecca, and the writing on the graves is in Hebrew, which is impossible on a Mohammedan grave -- Hebrew is not their language. The name of Jesus is written exactly as it was pronounced by the Jews, ""Joshua."" ""Jesus"" is a Christian conversion of the Jewish name. The grave is certainly of Jesus.

A family has been taking care of both the graves -- they are very close together in one place, Pahalgam -- and only one family has been taking care of them down the centuries.

They are Jews -- they are still Jews -- and I had to take their help to read to me what is written on the graves.

Moses had come to Kashmir to find a tribe of Jews who were lost on the way from Egypt to Jerusalem. When he reached Jerusalem his deep concern was the whole tribe that had got lost somewhere in the desert. When his people were established in Jerusalem, he went in search of the lost tribe, and he found the lost tribe established in Kashmir. Kashmiris are basically Jewish -- later on Mohammedans forcibly converted them -- and Moses lived with them and died there.

Jesus also went to Kashmir, because then it was known that Moses had found the lost tribe there. The doors of Judea were closed -- he would be hanged again -- and the only place where he would find the people who speak the same language, the people who have a same kind of mind, where he would not be a foreigner, was Kashmir. So it was natural for him to go to Kashmir.

But he had learned his lesson. He had dropped the idea of being the only begotten son of God; otherwise these Jews would crucify him too. He dropped the idea of being a messiah. He lived with his few intimate friends and followers in Pahalgam.

Pahalgam is named after Jesus, because he used to call himself ""the shepherd"" -- Pahalgam means ""the town of the shepherd."" So it was a small colony of Jesus and his friends, surrounding the grave of their forefather and the founder of Judaic tradition.

Jesus remained a Jew to the very end; he never heard about Christianity.

But the followers who were left in Judea managed to create the story of resurrection. And there was no way to prove it this way or that. Neither could they produce Jesus -- if he was resurrected then where was he? Nor could the other party prove what had happened.

They had put such a big rock on the mouth of the cave that it was impossible for Jesus to have removed it, and there was a Roman soldier on duty twenty-four hours, so there was no possibility of anybody else removing the rock and taking the body.

But because Pontius Pilate was from the very beginning against crucifying Jesus.... He could see the man was absolutely innocent. He has some crazy ideas, but they are not criminal. And what harm does it do to somebody? If someone thinks he is the only begotten son of God, let him enjoy it. Why disturb him, and why get disturbed? If somebody thinks he is the messiah and he has brought the message of God... if you want to listen, listen; if you don't want to listen, don't listen. But there is no need to crucify the man.

But Jesus learned his lesson -- learned the hard way. In Kashmir he lived very silently with his group, praying, living peacefully, no longer trying to change the world. And Kashmir was so far away from Judea that in Judea the story of resurrection, amongst the followers of Jesus, became significant.

So I say a kind of resurrection certainly happened -- it was a conspiracy more than a resurrection. But certainly Jesus did not die on the cross, he did not die in the cave where he was put; he lived long enough.

But Christianity cannot even conspire to revive itself, to resurrect itself. There is a great movement among Christian theologians, and they are making desperate efforts. Their very efforts show that they are going to fail. In fact their efforts are ridiculous.

652,2024-04-06,CMV: western young men are becoming more conservative in terms of their views on sexuality,u/AppropriateGround623,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bx9zvu/cmv_western_young_men_are_becoming_more/,changemyview,"One thing parallel between my muslim home country and western world is the unpopularity of feminism among men. Indeed, I observed in every country around the world, men are far more likely to hate feminism than women. 

But there is another thing that is increasingly becoming popular among young male western audience, that is emphasis on low body count which seems to be some kind of revival of purity culture. It’s more pronounced online. A lot of posts here on the topic of body count attract hoards of men trying to assert not just how it matters, but how it matters more for women than men. It’s not only on reddit. Take instagram, X, facebook and tiktok as well. 


I’m left rather confused regarding what these men precisely mean by low body count. Back in my home country, the consensus is that a woman should be virgin before marriage. With western male audience, I do find a lot of men saying they want or prefer virgins, but the majority seems to be drawing arbitrary lines. The benchmark is sometimes 3, and other times 5. Some move it even further as well. 


I’m skeptic of claims such as men ideally prefer virgins, since past research has shown decreasing value of chastity among men in the western world. However, I assume that the recent research might indicate something else."
0,2024-04-06,"CMV: Islamophobia is much more prevalent and impactful than antisemitism, at least in the west",u/artorovich,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bxans5/cmv_islamophobia_is_much_more_prevalent_and/,changemyview,"I should premise that I am writing this from a Western perspective, meaning that my argument applies to Europe and North America at least.

The existence and impact of antisemitism are blown out of proportion. While I do think that antisemitism exists, its reality is grossly overestimated while the presence of Islamophobia in Western society is downplayed significantly. Jewish people may experience discrimination and attacks on a personal level, but their oppression is not systemic as much as that of Muslim people is.

Jewish values -- whatever that means -- are considered to be part of the founding values of Western society, while Muslim values -- again, whatever that means -- are portrayed as foreign. Antisemitism is an attack on ""our values"", Islamophobia is not. 

While both religions originate in the middle east, Jews are considered native to the West, whereas Muslims are considered foreigners, if not straight up invaders, and othered. The attitudes towards people of these two different faiths are polar opposites, at least on a systemic level. Jews are, for all intents and purposes (and rightfully so, imo) a protected minority, whereas Muslims are often portrayed as a threat to our very existence. Jews are valued for their uniqueness and their Jewishness is seen as just a piece of their identity, while Muslims are often all lumped together.

In capitalism money talks and poor people are often discriminated for being poor. Muslims in the West face rates of unemployment, underemployment and poverty that are much higher than average, while the exact opposite can be said for Jews, who are among the richest groups. Whatever the historical reasons are for this, the fact of the matter is that this results in Muslims facing harsher discrimination.

If we look at anti-Muslim and antisemitic incidents within recent years, we can also see that cases or the former are much more prevalent. This is true even when adjusting for the number of Muslims and Jews. It may also be because Muslims, as more ""racialized"" and visible than Jews (the overwhelmingly majority of whom present as -- they are -- white) are an easier target for hate crimes. One could hold antisemitic beliefs but find it harder to act upon them, while it is much easier to act upon Islamophobia.

I could probably make a few more arguments, but this isn't a dissertation and I am afraid that the longer I go, the fewer people will read the whole text; so I'll jump to a conclusion.

All forms of racism and xenophobia are deplorable, but they are not all equally impactful towards their victims. It is important to differentiate, unpack and understand the different narratives behind them and what their effect is.

I'm pro-Israel because I believe that they are acting as any nation would in the face of an enemy attack. As far as I can tell their military response has been legal and justified. Even when we doubt their actions they seem to be acting in good faith, for example in the case of the hospital that was as they claimed- quartering HAMAS insurgents.

Yes tragedies/accidents happen in war, for example when an [America aerial-gunship fired 200 shells at a civilian hospital.](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/11/25/457370761/attack-on-msf-hospital-a-tragic-but-avoidable-accident-pentagon-finds)

>*Gen. John Campbell, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, detailed the findings in a Pentagon briefing Wednesday.* ***""This was a tragic but avoidable accident caused primarily by human error,""*** *he said.*  
>  
>**What Happened:**  
>  
>*On Oct. 3, a special operations AC-130 gunship fired on the hospital facility for 29 minutes, according to the Pentagon. However, MSF has said the assault lasted for more than an hour.*  
>  
>*The hospital's location was known to the U.S. military, and officials from MSF (also known as Doctors Without Borders) repeatedly phoned U.S. and Afghan military officials during the attack, trying desperately to stop the heavy fire. At least 30 people, including patients and hospital staff, were killed and 37 others were wounded.*

In terms of feeding civilians or not starving them out international law deems the national-government of the invaded nation must provide the resources and starvation is a legitimate war strategy. That being said it is expected be focused on the enemy combatants, which in asymmetrical conflicts could be almost anyone. *(For historical instances to see pretty much any siege or more contemporarily* [*Saudi Arabia's war with Yemen*](https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/YEMEN-SAUDI-BLOCKADE/0100515Q2KN/index.html)*.)*

Similarly the [occupying powers should, if able provide food for civilians](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN19354_FM%206-27%20_C1_FINAL_WEB_v2.pdf) but in this case distribution is not secure and soldiers distributing food could be shot by those they're trying to feed, Israel does not have a secure means of distributing food at this present time.

>*The* ***responsibility for providing and maintaining health services falls primarily on the national and local authorities***, but where such authorities are unable to provide adequately for the health needs of the civilian population,\* *the Occupying Power has the duty described below.* ***To the fullest extent available to it***\*, the Occupying Power has the duty of ensuring the adequacy of food and medical supplies of the population. In particular, it should bring in the necessary food, medical stores, and other articles if the resources of the occupied territory are insufficient  The Occupying Power must allow the protecting power to verify the state of the food and medical supplies in occupied territories, at any time, except where temporary restrictions are made necessary by *imperative military requirements*

As far as I know from new-reports, photos and videos HAMAS fighters are not/were not providing the civilians with adequate food distribution.

I'm open to other interpretations and would be very interested if there's any widely accepted reasons backed by internationally accepted law (LOAC) that proves or strongly suggests what Israel is doing is deemed judicially illegal by an internationally recognized court of law or set of norms, not just immoral or sad."

Some things are to be done in private, even if you really want to do it in public sometimes.

Now, rich people will pay the same percentage, AKA a bigger amount of money, tax.

That seems like tax is more unfair to rich people than it is to poor people, but the opposite is true.

If for some reason you make €1000 per hour and you pay 90% tax then youll still be making €100 per hour which is more than enough to live a very comfortable life with. So paying a high percentage of tax is not really an issue when you are rich. Also if you are in the lucky position that you can make €1000 per hour that doesn't automatically mean you truly deserve that money. So nothing unfair or bad about the rich being heavily taxed.

Poor people paying tax is an issue. They already don't have much to spend to begin with, and because of tax they can buy even less things.

If person A makes €100 per hour and pays 50% tax and still gets €50 per hour,

Person B making €20 per hour and not paying any tax on it,

person B is still in a worse position and has less to spend, so reducing person B's income even more by applying tax to it would be really unfair.

Tax money has to come from somewhere - so I suggest making rich people pay a little bit more tax to compensate for the lack of tax in poor people.

The fact that life isn't fair doesn't mean we shouldn't put effort into making it less unfair.

In other words rich people can easily afford to pay tax, poor people cant."

This forces some lower income households to have two working parents even if the mother wants to be stay at home. More women in the workforce, more supply of workers, whes go down, and more mothers are forced to work jobs.

I suspect it is similar in many countries.

The view is simple. The police have a specific job and that job has nothing to do with serving the average person. Police work for the government and enforce the government’s laws and prioritize what the government wants them to prioritize. This mostly ends up meaning they protect rich people’s property and persons from poor people because the government primarily serves the interests of rich people.

The average person simply is not a priority for the government/police until they break a law. It has been ruled by the Supreme Court that the police have no obligation to protect you and it is standard procedure for police to lie to you if they think it’ll get them what they want.

To get ahead of the straw man arguments, no I am not saying the average person doesn’t benefit from the police in any way. I’m not saying the police are necessarily out to get you. I’m not saying your cop brother is an untrustworthy person. I’m specifically saying that the average person should not trust the police as an institution because the police are not necessarily on the average person’s side."

For example: the US has really high tariffs (25% if I'm not mistaken) on Chinese electric cars like the brand BYD. And its not because they fear national security. But simply because they know their less expensive cars (new cars starting at $10,000) are such a good deal that they would put American car manufacturers out of business.

 I say: let them go out of business then. If a business can't compete because someone else makes the same product but better and cheaper, then too bad.  That's just the nature of competitive sales.

 It's illegal and anticompetitive to inhibit another business from succeeding. But isn't that the goal of some tariffs? Why do these rules suddenly not matter once other countries are involved? Sounds like a double standard to me."

Look at it this way. I think that it is almost certain that the Mormon religion has attained sufficient critical mass that it will outlast the US in the same way that Catholicism outlasted the Roman Empire or Islam outlasted the Umayyad. It is moreover very geographically concentrated around Salt Lake City. It therefore seems likely to me that, subsequent to the collapse of the US, this area is likely to have an identity that coalaces around a common religion - the LDS church - and for a period of time a country will exist in the region that can fairly be described as a Mormon theocracy.

Please note:

I labeled it 18+ as im sure triggering stuff will be mentioned

Also i swear i don‘t mean to be offensive, I am sure that my argument is missing others povs hence this sub so keep that in mind

And I am specifically talking about romantic/sexual orientation, not gender identity. That is something way different and should not be discussed here at all.

So:

I will always stand for peoples right to exist in peace, surrounded by love and care regardless of your sexual/romantic orientation. I myself am in the pride community.

But I am genuinely so annoyed of reading on forums and subs, ‚i like this person, does that mean I am x orientation?‘

I understand that giving yourself a label is important because it helps you understand yourself. And I understand that back then when not much was known in the mainstream world, labels helped with identification and explanations

But I also see it as just being very limiting and honestly just leads to more confusions than solutions

For instance me:

 I am (i think) asexual and aromantic, I have never once been properly attracted to anyone and honestly find sexual/romantic intimacy to be a no-go. But then there are few moments where I do get to know someone and I do envision a life with them, and so now im here like…wtf am I

And so I googled all the possible labels for my feelings and found out sapiosexual is a thing, and demisexual and so on. That too me is soo damn confusing now… because why do I need a Label that says ‚attraction for me starts when i gained an emotional attraction and such‘. I actually had people argue with me and say ‚if im ace then I can‘t feel sexual attraction period‘ and then others say ‚well no bc xyz exceptions exist‘ so which oen is it? We don‘t know, these labels habe created this divide now

Now im sure the first counter argument is going to be, you don‘t need one but let others have one if they want to

But i say: how do we know if they want one? Maybe they are surrounded so much by labels that they think they need one. Maybe a world can exist where you are who you are and love whoever you want (plz dont bring up nonsense like peddos i ofc don‘t mean them) and thats that.

Like i feel like it is these labels that brings up so much conflict, because labels then come with stereotypes and being boxed in.

And as I mentioned before in my case, I see the pride community struggle with this actually bc we now not only have gay or lesbian and such but we now have graysexual, semisexual etc. because we came to the realization that humans are all on a spectrum, and instead of leaving it at that we feel the need to label everything

I guess for my point to stick, we would have to agree on us being on a fluid spectrum which I understand not everyone agrees on. But if we (those who support it) know there are people who like x person of one group but also sometimes y person of another group, then why do insist on creating new labels rather than just saying ‚ ok this person likes this one but also this person‘ and thats that.

I hope my point is clear, feel free to ask for clarifications.

0,2024-04-06,"CMV: ""Domestic Fraud"" should be a criminal offence. ",u/secretlydevito,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bxpvau/cmv_domestic_fraud_should_be_a_criminal_offence/,changemyview,"""Domestic Fraud"" should be considered a crime, if not a felony. It should apply to couples who are legally married or common-law and should include the willful and deliberate misreprentation of:  

- ﻿﻿finances (debt, income, assets and ongoing payments like utilities and loan payments etc). - prior criminal history or any crimes committed during the relationship. 
- active addiction or substance abuse. 
- ﻿﻿familial obligations (child support, other children or entire other secret families). 
- ﻿﻿serious mental health issues that were diagnosed prior to or during the relationship  
- employment status. 
- STIs or other serious comminicable diseases that were diagnosed prior to or during the relationship. 

If someone is found guilty of Domestic Fraud it should carry penalties ranging from fines to jail time and their spouse/children should be absolved of any responsibility for the consequences of the offender's actions. This would mean that their spouse would not be responsible for the offender's debts or crimes. The offender should also be obligated to reparations for any physical, psychological, emotional or financial damages  their spouse may have suffered as a result of their actions and the spouse should be given full ownership of any remaining assets. Lastly, the offender should lose custody of any children involved, whether temporarily or indefinitely.

Some aspects of this, such as penalties for fraud and protection of the victimized spouse, may be covered by existing laws or could potentially be considered under broader legal principles like fraud, domestic violence etc. However, I think specific legislation targeting ""Domestic Fraud"" should exist.

0,2024-04-06,CMV: The size of the universe should not be a valid argument for aliens/extraterrestrial civilizations existing,u/TargetWide6872,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bxq92w/cmv_the_size_of_the_universe_should_not_be_a/,changemyview,"First of all I am personally really open to the idea of alien existing or that there are places with civilizations out somewhere other than the Earth. However when seeing online discussions regarding the beliefs of such idea, and the reasons for believing so, I am not too convinced. Unless religions are involved in the discussion (which is not discussed here) the Internet consensus seems to be ""the universe is so immensely huge, there is no way aliens do not exist"". Not the best argument in my opinion.

Quoting myself from another reply, ""I never understand how 'Universe is large therefore aliens' became so popular. To me it's the same as saying 'A certain national park is so large, there must be a trilobite somewhere'. The logic just isn't there. If something isn't existing as of now, or doesn't exist any more, or shouldn't exist, you can never find it. It doesn't matter how large your search area is or how hard you try.""

For now since we only have one sample (the Earth) there is no way to estimate the chance of life existing or the standard deviation for development of civilizations. All other numbers are basically made up. You cannot even plot a graph from that one point. People complain about statistics basing on very small samples, but they're fine having a belief based on one single sample? Just not logically sound to me. We severely lack the data to estimate the average density of potential alien beings existing, the chance of them developing into civilizations, or the time required for one happening. Heck we do not even know the criteria for life to start in the first place. Am I lacking any important information that might fill the gaps in this? There got to be something people know that I do not for such popular belief that I find illogical.

If say, we have already discovered life in other places in the solar system, albeit single cells or microbes for that matter, then maybe we can start some better estimations. Right now we are more like trying to beat an empty sudoku puzzle - nothing adds up, because there is nothing to be added up."

Some of you might have seen it before. Basically people call in and the hosts dunk all over organized religion.

I remember listening to an episode of this show once and the caller brought up progressive churches, the types where you see intersectional flags up in the stained-glass windows. The caller said something about how maybe these churches are proof that traditional Judeo-Christian religions can evolve into something progressive.

The host said something like this:

>""The people at these churches who are openly progressive and accept anyone and don't preach hate...they might be good people, they might be people that I would like to hang out with. That's because the religion they're touting is **not Christianity**. They're picking the parts they like and dismissing the parts they don't. If I were more cynical, I would say maybe they're changing their message in the hopes of surviving in an area where the people would otherwise be too progressive to attend. Maybe they're changing the doctrine to stay alive. And I think that's suspect.""

I'm always so puzzled about this because it seems to me that many people who believe in Christianity for example, they say they're Christian but when you ask them about controversial topics within the church (abortion, gay marriage, birth control, transgenderism, woke stuff in general), they say they disagree with the church.

So where my mind goes is, ""So...you're not a Christian?"" But this doesn't seem to be what happens. It seems like people just have this cognitive dissonance where they plug their ears and go ""la la la"" when it comes to archaic and arguably hateful beliefs regarding gay marriage, abortion, transgender, evolution, etc.

But I thought that to be a Christian you had to believe the bible was the word of God?

I found this fascinating info from Pew:

>While **about four-in-ten Christians (39%) say the Bible's text is the word of God** and should be taken literally, 36% say it should not be interpreted literally or express another or no opinion. A separate 18% of Christians view the Bible as a book written by men, not God.

So you mean to tell me that **a majority** of Christians don't think the bible is the word of God? 18% of Christians think MEN wrote the bible?! Why the hell are they still Christian? I think the bible was written by men and that's exactly why I'm NOT a Christian!

Anyway, I'm getting off-topic. I guess my overall opinion is that religion in America today is becoming very much diluted and those who claim to believe have very strange notions of what it means to be a person of faith.

That's not what the CMV is about though. I'm saying these progressive churches which reject the dogma of Christianity are not actually Christian churches, they're basically forming any new number of splinter denominations. Maybe they should call their version of Christianity ""New Christianity"" or something like that. Or honestly just become a Unitarian church. There are no rules for that at all - you're basically just a social club  for hippies at that point."

I think for the purposes of making it very clear when it is and isn't, i'd go so far as to say, if you drunkenly, clearly consent to sex, you are 100% responsible for that, and it isn't rape (unless other factors become involved). The statement ""intoxicated people cannot consent to sex"" is both ludicrous and dangerous.  
  
I think plenty of us can think back to a time we had sex with someone we wouldn't ever soberly have sex with but did so specifically because we were drunk. We wake up the next morning regretting it, and get on with our lives.  
  
The onus is on the individual to take full responsibility for their actions while drunk. If you're not being forced, and you verbally consent, and you're not so drunk that you're passing out, the onus is on you.  
  
If you're worried about this particular scenario (saying yes to someone you wouldn't normally while sober), then *don't drink!*  It's not their fault if YOU choose to drink and change your mind.  
  
Similarly, if you wouldn't typically choose to drive after a couple beers, but then later, when you're hammered, you don't make your typical value-system-aligned choices and get in a car and drive, you are 100% responsible for that behavior legally and morally.  
  
You may not like that you made a decision that you wouldn't normally make, but you have to own up to the behavior. It is the same with clearly giving verbal consent when drunk, for sex."

I'm talking about psychologists who claim they can cure you just through the power of talking.

I consider myself quite well-rounded mentally. I am generally happy, I'm happy with life, I have good relationships, and I  think I can control my emotions. I also think I give good advice to people: in the sense they report substantial improvements to their welfare.

Giving psychological support is just a mix of being a ""friend"" and common sense!

Half of helping people is just being there. To listen and to show you're interested. The other half is basic common sense. Here are few common sense principles I use in my life.

- Although you can't control your emotions directly, you can control the environment. If you spend too much time with a possible romantic partner, you risk falling in love. 
- Life is devoided of meaning and it's up to us to create meaning to it. Just keep yourself busy and don't think about it.
- If you lack will of spirit to do stuff because you're melancholic, make wholesale decisions. It's much easier to practice exercises if there are people there expecting you.
- Most human beings don't have emotional intelligence. It's your fault if you're in conflict with one of those human beings. 
- You should try to build relationships with people that have great emotional intelligence.
- Take care of your body. Doing exercises release endorphin.
- You're a human being, you're a social animal. You'll suffer if you're alone.
- You're not special. Just in the present there are 8 billion people just like you. Enjoy the gift of being and that your life is great. 
- Happiness is expectations minus reality.
- Objective of life isn't happiness. It is to be free through being ethical.

Obviously the list above isn't an exhaustive. My point that you can go very far in helping people through talking with basic common sense principles that how to live a worthy life.

I BELIEVE THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING WON'T I PROVE SUBSTANTIALLY THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S WELFARE THROUGH TALKING.

(Obviously psychological training provides the basic heuristics some way or other. And more importantly, it helps practitioners to know how to talk with people! There, if you put a psychologist vs a random person as the control group, the psychologist will pass the random test. Also, obviously, you can't do a double blind test. But if you compare with coaches or sacerdots, I dunno the results would be substantially different)

1- The fact that there is no true way in psychology, and even stuff like psychoanalysis has so much following by practicioners show that not even psychologists can get into an agreement themselves on what are the best methods to improve people's lives. The reason for this is that the human mind is so complex that the moment you exit the basic heuristics and try to create more sophisticated theories, you get to substantially bigger levels of complexity. 
2- Most people can't graduate from psychology. One friend of mine was said she was neurotypical by her psychologist, but nonetheless she still does therapy.
3- A big big problem are relationships with other people, like a couple or a parent and a kid. But curing two people is even harder and has mixed results.
4- Most psychologists I know dont have great emotional intelligence slash aren't free of psychopatologies themselves. On the other hand, most physical education practitioners I know are hot and healthy. And most dentists have a good smile.

What would change my mind? Evidence that having the psychologist training means you can  have more tools for specific situations, maybe you can have small heuristics for many many situations. Or a way better theory of how the mind works. Or something else."

3. Russians and the British supported the assassination of our first president, and allowed a coupe of a fascist (trained by Mussolini himself)

4. 1961 to 1991 Somaliland had been occupied by Somalia (Somaglia, Italy name), we have been genocide. The genocide was funded by America

5. While we are being genocide US and Dutch oil companies explore the area

6. Many intelligence agencies active, just Google William J. Burns suprise visit Somalia, they recently opened 5 new bases in Somalia after Somaliland got a chance in getting recognized

7. European countries follow suit, because the US defends them

8. Recent proxy war is in Sool, their intention is to start tribalistic war in our east. Media companies of the west ignore beheadings and terrorism activities because they are the ones doing it

9. They can do it, because if people don't care about Sudan, Palestinians or Somalilanders during the genocide. Why would they care today?

If you truly understood your wrong then you would not conclude it with your growth because it is a process.

The focus should be on humbling yourself and the atonement and how you will keep paying attention not to make this mistake by unraveling the underlying issues that made you do these acts in the first place. By doing so you are growing, but it can never be in the past because you are proving yourself (and others) every day that you have grown.

If I believe someone is worthy of it, it I'll be willing to splurge on them, because I enjoy their company and we have interesting conversations.

However I believe it's a two way street. If I pay for a woman, I expect an engaging conversation, otherwise why did I pay for them? I agree with the statement ""paying does not mean the women owes me anything"". I associate this statement with sex: paying does not equal sex. But I also conflict with the statement because I believe they owe me a conversation.

In my specific situation, women at work have pretended to be offended at things I say. For example I say ""lame"" when my microphone isn't working. I clarify I was referring to the microphone, not them. They continue to act offended so I give them an over zealous apology as a joke. To which they respond they will only accept me buying food for them as an apology.

I'm not in a relationship with any of these women, some of them have boyfriends. The most recent person has already expressed she thinks it's bad to date people from work, so I take that as a no (I never approached her, just came up as conversation).

Like any other mental illness that leads to medication and surgery, it's not something you would wish on anyone. Given that, doesn't it follow that we should raise children in a way that prevents gender dysphoria down the line? If we notice the seeds of gender dysphoria in a child isn't the moral course of action to extinguish these thoughts while we can instead of encouraging them towards that direction? If a child has separation anxiety with their parents would you keep talking to them about divorced couples? If a child has death anxiety would you keep talking to them about death? If they have an eating disorder would you keep talking to them about obesity? Now if a child grows into an adolescent and still carries these thoughts then maybe it is time to learn about their condition, but if you reinforce their doubts about their gender earlier than that you are wasting an opportunity to actually make them healthier. Primary schools should reinforce cisnormativity because it's the path of least mental illness.

There is an implicit bias or even feeling of superiority in dating your own race because it’s a mindset people have, consciously and subconsciously. 

This bias can manifest in various ways such as believing that one’s own race is more culturally compatible, physically attractive, or socially acceptable. However, such beliefs perpetuate harmful stereotypes and reinforce systemic inequalities.

There IS a difference between being unable to date someone *because you cannot relate, understand or assimilate to their culture*, however refusing to even date someone *because* they are not of your race, **that is racist.** 

**What did I mean by contributing to systemic racism?** 

Dating preferences based solely on race contribute to the larger systemic racism present in society. It reinforces the idea that certain races are inherently less desirable or inferior, perpetuating societal inequalities and discrimination.

Refusing to date outside one’s race can contribute to feelings of exclusion and othering among individuals of marginalized racial groups. It sends a message that they are not worthy of romantic consideration *solely based on their race or skin color*, *further marginalizing them in society.

The counter arguement couldld be ‘Me dating my own race doesn’t mean I’m racist’, but that’s the **equivalent** to saying “I do not want to associate with _ insert race but it does not mean I hate them” rhetoric. It’s illogical. 

When it comes to the topic of religion. It is understandable, since some people cannot convert or be in sync dating someone else of a different faith.

However when I talk about race, I’m **MOSTLY** talking about people who refuse to date someone else because of their **skin color** and use that by saying “it’s a preference.” 

That in itself is racist. I used “preference” with quotation marks because I do not believe it’s a preference, it’s racism. 

Some would say “but what if I refuse to date fat people”, does it mean I’m fat phobic? Not dating someone because of their race and not dating a fat person cannot be equated due to fundamental differences in the nature of discrimination. 

Weight is a mutable characteristic that can change over time and is not inherent to one’s identity in the same way as race. 

Discriminating against someone based on their weight perpetuates societal beauty standards but doesn’t uphold systemic structures of oppression like racial discrimination does.

Race based discrimination is rooted in centuries of systemic racism, perpetuating historical power dynamics, social inequalities, and marginalization. 

Furthermore, race based discrimination often reflects broader societal biases and reinforces harmful stereotypes, while weight-based discrimination primarily pertains to personal preferences and societal beauty ideals. 

Comparing the two overlooks the deeply ingrained historical and systemic injustices associated with racial discrimination.

If that is true why don’t you say the same about sexual assault victims who are male? Also no matter what a woman wears she gets harassed by a pervert one way or another. It’s like the unspoken experience of growing up as a woman. 


No matter how much a woman covers up and tries to look as unappealing as possible she still gets harassed. This just further goes on to prove that women dressing “provocatively “ isn’t the problem, it is the society justifying such problematic behaviour. Saying men can’t control their “impulses “ when they see an attractive woman yada yada.

* Guards who were stationed at the border post where Hamas entered, had sent reports to the highest-ranking intelligence officer in the southern command weeks before, warning of unusual activity, but the reports were ignored

I believe that Israel wanted any reason to enter a war with Hamas, so that they could access Gaza. Hamas' attack was brutal and horrific. This gave Israel the opportunity to strike almost any target they wanted to, without concern for civilian casualties, if they reported Hamas was nearby.

Palestinians were told to leave Gaza, but given nowhere to go. Still Israel dropped bombs.

Documents have now come out of the Israeli Parliament, outlining plans for a temporary tent city on the Sinai Peninsula for displaced Palestinians, with the long term goal of making it permanent.

I personally believe this has all been masterfully played by Israel, as a way of taking back the small but holy landmark of the Dome of the Rock. Or more importantly, the location of Temple Mount, where it is believed that once a third, previously demolished Temple is built, the Messiah will return."

A single super power actor gave the most material support to democratic forces, but that was often conditional, and did not involve direct military action - this was not enough to turn the tide. A general embargo and sanctions did nothing to diminish the efficacy of the aggressor power, which was supported in the shadows by fellow authoritarian regimes. 

The democratic forces stalled and ended up going on the defensive. Within a few years they collapsed, and the west quickly recognised the facist government. 

This whole episode served as a testing ground for conflicts to come, in particular highlighting the weaknesses of a democratic multi-lateral front in the face of sustained, drawn out war. 

These statements could easily describe the Ukraine conflict or the Spanish Civil War. Yes the West HAS supported Ukraine, but the appetite for that is clearly waning, and with every story of Russian rearmament and Ukrainian stalls, the parallels becomes clearer. 

To change my view, you'll need to show me evidence of Ukraine being in a position to continue it's fight, successfully, WITHOUT western aid , or evidence that western aid, while slowed, is still locked in for the foreseeable future.

One of Thanos' arguments was that the universe is finite and the resources are finite, to which many people said that he could increase the resources and then everything would be great, which I do not agree with.

An economy is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services. The ultimate goal of economic activity is the consumption of goods and services. People provide services to get money, for which they can then buy goods, be it food, clothing or furniture. It happens, of course, that work also becomes a need with the help of which people fill their lives with meaning, such as medicine, teaching and science, the meaning of which is the benefit of society. But in most cases, people go to work to get money, with which they buy goods, products, equipment, etc.

If metals such as lithium, gold, nickel, platinum, titanium, silicon and other metals, minerals are made abundant and in the form of finished products, this will lead to the bankruptcy of the mining companies of these resources, as a result of which millions of people around the world will lose their jobs, and with it their income . 
Also, do not forget about the economic importance of rare metals like gold, which people use as savings, and previously as money. If there is a lot of gold and other rare metals, it will lead to the collapse of the financial system and the bankruptcy of millions of people around the world, which will negatively affect the well-being of people. If resources become plentiful and easily accessible, this will lead to bad consequences in any case. Therefore, if people do not have work, they will lose the meaning of life. After all, the only thing that makes many people get up from the couch and go outside is the need to work. If people don't work, they will become lazy, corrupt and use drugs. In a certain sense of the word, poverty is necessary precisely to prevent this. The lowest birth rate and highest suicide rate are in developed countries of the world. If, once resources become available, the level of well-being will rise throughout the world, and with it the birth rate will decrease and the suicide rate will increase.

So even though Thanos was wrong, increasing resources is not an option. And AI is dangerous precisely for this reason. People will die out not because we will live worse, but quite the opposite. Man was created by nature where he survived for millions of years in conditions of scarcity of resources and abundance of resources is very bad for us."

Knowledge that has been rectified, confirmed, and disproved by time, and as we get to make more mistakes and strive for impossible perfection, we realize that our old ways were wrong—and we decided to change for the better. We invented the nuclear bomb, ready to use it against our enemies, until we realized how much damage and destruction it would cause to our own homes as well.

We performed surgeries on children, until human rights came to fruition.

We only saw punishment as correction for wrong-doing, until modernized countries began focusing on restorative justice.

We killed people for being men, and for being women, until we realized that they were both humans by core, and equal in power. Then the LGBT came. We hated them for ""not being normal."" But as the same persecutions arose, the world has slowly begun its acceptance of them.

We invented leaded gasoline, and as its effects came to light, we began to question the political system that allowed such a dangerous creation to pass through all the safety checks.

Progress' core values are that of patience, courage, mindfulness, and love. Whereas tradition is the complete opposite. It wants to be ""normal,"" not to change, to maintain its pitiful form in an everchanging and shape-shifting world.

And let's not forget that the most famous advocates for tradition are notable for being dictators responsible for war and genocide, conspiracy theorist conservatives, corrupt Ponzi-scammer-bankers, and religious supremacists.

To return to tradition is the commit the exact same crimes and mistakes we have done in the past, one that we have tried so hard to correct and avoid. It spits at humanity's hard work and soul into advancing as a powerful and compassionate species.

Tradition can only be praised for being a historical testament to what we were before—cancerous savages. The only good thing tradition can do is to remind us of the mistakes we have done during ye olden days, so we never commit them ever again. History books, paintings, and databases—that's where tradition belongs.

Progress has shown us what is right and wrong. Tradition wants to BE wrong."
828,2024-04-07,"CMV: People are unable to agree on the definition of ""Zionism"" and it harms discussion of the Israel-Palestinian conflict",u/LivinAWestLife,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1by6tv9/cmv_people_are_unable_to_agree_on_the_definition/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I support a two-state solution. The occupation and settlements in the West Bank are morally wrong in theory and practice that harms Israel’s legitimacy, and in the case of an enduring solution, they will have to be dismantled. I’m not Jewish or Muslim, Israeli or Arab, nor personally involved in this conflict. I think Netanyahu and the Israeli far-right are detestable people who should not be anywhere near power. Israel has overreacted in its bombing of Gaza and are likely causing more civilian casualties than necessary. The recent strike on WCK workers was a terrible and completely avoidable tragedy, and should be independently investigated. Israel’s recent diplomatic behaviour is very problematic and is actively making peace down the road more difficult.

Anyway, the word “Zionist” has often been conflated by many pro-Palestinian supporters to exclusively mean a far-right version of Zionism and treated as a slur -  people who support ethnically displacing Palestinians - while the word means [the establishment and continued existence of a Jewish nation-state in the Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism) \- what is now Israel. It is not a fascist ideology. Not all Jews are Zionists, but the majority of them \*are\* (at least 80%), a vast majority in Israel - similar to how most people in Turkey would support Turkey continuing to exist, as for the Japanese, Turkish, French, etc. To most Israelis and many of their supporters, Zionism just means that Israel should continue to exist, and many would be satisfied with a two-state solution. Many are inherently sympathetic since they learn about it in school. So when someone goes “Nothing against Jews, but \*fuck\* these Zionist pigs”, Zionist Jews see them as being targeted for what is a common stance around the world. Nothing says Zionism can’t coexist with an independent Palestine, but this common sentiment appears to many eyes, with a large amount of truth, that they want the state of Israel dismantled.   
Now I know many ethnicities, like Scots and Kurds, aren’t afforded their own country, and this argument is often brought up as to why Israel should continue to exist. But the fact is that Israel exists \*now\* and has for 70 years, older than Botswana or Bangladesh, and cultivated a strong civic nationalism. No one talks about collapsing Japan so the Ainu could have a state. While Catalonians protest for independence, there are no serious calls for the destruction of Spain. It is not a common sentiment in Darfur, where a genocide is occurring, for Sudan to be dismantled. Understandably, a lot of Jews and Israelis perceive anti-zionism to be anti-semitism.

Israelis perceive this language as hostile, and in turn they become defensive of Zionism, and some might begin to think there's nothing wrong with the more extreme kind. Israeli has a few nuclear reasons for why it won't ever go down in a fight. 

Those who oppose a two-state solution and want a single state over the area known as Palestine are not in agreement over what should happen to the Jewish population - some say that they can stay while others say they should be expelled (notwithstanding that that would be like Native Americans demanding that hundreds of millions of Americans pack up). In either case it's understandable why the majority of Israelis would not support either solution, given how Jews and other religious/ethnic minorities are treated throughout the Middle East and North Africa. In the face of this, Zionism appears sensible. Ask if a Chinese person would feel if they found China filled with 1.4 billion non-Chinese people, or Yemenis if non-Muslims started making up a majority of the population. Even if nothing in their laws prevents that from happening, these countries would fall into conflict long before it could happen. "

Next the employees from said stores (mostly old people or fresh of the boat people) in these major cities will now compete with college degree people for that barely $15 an hour minimum wage job. People argue that ""there's a lot of job openings"" however these openings have either insane requirements or you want to do the work for 3 people aka grueling sh\*t jobs (Which they can do since now there is a power vacuum, there's way more workers/immigrants than there are good jobs now for with or without degrees).

Now let me be clear this post isn’t meant to absolve what Adolf Hitler did or attempt to white wash him. What Adolf Hitler did was wrong and unforgivable, he was rightly stopped, I know I’ll be downvoted but anyway let’s begin. 

In school we are taught about the Nazi Party and the atrocities they committed during WW2 and in the Holocaust. We are also taught that Hitler in the textbook definition of pure evil, it’s also presented in documentaries, informations etc etc. Personally I don’t believe Hitler was fully evil and I will explain my reasons why. 

First we must cover the meaning of pure evil, a pure evil individual is someone who cannot show empathy, compassion, regrets, remorse, or love for anyone. In addition, any actions out of genuine concern or for altruistic reasons are disqualifying factors and the individual cannot count as Pure Evil.

Now with the definition out of the way one reason why I believe Hitler wasn’t pure evil is because in his early years he was distraught when his mother died. Klara Hitler was the mother of Adolf Hitler who died on December 21st 1907 due to complications with breast cancer. Ironically the man who was treated Hitler mother was Jewish and he stated that he never saw anyone affected by death such as Adolf Hitler. This is proof that Hitler was not pure evil as it shows he clearly loved his mother and was saddened by her death. 

Another reason why I think Hitler wasn’t pure evil is because he loved his wife Eva Braun. Right before he ended his life Hitler married his mistress Eva Braun and cherished every moment to the bitter end. This also shows he wasn’t pure evil has he clearly loved his wife and shows his capacity to care about others. 

Furthermore Hitler seemed to show great care for animals, infact he prohibited hunting animals in Germany and made it a punishable offence if anyone did so. Speaking about animals Hitler loved his German Shepard Blondi, whom he ultimately had killed because he was afraid it would suffer under Soviet hands. 

There is no denial Hitler is a terrible human being, no denial about that at all but at the end of the day Hitler isn’t the paragon of evil he is presented as. He loved and cared for people within his circle and did held some humane ideals but I must repeat I am not trying to white wash Hitler."

I'm proud with their act, but will it change life in Afghanistan? No. It will never change life in Afghanistan. Because talibs will kill or jail any resistance, including peaceful ones.

I believe that afghan people (especially women) should to commit suicide in masse. Just to escape from such misery and hope to get a reincarnation in better country. If reincarnation doesn't exists, well, they get a rest in non-existence. Also mass suicide will make Afghanistan's  economic to fall down, making talibs to struggle with problems.

I understand that certain people are biologically more prone to addiction and that there are factors beyond willpower which are at play. However, is it not still slightly the fault of whomever takes the drug in the first place? Even if you're experiencing difficult things in your life, or if you're just trying to have some fun. Unless, in theory, you're somehow coerced (either by force or non-consensually being fed a substance) into taking a drug or drink alcohol, the person who's doing it probably is aware of the general sentiment of substances being addictive and having negative consequences. How is it possible that there isn't some degree of bad decision making in this pathway to addiction?

0,2024-04-07,CMV: AI artwork is actually not so bad,u/JeaniousSpelur,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1byc4nl/cmv_ai_artwork_is_actually_not_so_bad/,changemyview,"AI artwork started to be controversial a few years or so ago. The general idea I get is that because the data is trained from artists, and because it may mimic the design formats of artists, it is essentially stealing their labor.

First, I would argue that artwork is not used to train models unethically. Artwork that is posted in the public square from gig artists is more so marketing material than anything else - and meant to be consumed. AI requires a large trainset to learn styles and patterns - which makes it far more likely for AI artwork to be an amalgamation of styles, rather than any one artist’s specific style. In conjunction with this, most online artists are likely to turn a profit especially by providing a more specific and effortful design tailored to a customers need, rather than something AI could make from its trainset.

Second, I would argue that AI artwork is unlikely to cut into the same market of people who are buying artwork from artists online. I would guess that the majority of people who use AI artwork are recreational users looking for a quick laugh. The most serious stuff I’ve used AI artwork for is creating dnd maps - but if I could not use it, I could just find a map less tailored to me in a google search. This couples with my prior argument - AI artwork is filling a niche where it makes more general types of art slightly more specific, but still not as specific as an artist themselves could make.

Thirdly, the arguments I’ve seen don’t consider art for art’s sake. Art is meant to be an expressive medium as well as commercial. AI artwork is causing more people to consider the applications of art and become interested and engaged. It helps people to consider creative ideas, which should allow artists to do what artists do best - create something novel from disconnected elements (like those we see within AI art). Furthermore, artists are becoming increasingly expressive with different mediums, and art in the physical world is something that AI is far from taking away - but rather, could inform.

I'd argue that the differing perceptions surrounding the reclaiming of Spain, Portugal and Israel aren't rooted in concrete distinctions between the two historical processes. Instead, they likely stem from deeply ingrained anti-Semitic attitudes and resentment from Arab nations.

4,2024-04-07,CMV: Federal Student Loans for University Should be Convertible to Startup Business Loans,u/OkKindheartedness769,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1byf3rw/cmv_federal_student_loans_for_university_should/,changemyview,"I mean this in a US context where the average debt is around $30,000 and 6% of people have $100,000 or more. My suggestion is you should have the option to take out business loans as an alternative with much of the similar conditions student loans have: less emphasis on credit history, protected interest rates, yearly transfers rather than one lump sum.

I don’t think most people would opt for this because most startups fail, most who graduate high school would have no idea what they want to do and many would prefer the relative safety of a bachelor’s degree. I think the option would mainly be taken by two types of people:

1) Non-traditional students who are significantly older. If for whatever reason you are thinking of entering college closer to 30 as a way to reset your life trajectory, this could be a viable option. You’ll already have years of work experience, a strong sense of what you want to do and the maturity to use the money well. 

2) Highly entrepreneurial teenagers. These are people who’ve had some success running micro-level businesses in high school or shortly after and the conventional 4 years to get a degree just isn’t what they might desire. Some of them will drop out or just meander through college anyway because that’s not where their heart is. It might be better for them to get the start-up capital to pursue running the business they envision.

Risks: if the business fails you don’t even have a degree to fall back on which could help you get a job to pay back your loans. To minimize this there could be a system where you have to first submit a business proposal and only if this is approved could you get the loan. I also think the payment in yearly installments similar to a bachelor’s helps with this. If in two years your business has gone nowhere you could ‘drop out’ and not accrue another two years of principal that collects interest to pay off.

Just a headsup, if I say show and not show + movie, I still mean both mediums.

So, I find it so weird how people just say ‚its just a show, relax‘ and leave it at that when people bring up debatable topics in a show/movie. 

I mean for one: movies/tv shows are there for entertainment, part of that is talking about it so that it remains alive and popular.

If there is a show where nothing can be discussed then it probably was not a good show

Now ofc the question is; what exactly is the thing thats not worth being talked abt? Is it just a comment on the look of a character? Or their actions, or any deeper meanings such as moral/philosophical lessons? And I say all of them are important to talk about if the commenter cares about it

But for me its especially ones where more touchy subjects come up, like for instance in fandoms like TBBT, many like to debate about the many debilitating jokes that are being made abt a wide range of people, and while I do still love the show, this should not be ignored.

For me movies and such are a good reflection of the social/cultural and political climate from when it was made, so why on earth would I not then want to talk about it?

I mean we learn so much about how to behave from what we see on TV, why should we not then debate about a show that for instance presents a possible autistic character and makes fun of it?

And idc if you agree about that, maybe you think the jokes are fine which is ok; because I am sure some people are more sensitive than others. But I do not agree with ‚its just a show, who cares‘ bc clearly someone does

And even if it is about something as seemingly pointless as a person saying: ‚i dont like x characters shoes‘, it is not up to you to decide if thats worth talking about, if you dont care, thats fine so then just leave the convo

I even stand by this argument when there are clear haters for characters, and they are being passionate about it. While I do not support when the hate is obviously meant as a target for a social group, I make it clear I don‘t like that. I do not (try not, maybe in past I did) just say ‚its a show, get over it‘ bc that is imo not a legitimate defense

To me it just seems lazy/weak, and you might as well say ‚i don’t care‘ and leave

I considered posting this on unpopular opinions but im curious about what counter arguments are out there, im open to all povs

Btw, I am not here to debate about TBBT, that was just an example to support my argument, I still added spoiler in case something does come up

0,2024-04-07,CMV: paid surrogacy shouldn’t be legal just because you think abortion should be,u/PenisAssShit,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1byh26p/cmv_paid_surrogacy_shouldnt_be_legal_just_because/,changemyview,"Saw a post a while ago where the pope was calling for paid surrogacy to be criminalised. Most of the comments were saying that a man shouldn’t tell a woman what to do with her body and that it’s a woman’s choice to do with her body as she pleases. While I sympathise with the sentiment since this was after roe v wave was overturned I feel like one can be for abortion rights and against paid surrogacy.

From what I’ve heard in my country, paid surrogacy usually consists of paying a poor Ukrainian or Moldovan woman a couple of thousand euros to have your child because you are unable or just don’t want to deal with pregnancy. First of all, pregnancy is incredibly stressful on the body and can even be life threatening, especially in poorer countries with substandard healthcare where these surrogate mothers usually come from. There’s a reason there’s not a lot of women voulenteering to be surrogate mothers in first world countries. Secondly, I feel that if you’re really want the world to be better for women, you would also care about women in poor countries and not just couples in first world countries that don’t want to adopt or just not have a child. 

Finally, there’s the argument often used with abortion that people would do this anyway, but just outside of a regulated market and much more unsafe. I feel like paid surrogacy in this case is more like the organ trade than abortion in that case. Abortion doesn’t take a third party, it’s just the woman and the unborn child. Surrogacy requires someone else to sacrifice their own body for you like an organ donor. Additionally, unpaid volunteer surrogacy would still be legal under the popes proposal much like organ donors.

I understand women don’t want old white men to make decisions about their body but a broken clock is still right sometimes. I want to understand why this is important to people so, please change my view! "

Then the punishment should be that you are not only temporarily disqualified from driving but once you get your licence back you will always be held at least partially liable for any crash you are in. Even if you couldn’t avoid it or are not the party worthy of blame for the accident.

For example, Ben is texting his girlfriend while driving and is caught by a police officer. The case is taken to court and he is fined a few hundred pounds/dollars and banned from driving for a fixed length of time (say, 6 months). Five years later, Ben gets into an accident where a child runs out in front of his car or a car cuts him off (Ben is unable to avoid the collision). Ordinarily he would be not at fault and the other person is 100% at fault, but since he has the texting driving conviction from five years ago, it doesn’t matter because he will now be held partially liable. He might even go to prison if somebody dies, even if he was not at fault for the immediate crash. 

People might think this is a dictator move but honestly it would force all drivers to think twice before texting or drinking or driving on drugs. No sane person will text and drive once you implement a rule like this and make the rule well publicised, I wouldn’t dare do it.

The whole story of Anatomy of a Fall was the audience learning about Sandra and Samuel's relationship...but we learn everything through the lens of a French courtroom.

The movie was (very) well acted, but I never felt there was enough evidence to determine whether Sandra was guilty or not, so the ""payoff"" being that >!we don't find out whether she is guilty was completely anti-climactic.!<  I also just didn't find their relationship interesting enough to really hold my attention throughout the film.   What exactly was I supposed to care about?

I was *really* looking forward to this film giving the amount of high praise I had seen for it.  If it's meant as a great and accurate courtroom drama, then I'm sorry, but the French judicial system must be literally **insane*****.***    If it is meant as a great character drama, then it needs a whole lot more of ""show, don't tell"".

All men are mortal, socretes is a man, therefore socretes is mortal.

We use science to prove P1 and P2 in this example, and then the conclusion is mathematically true. 

In an over-simplistic theological example:

Awareness actualizes potential 
Whatever actualizes potential is God
God is awareness
Awareness exists 
Therefore, God exists

And you could argue to bring that definition closer to God's other ""Divine attributes"" seen in places like Bible... You could also learn more about the Big bang and when SpaceTime came into existence, and a find further alignment or disalignment with religious text based on that argument... But that's all besides the scope of my view/question.

People say theological arguments are not testable. For example, if you see a watch sitting somewhere in a forest, you can say there must have been a intentional creator that made it with with a purpose in mind, because it's so much more complex than everything else in its natural environment, and happens to do one thing really well. 

But if the humans that made the watch were made through a natural process (gravity, evolution, ect), then the watch was made through natural processes by extension, making it... unintentional? People have told me you can't prove intent and design because of the way the words are defined in theological arguments. I disagree.

The theological example argument I gave, is to show that a fundamental physical process (like gravity) could involve sentience and intent, which is why why I picked the word awareness. The implication being, we may find a fundamental ultimate natural process that's inherently intelligent.

My main question is...

Why is quantum mechanics unable to prove or disprove P1 in that sample theological argument, or unable to prove or disprove intelligent design extrapolations from a basic idea like that. It seems to me like we are finding early signs of falsifiable tests in quantum mechanics from things like the observer effect, entanglement ect. And we may not have enough empirical evidence now to prove or disprove a God, but why can we not have enough in the future?

•Animals cannot get psychologically or physically harmed as long as the sexual contact is ethical
•Dogs do not need to understand complex concepts such as reproduction in order to have sex
•Dogs being compared to children mentally is an unfair comparison that can easily be debunked
•Dogs will physically ask for pleasure
•The power imbalance between “owner and dog” exists, but isn’t relevant as long as power isn’t activley being used to manipulate the dog
•A dogs sex drive is not something that is exploited through ethical contact

While they might occasionally dispense useful advice, such as suggesting that women should not flaunt their bodies on social media and that men should always work towards becoming their best selves, the underlying truth is that these individuals lack education and repeat the same baseless arguments ad nauseam. Although I concede that not all their points require scholarly critique—for instance, the idea that engaging with promiscuous individuals can be risky is, in many cases, common sense—their discussions often lack any real substance or evidential backing. 

Their main form of 'proof' comes from demeaning interviews with women that are promiscuous themselves and or materialistic, and devoid of critical thinking or education. With all due respect, let’s be honest. 

I won't even start on the recent controversy surrounding Fresh and the allegations that he's acted contrary to their preached values. Yes, as of these moment, these are still allegations. However, thus far, it doesn’t look good in his case. The second you fail to practice what you preach, your credibility is lost, regardless of who you are. At that point, you become merely a source of mockery, with an almost insurmountable task of rehabilitating your public image.

Moreover, their view that a man has no obligation to satisfy his partner is not just foolish; it's an utterly ludicrous notion. It's imperative in a relationship for both individuals to strive to please each other. The concept that one partner should not care about the happiness of the other is, to me, fundamentally flawed and one of the many reasons I disagree with them. Their behavior and opinions tarnish the reputation of the red pill philosophy, demonstrating ignorance and hypocrisy.

MODS: I hope this post is within the rules. It's vital that we question everything in society, particularly when there's a gap between the preached and practiced standards."

So ,I've been a little too invested in sex and relationships for the past couple of weeks . I've read books/articles , listened to podcasts ,  discussed the topic with a few female friends from very different  backgrounds and reflected on my experiences as well as theirs . And I've somehow come to this frustrating conclusion related to female sexual experiences : once you let a man inside you , he'll eventually start treating you with contempt .
 It's like , regardless of the relationship you guys share , whether a husband-wife relationship /fwb/ one night stand , men always take you less seriously once you've slept with them . I can't find convincing reasoning for that though . Could it be that it's ingrained in men's brains that women are just their sexual toys ? That women are somehow inferior beings ?? I'm trying hard not to believe that. 
I mean , sex is supposed to be a very warm and delightful experience.  The acts of making out , hugging someone ,lying next to them naked and the skin-skin contact should bring the two participating individuals close together . I'd expect to feel very deep affection towards my partner after that encounter , but that's not the case with men ... it's usually one of those scenarios : 
1. A guy becomes less responsive after the sexual encounter  and just texts when he's horny and lonely (if it's a casual relationship)
2 . A married man stops trying to please his wife and no longer cares about her needs (e.g : immediately sleeps after he orgasms or completely ignores her requests) 
3. A man bailing out on his GF/ fwb when she gets pregnant , leaving her to deal with the consequences of an act that he took part in and enjoyed as well 
4. He immediately hangs up after sexting /phone sex 

And , the way they communicate with their women after that changes completely.  They're more dismissive and salty . 

This has eventually led me to think that sex and relationships are just not worth it . 

I mean one can just masturbate to porn and not risk falling for a man who's gonna see me as  inferior to him.

I'm urging you guys to CMV . I don't want to detest men .

Think about establishments like theaters that aren't explicit but show plays that aren't really written for children audiences. Or cafes where people work or study. Or even a plane/bus/public transport - obviously, we won't ban kids there entirely. But there will be a section in a bus/plane/public transport meant for passengers with 11y/o below companions, so these children will be gathered in just one spot where they won't be able to bother the adults who just want to have their trip in peace without hearing some bawling baby or suffer some snotty brat with ADHD.

If the establishment is spacious enough, they can provide a specific space where children are allowed - somewhere far enough that they won't bother adults. But if not, then, unless they're catering to kids, they should ban them entirely.

The reason I say 11 y/o below is because I assume that 12 year olds and above have, hopefully, developed enough of their brains to not be obnoxious, noisy brats. Also, I think 12y/o+ have the capacity to enjoy certain things like meeting friends for coffee at a cafe, etc. So I don't want to deprive them of that.

(Disregard explicit adult-only spaces, like stripclubs, etc. Obviously kids aren't allowed there. But most adult spaces, like cafes, restaurants, theaters, etc. that cater to adults who just want to get stuff done or relax, are not explicit, hence they don't naturally have age limits.)

Children can be noisy, rude, and obnoxiously annoying. There are enough childish adults in the world already. Let's not add to our misery by letting in actual children into spaces meant for adults in the first place.

YES - not all children are ill-mannered, etc. But you have no control over that. Think about booking a hotel room or table at a resto or a seat at the theater. And then you'll just be surprised to see that a small family with kids also booked beside you. It would be great if they're well-mannered and considerate of people around them. But if not, it's hell. By banning kids or placing them in certain spaces only, you have assurance that, at least, the worst you can have beside you is some childish adult."

One example is a female teacher sleeping with a male student. Again, it's still absolutely disgusting. But only a naive person would claim this damages the male in the same way a male teacher sleeping with a female student damages the girl. For one, a young male is likely a very willing participant. It is their dream to sleep with the hot teacher. Also important is the social aspect. A male student who sleeps with the teacher is treated like a hero. They gain tremendous social status. The opposite would be true of a female student. 

I don't really know what male SA victims of female abusers go through. But given that males are in a different class in terms of strength, I'd imagine they would suffer less trauma and anxiety going forward. A female SA survivor likely has greater fear of men in her daily life, and continues to imagine how scenarios could go bad. But female abusers are far less common, and men should have less fear of any situation involving a woman going badly. And most importantly, they know that they have the ability to end almost any scenario where they are the victim of a woman.

This is a view that I really wish to change because it makes me somehow treat female SA victims as considerably more victimized than male ones. But logically I know it's probably not true. But all the points I laid out make it hard for me to see it any other way. For example, I really doubt if my Spanish teacher slept with me I'd have any problems then or now. Actually, I strongly believe the opposite. "
0,2024-04-07,"CMV: The details of marriage should, legally, resemble an ongoing business relationship vs. a traditional legal marriage.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bynne1/cmv_the_details_of_marriage_should_legally/,changemyview,"Whether you think the divorce rate is 30%, 50%, or some other figure, it's clear that marriage in the United States at least is in deep trouble. Men and women are not dating, they're not having sex, and men in particular are terrified of marriage.

It seems to me that one good way of dealing with marriage is to change the nature of it, at least legally.

Keep all the ""until death do you part"" flowery fairy tale stuff that people want to have on their special day, but legally marriages are going to use this system instead:

Once you become married, instead of having the incredibly complex and legally labyrinthine system of divorce, you simply **require people to ""re-up"" their marriage agreement every 3 years at a government office.** Similar to how you re-up your driver's license when it gets expired.

When you're married, you have all the typical benefits and legal standings of a marriage, but if the time comes during the marriage where **one or both** parties want the marriage to end, what happens is an **annulment.**

Now I'm not a legal expert and I figure this might be the biggest issue with my idea, but divorce is of course messy and complicated and awful. But an [annulment](https://www.verywellmind.com/difference-between-divorce-and-annulment-2302038) is much simpler.

>**Divorce**: A legal dissolving, termination, and ending of a legally valid marriage. A divorce ends a legal marriage and declares the spouses to be single again.

>**Annulment**: A legal ruling that erases a marriage by declaring the marriage null and void and that the union was never legally valid. However, the marriage records remain on file even if the marriage is erased. An annulment does not mean that the marriage never happened; it means that the marriage was never legally valid.

What might be a weakness in my idea is that for an annulment, it says ""the union was never legally valid"". I don't know what ripples that casts throughout the rest of the marriage, bills, kids, bank accounts, etc, but this seems like a much better option than divorce.

The big question I have is, divorce must take care of some things that an annulment couldn't when it comes to ""annuling"" a marriage that lasted 10 years. Typically annulments are meant to happen very quickly after a marriage.

You could make it so that if you decide to annul the marriage, either you agree on how the resources will be split, or you split it 50/50.

The annulment thing could be unnecessary though, we could just change the rules of divorce. But I wonder if any legal minds can weigh in on why annulment might still be useful.

One potential issue I could forsee is this: you have a marriage where one partner makes a lot of money, and one partner doesn't. I would make it so that with this new procedure, what is considered ""shared"" is only money that is in a joint bank account. Aside from that, if you decide not to re-up, it's the same as a non-married couple breaking up. Which is to say, no big deal (legally). You're just two individuals with your own property.

You could also just do a typical prenup, but I know a lot of couples won't.

Now of course the question of children. How does this work in terms of children? I guess it would just be the same assessment that they do with divorce currently. The courts make their assessment and there ya go.

So I guess I'm wondering why this wouldn't work? I'm sure there are a few things I'm missing at least, so change my view."

Starting with a personal example, I went to boy scout summer camp for 9 years until I turned 18 and this year I will go as an adult. With the introduction of girls into Boy Scouts we have practically endless Youth Protection policies, many of which surrounded swimming.

Female scouts are required to wear very modest one-piece bathing suits while male scouts can wear anything, speedos and the rest included. If they are going to stop people from ""Ogling"" (Their word not mine) female scouts, why aren't they stopping people from ""Ogling"" the males?

Every day when the waterfront is open and there are a dozen shirtless, wet, muscular young men splashing about in the sun, take a look over at the shore and there is always a line of 50-60 year old man with their Secret Service sunglasses having a good old fashioned ogle. Being an adult myself now, it's truly disgusting to see them standing there with absolutely zero repercussion or even concern.

Some areas have seen this issue and gone the other way, like Berlin. Recently a woman sued the city because the public ordinance requiring women to wear a top in pools but not men was discriminatory and won! Now everyone is topless in Berlin's pools. Honestly that's also an acceptable solution.

As someone who likes men, I hope other people who like men will agree that the chiseled chest of a fit stud is just as appealing to us as the chest of a woman to straight men. Guys get very uncomfortable if they catch you ""Ogling"" their muscles (Allegedly, I wouldn't know) and I don't think anyone should have to be uncomfortable in public. Further, I shouldn't have to be uncomfortable in a sexualized environment when straight men aren't.

17,2024-04-07,CMV: It’s more disrespectful to ignore a “friends” interest in you than to express interest in a friend,u/FormerBabyPerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1byodys/cmv_its_more_disrespectful_to_ignore_a_friends/,changemyview,"This is something I often see where people seem to almost universally make it seem like the person expressing interest in a friend is the bad person. While this can be an awkward situation, people seem to actually be villainizing the person expressing interest and acting as if there was some betrayal. I disagree with this and would say the “friend” who chooses to ignore and not address this is more disrespectful.

The reason is because by ignoring the topic, it’s often in the hope that the friend will just drop it and go back to “normal”. While things may seem to go back to normal they generally aren’t because now not only are you aware your friend is into you and will be second guessing things they do, they likely now feel disrespected and ignored. All this because they dared to open up and be honest about their feelings.

**But this would ruin the friendship**

Maybe? Maybe not? But doesn’t your friend deserve to be given a straight answer to make that choice for themselves? As someone who has experienced this at least twice in my life, in my personal experience, being given a straight answer would’ve lead to a more cordial outcome in both situations and possibly maintaining a friendship. Instead it just ends with me realizing that someone who was once a “friend” is actually pretty shit. In a way it kinda feels like their respect for me is based on me being the way they want rather than me as a person if that makes sense.

If you take out the romantic interest aspect of it, think about if you invited a friend to an important event. They don’t want to go but they also don’t want you to be mad they don’t want to go so instead of giving a clear answer they either ignore you or give a vague answer. Would the inviter be disrespectful for extending the invitation or the friend disrespectful for not giving an answer?

I seem to be in the minority on this so cmv"

If for whatever reason you are forced by circumstance to be in situation where you a forced into the latter, having to make do, I believe its perfect ethical and reasonably for you to do almost whatever it is to keep your peace and get your needs met.

Blackmail, lies, emotional manipulation etc are all on the table when you are forced to live with parents and siblings or other family members who are unresponsive to any kind of equally respectful mode of conflict resolution between you and them.

Yeah i love that guy, died for our sins man. i wanna learn skateboarding with him, he'd seem like the guy to shredd and grind hard
But in order to do that, i have to do good in life, follow the doctrine ive been told. So this motivates me to be better in life, even when the odds are against me i still find faith in god. sometimes my wishes never come true, in other words honestly god disappointed me, but i never hated god, because i knew i always sin, so i have done worse to god. and this ""disappointment"" is just a path to a better future. Which i fully accept. 

Simplifying this alot more to what i want to say: believing in religion motivates you to live a good life. but i see people thinking it ""forces"" you to live a good life out of maybe fear, guilt or anything else bad. So they become dissatisfied.
I dont want you to view it that way. God is forgiving, and he understands you will always fuck it up. its just if you repent and say sorry honestly. but dont go around thinking you can sin because god will always forgive. You're being manipulative to god. 

Understanding each religion is pretty hard at first but once you get to understand it somewhat it's actually pretty cool.

It wasn't like the leader of France fled and then the Germans appointed a German administrator. The processes and institutions and individuals of the Third French government which appointed Albert Lebrun in 1932 were the same processes and institutions and individuals who signed an armistice with Nazi Germany and which would appoint Philippe Petain as leader.

&#x200B;

\#2: Vichy France maintained administrative control of all metropolitan areas. The North was militarily occupied, but so was the Rhineland during the Interwar; does that mean that the Weimar government wasn't legitimate?

&#x200B;

\#3: Vichy France maintained control of all their colonies in Indochina, India, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. These places had to be militarily invaded by Britain and America later, except for Indochina which was transferred to Japan. The local governments of all overseas territories before the capitulation of France were the same 

&#x200B;

\#4: Philippe Petain was immensely popular and had toured throughout France up until 1944. Wherever he went, thousands of people would conglomerate and cheer support whilst waving flags. The Germans would turn these moments into propaganda reels to show back home. If there were elections in France, he would've won handily. Even when he was put through a kangaroo court and found guilty of treason, they did not strip him of his designation of Marshal of France.

&#x200B;

\#5: Philippe Petain did not commit treason, despite what the kangaroo court says. Many many high individuals including President Truman, Queen Mary, and King Edward the VIII appealed for his release. Domestically, the Council of Ministers (many of whom were in the French Resistance) wanted to move him to a hospital in his old age (rather than prison) and so did Prime Minister Henri Queuille and President Vincent Auriol. Calls have been consistently made by individuals high in government and influence to move his grave to Verdun, and when he was reburied (after his body was stolen) it was ceremoniously reburied with the presidential wreathe. The honorary names of buildings and streets for Petain were only removed in 2021 and 2022.

&#x200B;

\#6: Vichy France did not collaborate militarily with Germany. Vichy France never made an offensive against the British in Africa or anywhere else. They never declared war on Britain, nor did they declare war on the USSR. They never helped the Germans at any point. When Germany invaded Vichy France in 1942, the Vichy French government scuttled their fleet. When the Allies invaded Southern France (militarily under the control of Vichy France) they met no resistance; just a Frenchman offering wine and bread. [And then there's this whole fiasco.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir) Britain didn't even look at Vichy France as an enemy proper, as they did not invade at any point any Vichy French possessions such as French Guiana or in the Caribbean. If the allies ever made an offensive into Vichy French overseas territories, it was only when it was strategically useful. 

&#x200B;

\#7: Vichy France was recognized as the legitimate government by literally everyone. Even the UK only dropped ties with Vichy France after it was clear they wouldn't backstab the Germans. There were open diplomatic channels between Vichy France and the UK for months until the UK backstabbed the French and the French were forced to cut ties. They were recognized by Germany, Italy, Japan, the USSR, the United States, and even Australia and Canada. Over 40 countries recognized Vichy France. "

One of the precedents was the Nuremburg trials, in which civilian newspaper publisher and editor Julius Streicher was convicted and even executed.

For a less controversial example, most journalists on RT support the aggressive action of the Russian government to invade Ukraine. The purpose of the media is to manufacture consent to the civilians to keep voting for pro-war parties. A similar case could be made for the US and UK media in the lead-up to the Iraq war. However, I could not find information on whether ""crimes against peace"" is an actual, current international crime.

I came across videos arguing that inciteful radio messages played a critical role in the Rwandan genocide, in which violence was disproportionately inflicted in areas with higher per capita access to radios.

However, I read that not a single media figure was not tried for the Bosnian and Cambodian genocide trials, nor in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda prosecute particular newspaper editors.

Overall, I find it bizarre that government figures are the only civilians that everyone agrees that should be held accountable. However, because of a weird reverence for the office of journalists, some think that even controversial ones should be untouchable. That and people worry about the precedent that civilian non-government people could be prosected, let alone imprisoned.

I am not here to debate whether particular conflicts could be justified, but rather should international courts and tribunals have the ability to hold journalists as eligible for conspiracy and incitement for international crimes, the same way every national local/regional/national outlaws speech justifying/arguing/inciting a crime."

Without that aspect, people consuming it, particularly those with abusive tendencies who really need therapy, are not likely to critically examine themselves and have actual personal growth. Instead, they’ll probably just arm themselves with a bunch of therapy words that they barely understand and use them as cudgels to shift blame onto their victims.

Info: my perspective is shaped by a recent ex who decided that I had an avoidant emotional attachment style because of my IMO perfectly normal reservations about her behaviour. It’s not her fault for screaming at me and comparing me to her exes when I failed to answer the phone at 3am when I was out of town, that was just her justified trauma response to me being avoidant, because I had only been calling her about twice per day, instead of the three times per day she would have preferred (but never actually communicated).

I’ve been pondering the widely observed phenomenon that, on average, men are physically stronger than women. A prevailing explanation I’ve encountered attributes this difference not so much to natural evolutionary processes but to social constructs and roles historically assigned to genders. Specifically, the idea is that women did not evolve to be as physically strong because, for the major part of human existence, societal norms and expectations have positioned them primarily in caregiving roles, focusing on nurturing and supporting the family unit, including taking care of men. Conversely, men have been traditionally tasked with labor-intensive roles, from hunting and gathering in ancient times to various forms of work outside the home in more recent history.

This perspective suggests that the physical strength disparity is less a matter of biological evolution and more a result of centuries of gendered expectations and roles. I’m open to having my view challenged or broadened with additional insights, scientific evidence, or alternative interpretations of the data on gender differences in physical strength."

The people here only post to brag their stance on a certain topic. They are not willing to get their view changed.

What they do:

1) They often choose a topic, make it controversial, and build up a stance on it.

2) They post a topic which they do have knowledge of. Flex, maybe.

3) They love to debate. They post for the sake of argumentation or to show their intellectual prowess rather than genuinely seeking to have their view challenged or potentially changed.

4) People are more interested in defending their views rather than engaging in actual healthy discussion.

5) They interpret counter arguments in a way that reinforces their existing belief rather than critically evaluating them.

6) The OP already has a strong inclination towards their own belief and seek validation rather than a genuine debate.

When presented with facts and even proved wrong, they still don’t accept it and stay on their point of view.

0,2024-04-08,CMV: Gun control as a solution to school shootings is the same as using hostile architecture as a solution to homelessness. ,u/Emperor-Kahfonso,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bywkby/cmv_gun_control_as_a_solution_to_school_shootings/,changemyview,"Gun control often comes as a proposed solution when school shootings, hit the US. Now, I'd like to specify that I'm not American. I am Portuguese, and Portugal does have strict gun control, with gun ownership only being allowed with a license, and self defense not being recognized as a legal reason for gun ownership. Nevertheless, I consider gun control to not be a real solution to school shootings. There are plenty of reasons why gun control should be implemented, and plenty of reasons why it shouldn't. I don't want this to become a debate on gun control. Nevertheless, I think that the two have a problem that they end up covering up the symptoms of a deeper problem rather than actually solving that deeper problem. Of course, this is not to say that I don't think school shootings are horrible things, or that I believe that homeless people sleeping on park benches and school shootings are equally bad. 

  
When it comes to school shootings, the deeper problem is that there is such a pervasive mental health crisis in American schooling that there is a risk of students getting their hands on a gun and killing their teachers and schoolmates. Removing their access to guns is obviously going to limit their ability to do bad, but it doesn't solve the root cause - that the student was in such poor mental health that they even considered shooting up their school. That in itself is a problem, and implementing gun control, even if it prevented every single school shooter from getting their hands on a gun, would not solve that problem. Gun control is not a cure. It may very well solve the symptom, but it doesn't solve the underlying cause of that symptom. Our goal when dealing with school shootings should be to solve that symptom. Keeping people who are mentally unstable from getting their hands on firearms is a good thing, but it doesn't solve the problem that those people are mentally unstable in the first place.

  
Likewise, hostile architecture seeks to prevent homeless people from living where they may be considered a bother - benches, below bridges, realistically everywhere that they may be seen, and in places that they may not even be seen. It might keep them out of sight - just like stopping school shootings would keep the mental health crisis in schools out of sight - but it doesn't solve the larger, structural problems - a housing affordability crisis, rampant addiction, etcetera."

394,2024-04-08,CMV: Israel is showing extreme callousness towards civilian casualties in their war in Gaza,u/WheatBerryPie,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1byxjde/cmv_israel_is_showing_extreme_callousness_towards/,changemyview,"5 days ago, [+972 Mag](https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/) published an article that focuses on Lavendar AI technology and the IDF approach to civilian casualties. A few other outlets have already reported on this story, so it is likely that the sources have been corroborated and +972 Mag is generally seen as [reliable](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/972-magazine/). While most of the focus of the +972 Mag's article is on the AI, there are a few other things that really caught my attention:

>it was permissible to kill up to 15 or 20 civilians; in the past, the military did not authorize any “collateral damage” during assassinations of low-ranking militants. 

This ratio of 15 to 20 civilians is _absurdly_ high for a low-ranking militant. According to [this article](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/assessing-israel-s-approach-to-proportionality-in-the-conduct-of-hostilities-in-gaza) on proportionality analysis, the US Army generally accepts _ZERO_ for low-ranking militant, anything in the realm of 14 to 15 requires approval from the Secretary of Defense, and for Osama bin Laden the figure is 30. I don't understand how the IDF is permitting its commanders to approve a strike themselves if it kills up to 20 civilians per low-ranking militant.

>they would personally devote only about “20 seconds” to each target before authorizing a bombing — just to make sure the Lavender-marked target is male. This was despite knowing that the system makes what are regarded as “errors” in approximately 10 percent of cases, and is known to occasionally mark individuals who have merely a loose connection to militant groups, or no connection at all.

I'm not sure about you, but 10% is a crazy high error rate, because this is additive to the error rate that humans make. This is not some sort of error rate for a sorting machine, this is an error rate of killing people with weaponry. Using this and the information provided above, there's _at least_ a 10% chance that up to 20 civilians will die because of a Lavender error. 

>the commander laments: “We [humans] cannot process so much information. It doesn’t matter how many people you have tasked to produce targets during the war — you still cannot produce enough targets per day.”

This is incredibly dystopian. It feels like the commanders have a target number to hit every day, and because humans aren't capable to hitting that target by ourselves, an AI tool is used to speed up that process, a tool that has very little oversight.

>the Lavender machine sometimes mistakenly flagged individuals who had communication patterns similar to known Hamas or PIJ operatives — including police and civil defense workers, militants’ relatives, residents who happened to have a name and nickname identical to that of an operative, and Gazans who used a device that once belonged to a Hamas operative. 

This is not just a problem that runs deep in Lavender, it runs deep in their training set as well, which means the IDF consistently flag non-Hamas civilians as Hamas members. It puts the number of ""Hamas militant killed"" into question because that figure reported by the IDF must've included a lot of false positives like militants' relatives, nurses, etc.

>We were constantly being pressured: ‘Bring us more targets.’ They really shouted at us. We finished [killing] our targets very quickly.”

This speaks to a more top-down approach and systemic problem to killing Hamas militants. Because of the pressure from higher ups to rake up Hamas death toll, the lower level officials feel pressured to kill without proper oversight or check on intelligence. It feels like someone clocking into work, being demanded to hit some x targets a day, and clock out. There seems to be little consideration for what is the actual threat the targets pose to Israel or IDF. 

>“In the bombing of the commander of the Shuja’iya Battalion, we knew that we would kill over 100 civilians,” 

It's insane to me that a target like Osama bin Laden has an acceptable civilian death ratio of 30, but a commander in Gaza has a ratio of 100. I don't know, this seems very callous to me.


I can go on and on and I can bring up other incidents too like the WCK drone strike, but the point I'm making here is even if the IDF doesn't have a policy to target civilians, they sure as hell ignore civilian casualties in their policy-making. I don't know how this does not amount to a systemic enabling of war crimes. Also, the IDF response (which we have no reason to believe is true) does not deny the claims made by the sources I quoted. They denied some of the interpretations/extrapolations by others, and some of the minor details, but not the central claim of the article or the quotes I put above."

0,2024-04-08,CMV: Zionism advocates for a ethnostate and is thus incompatible with liberalism,u/PrometheusHasFallen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1byyi30/cmv_zionism_advocates_for_a_ethnostate_and_is/,changemyview,"My view is that you cannot simultaneously support Zionism and liberalism as the two political philosophy are incompatible with each other.

The early Zionist movement, ironically, was a reaction to the ethno national movements in Europe which targeted the Jewish people. But Zionists, instead of rejecting the notion of an ethnostate, sought instead to create their own ethnostate exclusive to the Jewish people. 

*Zionist nationalism drew from German racial nationalist Völkisch theory, that people of common descent should seek separation and to form their own state.*

It's essentially meeting fire with fire.

Liberal western philosophy, however, views the individual, not the collective, as the optimal way to conduct yourself within society. This individualists philosophy seeks to tear down the walls which divide us into distinct groups. People should be treated as the individuals they are and not based on some physical or cultural attribute.

And while the Jewish people have certainly suffered immensely throughout their long history, this does not excuse the establishment of an ethnostate which explicitly or implicitly discriminates against non-Jewish peoples.

**Note:** Being opposed to Zionism does not equate to being an antisemite. You can oppose ethno national movements without hating people of that ethnicity. I can oppose Nazism without hating the German people. I can oppose Apartheid without hating white South Africans. I can oppose Zionism without hating the Jewish people. I have many Jewish friends and colleagues and have donated to synagogues. But the concept of Zionism is as far as I can tell completely incompatible with my political philosophy of liberalism."

However for reference I am pro-choice and a man.

I often see some feminists decreeing that Roe vs. Wade being overturned as part of the patriarchy, and criticizing the men who are pro life as sexist. 

I fully acknowledge that women are more affected by abortion restrictions than men. That being said, as a man I’m don’t benefit from stronger abortion laws at ALL. If I unintentionally get a girl pregnant that I’m not in a relationship with, I have to pay child support for the next 18 years. Yes it’s much harder on the woman since she has to carry the child and breast feed, but my life would get worse as well. 

Polls in the United States would also show that women aren’t that much more likely to be pro choice either. 55% of women identify as pro choice vs. 48% of men. 

Really the debate should be framed as religious vs. non-religious since religious people feel that abortion is evil and killing an innocent life, while non-religious people don’t see it as a life and don’ think the government should interfere what someone does with their body.

A better example of a men vs. women issue would be the gender pay gap. One could argue that could impact both gender’s salary depending on how much you want to enforce   equal pay."

0,2024-04-08,"CMV: Western prosperity is not due to colonialism, but much of the Global South's poverty is.",u/DJJazzay,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1byzw3v/cmv_western_prosperity_is_not_due_to_colonialism/,changemyview,"I think there's a very commonly held belief that the prosperity enjoyed by Western countries can be attributed mostly to colonialism - that they were able to establish modern economies off the resource extraction occurring through colonial conquests.

I think this view is incorrect, and I also think its deeply problematic (giving far too much credit to an immoral geopolitical system). For my purposes here though I want to focus on why I think its incorrect.

**1)** If a country's wealth today was determined primarily by its colonial experience, then how is it that the ***overwhelming*** majority of economic prosperity in the West was created since the 1950s, right as colonial powers were finally abandoning their last colonial holdings? Was it some sort of ""wealth timebomb"" that only started to kick in after a couple centuries? 

**2)** This does little to explain those Western countries that were eager participants in colonialism, yet remained *unbelievably* poor until very recently? Portugal has one of the longest (and most brutal) colonial histories in Europe, but just 50-60 years ago their GDP per capita was lower than the DRC's today. Same goes for Spain, Russia, and many settler-colonial states like Mexico, Chile, Argentina, or Brazil. 

**3)** Further, this doesn't explain the prosperity enjoyed by many countries (some in the West and some not) who were not colonial powers but nonetheless enjoy tremendous prosperity, often far greater than colonial powers. This even includes a number of former colonies.

I think the more consistent variable determining a country's wealth isn't their history of colonialism, but their history as a ***stable liberal democracy***. In the case of Portugal, their economy only meaningfully grew after they overthrew their dictatorship and installed a liberal democratic government. Meanwhile, most of the formerly colonized states that are today quite prosperous have enjoyed several decades of stable liberal democracy.

**Now, this is not to say that colonialism isn't a massive source of** ***poverty*** **among those countries that were colonized.**

I think that's related mostly to the enormous political instability and shortage of economic institutions/infrastructure in many (if not most) formerly colonized states. Fostering deep and often violent divisions was central to many colonial models (the classic British 'divide and rule'), and in many cases formerly colonized states were put together in such a slapdash fashion by their colonizers that nobody could reasonably expect stable governments and economies to emerge (as in much of sub-Saharan Africa). 

So, my argument is that colonialism is, in fact, not a significant source of the prosperity enjoyed by many former colonial states. However, it is a huge factor in the continued poverty of many colonized states. However, this is not due to a shortage of resources left by colonial powers or anything like that (these are often very resource-rich countries to this day), but rather a shortage of political stability, itself a legacy of colonialism. 

I accept that my history could be way off, and/or I'm just not well-versed in the subject. Happy to have this view challenged!"

0,2024-04-08,"CMV: If gun control activists are going after AR-15’s, they should go after tactical shotguns as well",u/DaleGribble2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bz0scf/cmv_if_gun_control_activists_are_going_after/,changemyview,"Right now, the main focus of gun control activists is on AR-15’s and similar sporting rifles, which is understandable. A person in most of America with little to no training can obtain and AR-15, lots of ammo and spare magazines, and massacre many innocent civilians in a short time frame with relative ease. You could say the same thing regarding just about any other rifle similar enough to the AR-15 like the AK-47, AUG or even many semi auto pistols that can accept extended magazines like a Glock.

However, there’s one class of weapons that gun control activists seem to be ignoring that could be just as if not more deadly in a mass shooting than an AR-15 but are ignored because they are rarely used in mass shootings… shotguns.

Whether it’s a 410 bore or 12 gauge, shotguns can be incredibly devastating as short range weapons. Shotguns can’t match the high velocity of a 5.56 round but they make up for it through sheer payload weight and number of projectiles. An average buckshot load can contain about 3 to 4 buckshot pellets for the lowly 410 bore or up to 27 or more buckshot pellets in a typical 12 gauge buckshot shell. A 12 gauge 000 buckshot shell can contain eight 36 caliber spheres traveling at over 1000 feet per second that weigh 69 grains each, which is easily more than the typical 5.56 projectile. So, if you load a shotgun with some really stout buckshot, you basically are sending several or even dozens of deadly pellets out the barrel with every trigger pull that can spread out quickly. What could this mean in practice? A psychopath armed with a shotgun could massacre a school classroom in 15 rounds or less with a shotgun that would take 30 rounds or more with an AR-15. One trigger pull on a tactical shotgun at a group of innocent civilians 25 yards away could lead to 3 or 4 people getting killed compared to maybe 2 in the same scenario with a 5.56 AR-15 due to the spread of the buckshot.

This scenario could play out even in states with “assault weapon” bans because even a 12 gauge shotgun with a 10 round capacity is considered to be high capacity even if it’s considered to be low capacity by rifle standards. A Kalashnikov KS-12 with 10 round magazines may be legal to own in all but a couple of US states but it could still be very devastating in a mass shooting despite it having a lower ammo capacity than a 30 round AR-15.

And let’s say that shotguns with quick detach magazines are banned and you can only buy and own shotguns with tube magazines. With enough practice, those guns can be very devastating as well, whether they’re semi auto or pump action. With enough practice, you can reload tube fed shotguns very quickly. Just look at how quickly Keanu Reeves can shoot and reload a tube fed semi auto shotgun

1,2024-04-08,CMV: Iran escalated the conflict in Palestine because they stand to gain from Israeli atrocities.,u/iDontSow,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bz13y6/cmv_iran_escalated_the_conflict_in_palestine/,changemyview,"I feel obligated to start by saying that I believe  that ""Israel"" is a colonialist occupation entity and that it is fair to conclude that their ongoing military operation in Gaza is a genocide. This is not the view I am asking you to change. I don’t want my point to misrepresented as saying that Palestinians deserve what is happening to them.

TLDR: the Iranian regime, through Hamas and its other proxies, goaded (maybe not the best word?) the IDF into committing the genocide of Gazans to blackmail the US and the international community into loosening sanctions that severely inhibit the Iranian economy and prevent Iranian money laundering.

In order to understand why Iranian pawns like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis have become increasingly aggressive in the last 6 or so months, we must forget about the plight of Palestinians (for a moment) and focus on the international community's sanctioning of the Iranian regime.

Since October, I have seen a lot of leftists double down on anti-western rhetoric and sympathize heavily with Iran and the ""Axis of Resistance"", an Iranian-led political and military coalition that includes (among others) Hamas, the Syrian Arab Republic (Bashar al-Assad's regime), the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and Ansar Allah (commonly referred to as the Houthis). There seems to be a very common sentiment among leftists that these groups are united behind the noble cause of freeing Palestine from the Israeli boot on their neck. Although I am for the liberation of Palestine and the end of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land, it is my opinion that this belief is misplaced. It is my view that the Axis of Resistance, and especially Iran, stand to benefit greatly from the absolutely atrocious massacre of Palestinians at the hands of the IDF.

As I am sure many of you know, Iran has long been under some pretty strong sanctions from the US and others designed to limit the Iranian economy and block Iran from developing nuclear weaponry. The effects of these sanctions have been pretty devastating to Iran and have led to some serious inflation and a sharp depreciation of the Iranian currency, the Rial. The sanctions have been so devastating that the UN and Human Rights Watch have issued numerous reports expressing concern about food insecurity and the unavailability of medicine directly linked to those sanctions. Of course, the suffering of the Iranian people is a threat to the Iranian Regime, in addition to (or as part of) the larger economic implications of the sanctions themselves. To maintain their wealth and power, the Iranian regime has had to find workarounds.

Enter: Iraq. For decades, the Iranian regime has been circumventing western sanctions by laundering money through Iraqi banks - specifically the bank known as al-Huda. Through al-Huda, Iran has access to USD that it otherwise would not have because of western sanctions. For example, in 2022 about 60 billion Iraqi dinar derived from the assets of Iranian energy companies (40 million USD) was deposited by Al-Huda into the Iranian Embassy’s bank account with the Trade Bank of Iraq. Investigations performed by the US Treasury Dept have also linked similar transactions to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds force and Hezbollah. Iran is laundering money through Iraqi banks to fund militant groups.

In recent years, the US Fed has taken steps to eliminate or reduce this sort of laundering. By enforcing tighter controls on international USD transactions, the Federal Reserve is pretty much single handedly responsible for the nose dive in value experienced by the Iraqi dinar in 2023, which led to massive protests in Baghdad and throughout Iraq. As expected, the diminished value of the dinar and the restrictions on USD transactions limited al-Huda's ability to siphon USD into Iranian coffers. I don’t think it’s any coincidence that Hamas, using Iranian funding, attacked Israel just months after these developments on Oct. 7. The last 6 or so months have been a back and forth between Washington and Tehran, whereby the US imposes sanctions, Iran cranks up militant activity, and then the US comes back with more sanctions in response.

The actions of Yemeni militant group Ansar Allah is a good example of this. Based on viewing a simple timeline of events related to this conflict, I think it is pretty clear to me that Iran uses Ansar Allah as a thorn in the US' side, an annoying prick to draw a drop of blood in response to western aggression and sanctions. Israel invaded Gaza in October, giving Iran the opportunity to crank up the heat in the middle east with Houthi attacks on commercial ships beginning in November. The US responded by (among other actions) targeting the Budget Airline Fly Baghdad with sanctions because of their ties to Hezbollah, Quds, and other Iranian backed Syrian-Militant groups (these groups used Fly Baghdad to move materiel/weapons and troops around the middle east). Iran then directed Ansar Allah to increase their attacks in January, another logistical paper cut for the US regime to deal with. Finally, the US slammed down sanctions on al-Huda. And back and forth we go.

Every time the US tightens the screws on Iran, Iran instructions its minions in Iraq and Yemen to escalate. Attacks on commercial ships. Rockets fired at US bases in Syria, Iraq, Jordan, etc. They want to escalate the conflict, to drag the US down by pulling them deeper and deeper into the shit. Before long, the US has taken 1000 paper cuts. They want to take it to the point that the US finally says enough and something has to give - whether that be a deal that loosens the screws or leads to direct conflict (the former being far more likely, in my opinion - I don't think either Iran or the West want direct kinetic conflict).

All of this to say, I don't believe Iran cares that Palestinian citizens are dying. I don't think this entire series of events, as orchestrated by Iran, ever intended to free Palestinians from their oppression. I don't believe that groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Ansar Allah are worthy of my support. To me, the images of the leaders of these militant groups sitting in Qatari high rises with their fat bellies bulging through their shirts while Palestinians are starving en masse are pretty damning. I think the heads of the snake know that they stand to gain from Israeli atrocities. In fact, I believe this whole massacre may have been the intended consequence of the Oct. 7 attacks.

I am open to changing this view, and I truly want to believe that these groups are at least somewhat worthy of support. Change my view by convincing me that the liberation of Palestine is more than just a façade or a means to an end for the Axis of Resistance"

And all that for him just to joke with his friends in the group chat about how you’re a fat 2 with a loose pussy. Or, if you’re married, for him to neglect you while you do all the housework and chores and he does nothing, while making you work full time while pregnant.

“Oh but some guys are good!” You say.

The male mind inherently sees sex as a form of domination. He relishes in having sex with you because he gets to feel like he is being superior to you and violent towards you, revenge on you for having the power to control his lineage. 

I remember talking to this one guy about cunnilingus and he said “I would never go down on a girl because it would feel degrading.” Which makes me realize that men see blowjobs because they are degrading. When a man has sex with you, he is getting off on your degradation. Just look at the ubiquitous use of porn, for example. 

Men are incapable of emotional connection during sex. They have casual sex like it’s breathing, abandoning women at a second’s notice. They will abandon you to die on the operating room table if they don’t see you as wife material. 

There is a good chance the man you are having sex with doesn’t care if you live or die. And even if he does, he likely does not have the money to fund all the expenses of raising a child, so you essentially become his slave. 

“Oh, but what about the human race?” Fuck the human race, lol. Men can go jerk off to their onlyfans accounts for all I care. I’m not ever letting a man be that intimate with me ever again.

 They are useless, evil, weak, violent, sociopathic, and simple creatures, and they do not deserve love and companionship, much less for me to risk my life for them."

I'm not saying that you have to like something, you don't have to enjoy everything and it's OK to be a bit sad about something not meeting your expectations, but why should that interfere with people who like that thing. Sure, if your ""enjoyment"" comes from stuff like murder or whatever, then it's obviously not OK since it affects other people negatively, but if you like  a certain movie or game or whatever that other people don't like, then I don't see why it should not be OK to let you enjoy it, since it doesn't really affect anyone else.

These specific health conditions might require special diets that are not indicative of the general population's access to food. While it's critical these individuals receive the necessary treatment, possibly with IDF facilitation, their situations do not reflect a broader starvation crisis.

We give every reason why life is worth preserving, and every reason starts off with “because we are human” There is no reason other than we as humans have deemed ourselves special.

So at the end of the day, I’m not really sure what the final law is, but I think a person should be able to sleep anywhere they choose, regardless, if it makes you feel uncomfortable or not. 

It should serve as a reminder that our government is not putting money towards ending homelessness. Our tax dollars are going to proxy wars, supporting illegal immigrants, giving huge tax breaks to companies, etc. We are the wealthiest nation on this planet, yet we don’t have money for our own citizens, and no money to help homeless people.

Finland has an amazing model for homelessness, and it is as follows:

The Finnish model is simple, he said: give people quality, permanent housing before attempting to address other issues — such as alcohol and drug use, or mental health problems — or helping people find jobs

“That’s really the fundamental idea of our policy, if we give people a home, there will be very positive side-effects,” Vartiainen said.

Giving people an apartment leads to improved health, less drug and alcohol use, he said, and increases the chance that people will find jobs. Once someone is given a home, he said, there are teams that ensure they receive the care and support required.

Estimates say over half a million people in the United States are currently experiencing homelessness – which translates to 0.2 percent of the population. Reasons for homelessness include everything from economic hardship to untreated mental illness. 

With a lack of affordable housing and a shortage of beds in shelters, many take to sleeping on public property. This can create a nuisance for people trying to enjoy those public spaces. Some argue that it is a duty of the government to provide shelter to those who are unhoused, including allowing them to sleep or encamp on public property. The argument’s underlying idea is that homeless individuals are citizens just like everyone else and have a right to public property. Others, however, believe unhoused people have themselves to blame for their own individual situations and that occupying public space for shelter is not the answer."

Although other people advocating for their ban focus their attention elsewhere, my gripe with them concerns the noise: they're simply much too loud. Equipment operators are required to wear huge noise-cancelling headphones (which is good) but there's absolutely no consideration given to everyone else around. The sound is deafening and dangerous to people outside nearby and penetrates into otherwise noise-resistant homes and buildings. (Noise-cancelling headphones don't really help either, and even if they did, I think it's a travesty that the average person is told to just suck it up and cope instead of dealing with the underlying issue.) In suburban areas especially, the sound is almost a daily nuisance.

When investigating this issue online, I've usually seen people focusing on the environmental concerns over gas-powered equipment. While I agree that environmental concerns are valid, I fear they distract from the main issue for most of us, which is the noise. These same people usually point to electric alternatives, which are more sustainable. I've found that electric alternatives are indeed available and get the job done just as well, but the concern from landscaping companies and average homeowners is that they are perhaps a bit too expensive. To average people, I'd say that electric is a great investment that will save everyone a lot of trouble down the line. To landscaping companies, I say that you can't afford to not pollute your environment with unneeded dangerous noise, you shouldn't be in business. I think that actually, your company will be *more competitive* and can *charge more* if quiet landscaping is an option, which may counterbalance the equipment cost. People really want this to happen and I'm sure communities will pay a little more for it.

I'm genuinely interested in talking this over with people who disagree, especially those who work in the business. Change my view."

An [earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1247b6z/cmv_limited_liability_should_not_exist_for/) by /u/No_Concentrate_7711 argues that limited liability induces a moral hazard. I essentially agree with this point, which I repeat as follows.

Suppose that LLB A has equity of $W and is offered the opportunity to earn either $X or -$X in income, with equal probability. For sufficiently large X > W, the rational choice is for A to accept this opportunity. Clearly, with probability 1/2, A will be forced to close. This venture incurs a small friction cost associated with starting and ending a business, but that cost can be negligible given sufficiently large X.

Limited liability provides the owners of A with a call option on the +/- $X opportunity. In very many cases in which such a business loses its bet, the cost is passed on to the public via a bail-out. Traditionally, this scenario is controlled by a mixture of government regulation on what risks A can take (which is the case in banking), a government-assessed premium that prices in the implicit public bailout guarantee (also the case in banking), or private assessments of creditworthiness that underwrite the -$X optional liability.

It is clear, then, that the LLB system incentivizes business structures that seek to arbitrage these risk-reward profiles in such a way as to extract as much benefit from the public as possible by taking risks and under-appraising their riskiness.
This is why financial institutions have armies of legal staff to package risky financial instruments in infinitely specific LLC vehicles, or as Anat Admati puts it, vehicles without drivers.

Now I make a positive case for how business liability can be managed prudently. I write from a Liberal framework that assumes that, in the absence of external forces, most markets will assign prices to goods that incentivize the most public benefit. I acknowledge this may not always be the case (such as the market for emergency medicine), and welcome challenges to this assumption.

Limited liability is a public subsidy, where ""public"" is used in a broad sense that encompasses both government guarantees and shared liability among creditors such as customers. It is not hard to determine the size of this subsidy. For example, when I drive my car, I have unlimited liability for my actions. The government requires that a purchase an insurance policy that limits my liability for my actions beyond, say, $X a year in perpetuity, at a discounted present value of, say $10,000. I pay the insurer $1000 a year for this service. If I get into a crash with an insured loss of $20,000, then my policy might dictate that I pay $10,000 and the insurer pays the remaining $10,000.

Alternatively, I could (hypothetically) set up an LLC to operate my car with $10,000 of equity as self-insurance. As before, I am down $10,000, which I can't use for other purposes. If the LLC car gets in a crash and incurs a liability of $20,000, then my $10,000 of equity is wiped out. But the difference is that the 
other party doesn't get paid the remaining $10,000.

Objections:

1. $10,000 is too low. Regulation should require a higher equity ratio for self-insurance. This falls under the ""risk regulation"" mitigation I described above. I counter that assessing risk should not be the responsibility of the government's intuition, but of markets.

2. I, the owner of the LLC, could somehow be [personally liable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_the_corporate_veil). The legal system has provisions for making exceptions to limited liability, but they are technical and likely inefficient.

Proposal:

All businesses, including my car-LLC have unlimited liability. In my example, this would entail that the car-LLC would pay for insurance against losses arising from the car's operation. The car-LLC, which is substantially similar to driving a personal vehicle, would have the same risk profile. Likewise, all businesses should be required to hold insurance policies that limit their liability. The business and insurer will find the policy terms that make the relationship mutually beneficial. The government will sell insurance or reinsurance at high prices as an ""insurer of last resort.""

Objection: limited liability is a useful subsidy for small businesses. I counter that we may continue to subsidize businesses by making insurance premia tax-refundable up to a certain amount. In this way, the subsidy is explicit rather than implicit."

I think that it would be silly for me to be called a bigot or a transphobe because of this, as I don't have any hatred towards trans people. I simply disagree with their ideas, and believe that there are only two genders. 

I find it incredibly hurtful that, if any of my friends knew that I believed there were only two genders, they would call me transphobic and might even cut ties with me. Whenever the topic of transgender stuff comes up, I have to pretend that I agree with it. It feels like I can't fully be myself around my friends. In all honesty, it even makes our friendships feel kind of hollow and worthless, since I know they would easily reject me and end our friendships merely because of my personal opinions and beliefs.

I don't hate trans people. Even though I disagree with them, I still care about them and value them and consider them friends. What on earth is the problem with that? 

The same goes for gay marriage, pro-life, etc. I've met plenty of kind, understanding people who happened to personally be against homosexual acts or abortion. While their opinions may be controversial, they are still good people, and always convey their opinions in a humble and respectful manner. And yet, there are still many people who would disregard them as hateful bigots for no reason other than their beliefs.

For some leagues like NFL or PL its even worse and its basically sold on match by match bases, so you would need many subscriptions to catch matches of 1 team. The general argument that its not anti-competitive is that you have all the other entertainment options to go with instead. That might work for TV shows, movie right or even things like miniatures, but sports is a huge part of many people's lives and identities. Many times its part of city culture or family tradition. It is not an overstatement to say that it goes further than just entertainment to fill free time, its a real need. 
Unfortunately there is almost no consumer protection in this space. TV broadcasters can put out absolutely terrible product (For example NBC with absolutely horrible Olympics coverage that often isnt even live and many hours delayed) with little consequence since they have a captive audience.
Capitalism thrives in competition, so in order for people to have best viewing experience, most competitive prices and ease of access - sports TV contracts should automatically come allowing for multiple broadcasters. For example with the clause that if anyone else meets the agreed payment for broadcasting, they are allowed to do it also. Then we would just have to be on the look out for collusion between companies. The leagues would end up with multiple revenue streams of smaller amounts, the total might end up bigger or smaller, either way sports makes an insane amount of money for top leagues at most the spending (or cap) would have to go down a bit. Star players would still make hundreds of millions over lifetimes. (Increased exposure might actually increase overall revenue through merchandise and other income streams)"

But pretty much every conservative I've talked to, (bar hardcore white supremacists) has had little to no personal development in the ways of being traumatized or institutionalized in any capacity.

A good amount of rich people are conservative.

Less conservatives seem to seek out physical or mental illness treatment. 

Every conservative that's a minority, seems to overall agree that they're not oppressed.

It seems to me that those who lean more left, do so because they've experienced more adversity than those who lean right.

To clarify, this post is exclusively addressing people who shit on AI art with any opportunity they can get. It’s actually egregiously often recently that 20+ people will come to a post of AI art just to be rude. Like, the comments are NOT usually about any real argument, it’s usually something along the lines of “fuck yourself OP”, “Delete this you lazy sack of shit”, “Ew your idea is disgusting”.

Bruh it’s a picture of kitten in a horse race, meant to serve as a personalized alternate album cover for OP’s favorite band’s studio debut. WHY are you so mad? Because the faces in the crowd are blurry? Sorry man, jeez. 

I swear I’ve been witnessing this mob mentality reaction to AI art ever since DALL-E was released.

So I’d like to dedicate this post to the growing number of people that are starting to feel like they have to stay in a bubble with their own AI art. Just because whenever they post their AI ideas nowadays, people *literally* start a cyberbullying brigade. 

Let’s begin.

#PART ONE

I just discovered an AI program that generates really good music. It’s called Suno. With a (unfortunately paid) subscription, you can write as many lyrics as you want, then drop a large handful of descriptors and make entire songs out of the several 30-second clips you made. It’s fantastic, to say the least.

As a musician, here’s what Suno makes me realize: Becoming successful in the music industry was NEVER about your talent or how “good” your music is. A song being enjoyable in general has NEVER been about the skill level involved, or even the effort. There could be a simple rudimentary song that’s just 2 notes the entire time, and someone who hasn’t heard much of the genre (like a kid) really might fall in love with the song just because it was played a lot in their childhood or during their favorite holiday vacation.

I mean, we’ve been subjected to effortless art all our lives. Someone like Lil Pump could come through saying “Gucci Gang” 30 times and suddenly he’s rewarded for the rest of his life. His success wasn’t for how amazing his lyrics were, or how deep and sentimental. It was about the context and the freedom of expression, both being entertaining. Lil Pump simply did not give a fuck, just wanted to find a random beat to have some mindless fun with, and now he’s a recognized artist mainly because either enough people heard it, or people heard it enough. 

Maybe I sound very nihilistic and cynical rn, but I’m still gonna make organic music of course! In fact, this AI program gives me a ton of ideas that I’d rather work with from scratch. But I have to admit that Suno is actually very fulfilling for me. I have to admit it’s fun and fairly precise, so much so that it’s a **useful program** when I want to make some random music for fun.

I spent hours generating a single 3-minute song last night that gradually transformed from a really fun dance track to a sentimental piano ballad that actually made me cry a little just because the whole song made so much sense and created a journey of an experience. Yeah, believe it or not, it turns out that a pretty melody is a pretty melody no matter where it came from. My meaningful human lyrics are still human and meaningful even when a robot is singing them. Maybe YOU don’t think it sounds human enough, but I do. Leave me alone to rejoice with those who agree instead of bringing your negativity brigade.

Oh wait sorry, you have the right to freedom of speech so everybody needs to hear your opinion.🙄 Can’t wait to get berated by AI haters for being uncreative or lazy for liking my own AI album when I literally spent days crafting the concept, writing ALL the lyrics, tweaking the beats perfectly to my taste, curating and arranging sections of the songs in Ableton, mixing and mastering the damn thing… 🙄🙄 You’re such a good person for telling me my artistic expression is meaningless with no soul just because I used a program to make the process incredibly easy. 🙄🙄🙄🙄

I’m tired of getting told i’m a shit person just because I like AI art, so i’m making this post to put my foot down and straight-up say: If you think it’s LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE for AI to create anything “truly creative” then you’re just wrong because AI is not the creator in the first place. AI is a tool used by humans, and any tool used by humans is bound to be applied in a creative fashion.

Man, I hope one day I can generate Pulp Fiction 2 just to piss these luddites off. 

#PART TWO

Note! For the thousandth time, just because I like being able to make a rock song without a band does NOT mean I am advocating for the theft of graphic design jobs, or the streamlining of hollywood movies, or the downfall of every musician in favor of robot-dominated billboard charts. For some reason when I say “generated art is okay” it’s like people assume I’m implying “the exploitative utility behind this new technology is fantastic”.

Outside of what HUMANS are doing — *Not AI*, but outside of what shitty, privileged rich people with too much power in the industry of art are doing, programs like Dall-E and Suno are beautifully beneficial for society.

I don’t think AI haters realize just how much people have always wanted to be free to do things they don’t have the time, energy, or skill for. As a musician for 12+ years myself, I’ve always been frustrated at peers who say “yeah i would love to get started in piano/guitar/drawing/filming because i have so many ideas” … but when the time comes to put in the work, guess what? They’d simply rather not. It’s much easier to just smoke weed, watch youtube, or doom-scroll all day.

I believe we should reach a point where making meaningful personalized artistic experiences is an easier method of casual entertainment than doomscrolling. It’s frustrating that people are shaming us for making art easily. A lot of people really don’t even have hobbies or skills at all, so let them get any of the fulfillment they can, right? Human-created art will never go extinct and probably won’t ever be unpopular either.

I mean think about it: When someone’s too lazy to play sports, we don’t clown them for having fun with their NBA 2k24 gameplay clips. When someone’s too lazy or uncreative to play piano, we don’t clown people for using digital piano software. YET there *was* a time where I heard people say music made in Ableton or FL Studio was not real music because it wasn’t “human enough”. 

Even I was one of those people pissed at how some folks can get famous off of cheap beats from their iPhone’s Garageband while [I’ve made entire albums from scratch all for nothing](https://solace-music.bandcamp.com). Then I realized I just had to accept that **the skill floor has simply been raised**. That’s what I’m seeing again with AI.

I don’t think it’s unfair that musicians have to compete with AI music now - I mean, it’s only motivation for artists to be better. You think everyone stopped playing chess just because AI can outplay humans sometimes? Obviously not, because playing chess is still fun as hell.

I’m sure there’s a lot of unforeseen consequences that AI will bring, as all new technology does. But the only obvious and slightly important detriment I can see, *that is actually due to the nature of it’s existence and not just your personal gripe*, is that AI software can only work if it collects information about all the art in the world. So yeah, it is basically trained to copy the techniques and concepts of actually-human artists. However my counterpoint is that, like humans, being influenced by everything it sees does not cause a software to *exclusively* push out knockoffs and ripoffs. So the fact that an AI portrait of my wife might accidentally look like a picture of the Mona Lisa does not bother me much because I can just throw it out and generate a more unique one. It’s possible to make something unique with AI art. It just is. I promise you. 

#ENDING

At this point i’m rambling, but the last most important things I’ll say are: 

**It’s kinda funny how y’all want to protect the sanctity of human effort and innovation, but you realize it’s okay for people to sit back and just enjoy Call of Duty 12: Modern Warfare 3: The Remake.** My point is, if franchises with sequelitis can thrive and flourish, then I don’t feel so bad for my generated song not *absolutely* being a historical benchmark in the progress of our contemporary artistic standards.

**It’s funny how y’all are so concerned about the sanctity of human creativity when, for the most part, artificial intelligence EXPANDS the entire idea of creativity.** Again, the skill floor is just higher now. If you want to learn how to play piano so you could put it in a song, that’s completely respectable and even admirable in my opinion. On the other hand, I already know piano very well and SOMETIMES i’m tired after work, so I’d rather just have a computer play it while I go take a shit. 

I already know I could literally play any melody in the entire world if I really wanted to, unless it’s some unhumanly complex sound or something, sooo… why should I have to? Just because a resume of proven talents is your requirement for being entertained? Okay buddy 🙄

And listen, this is my favorite part: Not only can a disabled person now make music all by themselves, right? Not only can an untalented and depressed middle schooler vent out their feelings by turning their diary entry into a jazz ballad… but **ALSO, now hip-hop producers are completely free to explore an infinite amount of melodies to sample, without any fear of copyright.**

Alright, that’s all I have to say. I fear what is going to happen next. Lol.

0,2024-04-08,CMV: Technical level workers should be required to contribute to vocational schools.,u/SimplePoint3265,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bzcsyz/cmv_technical_level_workers_should_be_required_to/,changemyview,"There should be a mandatory contribution to be deducted (such as 1%) from work income and allocated to a professional school of the worker's choice (it could be a high school or polytechnic). Even though it is expected that the worker will choose the school from which he graduated. The idea is to reward professional schools for their role in training qualified labor, so that the professional success of their former students brings financial resources in the same proportion. This would provide a natural incentive for these institutions to do the best they can in in relation to the quality of training. For example, well-trained students will get jobs and relocate to the job market more quickly, as well as have better salaries. All of this will translate into greater financial returns for the professional school. An observation to be made is that former students, if they understand that the quality of the training offered was less than necessary, and their positions in the job market are essentially due to themselves, they can allocate the contribution money to another professional school of your choice. Emphasizing that the contribution mentioned would basically be the profit of the professional schools. And like all profits, it is the oil that makes the gears work. As for funding the operation of professional schools, it could be done with resources from the general public budget, to be transferred in the form of vouchers for each enrollment made"
242,2024-04-08,"CMV: If your content is promoted with sexual context, you can't fault people for viewing it/you for that reason and having that be your audience",u/FormerBabyPerson,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bze3oq/cmv_if_your_content_is_promoted_with_sexual/,changemyview,"I started using Instagram again and I'm sure if you use it too you will notice something regarding any popular creator in a saturated genre. One thing could be expertise: You watch someone because they have some kind of credentials and now what they're talking in regards to their subjects. Another thing can be humor: maybe they don't have the expertise to say anything different from information you can get from any other creator, but they present it in a funny way. Some people just put tons and tons of money into ads and promotion so you have no choice but to see them. Another thing is sexual content. I see this when creators where use their body and sexually suggestive content to build their audience. 

I've seen some males do this but biggest example would be female fitness influencers. They are able to grow their audience quickly because although they are usually giving out very basic advice, sometimes terrible advice that's outdated or dangerous, they also make sure they wear the skimpiest clothes and make sure the angle always focuses on their ass. Or a female real estate agent who starts every video of with a close up of her ass walking into the house in a skimpy dress or a woman who does 'comedy' but makes sure her cleave is perfectly in frame and is angled to show it off. 

Now obviously I know someone will get into semantics about 'what is and isn't considered sexual' this is a fair point. Sometimes innocent things get taken out of context, but as adults I think if we're having a good faith discussion we know the difference between something being taking out of context and something being intentionally suggestive. 

To continue, I've seen two different general responses to this. The first is that the actual creator will get defensive about this and insult the audience they have attracted. One creator made a video complaining that once she stopped wearing revealing things, her subscribers significantly dropped because males starting unfollowing her. The second is where other female commenter will insult the men who are commenting on the video responding to the sexual content when the creator just eggs it on.

So i think if your content is held up by sexualization, there's not valid complaint to be mad because you went for the low hanging fruit and that's the audience you curated with the content you've created, just like any other content creator."
0,2024-04-08,CMV: Employment of south Asians by GCC countries such as Qatar is overall positive for both parties,u/Ledezala,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bzed8p/cmv_employment_of_south_asians_by_gcc_countries/,changemyview,"I am a British citizen with mixed Asian origin, I have lived most of my life in UK, but lived one year in Saudi Arabia and now living in Qatar. 

I believe this anti GCC narrative of these countries being built by ""slavery"" is heavily influenced by propaganda and political beliefs and complete lack of understanding and misinformation about these migrant workers. 

What you have to first understand is why are the migrant workers in the situation they are in, and as we all know, a large part of this is due to western colonialism. Western powers invaded highly prosperous nations and depleted their resources and left them in ruin and poverty with decreased opportunities for the poor. I am not talking about this as point of moral highground because of the past, but about the present. What programs have westerns nations established that employ low skilled workers from such countries? Programs to increase social mobility? Programs to reverse atleast a little bit of damage they have caused? Instead they employ highly skilled workers for their own gain and a net loss for these countries. 

I have talked to many migrant workers in the GCC, they are happy here, they've been given a legitimate chance to escape poverty, their salaries are atleast 3x what they would get back home for the same work in harsher conditions. Most of them send money back home to their families allowing their children to get higher education and better paying jobs, down here in Qatar they are offered world class healthcare by UK/US trained physicians. They have fulfillment. Compared to the families in poverty back home who have a bleak outlook with no hopes of improvement and few opportunities to ever get out of poverty and daily concerns such as food and health and a roof. 

I agree that there have been many huge mistakes in the treatment of workers such as kafala system and I'm not justifying them, instead I am happy that there have been many reforms and improvements such as minimum wage etc. But to argue that these employment programs are inherently evil and completely predatory and lead to ""slavery"" is blatant exaggeration and a classic case of western hypocrisy where these countries put other nations in terrible circumstances, offer no solutions, and when other solutions are offered, they only highlight the negatives.

Nope.  
  
Not at all.  
  
The consensus was that ""nothing in the news matters.""  
  
There was one ""big"" thing that was stressing out this group of university students: **Social media and its influence on dating.**  
  
Aside from the four or five students already in long-term relationships, she said the class was perfectly divided between the guys and girls.  
  
Every guy in the class, even the two popular ones on the hockey team, said: ""I'm honestly afraid I'm going to die alone. You can hardly get a date and then no one wants to commit to an actual relationship.""  
  
Every girl in the class said: ""I'm afraid that I'll miss out on someone better, so being in a relationship stresses me out.""  
  
My wife even asked them what they meant by ""better"" and was told, ""better looking, more money, more followers on social media.""  
  
She was absolutely floored by how shameless everyone was in admitting these these things, but all the kids also admitted that it was 100% due to social media and they wished they could go back to dating before the apps.

It’s being committed because there’s a state who claims to represent you and your struggle and they want more land and they want to kill the indigenous people so that they have access to the land. If that’s going on, you absolutely should be using your voice to speak up against the genocide. Whether you think Israel does or does not have the right to exist, you can’t possibly agree that they have the right to commit *genocide*. 

It’s not antisemitic to think that Jews, especially Jews in America and Europe, have a responsibility to speak out against this genocide. Men have a responsibility to hold toxic men accountable, white people a responsibility to do it with white supremacists, and really, everyone with their community. So if Israel commits a genocide to “defend” the Jews, why shouldn’t there be an expectation for Jews to denounce that genocide?"

I am here to argue that if the current voting system was changed to ranked choice, all of America's issues would be significantly lessened, because I think one of the main fundamental issues with this democracy is the lack of options.

I think most Americans feel like they only have 2 options: the bad one and the worse one. But if ranked choice voting was used, there would be no risk of 'throwing away' your vote if you vote for a more niche party, which allows for more options, more solutions, and of course, less polarization, because more options mean more moterate options and less of a 'red team or blue team' kind of mindset."

I usually need to buy suits and formal items in a larger size than I’d buy a T-shirt or a hoodie because the shops are making casual clothes baggy now (as a result of fashion change) whilst suits are made to actually fit.

0,2024-04-08,Cmv: Being gay is a mental health disease,u/moneyloser10,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bzgff2/cmv_being_gay_is_a_mental_health_disease/,changemyview,"I'm not against the LGB community. I believe they should not be discriminated. I think they can marry each other and adopt kids. They should have the same rights as normal people, but our government and other institution should not promote this community. 

Why do I think that?

Their motto states ""Love is love"". A man can love another man and a woman can love another woman (spiritually and sexually). But why should we not include people who love kids or animals (zoofilia actually exists) following this logic? Because pedophilia and zoophilia are both considered mental health diseases, so is in my opinion being gay. But the difference is that a pedophile might hurts a kid, while a gay person just loves another of the same sex and it is not dangerous for society. That is why gays are widely accepted in our society. However, our nature and our final goal, besides seeking happiness, is to have children. This would not possible with people of the same sex.  The normality and thus the nature of the human being is to be attracted to the opposite sex. Furthermore, you are not born gay because otherwise there would be a biological connection, which has not yet been discovered. You become a pedophile. You become gay. The factors that influnce this state of ""slight mental illness"" are unknown, but I could bet that hearing of it everyday can impact people. This why it should not be allowed pushing LGB propaganda, simply because it can have negative effects on mental health, mostly of young people. 

So, despite not being harmful like pedophile, I believe that gay people have a little mental health issue, it could be called a fetish, that nevertheless prevents them from having children. This is why I am pro adoption (also because saving a kids life is more important that having gay parents).

0,2024-04-08,"CMV: It is possible for AI-generated art to deserve respect, and it should be allowed to exist.",u/solace1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bzgwt7/cmv_it_is_possible_for_aigenerated_art_to_deserve/,changemyview,"For some reason when I say “generated art is okay” it’s like people assume I’m implying “the exploitative utility behind this new technology is fantastic”. The whole topic of AI is incredibly stigmatized to the point where **there are several times I've seen dozens of people come to one post just to tell OP they're a piece of shit, that they're soulless, that they should delete the expression they posted.** I've even seen some very impulsive uninformed hate towards AI in real life, too. **So please let me clarify: My point is not that all AI art is amazing and you have to like it or stay quiet. My point is that people are literally becoming bigoted towards anyone who likes AI to the extent that they're advocating for ALL of it to be shamed and discouraged from society.**   


It's such a popular sentiment that I really feel like I NEED to know what I'm missing that is the cause of my disagreement. All this vitriol against something as simple as a picture of a kitten racing a horse just doesn't feel right, but nearly everyone I know seems to think it is.  


I discovered a program recently called Suno. Long story short, you can spend an entire day directing a song to sound almost exactly how you want it to sound with little effort. It's incredible. Not only is it fun, but it's impressively precise when you get a paid subscription. After spending several hours on a 3-minute song and listening to the whole thing, I enjoyed it all so much that I cried because the ending resonated with me in a certain way. I'M NOT SAYING THAT MEANS IT'S A GOOD SONG, but I am saying I love it. I'm telling you this AI song has the ability to emotionally resonate with *at least one person*. No one can take away the fact that this piece of art wouldn't exist without my human experience. Nor can they say it's a fact that I put no effort into it. I wrote ALL the lyrics, spent almost an entire day directing the instrumental, mixing and mastering it and arranging all the sections in Ableton. Just because I didn't put as much effort into it as much as Kendrick Lamar did for TPAB does not mean it was easy to make something that I *really really* liked.  


# Here are my main points as to why there's no need treat the concept of AI Art as an attack on the human race:

1) **Art was never about talent or effort or skill.** Most people like art because it feels good. There could be a song with only two notes the entire time and any human might fall in love with it if they get comfortable enough with it inadvertently playing often throughout their childhood, or during a special period in their lives. A lot of artists don't even write their own lyrics or instrumentals, that doesn't mean the artists who do are completely exiled from the music industry. In fact, it's so silly to pretend that AI art will replace real art when we all know there are several human things that AI simply can't do. I understand you'd like to exercise your freedom of speech to tell someone their artistic expression is garbage. I'm just saying you don't have to encourage of the non-existence. But just because an art piece didn't take as much skill and time as To Pimp A Butterfly, doesn't mean it shouldn't exist, right?  Like, whether we're talking about AI or not.

2) **AI art software is objectively beneficial for society**. That's how most powerful new tech goes. Many people have told me ""I really want to get into drawing/singing/playing piano, because I have so many ideas!"" Then when I sit them down to actually do anything, guess what? They'd rather go back to doom-scrolling. For 2024 and beyond, not only will Suno and Dall-E only get better at lowering the skill floor of art for regular people in a way to let us make detailed yet easy art that feels human... but ALSO artistic expression is now incredibly easy for the disabled. It's a whole game changer for someone who's mute and would like to have a voice, right? You can't make someone else say absolutely anything you want like with AI. The only real issue that arises from the nature of AI's existence and not from the fault of human beings, is the fact that it can only work by copying the techniques and concepts of human art. But even *that* concern is relieved when you realize that, just like with humans, AI is not going to always rip off everything it sees just because it's talent is influenced by everything it sees. Even if it did rip something off, do you think that's what the devs want? No. So it's only gonna happen less. Psh, You might notice that even without AI, we will still have the human unoriginality that leads to Call of Duty 12: Modern Warfare 3: 2: part 4: the movie. This leads to me to my last point....  


3) **AI art is human.** I swear AI tech is the most natural next step for artistic technology. Like c'mon, let's not play pretend. I'm willing to bet every single person reading this knows at least ONE person who has always wanted to make a movie without going to film school, or worrying about the budget, finding who to cast, etc. No matter what, an AI's output is always the result of human input. Humans made AI, humans made the data that AI bases it's algorithm on, and all we need to do now is learn how to get even MORE control over the output than the impressive amount of control we already have. This AI song has vocals singing lyrics that *I* wrote, over a beat that *I* directed in 10-second increments. I think it's completely fair to say my AI song is not 100% organic or human, but to say that it's completely soulless with no potential for emotional expression or human connection is ridiculous. It's at least, like, 1% human so I'mma call it human.  


ANYTHING that can be entertaining can be emotionally connected with on a human level.  
**CONCLUSION**  
I think as a human society we're just having a hard time coming to terms with the fact that music is all just a bunch of math at the end of the day. We took one of the biggest things that make us special and unique as a species, and removed a large chunk of the mystique and hardship around it. It seems that most people think art is basically on life support just because some of it won't be made 100% by humans from now on.  


That's my take. I'm 100% willing to listen to other perspectives.

0,2024-04-08,CMV: I should not go to therapy,u/Flat_Goose_8780,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bzi3oz/cmv_i_should_not_go_to_therapy/,changemyview,"How to drop my prejudice towards therapy?

I'm sorry if it's the wrong sub to talk about this. I posted it on r/offmychest, r/depression and r/therapy but got very few replies.

About therapy: I want to do it. I want to actually engage in it. I find the idea great in theory. But I have tried it in the past a few times (admittedly, for only a couple weeks at a time) and it always left me disappointed, in more than one way. I have severe distrust of therapy. 

For one, I believe they do a great harm to society by taking away mental pain that is externally caused. This is detrimental to solve collective issues. ""Societal problem X doesn't have to be dealt with by me, because I can cope with it existing"". I believe this happens way too often, and that is terrible. One such societal problem that it helps people tolerate is commercialization of something very similar to friendship - therapy itself.

Second, I believe therapists don't care enough to help in a meaningful way. They're there to do a job, to pay bills, to secure their retirement. Most are not there for fun. As with any job, some days you don't wanna be there, but you have to, and can have a bad day on the job. I personally would rather not see a single day of indifference than get 300 of full attention. They also will probably never tell me what they really think of me, and that is a constant feeling I have a hard time processing as well.

Third, they don't really know you, they know the you you talk about there. They don't know you like an old friend, or a family member. They don't have enough information to understand you the same way people who are closer to you can. Why should I not invest the time in my friends over this person every week?

Fourth, I believe they will too often bring psychiatrists and medication into the mix. Fuck that. Not only will that shit change you, some will even get you addicted. Again, it takes away mental pain that not only is internally caused, but externally caused too. A sedated person is easy to control. Artificial tranquility is harmful. Not to mention the corporations that make many of these meds are run by plain cruel people. Very powerful and influential people who benefit from your suffering, from you accepting that you need to take them to get some mental relief, for only 50 bucks a month.

Fifth, and my weakest argument, is that I can't see what a therapist can say that will help me deal with what is rotten in my life. I can only see them saying things that are futile or that I have already tried. This is easy to attempt to disprove, as there is an infinite number of sentences that can be said - though it is in practice limited by the time it takes to convey this infinite collection of sentences, so maybe they can find something. I doubt it, but that's just my opinion.

If I am able to kill two or three of these beliefs, I might be able to enjoy some benefits from it. But until then, I remain out of the therapist's office. I'm going through some really, really tough shit, as is the crushing majority of people, and I really want to be convinced. 

Any and all thoughts are appreciated."
0,2024-04-08,CMV: The USSR had a better housing model than the United States,u/Beneficial_Novel9263,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bzinpw/cmv_the_ussr_had_a_better_housing_model_than_the/,changemyview,"Note: This argument is probably going to be different than what you'd expect, so if you don't read it than your response will probably not be applicable.

So, basically, markets are at the root of prosperity. No markets? Well, have fun staying poor.

Despite this, I would say the USSR had a much better housing policy than the US does, specifically during the Khrushchev era. This is for a pretty simple reason. While the USSR had a centrally planned housing economy, it was at least dedicated to creating housing stock. However, in America, our housing market incorporates much of the worst elements of central planning, but with the explicit goal of limiting housing stock.

Most of the problem stems from zoning laws (but plenty of other land use regulations are important, as well). These laws essentially have central planners determine what type of buildings are allowed to be constructed in certain areas, typically in ways that limit/ban more dense and economically efficient housing. This is primarily because homeowners are leeches who want to artificially inflate their home values rather than, idk, put money into a 401k. Other reasons are liking their gaudy McMansions or wanting to price out poor people and black people, but artificially inflated their home values by limiting supply is the biggest factor. While the market is involved in things like construction, the fact that central planners artificially limit the housing stock basically makes the American model the worst of state planning and markets in one dogshit package.

The Soviet model seems to have largely avoided this issue. Sure, Soviet housing was dogshit, but that is because the Soviet Union was a shitpoor country due to central planning. If the US maintained itself as a market economy in all ways other respects, then adopting a Soviet model would get rid of the incentive to rent-seek by limiting supply, while our prosperity means it would be much better than the commieblock cementshit of the USSR.

Would it be better to just get rid of the central planners all together and let the market build housing? Sure, that is as much of a fantasy as the hypothetical I am presenting here. We are stuck with the current model, so its fun to think about how it would compare to others, even though we will never have them."

0,2024-04-09,CMV: Conservative social views will never “win” longterm and should be given up,u/astronautmyproblem,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bzjumh/cmv_conservative_social_views_will_never_win/,changemyview,"When it comes to social views, conservatives and traditionalists are fighting a lost cause and should give up. I mean this for practicality sake: they will never win long term against humanism and are wasting their time.

I’m not saying it will be immediate or that there won’t be ebbs and flows, moments when conservative views win out (such as abortion laws in the US right now). But overall, denying people freedom that isn’t harming anyone else / pushing for laws that DO hurt some people, will never win out because it’s a fundamentally unappealing view.

Conservative social views tend to all go through the path of being praised, accepted, challenged, replaced, frowned upon, and then considered repugnant.

For example, slavery. It went through all of those stages, and now we’re at the point where supporting slavery in its clearest forms is repugnant. I believe that in the future, it’s inevitable that more insidious / subtle forms of slavery will follow suit (US prison system, etc).

Another example is women’s rights. Many countries are pushing into the “denying women’s basic humanity is repugnant” category.

I believe that every social issue (which doesn’t directly harm others) will follow this path. LGBTQ rights. Child rights. Animal rights. Even issues such as abortion. Non-humanist / conservative views that are considered “accepted” today will in the future be considered “repugnant.” I believe this to be so obviously inevitable, that I find it not only silly but a waste of time when people cling to conservative views.

I’d be curious to learn if there are any anti-humanist social trends that seem to have definitively / conclusively lost once challenged. For example, if there was something akin to the gay rights movement that just was completely abandoned with the conservative view winning out. Is there an example of when the pattern I described hasn’t held up?

I see the biggest counter to this being capitalism—that money might make conservative views last longer, but even then, I don’t think it’ll stop the flow of progress.  

Maybe there’s a “down with the ship” argument to be made of why to stick to conservative beliefs, but based on trends (these views going from praised to repugnant), isn’t it obviously a losing battle? And is there even merit to entertaining conservative social views when we know where the ship is going?"

Still, he is pretty moderate and sometimes can do even left-wing moves. This thread will get downvotes probably but I'd like to offer a different perspective:

In 1996, Netanyahu was elected after promising to make a ""safe peace"". Netanyahu met with Arafat eventually

[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Flickr\_-\_Government\_Press\_Office\_%28GPO%29\_-\_P.M.\_BENJAMIN\_NETANYAHU\_SHAKING\_HANDS\_WITH\_PALESTINIAN\_AUTHORITY\_CHAIRMAN\_YASSER\_ARAFAT.jpg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Flickr_-_Government_Press_Office_%28GPO%29_-_P.M._BENJAMIN_NETANYAHU_SHAKING_HANDS_WITH_PALESTINIAN_AUTHORITY_CHAIRMAN_YASSER_ARAFAT.jpg)

Bibi called Arafat his ""partner for peace""

Bibi later signed the Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron. His coalition was mad at him and threatened to take down his government. He was criticized by his right-wing supporters. Netanyahu then continued the peace process and signed Wye River Memorandum which expanded Oslo. Bibi even broke the law trying to sign the Hebron agreements 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-On%E2%80%93Hebron\_affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-On%E2%80%93Hebron_affair)

Netanyahu voted four times to disengage from Gaza

After returning to power in 2009, Netanyahu froze settlement construction which again made him criticised by his right-wing supporters 

[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna34151442](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna34151442)

In the Bar Ilan speech, Netanyahu agreed to the 2 state solution 

[https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/address-by-pm-netanyahu-at-bar-ilan-university-14-jun-2009](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/address-by-pm-netanyahu-at-bar-ilan-university-14-jun-2009)

Netanyahu said in 2015: ""I have not given up on peace. I remain committed to a vision of peace based on two states for two peoples,"" Netanyahu said at the time. The chairman of the Likud even went above and beyond when he called on the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Abu Mazen, to come and speak in the Israeli Knesset. ""President Abbas - I invite you to speak to the Israeli people in the Knesset, in Jerusalem, and I would be happy to speak to the Palestinian people in Ramallah.""

[https://www.jewishpost.com/news/netanyahu-takes-nyc.html](https://www.jewishpost.com/news/netanyahu-takes-nyc.html)

During Obama's tenure (During the tenures of both Clinton and Kerry as secretaries of state), Netanyahu entered into a political process with the Palestinian Authority and was ready to make concessions that endangered his coalition with the right. 

(Bibi started to strengthen Hamas only in 2019. Before that he was fairly pragmatic towards the peace process)"

And that men and women are distinctively different and complementary; men need women and women need men to truly function properly.  And that what we call nuclear families are vital in order for human civilization to advance and stay intact. 

These aspects of Christian doctrine are going to be inherently problematic and downright offensive and insulting for those who want to take progressivism past a certain limit."

But I have recently concluded that all the arguments given against the age gap relationships involving consenting adults are really bad.

Before diving into anything I want to clarify something: obviously as an admittedly flawed person who tries to be good, I am against any relationship that harms people. So I am only and solely talking about relationships where there are two consenting adults who abide by the law and are interested in each other. 

Now let me dive into commonly given arguments and try to offer counter-arguments.

1) THE RED FLAG ARGUMENT
This argument usually states that it is a bad sign to see an older man with a younger woman because there are supposedly sinister reasons for why the man would be rejecting people his age and settling for a younger girl. This argument sucks because A) an older man might just find younger (legally adult) girls more physically attractive than people his own age. There is nothing inherently harmful with having a personal beauty preference. And B) dating is hard. If an older man happened to hit it off with a younger girl in todays world it might be insane for him to hope that an older woman shows up later. In any case, who are we to tell him he has to wait?


2) LIFE EXPERIENCE ARGUMENT
This argument usually states that at different ages people are at different stages of life experience, and thus it’s (for reasons unknown to me) wrong for someone at a more advanced stage of life experience to be with someone with less. This argument sucks because A) it assumes that people move across life the same way. Plenty of people, for example, join the army and start college later. Let’s assume that someone joined the army and had his first year in college at 28. Now let’s assume that as a third year at 30 he meets a second year classmate who is 19. If they hit it off, why should an internet Karen’s opinion or experience matter? B) There is no good reason given as to what specifically in differences between life experiences would cause harm.


3) YOUNG AND NAIVE ARGUMENT
This argument usually states that someone who is 18 is chemically or behaviourally immature to be able to detect whether an older man is manipulating her. This argument sucks because it’s a general disenfranchisement argument. It’s conclusion is not that the age gap relationship is bad, but that 18 year olds are stupid in general and can’t be trusted to take care of themselves. This argument is in direct opposition to most western legal experts who believe that 18 is more than enough for a person who is not otherwise disabled to make adult decisions. At any rate, the conclusion of the argument should be about raising the general age of consent, which is unrelated to the age gap thing.

I'm all for helping end the systemic wealth gap between white men and POC, but this is simply too much too fast. The corporations are creating an environment where young white men entering the workforce have no options left for them. 94% is *cartoonishly discriminatory*. In my mind, anyone who supports diversity hiring to this level of extremity is actively supporting the economic displacement and impoverishment of an entire group of people, that being young white men who are just now entering the workforce to find out that *94% of jobs will not be give to them*

This should be as socially acceptable as women having abortions, in fact it should be more acceptable.  Because when a woman has an abortion, it means the father can't have the child. In this system the mother still keeps the child.

There should be a time limit on when you can abandon like there is for abortion. You could make it the same time as abortion, from birth, or even from the 2nd year because memories haven't formed. I'm not sure which would be best.

Some people were genuinely born into unfair situations or unfair lives yet if you express the desire to end your life, people pretend to care and tell you to call a hotline that’s going to put you on hold for like 15 minutes and probably just call the police on you, and everyone knows cops are sooooo good at de-escalating. 

I think those that are genuinely struggling financially, mentally, or physically with their health (like me who falls into these categories. Financially struggling, mental issues, loneliness and no friends, autoimmune diseases and too much pain to work but my government refuses to approve me for disability.) should have the choice to end it if they wish without people trying to guilt them using things like “your family” “these problems are temporary” for some of us these problems are long term.

0,2024-04-09,CMV: Jesus is not enlightened.,u/ImposterModAmongUs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bztsoc/cmv_jesus_is_not_enlightened/,changemyview,"Jesus is not enlightened. In fact, in the Western world enlightenment has been very rare. People have not worked for enlightenment, people have remained part of organized religion. And enlightenment needs a rebellious spirit so that you come out of all organized religions; you drop everything that has been taught to you, and you start looking within yourself for the truth of your being.

Jesus is not a meditator – how can he become enlightened? He has not even taken the first step. He prays – and there is a tremendous difference between prayer and meditation.

Prayer is directed towards a mythological God, a fiction. Prayer is always directed outward. Meditation is an inward journey, not to some fiction but to your own reality. Enlightenment happens to those who come to realize their being.

Jesus is still praying to a God, thinking still that he is the only begotten son of God – that proves him just to be a crackpot – thinking that after crucifixion God will raise him again, more luminous, glorious. But on the cross nothing happens. He is thirsty and he asks for water, and God cannot even give him a bottle of Coke. Frustrated, he shouts towards the sky, “Father, have you forsaken me?” The very word “father” shows that he is still a helpless child, he is not a mature person. He still needs a father figure, and is afraid perhaps the father has forsaken him. But now it is too late – he is crucified.

Jesus thinks that he is the savior. No enlightened person has ever said that he can save anybody; he can only share his experience. Then to save yourself or not is your business. See the subtlety of the point: if somebody can save you, then even your being saved is not your freedom, it is dependent. What kind of saving is it?

Not a single enlightened man – Bodhidharma, Chuang Tzu, Basho, Nagarjuna – has ever said that he is a savior. All that he can say is, “I am saved, and I have an experience which you don’t have. If you are ready to share it with me, I can open my whole heart to you.” And then it is your decision to be saved or not saved.

Nobody can save someone who does not want to be saved. And if somebody wants to be saved, he has to find the way himself.

The enlightened person is just like a bird: he flies into the sky but leaves no footprints. You cannot follow him; you can simply see the joy, the freedom – that the whole sky is available to him.

Perhaps that may awaken in you a desire also. Perhaps for the first time you will find that you also have wings. And if that bird can fly, why can’t you fly? The function of the enlightened person is just to create the milieu in which you become aware of your wings, you become aware of your potentialities.

Jesus is not doing that. He is the shepherd and you are the sheep. No man has insulted humanity in such a way as Jesus has done. Enlightened people don’t humiliate; in fact, they respect you because they can see your potential – if not today, then tomorrow you will be flying. If not tomorrow, then the day after tomorrow.

Time does not matter, because we are part of eternity. On both ends it is eternity. Time does not matter. When you start flying has no significance; flying has significance.

But to tell you, “I am the shepherd and you are the sheep,” is to destroy your individuality, is to destroy your freedom, is to destroy your integrity; is to destroy everything that is valuable, is to reduce you from human beings to animals. An enlightened person raises you, helps you to rise to super-human beings. He does not make you sheep.

No, Jesus was not enlightened. In fact, in the Judaic and Christian tradition the orthodox have never been enlightened. Amongst Jews, there have been a few enlightened people, but they are not accepted by the orthodox Jews. Those are the Hassids – rare and really genuine people. But the orthodox will not accept them…and they are the only beauty that Judaism has created. The very flowering of Judaism is Hassidism, but it is rejected.

The enlightened person is bound to be rejected by every tradition. In Greek tradition you will hear about Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, and so many other philosophers; but you will rarely see Heraclitus mentioned as an enlightened man, or Pythagoras, or even Socrates. But these are the people…. But the very word “enlightenment” does not exist in the Greek traditions.

The same is true in Mohammedanism. Mohammed is not enlightened, and the orthodox tradition of Mohammedans rejects Sufi mystics who are enlightened: Jalaluddin Rumi, al-Hillaj Mansoor, Sarmad, Rabiya al-Adabiya. These people are not part of the traditional religion. They are rejected, condemned. The same has been true all over the world.

From mislabeling photos of Syrian children as Palestinian to baseless accusations of sexual abuse of Palestinian women by the IDF, and extreme claims of executions and organ harvesting, the misinformation aimed at demonizing Israel is overwhelming.  
  
I have no doubt that it all just fuels a pre-existing bias.  
  
People will readily accept narratives that reaffirm their already established views, but sometimes I simply cannot understand how people can be so easily influenced by the media.  
  
Particularly concerning are people who listen to outlets like the Middle East Eye, which produced a propaganda video attempting to depict Hamas in a humane light, by selectively editing an interview with Agam Goldstein-Almog and omitting her accounts of meeting five girls, most of whom had been raped, shared in that same interview.  
  
The Middle East Monitor, which tried to claim a teenager, an Israeli Muslim, stabbing his own pregnant sister to death, was actually a ""settler stabbing a Palestinian woman."" https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20231130-pregnant-palestinian-woman-brutally-stabbed-in-the-city-of-lod/ https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/truth-or-fake/20231204-video-does-not-show-palestinian-woman-stabbed-by-israeli-settler  
  
Or Al Jazeera, which literally has Hamas operatives posing as journalists. https://twitter.com/Osint613/status/1756738233814208825?t=8u91dtFT3zEHnODy7f5SPw&s=19 has been pushing false narratives such as the ""500 dead"" in the Al Ahli hospital incident https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/gallery/2023/10/17/photos-an-israeli-air-raid-on-al-ahli-arab-hospital-kills-an-estimated-500 and the fabricated story about IDF soldiers raping Palestinian women in Al Shifa. https://www.jns.org/al-jazeera-deletes-fabrication-of-idf-rapes-in-gaza-hospital And if it wasn't already clear that they can't be trusted, they operate from Doha, Qatar, where Hamas leadership currently takes refuge.  
  
Current Palestinian myths I saw on this sub alone:  
  
1 - Claim: Israel is killing innocent Palestinians in the West Bank.  
  
Reality: No, no they do not: https://twitter.com/AdinHaykin1/status/1745536754466119932?t=k0oaMiHi7sNleMcWtpL5vQ&s=19  
  
2 - Claim: Palestinians in Gaza are starving.  
  
Reality: No, no they are not: https://twitter.com/imshin/status/1774840768248660015?t=04kLxrgGO19IlVeNgMAmuQ&s=19  
  
But it gets even worse than that; there are serious attempts to alter history as well.  
  
Amnesty International recently referred to a man who kidnapped someone, removed his eyes, castrated him, and then shot him in the chest as a ""writer,"" yet many still cite them as a credible source. https://twitter.com/amnesty/status/1777390873518489613?t=E2gs8-f5f4HTEsgeuj8\_zA&s=19  
  
CNN recently attempted to compare Barghouti, a terrorist who orchestrated mass murders and suicide bombings during the Second Intifada, to Mandela. https://twitter.com/guypbenson/status/1765749405938827709?t=9Z45Ci0EdRijpTpM\_CSzGg&s=19  
  
The world seems to have turned reality on its head, and it appears everyone accepts it unquestioningly.  
  
It's like finding yourself in a real-life version of George Orwell's ""1984,"" ""The party told you to reject the evidence infront of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command"". The overwhelming flood of misinformation aimed at Israel points to a deliberate, globally orchestrated campaign, likely with significant backing from places like Qatar.  
  
Approach every piece of information with a critical eye and great caution.

It's more effective and has less risk of misunderstanding. Most conflicts I've had has been due to indirect communication misunderstandings.

First off, he hasn't played in the Premier League- I'm sorry, you can't be called the GOAT if you haven't played in the best league in the world. Not only does he have fewer UCL titles than Ronaldo (3-5), but his supporting cast  was significantly stronger (Ronaldinho, Henry, Xavi, Iniesta, Neymar, Suarez). Only player Ronaldo played with who is in that class was Rooney. Not to mention, being the GOAT involves being at your best against the best competition and he has struggled against guys like Van Dijk, Terry, and Fernidad. Lastly, the Anfield disaster game automatically disqualifies him from the GOAT title, how can you let that happen and be considered the greatest of all time?!?!?! 

Anyway, posted here cause I'm sick and tired of people calling Messi the GOAT and I honestly can't understand why? Ok everyone points to the World Cup, but of his 7 goals 4 were penalties and that Argentina midfield was absolutely stellar, I don't think Messi played a key role in their World Cup tournament victory. Not to mention, I think the UCL is tougher to win than the World Cup and should be weighted more (I don't remember Salah or Haaland playing in this World Cup). To be the GOAT, you have to be clear head and shoulders the greatest to ever play, look at other sports: Brady, Jordan, Ruth, Gretzky, Phelps, Woods all have validated their GOAT status, Messi hasn't.

We should eliminate them and just be nice.",u/Deletdisnoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bzy9t4/cmv_labels_and_identities_have_been_unnecessary/,changemyview,"One of the things that has done more harm than good over the last few centuries has been the creation of new groups and identities, at this point purely for the sake of it. It was understood as an element of patrilineal descent in historical and anthropological context. Way back, you were part of a tribe. You protected your crops and family and territory, and warred against/took that of the other tribe's. This was how you understood your identity.

  
We have reached a point nowadays where territory and land is more or less fixed, but tribal identity has coalesced and made problems worse for humanity. 

  
There are obvious examples, like false racial classifications. Let's take gender problems instead.  
Over the past two decades we've seen an explosion of identity establishing itself and pushing through the mainstream. We now have paradoxically more readily acceptance of gender variance as we do opposition against them, and while alot of it comes from obvious religious indoctrination, I'd like to bring the tenants of gender rationalization and hysteria into question.

  
I'll get to the crux of the issue, gender in alot of ways is still very much rooted in gender essentialism. You have some innate 'essence' of being a boy or a girl, a male-ness or female-ness. This is the issue I take with the movement, it's an oddity that they share it completely with TERFs. The only thing they disagree on is whether someone of an assigned sex can possess that 'essence' or claim to have alway have. The whole idea that someone is a ""Man trapped in a woman's body."" 

  
There's no such thing. You are a brain and some organs inside, and your brain is not a man or a woman. It might have some sexualized features (genitals, specific brain regions, higher amounts of testerone/estrogen) but to a variety and frequency- you cannot find a definitive 'womans' brain or something anatomical like that. Even if you were an AFAB, I'd argue its false to even make a statement like ""I'm a woman trapped inside a woman's body"" because you are still making statements about anatomical destiny. I'm going to explore what this means for society and the implications metaphysically.

  
Societally, we want to be percieved a certain way. Strong, tough, sweet, sociable, chatty, aloof, and we want to be addressed in the manor we present ourselves as. This is what is known by Althusser as Interpellation. When people say your name, they're addressing you specifically, hailing you. When they say 'teacher', 'son', 'Sir', they're speaking to you with all sorts of expectations and assumptions. You refer to a doctor with  Interpellation because you assume, they are a trained professional and will act like one, and their history allows this mode of communication. A sender and a reciever. The issue comes when we have a metaphysics that tries to uphold false entities to uphold false values. On both ends this is wrong. 

  
Gender Identity for example, is purely a social construct. We could say its similar to being a teacher or a vegan, but outside of surgery it's only a construct held up by the sexism if gender essentialism (Sexes are 'different'). While what people do with their bodies is their own business, demanding to be treated as a certain 'gender' is sexist. I think people should be given respect and dignity, and the pronouns of their choice because language evolves thru custom. That's politeness. However demanding to be treated like a 'woman' because that's how you believe woman are treated, inevitably runs into sexist assumptions. You possess X so you should be seen as Y. How about no one possesses X so we shouldn't uphold Y at all? I wouldn't try to 'treat' a woman like a woman at all and one cannot answer what that means without biases, so why should I treat a transitioned woman like a woman? I'll treat you like a person thank you very much.

  
This is an arguement that TERFs often make similarly, but they make it in bad faith. They are against the sender reciever portion, but still uphold the sender aspect- that there is a 'womanly essence' they were born with, or were conditioned with, or exists somehow and they're privileged to. Some condition it on abuse and a universalized woman's experience, which as a generalization seems patently absurd.  The point is they'd deny a person the freedom to live the way they way they choose because they wish to monopolize and ingroup identity, which shouldn't exist.

  
And then from this we get a litany of other identities? Someone claiming they're 'nonbinary', so they may as well say they're beyond a man or woman. There is no scientific proof of this, neurologically. We could say, they're tired of gender roles so why not let them? But there's no construction that affirm this in reality, like you can be gender noncomforming and 'not' be Non-Binary. That's kind of what I'm getting at if you're confused- you can 'be' something without 'Being' it. The reason for this bloom in Interpellations, is these all seem to me like social modes of narcissistic due to the the Internet. We're so accustomed to seeing people as male or female that we feel anxiety when don't know whether that person is a certain sex, once anonymous. That's what this hyperfixation on pronouns seems to be compensating for.

  
On the other hand, I don't think repressive insistence on conformity or ingroup mentality is benefited from just, preventing people from exploring who they are. I am criticizing and questioning how identity exploration leads to identity tribalism. I'm against censorship and repression. Would all of society be better if we were white cisgendered heterosexuals that forced everyone else to be that too? I don't think so, and that same desire for it comes from a similar compulsion towards 'Ingroup' thinking. So what is the solution? As a radical idea, we should try to dissolve Ingroups in the positive and negative sense. We stop recognizing them and appeal to a more universal tolerance. Basically   


The positive meaning, we stop labeling and allowing narcissistic identities, while allowing for differences. You want to changeup your body and identity, fine. But you're not, you're just a women. There's no 'treating you like one' because we're already treating everyone with universal respect anyway. There's no Non-Binary, you can dress how you want, express yourself but metaphysically you're a person rather a label. There aren't 99 genders- there aren't even 2. The feminist ideal is equality right?  
The negative meaning, we remove discrimination aswell which is a sort of Ingroup-think aswell. Anyone caught signaling out aforementioned and treating them badly will be punished and met with repercussions.

  
We can extend this to Race even and it'd be beneficial, but in practice will be quite hard. The paradox of ingroup tolerance is to dissolve racial catagories and be truly race-blind, we'd need to remove barriers and discrimination first that exists which I admit is idealistic, same with any way of being. I acknowledge the impracticality of that since  But introducing more divisions and labels codifies discrimination and the tensions to combat said discrimination which is then never healed or fixed after.

  
The big label I think would be very to remove would be sexuality. Sexuality by its very nature isn't like gender, because while we can treat people egalitarian once gender is eliminated, sexuality is a form of interpellation prima facie. Sexuality helps people cut down on unsuitable matches and find potential partners, activities they enjoy and a huge aspect of how they might interact with others. Even falling on the Kinsey Scale of bisexuality, removing sexual labels would be a nuisance. I am however abit nuanced that all these additional sexual labels need to go, because they are kind of meaningless- Like calling someone a graysexual, a Demisexual, Omnisexual, Alloerotic, because many of these don't mean anything? They seem to refer to different shades of bi/pansexual which fair enough, weirdly don't seem to acknowledge the very vast and varied amount of sexual practices that exist outside of 'identity'. But this goes towards my critique, the terminiology right now is entirely stacked with this idea of inherent metaphysical entities inside the psyche/mind/soul whatever which have a determinism of behavior, rather than defining people by their actions and behavior itself (Even sexual acts). 

  
Because these have so little concrete backing, it's difficult for me to say someone who is Faunsexual towards Genderfaun individuals would have a legitimately consistent pattern of attachments or attractions since Genderfaun itself holds no properties outside being another percieved essence/label. We should keep sexual labels the same way we keep employment ones, not because they have any 'essence' or metaphysical entity but because they lead to different actions, whereas if I'm in front of a man, a woman or a transitioned woman I'm going to take no action nor think of you any differently until I know your character and what you do.

  
I feel alot of the confusion would just be removed if we permitted the many creative and self-affirming expressions and actions of a liberal tolerant society without the need for labels (or negative labels discriminating) and just maintained a greater level of universal compassion and respect."

Well my husband never seemed to care and never ask me about my whereabouts, how I dress, who im around, what time I’ll be home…until now

I didn’t tell my husband. I got ready for my date, did my makeup and put on a colorful wrap dress. I looked hot. My husband comes into the room shocked & I am barely paying attention to him. This is how the conversation went. 

Him: hey where are you going?
Me: I’m going out with a friend 
Him: yeah but where at?
Me: just some wing spot that has a DJ
Him: oh when will you be back home?
Me: idk probably 11pm

He is getting annoyed at this point. I know he is getting jealous. 

Him: ok text me when you get there and text me when y’all leave. 

I said ok and left. I walked out of that house and I was smiling on the inside.

My husband confess to me today that he was pissed off by the way I acted that night and how aloof I was being. He didn’t like that I went out without telling him.

0,2024-04-09,CMV: the best way to fix the homelessness problem is to make every landlord accept a small portion of the risk. By evenly distributing the risk we can minimize the impact. Banning tenant screenings will benefit society. ,u/blushngush,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c01b3g/cmv_the_best_way_to_fix_the_homelessness_problem/,changemyview,"Tenant screenings are landlords way of deflecting risks. They limit their cost burden with screenings but doing so places this cost burden onto the taxpayers. 

We all pay the price in the form of higher cost for police services, firefighters, city cleaning and maintainance, unpaid medical bills, depreciating property value near homeless camps, higher retail price due to shrink rates, etc etc. 

The cost of this crisis has been placed entirely on the public but we can shift this burden back where it belongs by placing it with the people who created the problem by gatekeeping housing. 

Banning tenant screenings will make it possible for the homeless to get a second chance. Housing is the most basic of necessities and it's impossible to focus energy on anything else while struggling with homelessness. You can't get sober or get a job if you can't get a good night's rest and shower & shave.

The basics have to be prioritized and we shouldn't allow businesses to hurt the public to protect their profit margins. "

Males are stronger, can reproduce for a lifetime, their memory declines later in life, they have a smaller decrease in muscle and bone mass as they age.

We are not the same, thus we joined to create and raide children and suport each other. Even If a woman does not bears a child she most likely is the one dealing with birth control. Birth control slide effects include: sudden death, blood cloths, and the list goes on. When a woman does get pregnant not only she carries and delivers the baby (many woman still die from childbirth alone), but also feeds him exclusively for 6 months. This is not a brunt a male can share. 

Females get: At least protection, food and care while pregnant, breastfeeding and getting back to healt (It takes at last 18 months so that's even safe to get pregnant again), plus a lifelong partner and someone to raise children with. What do males get? A lineage and a partner, someone willing to Go through ALL that. 

Females choose their partners based on weather or not they can provide just that and males choose their partners in weather or not they can provide just that. That's why females look for capable, healty partners and males look for partners that are able and willing to bear babies or willing to take measures to not have them. 

Housework was never the exchange coin. Males and females are not the same. They are, however, worth the same. Even If you don't want a child (or sex without one) you could always have a partner that is intriguinly dissimilar to you. Someone who can ser more colors or someone who will be stronger than you and for much longuer. Love for love's sake.

When you donate change to a homeless person, you may have the intention of helping that individual in some minute way, but that action also serves as a reward for you in that same minute way. Donating change makes you feel as if you did your part. If donating change made you feel terrible, you wouldn’t do it, unless you’re an individual that likes feeling punished and in that case, you’re still acting to satisfy an urge or need within yourself.

Correcting for errors in data collection showed that actually, children from more rigorous religious households are more likely to be mean to non-members than children from less rigorous religious households. So, right out the gate, fundamentalist children are bigger jerks to non-members. I’m sure this comes as no surprise to anyone on here. We all know the feeling of being looked down on by a religious fundamentalist; they often believe that all non-members are totally doomed, as well as foundationally evil.

That's what I see. I honestly think the majority of people don't choose their religion, they just take what their parents give them. 

I live Asia, I don't have the data but I think more than 90% of people in my country never convert to another religion. I tried to check the American data and honestly quite surprised that 42% of Americans have switched religion https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2015/05/12/chapter-2-religious-switching-and-intermarriage/

But first majority still never switch their religion. Second population wise America is small compared to the rest of the world. Third America is less religious and has more religious freedom than ME and Asia

And fourth the biggest gain from religion switching is actually unaffiliated. When people switch religion they usually aren't going to another religion, they are going to ""unaffiliated"". Which is basically not a religion

My definition of truly believe is like this:

Let say X is a moslem from Iran. If X was born in America with Christian parents and X was assigned Christian at birth. There should be at least 51% chance X will convert to Islam

So basically my definition is ""there's reasonable ground that if a person were born in different religious group, they would convert back to their original religion""

And I don't think there's a reasonable ground that that is true 

Based on the data I think more people truly believe in ""unaffiliated"" than in any religion. But this is not included in my CMV"

I disagree with this as there’s a lot of evidence that shows this is the case. There’s a few things I’m using as evidence.

First a few premises: sexuality and what’s “normal” sexuality wise really depends on society, time and culture. What we consider gay today may have been considered straight in Ancient Rome. What we consider wrong today may have been considered acceptable in the past or in other countries. I would also say sexuality exists on a very complex spectrum. I am a straight male. This means I like females but at the same time I like particular females not all females. So while another guy maybe straight, in a way our sexualities are different. Now on to my main points :

1. Most studies show that there’s a correlation between child sexual abuse and non-heterosexuality where a child who is sexually abuse is more likely to be non-heterosexual. As well, children who are exposed to sex at an earlier age usually have a different view on sex. Many people in porn usually started have sex at a young age, we’re abuse victims or a combination of both
2. The are some straight people who enter prison and due to the circumstances will partake in heterosexual activity. Even after getting out these people may still engage in these activities in secret though they don’t consider themselves to be homosexual. Many will be ashamed and try to hide this fact.
3. In the US we consider pedophilic actions wrong and as such illegal. But at the same time  it’s acknowledged that it’s an uncontrollable attraction, so it’s diagnosed as a mental illness. Meanwhile in some other country it might be perfectly legal and the person is deemed a normal person

So with all that said I don’t think it would be true to make the blanket statement that sexuality just “is” and cannot be influenced by trauma or the result of mental illness. I think if we did further research on this (and I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some that just isn’t widely disseminated) we would find this this be closer to the truth"

Every state with an abortion referendum since Roe v Wade has voted pro-choice, often by large margins.

Biden was in trouble in Arizona because of the border, but this ruling shifts the focus back to favorable terrain. Women will be furious and ready to take out their anger on every Republican they can. Trump already has a narrow path to the White House, and it becomes very difficult if he loses Arizona again.

Obviously women have a bunch of other qualities that are more important. But I think society sets their physical appearance at the top of that list because they are sought after by so many men. Men will say personality is more important but I don’t believe they put it above physical appearance. From what I’ve seen most men would rather give a woman who is super attractive but mentally unstable a chance over a woman they can connect with on all levels but isn’t physically attractive. I feel like physically attractive women are sought after by men so much that it continuously raises the leverage that they have from being attractive."
0,2024-04-09,CMV: I shouldn't do psychotherapy,u/Flat_Goose_8780,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c09jqe/cmv_i_shouldnt_do_psychotherapy/,changemyview,"How to drop my prejudice towards therapy?

I'm sorry if it's the wrong sub to talk about this. I posted it on r/offmychest, r/depression and r/therapy but got very few replies.

About therapy: I want to do it. I want to actually engage in it. I find the idea great in theory. But I have tried it in the past a few times (admittedly, for only a couple weeks at a time) and it always left me disappointed, in more than one way. I have severe distrust of therapy. 

For one, I believe they do a great harm to society by taking away mental pain that is externally caused. This is detrimental to solve collective issues. ""Societal problem X doesn't have to be dealt with by me, because I can cope with it existing"". I believe this happens way too often, and that is terrible. One such societal problem that it helps people tolerate is commercialization of something very similar to friendship - therapy itself.

Second, I believe therapists don't care enough to help in a meaningful way. They're there to do a job, to pay bills, to secure their retirement. Most are not there for fun. As with any job, some days you don't wanna be there, but you have to, and can have a bad day on the job. I personally would rather not see a single day of indifference than get 300 of full attention. They also will probably never tell me what they really think of me, and that is a constant feeling I have a hard time processing as well.

Third, they don't really know you, they know the you you talk about there. They don't know you like an old friend, or a family member. They don't have enough information to understand you the same way people who are closer to you can. Why should I not invest the time in my friends over this person every week?

Fourth, I believe they will too often bring psychiatrists and medication into the mix. Fuck that. Not only will that shit change you, some will even get you addicted. Again, it takes away mental pain that not only is internally caused, but externally caused too. A sedated person is easy to control. Artificial tranquility is harmful. Not to mention the corporations that make many of these meds are run by plain cruel people. Very powerful and influential people who benefit from your suffering, from you accepting that you need to take them to get some mental relief, for only 50 bucks a month.

Fifth, and my weakest argument, is that I can't see what a therapist can say that will help me deal with what is rotten in my life. I can only see them saying things that are futile or that I have already tried. This is easy to attempt to disprove, as there is an infinite number of sentences that can be said - though it is in practice limited by the time it takes to convey this infinite collection of sentences, so maybe they can find something. I doubt it, but that's just my opinion.

If I am able to kill two or three of these beliefs, I might be able to enjoy some benefits from it. But until then, I remain out of the therapist's office. I'm going through some shit, as is the crushing majority of people, and I really want to be convinced. 

Any and all thoughts are appreciated."

Humanity has advanced so well, there is a cure for cancer, STDs and there is a way to memorize everything you ever wanted with ease. No financial problems, no need for safe spaces because everyone is well educated, acceptance of deferring views is very very encouraged even on things we currently don't agree on at all, and whether your decision was healthy or not, it does not matter because we have advanced so well a simple visit to the local health restoration center is enough.

It's your life, your choice. 

A couple can freely exchange sex with their besties. If the husband doesn't feel like it, the wife can go to her male bestie and get the good goods and vice versa.

If your son feels horny and lonely, he could always pay a visit to the local strip club and get hooked, or just, hook up online for casual sex.

There's no need to invest in forming friendships locally, because of the chips you have that allows you to communicate with people that conveniently match you in many ways abroad (or locally too) with ease.

Healthy habits become a mere hobby because you can always get yourself checked up with the best medical equipment available.

Good tasty sweet food doesn't become a problem due to the same reason, so there's no need to invest into a healthy diet.

Traveling is unnecessary for most because of self-satisfaction with their environment and complete disinterest in visiting other parts of the world because they all look the same in city design and terrain transform.

Becoming an asshole is less common, because everyone is happy, but those who still choose to be assholes, are not disliked but encouraged because that's just their nature, and those who are hurt can always refer to their friends and family for support, good as new.

Spending all your life doing unhealthy habits and having a constant visit to the local health restoration center becomes so normal, that if you decided to criticize it, you'd be ignored because that's like, your opinion man

Taking care of your parents is not something you should ever care about because the daycare is so good your parents don't need you to care for them at all and only have them visit them on limited occasions.

Funerals aren't as tragic as they are then, because everyone had a happy life and everyone is so sure that whatever is on the other side is better, whether may it be a void or heaven (and not hell because people then wouldn't do things that are *that* bad).

Putting love into your job is seen as declining convenience because it results in taking too much time to finish a task when the world needs fast and steady workers, such as how it is in pharmacies (a pharmacist has to perform their job as fast as they could if they wanna keep their job) or in restaurants and other workshops.

Missing someone or regretting an action you did is seen as a waste of time, because by the time you were sad, you could've been happy and partying, you don't have to worry about the person you've hurt because they will be happy anyways and you can continue to be yourself.


Interests in faiths and traditions are declining because they limit the complete freedom these societies have to offer, and having any identity gets you called a weirdo/racist/uncool by people, but that's who you are and you should love yourself for it.

People have always caused mayhem because they differed on things, how about we don't? And that's how most people in schools by that year are taught a system of thought that makes free thinking seems pointless, because it teaches something that is universally so agreed upon (because it always worked for society), that disagreeing on it makes you ""the bad apple"", oh and it doesn't get you to reflect and think and believe and all that headache, all you need is to have fun!

Acts of kindness and love and loyalty are seen as nothing special, theyre so mundane they don't define you as lovable and interesting, that means you gotta invest into some hobbies and find a community that likes that certain hobby.

People don't need their human limbs/organic parts anymore because they're so weak, and instead, replacements are more preferred, and those who don't use them are seen as conservatives.

There is no need for wild life, as we need more space for factories and urban centers, so instead, we invest on regional zoos, where we could watch wild life, in the comfort inside the glass dome. Just make sure not to put predators against other animals in the same section, that's not cute.

We already have travelled to many planets within and outside our solar system, and enslaved many aliens species, because they can never be integrated into our societies, and there are no movements against that because we as species forgot what slavery feels like. (Also the chips are equipped with manual hormonal control to make sure we don't feel sad and other unnecessary emotions for too long to start acting on it).

In the case of a war, which is rare, humanity has learned that eradicating the whole place that rebelled you and rebuilding it works best, because these enemies won't stop if we defeated them anyway and more of their people will join them in later generations, so some sacrifice has to be made to ensure peace. Also if you lost someone you know, you will be sad, but you already know so many, and well uh, the chips, so this kinda sucks.

Rebellions are seen as acts of violence extremism by conservatives who wants to uh, ""preserve human nature?"" what's that? we are already natural...

I hope the global defense force does something about these guys, they're ruining our freedom, this is already a utopia.


Freedom is absolute, but it's not when it limits freedom, this is why any sad or angry, or loyal, or moral, or traditional/cultural thought are frowned upon, because they limit our advancement, and the same could be said if these emotions were the ones controlling society (""any thing that is not loyal, not cultural/traditional is limiting our advancement"").


Aaaaand so on, our current human nature is so subjective by its time, that nothing we believe in is ever true or worth it because it's not what will lead to ultimate advancement.

Most arguments regarding Leviticus 18:22 argue that it's a translation error, but as far as I'm aware there is basically zero evidence to support this assertion. There is argument to be made that it only explicitly condemns *anal* intercourse, but regardless I don't see this as a particular strong improvement.

The New Testament is even more clear. Sure, Jesus doesn't say anything about homosexuality, but Paul absolutely does, and I don't see any way to interpret Romans 1:26-27 that does *not* make homosexuality sinful under Christian doctrine. 

To be clear, I think you can certainly square being Christian with being pro-homosexuality - so long as you don't hold the Bible to be the literal, unaltered word of God. But this is an exceedingly common belief among Christians. Also, I don't really think this applies to the full LGBTQ spectrum, and Galatians 3:28-29 seems if anything to suggest to me that support for the ""T"" is fully compatible with Christian belief. "

Everyone at some point was unknown. Tomorrow is unknown and many people don't fear that unless some conspiracy theorist rants on about something. Everything was unknown at some point, so if the phrase ""Humans fear what they don't know"" we would've probably already gone extinct because fear most of the time is a synonym for hatred, humans would be avoiding each other like the plague if that is the case. Also, fearing the unknown limits your experience. If you aren't willing to try new food because you don't know what it might taste like is just a dull way to live. In order for something to be known it has to been unknown first because things wouldn't exist at all including us."
0,2024-04-10,CMV: If we considered stopping the genes (Whether it be gene editing or control methods) which lead to unhealthy violent and resource hoarding behaviour along with possible carriers in the case they exist we might be able to improve society and work towards a better form of one,u/Dragon3105,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c0cl2t/cmv_if_we_considered_stopping_the_genes_whether/,changemyview,"When people talk about dismantling toxic hoarding type Capitalism and there are the arguments of genetics which predispose people to capitalistic behaviour, if they are right then it is likely that this form of genetics mainly came to be a thing roughly 300 years ago through a combination of carriers who produced those people and epigenetics. Alot of guys per say in the 1600s compared basically were more communal, liked fashion and more platonic with one another. There are also still other cultures without this genetic predisposition cause I mean tribes often form based more on common neurology rather than shallow factors like race.

This could actually explain why things like eshays with toxic macho views exist as well as why there are other boys who come from the same situation as them who do not act as toxic or violent towards others and are very good carers of children, cleaners or cookers. Why did there exist a violent 16 year old boy who could not feel remorse when he murdered at all?

Hence why nothing you say can change their outlook, although there are exceptions of those who do maybe. We should do more research on gene editing and make mandatory policies to remove genes which lead to unhealthy hoarding among the population.

In some schools of thinking, there are theories that our current economic system and ecosystem is getting worse because of the increase of people with what can be considered orc-like genetics. Their genes are not compatible with our planet's ecosystem and will lead to destruction, although it might be made favourable by present conditions.

If it is true then these genetics often can lead to emphasis on unhealthy resource hoarding which leads to things like inflation, exploitation and to the point of damaging the ecosystem.

I think western society has become a bit too entrenched in the Christian idealist thinking that ""All people can be saved"" no matter how bad they are as opposed to the belief systems among pre-Christian tribes that some people are inherently corrupt or flawed.

61,2024-04-10,"Cmv: Non-westernized Islam is trash. Islam as practiced in Muslim-majority nations is almost universally antidemocratic, nonpluralistic in the pertinent ways , and a threat to many basic human rights. 

Vast majority of Muslims in the west don't have this problem though. ",u/red_dawn_wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c0eecp/cmv_nonwesternized_islam_is_trash_islam_as/,changemyview,"This isn't as fleshed out as I would like it to be but here are my thoughts. 

Some cite Tunsia and Indonesia as examples of Muslim majority countries where democratic values exist but unfortunately neither have been able to maintain this. In Tunsia President Kais Saied’s moves on July 25, 2021, were a coup d’état. Saied has seized all powers, arrested journalists and dissidents of all stripes, and incited violence against migrants and black Tunisians. Tunisia is no longer classified as free by Freedom House or as a democracy by the Economist Intelligence Unit, and it has tumbled nearly 50 spots since 2021.

Pew Research Center poll suggests that while 70% of Tunisians supported democracy in 2012, only 48% still did in 2014. 

Indonesia is better but still has massive problems. Indonesia officially recognizes Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. Individuals may leave the “religion” section on their identity cards blank, but those who do—including adherents of unrecognized faiths—often face discrimination. Atheism is not accepted legally, and the criminal code contains provisions against blasphemy, penalizing those who “distort” or “misrepresent” recognized faiths. 

Academics have been charged with defamation and removed from their posts for criticism of public officials. In October 2021, President Jokowi pardoned an academic who had been jailed for defamation. The academic had been arrested after commenting on university hiring processes, without naming any particular hires, in a private WhatsApp group chat with other academics.

I understand the problems Indonesia has with democracy are intersectional, but since they are the exception rather than the rule, I would even make several concessions to them and I think my point would still stand. 

I'm convinced that an islam that does not make concessions to the principles of democratic pluralistic society is an Islam that should not be accepted by rational democratic minded people. In Islam, God is the only sovereign and ultimate source of legitimate law. Insofar as Islam recognizes the the people’s authority and other democratic conditions then it is an Islam that is more than welcome. "

It allows you to pay for people who live in poor communities to make videos of themselves acting a bit silly for the entertainment of you and your friends.  


My immediate reaction is that this is distasteful and perhaps even dystopian but when you dig into it a bit more, you see that this is a charity that is trying to help these people who live in poor communities. Is it taking advantage of someone to pay them to beclown themselves for our entertainment? It feels like it is.  


Having said that, in the wealthier world, there are people who choose to be clowns and some might do this because its a job and it pays the bills while others might do it because they enjoy entertaining others.  


I guess it starts feeling weird and wrong when we worry that there might be coercion involved. If you're paying someone to humiliate themselves for our entertainment then that doesn't feel right. But isn't work almost always coercive? There are many people who don't like their jobs but do it because they need the pay."

That's in addition to adoption being several orders of magnitude more expensive than IVF (especially for those with insurance coverage) and about equivalent to surrogacy. The goal of social services is family reunification, so even fostering to adopt is no guarantee and can cause heartbreak for both the intended parents and the child themselves. There are dozens of potential parents for each available child, so it's far from a guarantee.

People only ever say ""just adopt"" to infertile couples, not to fertile couples who pursue having biological children the natural way, and only talk about the evils of surrogacy when it applies to infertile women, not to homosexual men. This type of language disporportionately penalizes people for having a disease.

If that is the case, surely Republicans must take the following positions:

1. Red states should secede from the union knowing that Blue states are now allowing and funding hundreds of thousands of infanticides every year. It is such a grave crime that by virtue of staying in the union means they are complicit in it.

2. Violence against abortion clinics is morally justified because they are committing infanticide at a systemic scale. You can even make the argument that it's a moral obligation to stop that with whatever means necessary. I mean, nearly 1 million murders a year!

3. The US should cut diplomatic ties and sanction countries that legalise abortion. If I found out that a country is allowing and funding hundreds of thousands of infanticides, I will demand my government to take the extreme actions in diplomacy to punish them. I may even demand military action like America did in WW2! It's a massacre/genocide and it's right to punish those countries to make them stop.

4. Every case of miscarriage must be investigated as a potential case of murder. Court system and investigative powers must be expanded to accommodate these cases. Prison systems must be expanded to house all the infant-murderers, who must be kept in jail for as long as any other murderer would.

5. Every pro-choice activist must be arrested for inciting severe violence and advocating for infanticides. Free speech generally doesn't cover incitement of violence after all.

6. If a pregnant person is travelling out of a Red state to a Blue state, they must be investigated as well in case they are about to commit infanticide.

7. If a pregnant person starts talking about getting an abortion, they should be arrested on grounds of preventing a murder.

8. If a pregnant person is engaging in dangerous activities and that leads to a miscarriage, they must be charged for manslaughter.

Since no Republican that I'm aware of is arguing for these positions, surely they recognise that abortion is not actually murder, just a form of harm that is inflicted on an entity that has some moral value but not an actual human being."
0,2024-04-10,"CMV: “Death to America” and similar chants are being overreacted to, and the media is deliberately sensationalizing them",u/StanIsHorizontal,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c0lz6b/cmv_death_to_america_and_similar_chants_are_being/,changemyview,"Recently, in Dearborn MI, a community that is predominantly Arab-American or recent Arab immigrants, there were chants of “Death to America” at a pro-Palestine rally. This has become major news and like other chants (death to Israel, etc) has been framed as a call for violence and destruction upon entire nations.

While I agree that it is in bad taste, particularly in some more sensitive instances, the phrase’s origins in Farsi and Arabic are metaphorical. “Death to” basically means “Damn” or “Down with” (which taken literally, mean wishing an eternity of torture) and especially using them in the context of nation states or political leaders is meant to convey a displeasure with policies or actions by leadership. This is well understood by anyone familiar with the culture, and should be understood by anyone tasked with reporting on the topic from a reputable news outlet.

And yet, despite this being a pretty banal political statement (I know in the US it is controversial sometimes to criticize the government, but it is not exactly newsworthy to say “protestors against government action say ‘down with the government’”) I frequently see it reported just as a headline “protestors chant ‘Down with ___’” as if the chant is the most important part of the story. And within the body of the story I almost never see an explanation of the context behind the chant, just that people are upset and so they are chanting Death in the streets.

This is not just the usual culprits stirring up rage and controversy over Muslims and refugees either. Plenty of regular outlets report these incidents like I described, as if the chants themselves deserve a headline and without any cultural context. Feels to me like either lazy incompetence or a deliberate choice to use yellow journalism to attract more attention their way.

Am I wrong about the meaning of the chant? Am I wrong about the media not giving appropriate context often enough? Am I wrong about the medias obligation to provide said context? Is there anything else I haven’t considered in my view? Thank you."

However, if one holds the belief that abortion is akin to murder, then there is a logical inconsistency in not assigning culpability to an unborn fetus in cases where a woman tragically succumbs to complications directly linked to the pregnancy.

If the premise is that abortion is tantamount to taking a human life, then terminating a fetus would be considered an act of murder within that framework. This perspective perceives the fetus as a human being, thereby deeming its termination as a grave offense.

Following this line of reasoning, if the woman perishes due to pregnancy-related issues (for which the fetus is responsible), and the fetus is regarded as a human life, then it would logically bear responsibility for her death. This would constitute either murder or at the very least manslaughter, given the circumstances. Some may argue that the fetus lacks intentionality in causing harm, but even in that case, the charge would still amount to manslaughter, a serious and reprehensible accusation nonetheless.

While it may seem absurd to label a fetus as a murderer, the assertion that abortion is murder brings to light the logical inconsistency of not holding the fetus accountable in cases where the mother dies. Assigning personhood and accountability to the fetus in this context reveals the complex ethical dilemmas inherent in the ""abortion is murder"" stance."

It seems that with each passing day, Muslims in the West seem more loyal to Islam than they are to their countries. In February, an op-ed in *The Wall Street Journal* called Dearborn, Michigan, in which Muslims make up a substantial portion of the population, ""America's Jihad Capital."" The op-ed was controversial at first, but just a couple days ago, Muslims in Dearborn chanted ""Death to America"" and ""Death to Israel"" and voiced support for Hamas. The mayor, himself a Muslim, *did* condemn their remarks, but he's also a politician, meaning dishonesty is a part of his job. I'm not saying that his condemnation was purely a PR stunt, but it's important to be skeptical of what politicians say.

Elsewhere, it appears that the fears of many Europeans and some Americans regarding Muslim immigration are slowly becoming reality. *The Guardian* reported a 30 percent increase in honor-based abuse in the UK, the overwhelming majority of which happens in Muslim communities. For those who do not know, an ""honor killing"" is the murder of a family member who brings ""dishonor"" to one's family. They are not exclusive to Islam, but they are most common among Muslims. Not only is it murder that is deemed socially acceptable by many Muslims, but it also a major women's rights issue, as the overwhelming majority of victims are women. Honor killings have also been reported in other parts of Europe and the United States; nearly all perpetrators are Muslim immigrants or descendants of Muslim immigrants. Honor killings, once unheard of in Europe, are becoming more common as the Muslim population grows.

Antisemitism among Muslims is also a growing problem. Polling showed that even before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, antisemitism in many EU countries was steadily increasing. While many left-wing European politicians were understandably alarmed, what many of them either didn't realize or didn't say out loud was that the increase was largely attributable to Muslim immigration. Antisemitism has always existed in the Islamic world, and since the early 20th-century, antisemitism has grown so much there that practically no Middle Eastern country (other than Israel, obviously) is safe for Jews. Jews can't even live in nearly all Arab countries after the expulsions of the late 1940s and early 1950s, and even in the countries in which Jews can live, they face near-constant persecution. Turkey (I know Turkey isn't Arab, but it's still Muslim-majority), the first secular Muslim country in history, recently barred Jews from shops. Synagogues in Morocco and Tunisia have been burned. Undoubtedly, Muslim immigration to the West has led to numerous antisemitic incidents. If I recall correctly, Muslims in Germany planned to firebomb a synagogue. In the United States, a British Pakistani took four congregants at a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas hostage. These are not isolated incidents, either. In the UK, the Campaign Against Antisemitism urged Jews to leave Britain while they still can following the Oct. 7 massacre. Just yesterday, I saw a clip of a group of Muslims in the English city of Bradford threatening to kill a visibly Jewish man while the police did nothing. The widespread antisemitism among Muslims is simply undeniable.

Don't even get me started on LGBTQ+ rights. The city of Hamtramck, Michigan elected a Muslim-majority city council in 2015, the first in US history. Leftists celebrated it as a win for diversity, only for the city council to immediately turn on their allies by banning Pride flags. Granted, the city council banned other flags, but the ban on Pride flags is what most people remember, likely due to its being a reminder of how conservative Muslims tend to really be. Muslims actually used to vote overwhelmingly for Republicans; they only flipped to Democrats due to Republican foreign policy in the Middle East and anti-Muslim sentiment post-9/11. I heard that one poll found that the majority of American Muslims support same-sex marriage, but I have reason to doubt that. In Thailand, the parliament voted to legalize same-sex marriage, with all the ""no"" votes coming from Muslims. We also can't forget that the deadliest attack on America's LGBTQ+ community, the Pulse Nightclub Shooting, was committed by a Muslim. I haven't heard as much about Muslim homophobia in Europe, but given that European Muslims tend to be even *less* assimilated, it's probably *much* worse.

I am an atheist and a firm believer in secular government and freedom of religion. Even I am beginning to question whether or not Muslims deserve the right to practice their religion freely, as it seems that the results of allowing the practice of Islam are mostly destructive. One person said that if Islam was founded in the last few decades, it would be universally considered a death cult. The Paradox of Tolerance certainly tells us that we cannot tolerate death cults. So, if Islam truly is a death cult, then it too should not be tolerated. There is a growing ""Muslim question"" in the West, and we must do what we can to find a solution."

It is also necessary to return racial segregation, and limit the rights of women, people of color, and if possible, deport all LGBT people, regardless of their citizenship.

It is also necessary to switch to a one-party system using the example of Iran, North Korea and China, with a ban on liberalism and communism.

Today, the biggest enemy of the United States is not Russia or China, but LGBT people, people of color, immigrants and feminism.

Especially given the fact that it’s a musical, I’ve seen countless different cries of “Why are they even making this?” or “It’ll retroactively ruin the first film” or even “It’s disrespectful to the fans to make something like this.” 

I simply cannot fathom this line of reasoning. My opinion is this: Sequels can be either good or bad. If a given sequel is good, then great, it’s a good thing that it was made. If a given sequel is bad, however, I simply pretend it doesn’t exist. It’s that easy. It does not factor into my enjoyment of the original(s) at all, and nothing is gained or lost by me if an inferior sequel exists.

Therefore, if the only two outcomes for the production of a sequel are:

1) The sequel is good, and I benefit, or

2) The sequel is bad, and I neither benefit nor am harmed,

Then, logically, I stand at best to gain something and at worst to lose nothing by the production of a sequel. What reason, then, is there *a priori* to discourage a sequel from being produced? Joker 2 might be terrible. You could probably argue convincingly that its musicality is a sign that it is jumping the shark. But who knows? It *might* be good. If it does end up good, then I’ll be glad they made it; if it ends up bad as some predict, then I’ll just ignore it and continue enjoying the first one in isolation.

I’ve thought a lot about this because some of my favorite pieces of media are sequels, e.g. Godfather 2, The Last of Us Part II. I love the shit out of Godfather 2, and for me, that’s where the Corleone story ends: Godfather 3 doesn’t exist. I can totally understand not liking TLOU2, but people literally sent death threats over the damn thing. Like, they do realize there are no Thought Police, right? You can just pretend it doesn’t exist. It’s fiction. It’s all made up. There’s no way for one made up story to be any more or less valid than another. You can read all the fan fiction you want and consider it “canon” or whatever floats your boat. Why can’t we all just be more chill?"

Many people gathered for publicly advertised events. Most of them were just free gatherings, but others paid $100 a person to go to ticketed eclipse parties that served booze and food. More power to you. I understand the compulsion to share a unique experience with many people. It can magnify how special something feels. It's why concerts are better with more people.

I saw videos of these events and said ""no thanks"". Getting 2-4 minutes of a phenomenon that happens so rarely is something that I would prefer to do with as little sensory distractions possible. People cheer and whoop at these things, and good for them. I would never go to one of these and demand that people shut up, because I have a goddamned social sense of the appropriate way to act depending on my environment.

I hiked a MILE into a state park. People pretty far from me but still within earshot were all in little groups. BY THEMSELVES. I just want to reiterate. These people hiked 30 minutes into the woods and staked out a spot to be by themselves. Then they all joined in gradually yelling and clapping like they were at a concert.  You know when one stranger goes ""woo"" and the other stranger goes ""woo""? Yeah. Kind of makes it hard to hear the incredibly unique things that happen in nature during this ultra-rare fucking thing. 

I just don't understand. The Grand Canyon illicited about 60 percent of the same emotional reaction from me and you don't see people screaming at that.

To all of the people who may already be typing, ""who are you to gatekeep"" or ""why do you get to tell people how to enjoy"", I'm not. You don't go to a library to socialize, you don't go to a concert to have a quiet night, and you don't hike a mile into the woods to yell at nature. There were SO many Eclipse parties for people who wanted the social experience and so many of those in nature. 


Heres the bottom line. It literally makes no sense to go out of your way to find a secluded spot if you cared about being ""heard"" or being part of a shared experience. If you drove down a dirt road to get somewhere, you get out of your car, and you notice people have gone to great lengths to be far apart from each other, then maybe that's a pretty strong social cue that you're not going to get the communal experience you want.

Anyway, I thought it was possible that one person reading this may have been this person during totality and I would love a reason to not think it's selfish "

To demonstrate this, I think we need to look at which relationships have the most reported domestic violence. [Statistically, the relationships with the most reported domestic violence are lesbian relationships.](https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/21961)  (I've seen people try to dismiss the latter with the idea ""Well, in a lifetime, some lesbians date men"", but we'd still expect it to be considerably lower, not at all higher, as lesbians do generally go on to date women.)

No, instead, it seems to be pretty clearly the key word ""Reported.""

I think the reason we see this number jump is in the shame around reporting. Men abused by women are much less likely to report, because of shame and embarrassment. They feel that as men, they're expected to be strong, and making a big deal about violence from women is a sign of weakness, and thus they're much less likely to report it. 

This shame is considerably lessened with women (although all abuse victims do have an unfortunate degree of shame for being victimized. Thus, we see the highest rates of reporting in lesbian relationships, where both partners are more willing to report when they're domestically abused.

As to WHY this is, I think there's stronger cultural pushes against men being violent. A man hitting his wife will generally be viewed as this horrific act, past the point of return. A woman being violent will be viewed as less of a big deal, even humorous. Thus, as there's less cultural condemnation, women are more likely to feel able to go to violence as a response in relationships."

The precedents established by President Washington would lay the foundation for how the executive branch functions. Basic fundamentals of our government today he just made up and now we don't question them. The power to recognize foreign governments, term limits, and the appointment of the cabinet.

The way President Trump acted during his four year term from 2016-2020 established new precedents for how our Commander-In-Chief should act. Let me give you a few examples.

*Spring 2020 COVID Press Conference*
**Reporter:** ""Mr President, what would you say to the people who are scared right now?""
**The President:** ""I would tell them that you're a terrible reporter.""

That is the kind of toxic behavior that President Trump normalized in politics. He stripped away the formalities of national diplomacy and let everyone know that he doesn't care.

*2017 Press Conference at Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria*
**The President:** ""You've throw our budget a little out of whack.""
*95% of the Island remained out of power at the time of the conference*
**The President would later Tweet:* ""The United States Congress foolishly gave 92 Billion Dollars for hurricane relief!""

It is completely unprecedented for a United States President to insult a White House journalist on international television, let alone mock disaster relief for an American territory. He changed the landscape of what is appropriate in American politics.

You see this with the left now too, demanding that Biden start saying these crazy things. When it was leaked that President Biden refers to President Trump as ""That sick fuck"" he was applauded by the left for *finally being more aggressive.* We don't need more of this disrespectful behavior, we need to end it! People are expecting President Biden to say unprofessional things because that's the precedent Trump set for the Presidency.

Need more? Here. 

*On assassinating Secretary Clinton*
""If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks. Although the second amendment people, maybe there is, I don’t know. But I’ll tell you what, that will be a horrible day.""

*This week with George Stephanopoulos*
""When you see the other side chopping off heads, waterboarding doesn't sound very severe.""

*On his democratic rival*
""That's why they call him Mayor Pete. OK. Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete. Mayor Pete. I've had you up to here, Mayor Pete.""

*On the chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee*
""I don't talk about looks of a male or female but in his case let's just say, last time I'll ever refer to this. He's not exactly the best-looking guy we've ever seen.""

*On his democratic rival who had just passed away*
""She calls me up and said it's the nicest thing that's ever happened. 'Thank you so much. John would be so thrilled. He's looking down, he'd be so thrilled. Thank you so much, sir.' I said, 'That's OK. Don't worry about it.' Maybe he's looking up, I don't know.""

*Women tell him...*
""Remember the dishwasher, you press it, there'd be like an explosion. Five minutes later you open it up the steam pours out, the dishes -- now you press it 12 times, women tell me again.""

I don't care if you agree with the content of his statements, it's clear that he says things that are completely unacceptable in a formal setting and he says them in front of the cameras because he doesn't care. He has changed the political precedent and made this open toxicity acceptable for our politicians.

1,2024-04-10,CMV: Banning Abortions Without Drastically Increasing Welfare Spending Is Cruel,u/Itchy_Egg9279,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c0s97w/cmv_banning_abortions_without_drastically/,changemyview,"I'll preface by stating that I don't want to turn this into a moral issue about pro-life or pro-choice, this topic is already discussed widely and I'm not sure people on either side can be convinced to change their stance. I will, however, say that banning abortions for women, without putting the proper funding into the social services that will inevitably become burdened by these laws, is a form of cruel and unusual punishment for citizens. I've compiled statistics that convey the problem in states that have banned abortion. I will also explain why little funds coupled with an increase in need is cruel and shouldn't happen. I'll then determine the best, and most moral course of action for elected officials to take when considering the issue. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2023/nov/10/state-abortion-laws-us](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2023/nov/10/state-abortion-laws-us)

Here is my source to determine which states I'm focusing the discussion on. 

[https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/state-and-local-general-expenditures-capita](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/state-and-local-general-expenditures-capita)

Here is my source for the data table I've used to determine state welfare spending per capita and their rankings. 

[https://www.wonderbaby.org/articles/how-much-do-foster-parents-get-paid#:\~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20a%20breakdown%20of%20how%20much%2C%20on%20average%2C,as%20high%20as%20%241000%20per%20month.%20More%20items](https://www.wonderbaby.org/articles/how-much-do-foster-parents-get-paid#:~:text=Here%E2%80%99s%20a%20breakdown%20of%20how%20much%2C%20on%20average%2C,as%20high%20as%20%241000%20per%20month.%20More%20items)

And here is another article on the compensation foster parents might receive in each state. My point of this source is that many of the abortion-banned states are in the lowest income bracket in the country. 

Of the 20 states (now with Arizona, 21) 15 rank in the bottom half of the United States for welfare spending. I know there are arguments to be made about the effectiveness of welfare spending. The only logical conclusion of banning abortions is that more and more people are going to find themselves in need of such programs as the financial burden of childcare has become so vast. Every one of these states is reluctant to acknowledge the possible implications of banning abortions in their state. These actions show great apathy for people who are in need and directly contradict the values that are supposedly being upheld by illegalizing abortions. 

Not only is cruelty being displayed by a lack of funding, but also by subjecting children to a flawed and dangerous foster care system. 

[https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-foster-kids-end-up-in-permanent-homes/?utm\_source=bing&utm\_medium=cpc&utm\_campaign=NB-Childcare&msclkid=d789bba421bd12847504ddb2f145f70f](https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-foster-kids-end-up-in-permanent-homes/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=NB-Childcare&msclkid=d789bba421bd12847504ddb2f145f70f)

Simply put, tons of people aren't capable of being good parents. By banning abortions states are possibly subjecting children to neglect or abuse, all done without providing the proper support parents need. Welfare spending in states directed toward foster care and parental support should be mandated. I hear a lot of times the argument against abortion is divulged into something of morality which can seldom be changed in an individual. I argue that the only logical argument that both sides should agree on is that parental support and welfare spending for children and families should increase drastically if the law is passed.

This approach has manifested in various forms, from economic exploitation to military interventions.

  
The offshoring of production has been a strategic economic move by the United States to capitalize on cheaper labor markets in the developing world. This shift allowed the U.S. to act as a global middleman, importing low-cost goods and exporting them at a markup, thereby reaping substantial profits. This practice has contributed to significant job losses domestically and has been accused of exploiting workers in developing countries, where labor standards and wages are lower.

  
The U.S. has been involved in numerous conflicts since World War II, with some critics arguing that these engagements are less about achieving concrete political objectives and more about sustaining the military-industrial complex. The profits of war have become an integral part of the U.S. economy, with defense contractors earning billions from ongoing conflicts. The perpetuation of war serves to benefit these contractors and related industries, leading to a cycle of conflict that is financially incentivized to continue.

  
The role of the United States in international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has also been scrutinized. Critics argue that the U.S. has used these institutions to impose economic policies on developing countries that favor American interests, often at the expense of those nations' economic sovereignty and development prospects.

  
Domestically, relentless marketing and consumerism have been identified as factors contributing to the economic precarity of many Americans. With 60% of U.S. workers living paycheck to paycheck, the push for increased consumption has been linked to a culture of materialism fueled by sophisticated marketing strategies. This culture encourages spending and debt, often leading to financial instability for individuals and families.

  
The U.S. political system has faced significant challenges with corruption and polarization. Studies have shown a robust negative relationship between state-level government corruption and ideological polarization, suggesting that polarization can enhance political accountability in some contexts. However, the deep ideological divides have also led to a fragmented society, with groups increasingly hostile toward one another, undermining the democratic process and social cohesion.

  
The United States has long promoted itself as a beacon of freedom, yet its foreign policy actions have sometimes contradicted this image. The pursuit of power and influence has often involved interventions in other countries' affairs, sometimes under the guise of promoting democracy or human rights, but with outcomes that serve U.S. strategic interests.

  
The US system has been a negative influence both domestically and internationally, affecting the lives of American citizens and the global community.

0,2024-04-10,CMV: Young people should graduate from the public school system by age 16 at the latest.,u/Aggressive-Carob6256,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c0sm8t/cmv_young_people_should_graduate_from_the_public/,changemyview,"When was the last time we really evaluated whether or not it still takes 18 years to educate a person? From what I understand, the elementary school system operates about the same as it did when I was in it 30 years ago (addition first grade, subtraction second, multiplication third, long division fourth). I feel like there's been quite a few technological improvements since then that could be used to expedite the process. An old gf as an example had a younger sister who was 6 already learning times tables with a videogame, and that was in 2007.

Middle schoolers are already taking college level classes including Algebra I and Geometry, both of which are worth 5 fully transferable credits at any JC. Same thing for foreign language, with every level of it also worth 5 credits and there was an 11yo girl in my Spanish I class when I took it 5 years ago. Not that I was the one grading her work, but when she was called on in class I never got the impression that she was struggling. Algebra I is Algebra I no matter how old you are when you take it or who's teaching it, so why shouldn't people be given this credit for their efforts regardless of when/where they learn it?

When we get to high school, this is even more pronounced. I'm finding it very difficult to find even a single class a person takes as an upperclassman an high school that they couldn't instead be taking for transferable college credit that would follow them their entire lives instead of high school credit which isn't actually worth anything. In addition to this, I've never come across a single job listing that accepted a high school diploma that didn't alternatively accept a GED. So what incentive is there currently for any 16yo to remain in high school when they could instead either be taking the same classes at a college level or joining the work force?

When I first started attending JCs almost 20 years ago I met no fewer than three 16yos who attended the same classes. Two of them were in my Calculus class and aced it. So some of them have already been doing this for a while now. I propose that they easily *all* could be doing it.

This post kinda turned into a braindump so here's the three main tenets of my philosophy that I'm testing:

-The current education people receive by the end of their sophomore year in high school is more than sufficient as a baseline to function in society.

-If we were more focused on efficiency in education, the education that we receive by that time could be better than the education people currently finish high school with.

-If we continued on a course of increasing efficiency, it's not difficult for me imagine a world in which high school straight up doesn't exist.

[Here's](https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2024/01/11/school-leaving-age-can-you-leave-school-at-16-and-what-are-your-options/) how they currently do things in the UK. 16yos finish high school and have three options between attending college, starting an apprenticeship, or a combination of part time work and continued education. This is relatively new for them as they increased the age of compulsory education from 16 to 17 in 2013 and then again from 17 to 18 in 2015. The rest of the UK isles (Wales, Scotland, Ireland) still only have compulsory education until age 16 so there is some precedent for my ideas."

Simulation theory isn't a new idea, it's something the kind of resonated with me for like a decade, but with advancements in AI lately it really feels like we're approaching an entirely new generation and I'm not sure what that means for us.  


I'm very plugged in to the tech, art, and music spaces so I am super aware of all the new tech. It's not that it's frightening right now, right now it's just annoying because of all the plagiarism and instant algorithmically generated images and music flooding art communities, but what it's actually being trained to do is replicate human expression.  


We're getting awfully close to ai being able to replicate someone's identity, and we are advancing exponentially fast. Way faster than I even expected. AGI isn't THAT far off, when AI can actively make it's own decisions.  


What happens to the economy when AI can handle most jobs, 24/7, essentially for free? That's a scary separate thought.  


So let's say hypothetically, we reach a point where we develop a super computer capable of running a real time simulation of society, with characters that can make their own decisions in real time, in that reality, the character would believe they are sentient, and in a sense, they are.  


Or what if you run one simulation for one character, and their entire life experience is programmed specifically for them?

I was watching my kids play on the swings / climbing frame etc when another parent came along with his child who say was about 5 yrs old. He sat and watched him and I noticed he had a large glass of wine ( ok you can say it could be any drink in a wine glass ) but for this post let’s say it was . I just thought how irresponsible his young child is playing and he is drinking alcohol. While the evening went on and we were at dinner I noticed many families with several wine bottles drinking away while there kids were with them . Average age of these kids are around the same as mine 3-12 years old.

I don’t like to think I’m judging but I just think is this irresponsible to drink around your kids like this. I don’t drink and haven’t for about 20 years so maybe I just don’t get it  plus I did grow up with an alcoholic mother so I have experienced the repercussions of this and maybe that’s just made me have an more extreme view of it

When I think feminist, I think:

""Men and women are equal""

Just because others may warp your perception of ""feminists"" by acting a certian way does not change the fact that this is it's core principle.

If you believe women can have a license, have a job, can vote or own land, then you are a feminist.

If you believe that women should be able to think freely for themselves and openly wear pants, you are a feminist.

If you believe that women shouldn't be bartered as some form of currency, you are a feminist."

Equally capable of suffering, and pain.

Yet, dog consumption in some parts of the world is very much looked down upon as if it is somehow an unspeakably evil practice. Is there any actual argument that can be made for this differential treatment - apart from just a sentimental attachment to dogs due to their popularity as a pet?

I can extend this argument a bit further too. As far as I am concerned, killing any animal is as bad as another. There are certain obvious exceptions: 

1. Humans don't count in this list of ""animals"". I may not be able to currently make a completely coherent argument for why this distinction is so obviously justifiable (to me), but perhaps that is irrelevant for this CMV. 
2. Animals that actively harm people (mosquitoes, for example) are more justifiably killed. 

Apart from these edge cases, why should the murder/consumption of any animal (pig, chicken, cow, goat, rats)  be viewed as more ok than some others (dogs, cats, etc)? 

I'm open to changing my views here, and more than happy to listen to your viewpoints. "

Don't buy Mormonism, Hinduism, Evangelicals, Muslims, Judaism etc. I study physics and consider myself well versed in most aspects of science like biology, astronomy, physiology, psychology, quantum mechanics, etc. I simply set forward the scientific method and concluded these people have been lied to, at a massive scale. So far, a pretty standard conclusion done in a fairly standard way.  

I live in the US, where freedom of speech is protected and will not be hung for say talking smack about the ruling religion in the country. Those are crazy places, which I assume most readers would agree. Killing based on a religion is whack.

Now, the culture in the US has become more ""free"" or ""open-minded""  this past century thanks to many things like advancement in technology, the ability to protect a constitution with an army, the growing consensus amongst the population to stay true to the constitution for the better of the country, spread of information, kindness spreading, and many things. These ""conduits of freedom"" allowing millions to be free and behave how they please with vast less consequences than other places.

Now, back to the part that's not sitting right with me. Christianity has been the ""ruling"" religion in the US, and has been gutted, mocked, rejected, pushed aside, ridiculed for being a religion. We've got music, movies, shows, careers built upon judging all things Christianity, as you should because America. But I don't think you can do that with Judaism. Say, ""hey that's a [jew]. He thinks of made up [jewish] traditions that are dumb. I hate [jews]. [Jewish] teachings are a negative thing in society."" Replace what's in brackets with the Christian counterpart and it is totally normal. But leave it that way, and I think I would be cast as an anti-Semite, and be shunned from way too many places for this to be okay.

Antisemitism is defined as: ""hostility to, prejudice towards, or discrimination against Jews"". There isn't hostility in what I feel but rather disappointment is a group of people and want them to stop haha. Is that anti-semitism? I supposed I hate the teachings that these people believe in, because I believe they are lies, and will arrest the development of society as a whole, but not the people. 

I hate the teachings of Jewish people. Equally as I do every other religion. Much like Christians speaking in tongues is ridiculous *to me* and I feel I have the right to mock it, I cannot muster the brain power to have to respect a religion or a member of a religion for being lied to like funny sideburns. The person is likely a very kind person, that was lied to and now has a megaphone with a label stamper on anyone that judges them. That's not okay"

Whenever you hear progressives argue for abortion they will usually say something like they support a “women’s right to choose” or “women having control over their own bodies”. This is kind of like a confederate saying they support “states rights” or something. States’ rights to do what?? A women’s right to choose to do what?? If you believe that abortion is moral then say it with your chest: “I believe a women has the right to end the life of an unborn fetus”. Again I agree with the pro choice perspective on this but speaking in euphemisms is not convincing at all.

If you’ve ever talked to a pro lifer they are not that way because they just want women to have less rights in general lmao (well most of them).

The actual point of contention is the moral and scientific argument of “when does a fetus become a living sentient being with rights of its own”. Whether that’s after 10 weeks, 20 weeks, or at birth is where people actually disagree on.

My point is that if you want to argue in favor of the pro choice position in good faith and convincingly to those who don’t think the same as you, you actually need to confront the argument of whether a fetus is a living being and when if ever it becomes so."

Some of my main goals in life 10 years out from when I graduate include: 

* \>150k salary 
* Property -  home in a safe neighbourhood; 1/2 acre lot
* Starting a successful family 

As I understand it, these goals are becoming more and more unrealistic in Canada due to our current and forecasted economic conditions. I'm currently edging more towards looking for a life in the States after graduation. I'll explain what I'm looking at when I make this assertion:

* Currently, the average Canadian makes $18k less than the average American ([2023, OECD](https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/average-wages.htm)), this is a large and growing fall from the 2010's when average income was [near comparable.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GNP.PCAP.CD?end=2022&locations=US-CA&name_desc=true&start=1990)
* As you may have heard, home pricing is insanity in Canada, with the average Canadian home price being a whooping $720k, [and increasing.](https://wowa.ca/reports/canada-housing-market) Whereas in the States the average home cost is [$325k](https://www.zillow.com/home-values/102001/united-states/).
*  Canada is projected to be the [worst preforming](https://www.bcbc.com/insight/oecd-predicts-canada-will-be-the-worst-performing-advanced-economy-over-the-next-decade-and-the-three-decades-after-that/) advanced economy over the next three decades.
* Crime has always been low in Canada, however we've seen a recent uptick in car theft, and a recent [leaked RCMP report](https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/secret-police-report-warns-canadians-may-revolt-once-they-realize-how-broke-they-are-under-trudeau-as-many-under-35s-are-unlikely-ever-to-buy-a-home/ar-BB1kITzH) found that because of worsening economic conditions (among other things), Canada may face civil unrest as citizens grapple with the hopelessness of their economic situation.

I want to stay in Canada, as my family has been here for three generations. However, I don't see a future in Canada that I can look forward to."

I believe that republican lawmakers are evil, they create laws that do nothing but hurt the working class. For example, Florida just passed a law that would make it so companies that have employees doing work outdoors do not need to provide training on heat exposure, water breaks, shade breaks, and no county in the state can pass laws requiring companies to do so. I see Republicans making laws like this all the time and it is truly vile, making it very clear that republican lawmakers do not care about the people who vote for them.

I’m a fairly average guy, or so I thought. My family are all good looking, me being the exception. I don’t actually think I’m horrid looking, im just so average, and when im with my family I do look ugly compared to them. My mum and sister often make sarcastic jokes about my looks. One of my sisters friends who is very attractive somehow gained a small crush on me and my sister told her to wait till I glow up. That’s a thing my sister always does. I had a haircut recently and finally gained some confidence in my looks, this was ultimately cut down during dinner one time when my family were talking and my sister said I really need to glow up urgently, especially if I’m going to start uni soon. What annoys me is that secretly I do make an effort, I’ve tried doing a skincare routine, hitting the gym and to still hear these comments from a family member hurts. My dad is the only one that tells me I look good from time to time. My mum used to mock me, once on holiday I took a picture with my cousin and my mum brought up how we look homeless or something. It was the first time I’ve actually confronted my mum about this and since then she’s stopped and complimented my looks, but this is only because she realised her words were getting to me, not because it’s true. 

Whenever we invite people to my house everyone is far more invested with my sister than me, when talking people make eye contact with everyone else in my family but me. I’m starting to hate how I’m treated for simply being average. Once a group of young girls came up to my sister and called her pretty, then looked at me and called me ugly. This was one of my last straws. I hate that an average guy like me is getting treated like this. I hate that when I’m walking down the street every single guy my age is better looking than me. I hate that women can hide behind make up and call me ugly and reject people like me while having loads of options. I downloaded a social app and was talking to this hot girl, things were going well until she refused to give her snap. I found this odd and let it go. She then found out I play this game she plays and told me to add her on it, so I gave her my username and she didn’t add me. After a while she said she didn’t add me because she thought the username I gave her was my snap, so she added that name on Snapchat - sorry wtf? And no, not once did she mention i added the username on snap, and I was constantly letting her know I was on the game and didn’t receive a friend request, so surely she would’ve realised she added me on the wrong thing. I couldn’t even be asked to carry on wasting my time with her, I immediately told her to get lost and stopped texting her and ignored her. I’ve had some experiences where me and a girl talk and then the girl just randomly reads my message and never gets back, or they’ll be bland as hell. It’s just made me furious and is giving me the mindset to never chase and talk to a woman again..

I’m friends with these guys at my church who are chads, there’s a group of girls who probably have a crush on them. On Christmas Day they came up to our group and wished and hugged everyone except me. After I saw the way the first girl hugged my friend then look at me and looked awkward, I couldn’t even be asked and just walked away and let them get on with it. I was then talking to my sister when these girls approached her and wished her a merry Christmas, again they didn’t say anything to me and they were probably assuming I’d say it to them first which I didn’t (partly because I’m a naturally shy guy), instead I got my phone out and let them talk.One of the girls took huge offence to this, as I was talking to another friend 1 on 1 this time, and she came up to him and hugged him again, and had a whole conversation with him infront of me. Now obviously I have social skills, since it was us 3 only I did put my pettiness aside and actually tried joining in the conversation and making eye contact with her but she wasn’t having any of it. She completely ignored me throughout and then only said bye to my friend.

Anyways so remember when those young girls called me ugly then called my sister pretty? My sister ended up telling my family. When this happened it got to me so bad i immediately told my dad I’m walking back home because I’m bored (this event also happened in church) my dad was surprised and told me to wait but I told him im using the toilet then leaving. When I came out the toilet my dad was waiting outside and told me my sister told him what happened and told me to not give a shit and said those girls only said that because they have a crush on me- im not buying into that bs. My sister ended up forcing them to come up to me and start calling me handsome, but again that’s not changing what happened. When I got home I went to my room and I heard my dad explaining to my mum what happened and she sounded shocked. I then heard my sister and mum talking about it. Since that day, my mum completely stopped talking about my looks, my sister now instead says my face has the POTENTIAL to look good, but my mum counters that saying I look good already, and my sister always responds back with “stop holding him back”

These are experiences which make me believe I am ugly and will never get a girl. I don’t hate women but after doing research on incels I noticed I’m getting similar thoughts to them (being bitter due to experiences with females) which I want to eradicate immediately.

  To reexmine a former post I saw - In which a health professional asked which was worse… Prison or a Mental Institution?  

I was in a mental institution. I swore I’d make sure to kill myself the next time… Yup you guessed it, I had attempted to “unalive” myself and was admitted on a 72hr hold that ended up lasting 8 days and cost me my job… Now imagine you’re that low, that freaking done, and they force you to sign all this paperwork agreeing to things like a lobotomy. YES. A FREAKING LOBOTOMY back in 2009! !. Why on earth would you sign such a thing!?!?! Because they brought out the straight jacket and said you’d be placed into a padded room until you agreed to sign it. So you do. Then there’s mandatory blood work to make sure you can take all the prescription medications the deem fit, and they send in some phlebotomist that is a sadist,  finding pleasure in your cuts and the rope burn around your neck, he says “Oh, you like pain?” An evil smirk spreads across his face as he jams that needle deeper and deeper into your arm. I don’t even know how he got blood out after that, because he was in my bone by that point. I couldn’t close my arm for the duration of my stay because the swelling was so bad. I asked for NSAID’s to relieve the swelling and pain, but was denied because it was also a rehab facility…. They had the audacity to ask how I had managed to do that to myself. I told them about the earlier blood draw and they said, “No, really how did you do that to your arm?” They searched my room, and then my time was extended because I was still “self-harming”.

 There were a few nice nurses that tried to help me… They would say things in a hushed tone like “Look, if you want to get out of here, you have to go to all of the activities, otherwise they will keep you here forever.” … So I had no choice but to co-mingle with the other “crazies”. One man in particular stuck out (we will call him Jack), he was there for “anger management” - he had been to the padded room and got what he dubbed “Booty-Juice”.  Yup, They put him in a straight jacket and jabbed him in the butt with a sedative so he’d pass the heck out. He came to us after being released from a separate wing. Yeah, there were a lot of wings with security and locked doors in between, but one time one got out from the “seriously Ill” wing and found her way into - MY Room. I was half asleep when things were being thrown at me. She was cursing at me that I had rearranged her room, thrown all her stuff away and she was going to make me pay for it. I ran to the hall nurses’ station to ask for help, and they promptly took her back to her wing, ignoring all of the prior screaming that had been taking place because of their negligence; writing it as MY outburst. So I was held longer. My psychiatrist said that despite the medication, I was failing, so she intended to extend my hold.

The “addicts” and the “crazies” kept me sane. There was one outdoor yard, and me being a smoker I took every timed event of it. The problem was, it was covered in a tarp-like material and 20’ tall, so I still could not see the outside world. My purse, phone, identity, shoes, everything was taken from me; I only had strange clothes from the facility as I had arrived there and mine were a “danger”. There was no internet, no sign of life beyond that blasted green tarp. Sometimes they would let other “high functioning” wings into the yard with us, and they would make a ruckus with the one basketball hoop we had. That’s when Jack and I began to talk… He was there because his “anger management” caused him to have a bar brawl over some dude inappropriately touching his sister. I started opening up and telling him that I had been raped and my Dad died on my watch, and I didn’t know how to cope. Jack freaking gets mad, says something like “If I ever find this A-hole I will kill him”. That night, I can’t find him in the common area, and people are telling me he got put in the padded room again for being angry and violent. He kinda avoided me after that, and it broke my heart that they broke him.

But that’s what happens, it’s a medicinal breakdown of the soul. It’s psychological warfare like I have never seen. Torture. Pain… I remember how scared I was the first night I spent there. There were claw marks above my bed. The amount of strength and nail density to perform such a task eludes me…. This is why I am hesitant to ask for help, because I did, and they locked me in an institution to be tortured. Imagine all the souls that are in prison because the system did the same thing to them when they asked for help.

Please read Francis Farmer’s “Will There Really Be A Morning?” Because I’m sad to report not very much has changed…

So honestly which is worse? "

People come to America to make a better life for themselves and their families. Just to be knocked down by racism, poor economic conditions, and the government doing their best to revert back to the 1900s. Even through blood, sweat, and tears, minorities will never truly succeed. Even then, they will be viewed as less by old ass white men. 

No, I am not a liberal. Considering how no matter what party, neither one genuinely give a shit about the people. People are struggling to even feed themselves. Yet, the rich and powerful seem to not notice. No wondering women aren’t having children. No wondering why people are protesting for their basic human rights.

We have no universal healthcare. We have no universal childcare. No tuition free schooling. And no paid family leave. And that’s just scratching the surface. Yes, we are better than a lot of countries. But if you truly do a deep dive, America is terrible compared to other 3rd world nations.

Politicians (such as Governor Mark Robinson of NC) openly express their views on women. Openly expressing their desire to let women have no right to vote. And don’t even get me started on abortion laws. Women are being forced to have children despite certain circumstances that involve rape and incest, even minors. 

Many people believe (especially Trump supporters. Sorry not sorry) that LGBTQ+ rights is “asking for too much”. No one is asking to be treated better than heterosexual people. They simply want to have the same rights. Trump supporters and closed-minded people truly need to go back to school. Trump swears up and down that Biden had made a ‘certain holiday’ (Ifykyk) on Easter. Anyone with half a brain would know that Easter changes every year in April. And that ‘certain holiday’ was invented years ago. If you want any quick info, or additional info, on that topic check out Jordan Klepper.

Anywho, there’s more I could list, however I’m sure I’m already pissing people. If you have the money and resources, get out of America. Do research on other countries that best fits you and your family. Some places I recommend are: Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada, etc…

0,2024-04-10,CMV: More anime should do what Oshi no Ko did with their first episode to stop excessive flashbacks ,u/Sketchy-Turtle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c13c9i/cmv_more_anime_should_do_what_oshi_no_ko_did_with/,changemyview,"Background: I will not provide a detailed explanation of the anime or its first episode, as I assume that anyone reading this post is already fa
miliar with the series.

CMV: Oshi no Ko presented the backstory to the main plot as a 'movie' in the initial two episodes, thereby avoiding the need for excessive flashbacks throughout the series. This first episode was highly impactful and served as the highlight of the entire series.


I believe that some anime series do employ flashbacks effectively, but my primary concern lies with shounen anime that excessively rely on flashbacks as a means to garner emotional investment in characters who lack proper introductions or development. 


The most common argument against this is that viewers of these shows may not be interested in sitting through a lot of backstory for a character before getting to the action. I have a few concerns with this.


1. There is no reason why a backstory needs to be dull. The author can easily include action to keep viewers engaged.


2. If the backstory is not what the viewers are primarily interested in, then it should be briefly acknowledged, and the focus should be on the action and animation.


In my opinion, Oshi no Ko set a new standard for anime first episodes. However, I have only seen a few shows attempt to follow. They release their first two episodes at once, while still using flashbacks in the series. I believe these shows missed the point of why Oshi no Ko did what they did. "

It’s essentially this major sovereign nation that commits rancid occultism every day and no one cares. I don’t understand why normal people with an intellectual, adult mentality haven’t just shut it down finally.

Is there not an outside perspective of London culture that understands it’s just complete 100% cringe while also a sort of real form of evil that gets away with it?"
0,2024-04-10,"CMV: In the age 18-30 age group, the average woman have it easier than the average man",u/PooPooPointBoiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c140tl/cmv_in_the_age_1830_age_group_the_average_woman/,changemyview,"And I mean average.  No super models, and no abnormally bad looking people. 

Your average woman growing up is being told more and more that they can be anything they want to in life.  An engineer, pilot, astronaut, teacher, military officer, stay at home mom, nurse, doctor, you name it.  There are no longer strict gender roles in jobs.  And in fact, a lot of jobs will openly seek out and encourage women to apply/join to boost their ranks with diversity.  The various military academies is an example.  Women can own a home, open a bank account, vote, adopt a kid as a single parent, be an elected official in pretty much any governmental role.  

&#x200B;

And I say all that to set the ground work to show that women on many fronts are just as equal as men.  

&#x200B;

And in many ways women have it better than men.  The ease of finding a relationship.  The ease of obtaining sex nearly whenever she wants.  The showering of attention on social media.  The fact that ""chivalry"" is still somewhat a thing and in dating, the woman can expect to be courted and paid for in many instances.  The ability to just live life and have people come into your life wanting your attention just for you as a person.  As a man I have literally never had that.  Every single relationship in my life, whether it was a friendship or a significant other, I had to initiate, I had to progress, I had to do the leg work in making it happen.  And I think most men can agree that they've experienced the same thing. 

&#x200B;

Sex is a vital portion of having a satisfactory life for most people.  And it's absolutely absurd how easily women can get it.  Online dating is trash for men, with few matches and even fewer dates.  But I've had a female friend who showed me her tinder and it's stacked.  Dozens of dudes messaging her a week asking to take her out and she can have her pick of partner.  To be wanted just for being you is such a foreign concept to me.  In every aspect of life, I as a man, am only as valuable as what I can provide.  There is no inherent value in men like there are with women and children.

Women are having increased equal footing to men in so many aspects of life, and still hold the power of sex over men, and that will never change or inverse.  

&#x200B;

Now yes, I'll admit that women do have drawbacks that men don't have to deal with.  Periods.  certain danger/safety issues, unwanted pregnancies and the assault on abortions.  But in a lot of ways those risks and drawbacks can be mitigated with proper planning and medications.  A hormonal IUD can ease period pain and prevent pregnancies, a conceal carry gun can make you feel safer in potentially dangerous situations, etc.

I also love that we challenge almost everything that the government puts out (even tho that even has its drawbacks I love that we feel the urge to fight back just wish we had the direction), HOWEVER I feel like while those feelings are strong, most of the generations only attempt at making the world better is posting  some political crap on their socials and fighting in comments. It's hard to meet others who have actual goals which are gonna contribute to our future as a nation. Almost everyone says college isn't worth it and has no plans for the future.

Yet our generation seems to be the first to not even want to try to fix it, just would rather watch it all burn. Which also contributes to the way everyone in our generations treats each other like we're disposable. Constantly swiping to the next person who can give us our fill of whatever until the next quick fix comes along because our attention spans can't hold onto a meaningful relationship. And dont even get me started on the faking mental illness to avoid taking accountabilty leading to a generation of pure narcissists.

35,2024-04-10,cmv: Reparations are Not Possible to Give,u/Juuggyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c14mwg/cmv_reparations_are_not_possible_to_give/,changemyview,"Although I would love reparations because me and most of my family are African American, I don't believe it's possible to fairly give reparations. For 3 main reasons: 

1. You can't put a price on the suffering each individual black person went through during slavery. 

2. Where would the money come from?

3. Reparation laws would create new laws that would cause further outrage.

These 3 reasons are *extremely* oversimplified, so before you come at me please hear me out:

1. You can't put a price on suffering. Let's say my great great grandmother was a slave for 20 years. How much money would we get for that? If the government said 20 years of slavery was worth 20 years of medium wage employment, what if I disagreed with them? What if I thought I deserved more because of the mental and physical abuse my great great grandmother went through? And how would we put a price on said abuse? If she was whipped 200 times in her lifetime, how much money do I get per whip? What if she was sexually assulted 10 times. How much money would my family get per sexual assult? If the government said an act of assult is worth $1000, what if I disagreed with them? What if i felt an act of assult was worth $1,000,000? Who's right? My opinion or the government's opinion?

And let's say my best friend's ancestor was a slave for 40 years. Would he get twice as much reparations as me, since my ancestor was a slave for half as long? What if his ancestor didn't go through the same trauma?

Let's say hypothetically speaking that all the issues I presented were solved, and all black people agreed to what the government offered us. How much total money would be due? This is just a rough estimate, but assuming the average black slave worked 20 years, and each year is worth $70,000 (adjusted to inflation for the average middle class worker.) That would make their life worth 1.4 million dollars. Does every black American alive right now get $1.4 million? Lets say we each get 10% of that. (*which is an extreme lowball on our suffering btw*) Each black American would then get $140k. With 47 million black Americans alive today, the government would then owe 6.58 *trillion dollars*. (And remember, this is a *lowball* number)

2. Where would this 6.58 trillion dollars come from? The government is in debt. They don't have it. You might think ""let's just tax all white Americans whose ancestors are linked to slavery.""

But doing this would be unconstitutional. Why should someone who I've never met, (who has done *nothing* to me) be required to pay *me* money for something they didn't do? They would in effect be paying for the debt of their ancestors-- which is already against the law. This leads me to my third reason

3. If we created reparation laws, we would have to change some current laws. Currently, the law states that if you are in debt and suddenly pass away, your debt goes away as well. No one is obligated to pay it-- not even your family. 

However, the logic of reparation laws would change this. Decendants are now responsible for the debts and mistakes of their ancestors. So, for example, if your grandmother was $50,000 in debt because of hospital bills and suddenly passed away, *you* as her decendant, would then be responsible for paying her debt. Since we are now living in a country where decendants must pay for the debts of their ancestors. Would you be ok with this law change? Such a change would not only affect the black community, but *every* community in the country.

Again, I would loooove reparations because I myself am black-- but I'm also a realist. I've thought about this for years, and I can't think of a solution to the problems that I presented. If anyone here can think of some, please let me know. Or if you've come to the same conclusion, let me know. I would love to hear other people's opinions on the matter"

Just by how we remember, we often get confused whether it's still March 31 or already April 1. So it is important to say the month first, and then the date. The year is not so important because it changes so slowly that, at this time of the year, it's given that all dates talked about that are close proximity are assumed to be 2024. One could even just say MM/DD in informal conversations. It's also faster to say April One than First of April. Non-native english speakers probably also say April One more than First of April.

Other formats:  
\- DD/MM/YYYY - confusing to me only because I live in a place where everyone uses MM/DD, so I have to confirm it every time and it can mess up an already existing system. Also, it's a really bad sorting format (unless the software recognizes the date) because the starting number goes up daily and then just resets. This format is my least favorite.  
\- YYYY/MM/DD - the only time I use this is in excel, because it's the best way to sort numerically. This format is what I use in documentation.

Just by raw number sequence, the last numbers are always the ones to change first, not the first ones. And because we don't really mention the year in casual conversations, MM/DD is the format that is practical, fast to say, and numerically logical. Imagine if a clock says mm:hh instead of hh:mm."
0,2024-04-11,"CMV: MAGA Republicans Reject the Principle of ""Best Ideas Win""",u/FinTecGeek,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c16256/cmv_maga_republicans_reject_the_principle_of_best/,changemyview,"I write this from a perspective of a CS student who attended an awesome private college in the northeast, and had the fortune (sometimes misfortune) of being roommates with three very passionate federalist society pre-law (then law school) students that I became unlikely best friends with. I say ""unlikely"" because I was always a skeptic of political movements from either side. I was primarily a libertarian from a very ""non-partisan"" upbringing where my mother was a prosecutor and my father was a detective. The politics of our household were really just ""right and wrong"" and bad policy from both sides created grim work for both of my parents.

That backstory aside, I did adopt \*\*some\*\* of the ideology of my ""federalist society"" roommates. Not all, and not even most, but some. They are all practicing attorneys with lots of successes between them, so what they were so passionate about served them well so far. But - and this is the interesting part - I increasingly see them siloed with me now - the people Democrats and MAGA Republicans both detest.

What seems to be the case to me is that my friends and their greater movement accomplished about everything they set out to do. They ""caught the car"" and they completely lost cohesion in the ""vacuum"" of ""what to do next?"" I see it that MAGA were the grifters and the populists who came in to cannibalize the traditional, highly-educated conservative movements like the Federalist Society and the Tea Party. Essentially, the federalist society was like a business built around the Cold War... but now the Cold War is over.

Now, conservatives either adopt the ideas of the populist figures MAGA so loves, or they are eaten alive by their own. The party has become so centralized, the best ideas cannot win. Only the ones that energize the base most.

\*\*Note\*\* I am choosing to analyze this for the Republican party now. A separate post could be made for the left and to discuss that, but here I am wanting to reflect on what has happened on the right of politics, and how MAGA turned its back on the people that formed the nucleus of the party even up to a decade or so ago."

0,2024-04-11,CMV: Golf Courses Should Be Illegal,u/BroDudeGuyThe3rd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c18ido/cmv_golf_courses_should_be_illegal/,changemyview,"America at large is dealing with a housing crisis on top of many other environmental issues. I recently saw a post showing how many people valued National Parks (the only areas in this country reserved to preserve nature and native biomes) less than they did the idea of cutting them down to build more homes and affordable housing complexes for people. While I understand the desperation many feel for a home (I still can’t afford one either) there are much better options available and I believe one of the best ones is to replace every golf course in America with affordable housing.

When I saw the post about cutting into National Parks it was talking about the Everglades specifically, so I will use Florida as my example. 

With a few quick google searches this is what I found. There are more than 1,250 golf courses in Florida. Let’s use that as our number despite the fact that it’s a lowball. The average golf course uses 75 acres, but most modern golf courses use double that at 150. Again, we’ll use the lower number. This means that on the low end, Florida dedicates 93,750 acres to golfing. The median lot size for modern single family homes in America is .19 acres, but again let’s round it to .2 just so there’s a little extra room on each lot. 468,750. That is how many new affordable single family homes could be constructed in Florida alone with the land they use for golf. All while rounding my numbers to get the lowest possible estimate. Taking into account the larger number of golf courses that are actually present, the larger number of acres that many of them will take up, and the lower number of land required for each theoretical home, there would be many more homes available. And, if apartments were built every now and then, the number of affordable living spaces would skyrocket even higher.

These numbers show that golf courses could contribute much better to society with many more additional benefits. For example, allowing native biomes to re-enter the space rather than having them cut down and prevented from roughing the course terrain. Also the amount of fresh water that would be opened up to residential areas since it will no longer be going to irrigating the grass since it is estimated that golf courses use on overage 200 million gallons of water per year. ALSO there would be significantly less pollution since many of the rich elite who play golf use private jets to fly to them. There is even a private jet charter service for golfing specifically that offers “Ample Golf Bag Capacity for Golf Trips”.

There are so many benefits to this plan including making housing more affordable, making housing more abundant, and even significantly reducing pollution, all while actively protecting nature reserves. And it’s not like the act of golfing will be illegal. Mini golf and driving ranges are all fine while also being much more accessible to the rest of the population. All it takes is outlawing a borderline climate crime of hoarding and over irrigating land so the 1% can have another location to fly their private jets to as a way to spend their untaxed millions/billions.

But of course this won’t happen. The 1% love their wastefulness."

This isn’t a post about all women being manipulative gold diggers or anything of that nature it’s just the way I view it at the moment through a purely logical outlook.

The real downside of marriage for a man comes in the form of a divorce and how that can genuinely destroy someone’s life forever. 30-50% of all marriages end in divorce depending on which website u use as a source so it is a legitimate possibility.

People would often think it won’t happen to them yet it’s possible and not an unreasonable conclusion that it may happen to u. Same way u put ur seatbelt on when ur driving u don’t anticipate to end up in a car crash yet it’s possible same here.

Why are there no upsides to marriage for men it’s simply because of how bad divorce can end up being for a man . 

What may end up happening to a man following a divorce 

1) may lose half their things (for those who say get a prenup. Those have been tossed out and invalidated in courts in western countries such as Australia. While it’s possible to protect ur things in another way that is a difficult and expensive process)

2) alimony can genuinly destroy ur ability to rebuild ur life(alimony and child support are separate things). Alimony can steal form 5-30% of someone’s salary making it almost impossible to try rebuild ur life after a divorce.

If examined rationally there is no upside to marriage for a man like I look at the risk of having my life destroyed for good and attempt to put it up against the benefits of marriage I see none.

U don’t necessarily need marriage to live a happy life with someone and to have a serious  relationship with them . Proof of this is those in the LGBT community who could not get married for years and yet still had deep,long lasting relationships .

However, there is a strong feeling amongst lots of people that anyone who doesn't stop listening to his music is disgusting, and supports antisemitism.

What I feel is that, I would gladly take this argument coming from someone who dearly takes into account the importance of their buying power from an ethics standpoint.

But, how could someone, in good conscience, judge me for not boycotting an entity who's done reprehensible acts, while wearing 250$ Nike's, using an iPhone 15 Pro because the camera was slightly better than the 13 Pro's, wearing Shein... Child labour, artisinal mining, sweatshops, irreversible environmental impacts...

Yes, we're somewhat tied up in the system we were born into, and we can't make perfect choices all the time, not everyone has the privilege to make those choices too. But I'd argue that a whole lot of people make a bunch of those choices on a constant basis, sacrificing ethical integrity for their personal desires.

Doesn't it speak to the privilege and arrogance of living in a first world country, where there's this ability to consume products whilst dissociating from the harsh reality that, we all know, is necessary to manufacture such products, because we don't have to see it?

Obviously the main difference is that, in Ye's case, he's directly the one who says the wild things, and he's directly the one who puts out the music, so it *seems* like it'd be easier to initiate a boycott to shut down his voice; we're not fighting against multiple billion dollar corporations and international government policies, it's just one guy. But would it be really? Don't we collectively hold the buying power to shut down any corporation who uses reprehensible methods? Is it really practically different? If every single person on earth decided not to purchase any Adidas product unless they decided not to use sweatshops anymore, and that, tomorrow, Adidas' has a net profit of 0$, wouldn't they change their ways by the day after tomorrow? 

I'm not trying to say that anything about this is OK, just that it's hypocritical to treat this situation any differently than the countless others we let slide."

To make it worse, he and his legal team went on a PR smear campaign against her to force her to settle out of court. Not only did he get away with it, he basically got everyone to forget about it, first via his play and his overhyped “mamba mentality” image, and then through his untimely death.

Compare that to how we talk about OJ Simpson. Dogfighting is still the thing people associate with Mike Vick even though he served jail time and has worked to make up for his crimes. And yet Kobe gets off scott free like nothing happened.

Coercion is distinct from simple force, as it requires psychological persuasion and not just physical violence by itself.

For example, there is a difference between shooting someone and taking their wallet, vs threatening to shoot someone if they don’t give up their wallet.

Coercion doesn’t require physical force at all, practices like blackmail can be entirely non-violent, and use purely non-physical threats to extract compliance.

I have had too many arguments with people, who seem to be illiterate or ignorant as to the basic nature of power.

They either conflate force with coercion, or they just straight up argue that certain obviously coercive practices are “voluntary” and “consensual.”

“Anarcho”-capitalists in particular seem to demonstrate especially strong wilful ignorance on this issue, as they can’t see how the “free market” is actually highly coercive and controlling over workers.

To them, libertarianism is the rejection of force or aggression. Coercion doesn’t even register as a concept in their minds.

Ancaps don’t oppose taxation because it’s coercive, they oppose taxation because of the use of force. They are anti-violent, not anti-authoritarian.

I’m sick of this nonsense. It’s time to set the record straight, and correct the ignorance."

",u/JeremyWheels,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c1bxk1/cmv_these_common_arguments_used_against/,changemyview,"There are others, but these are some of the most common points I see being raised when reading about eating animal products & veganism on Reddit:

- Animals in nature eat infants of their own species....are they evil too? Are you going to stop them doing it?
- We need to eat
- As a species we once had to practice cannibalism to survive (ancestral diet) cannibalism has been around a long time
- Some tribes practice cannibalism. Not *everyone* can stop doing it.
- Nutrition: Baby protein (and iron) is more bioavailable and more complete than the protein in beans. DIAAS etc.
- I'm more intelligent than Babies
- I like the taste
- I just don't care about babies 
- You own an iphone though
- Morality is subjective and we shouldn't force our views on others regarding what they choose to eat.
- Everything has to die for other organisms to live. It's the circle of life.
- Plants feel pain too
- I've decided that people who don't eat babies are in a cult
- Babies contain natural b12, I choose to get all my nutrients from food.
- I breed babies specifically for meat

Am I wrong to think that they could be used in the exact same way by someone who wanted to defend/justify eating human babies?

*To be clear, I am **NOT** implying that I think eating babies and eating animals is in any way the same thing ethically*

1,2024-04-11,CMV: The outcome of of Russian invasion of Ukraine has been a vindication for The Reformers.,u/Ammordad,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c1e87g/cmv_the_outcome_of_of_russian_invasion_of_ukraine/,changemyview,"For context, by reformers I am referring the [Pentagon wars Reforms](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/894123), a controversial group of thinkers within US military that challenged the existing military doctrine of US that is based on reliance on high-end, technologically advanced military equipment by proposing low-tech and cheaper alternatives.

You may have heard of them from watching [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gOGHdZDmEk) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RO5ZAmzjvI),(I have referenced them in my arguments) or if you are a NCD user. (and believe me, I am a NCD user myself and used to be convinced Reformers were fraudsters and wrong myself), Recent Russian invasion of Ukraine, Western response to Houthis, and Israel-Gaza war has slowly convinced me that the reformers were mostly correct about their assessment and that US and Western world as a whole rely too much on expensive technological solutions that aren't fit for most real-world situations that US or Western world might find itself involved in.

Here are some of my reasons for why recent conflicts has convinced me the Reformers were right:

1- **Despite being vastly larger, Western Military Industrial Complex is outmatched by smaller Russian military industrial complex**, Now as many of you already know the military aid to Ukraine has dangerously drained ammunition reserves of Western world, and the rate of missile consumption by Ukraine is so high one could question whether or not Western world ever had enough missiles to properly fight a country like Russia. Currently Russia is deploying more vehicles than West can make missiles to counter them, and not only that they are managing to produce massive quantities of small arms, shells and ammunition while the Western output is almost non-existent in comparison. I blame over reliance of high-tech expensive ammunition and weapons for Western world's lack of performance in this regard. 

2- **Ukrainian invasion has showed technological superiority is largely meaningless if not backed by numbers. So it makes sense to prioritize affordable, simple, easily replaceable equipment above all.** Yes, Russian T-14 Armata is no where to be seen, and Russian Su-57 is probably a pipe dream, but seeing as how Russians are managing to win by relying on more affordable and easily replaceable lower tech Tanks and Fighters, maybe that was  a good thing. It doesn't matter how many tanks or fighters Russian lose, because Russia is rapidly replacing everyone of them. For instance, It doesn't matter if a Russian fighters don't have stealth, because Ukrainians are running out of AA anyway. 

3- **The fact that Western World needs to have embrace full war economy to be able to address security challenges is a big problem:** The biggest argument I have heard people say in defense of current luxury military industrial complex of West, is that if West embrace war economy like Russia, it will all work out fine. **But that's the big problem**. Here is the thing, if a nation has the political will to embrace war economy, then they probably have the will to lose a bunch of people as well. So things like survivability, or preventing friendly fire can take a back seat. Russia is not even in a  defensive war and it's people have not expressed any issue with losing 100,000+ people in any way that could cause a problem. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that if Western world has a charismatic leader like Putin, or a very strong reason to fight they should be able to sacrifice few hundred thousands as well to win a war. And if West has a charismatic leader or a strong reason to fight it makes sense to prioritize mass production above all. But of course, you can't take existence of charismatic leaders and strong national will for granted. Which means West needs to be ready to fight a war as cheap as possible. And as seen in anti-Houthi intervention, invasion of Libya or aiding Ukraine, Fighting wars in a cheap way is pretty much impossible if everything military complex geared toward producing extremely expensive stuff.

4- **Israel-Gaza war has shown expensive high-tech weapons are not good enough to replace dumb-shells and ammunition.**  Now, I fully understand Israel-Hamas conflict is a multi-dimensional complex issue, so i recognize plenty of non-military industrial related issues can influence the conflict, but lets stay on the topic here: The fact that Israel even has high tech weapons has been a big problem. It has raised the expectation that Israel should be able to wage a ""clean"" war, while also straining their economy and economy of their allies trying to make stuff that by all accounts large amount of cheap equipment and ammunition could achieve the same if not better result. And I have not heard good arguments that suggest better use of existing high tech weapons could have improved Israel's state in the way that couldn't also apply to low-tech weaponry.

In conclusion, I feel like what could convince me that Reformers were not proven right by the recent conflicts, is that prioritization of ease of training, or affordability at the expense of survivability,  or combat ability, would not have prevented Western set backs in recent conflicts.  "

But, I personally find such complaints hypocritical. The insane people who bring bad names to the new age stuff are literally the exact same kinds of people as Zionists (Jew or Christian), the people obsessed with Christian Ragnarok (I can’t remember what it’s called), etc. 

Literally. The insane astrology girl who thinks she can’t be friends with someone because she’s a Libra is just the insane church lady rebranded. Instead of being too into Christianity, she’s into rocks and stars.

The problem isn’t so much what people believe, it’s how people choose to act when they think they have a special connection to some higher force beyond themselves.

As an outsider on both, religion and stuff like astrology end up treated similarly by the most zealous followers."

Now, where once thousands of swimmers could be seen, only a few dare to wade deeper than their knees, with the exception of an occasional brave surfer.

It's said that the Outer Cape now hosts the highest concentration of Great Whites globally, attributed to the burgeoning seal population. This scenario mirrors the plot of 'Jaws'—except, in reality, there's not just one shark, and the response has been markedly different. In Cape Cod, over 300 sharks have been tagged, which experts claim represents less than 10% of the actual population.

Nowadays you’ll read that there have been no new shark deaths or that there have been very few attacks as if that’s an accurate representation of the danger. NO ONE properly swims anymore, so yeah duh it’s hard to get eaten on land. I suspect the statistics would be far more grim if people played in the water like they used to. 

The prevailing sentiment is that ""the ocean is their territory, not ours,"" emphasizing the importance of maintaining the natural order and celebrating the magnificence of Great White sharks. However, I personally believe the experience of swimming in the ocean and the value of human life hold greater wonder.

Consider if Central Park were to experience a sudden boom in deer population that attracted wolves, leading to attacks on people. Would we adopt a similar hands-off approach? How is this situation any different?"

Every 4 years the people would be given the opportunity to vote, but instead of voting for a party, they would be voting for a political ideology. The political ideology that wins, will be programmed into an ai and the ai would make decisions that are congruent with the political ideology, but also in tune with the scientific research and statistics. The ai would not be a diplomat, that would be a human, but it would not outrank the ai.

The ai would be president and no one would outrank it, however there would be protocols installed where the government can vote to override its power if it becomes fallible in any way, meaning it doesn’t meet the criteria for what it was intended to be used as.

So why would this be better than a human? Well for starters, it wouldn’t make as much mistakes, it wouldn’t be affected by personal urges like greed, status and power that can cloud someone’s judgment. It wouldn’t be personally biased, it would only make decisions based on the ideology it’s programmed to follow.

Such an ai would not exist today, if you’re imagining chat gpt when I’m explaining this, forget it, this would be a much more sophisticated ai that would be far beyond any current ai language model.

I usually see this expressed when people say ""you can't take criticism"" in response to when an artist says the slightest thing in response to a critique; when the artist directs critique at a critique of their art. Or when someone suggests something like ""critics shouldn't exist and people should be allowed to enjoy whatever"", they're met with pretentious scorn, accusation of unculturedness and narcissism.

My argument(ironically, critique) is that critique —by its own nature— has no right to exist:

Now let's take a critique=(C).

Let's assume that C has the right to exist,

Now if critique has rights to exist, then a critique of C(let's call this C2) has rights to exist. Suppose C2 says C has no rights to exist.
That means C has no right to exist.

But by that critique(C2), C2 has no rights to exist, And if it has no rights to exist, then critique has rights to exist.

Ergo; if critique has rights to exist, then it has no rights to exist.

49,2024-04-11,CMV: The major changes that Denis Villeneuve made to the plot of Dune: Part 2 were mostly detrimental to to its success as a film and will likely be detrimental to the success of Part 3.,u/doctorstasis,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c1ged8/cmv_the_major_changes_that_denis_villeneuve_made/,changemyview,"Some examples:

* In the book, Paul's younger sister Alia is born and grows into a child. The movie keeps parts of the ""abomination"" story by depicting her as a sentient fetus, but for some reason sets the entire rebellion during the Jessica's pregnancy. This creates two major problems: first, we know from Anya Taylor-Joy's cameo that Villeneuve wants her to play a major role in the next movie, but not only are we deprived of seeing the beginning of her character arc, we know from the books that her storyline is meant to be closely linked to Baron Harkonnen and they never even meet in this continuity. Second, this shortened timeline means cutting major character developments like Paul and Chani's baby entirely while also compressing his entire learning process and propaganda strategy into a matter of *weeks*, which simply isn't plausible. All of the actors are three years older than in the first movie anyway, so it would have made more sense to incorporate a time skip.
* In the book, Feyd-Rautha isn't sent to replace Rabban because he's failing to contain the insurgency; rather, the plan is to use him as part of a ""good cop, bad cop"" strategy to make it look as though a cruel leader has been replaced with a more lenient one. This is an obvious thematic parallel to Paul's ""false prophet"" arc, but it's removed from the movie.
* In the book, Chani stays with Paul at the end, and the final line of the novel emphasizes her role as his de facto wife. Having her seemingly leave him will create huge problems for Villeneuve's planned third installment, which largely follows from their relationship and attempts to have another child. The further the movies stray from the original series plot, the less of Herbert's ideas they have to work from (similar to when the writers of Game of Thrones moved past the books) and the more likely they are to risk alienating fans of the originals."

0,2024-04-11,"CMV: We are wasting dogs and cats that HAVE TO be put down for a real reason by not taking their meat and making food (kibble) for omnivores and carnivores. The only reason why we aren't doing that is because ""They are pets, not food"". Thanks to doing that we could save more dogs and cats overall.",u/d4wid3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c1gscs/cmv_we_are_wasting_dogs_and_cats_that_have_to_be/,changemyview,"As you know, some dogs sometimes have to be put down, usually because of illness or can't find a place for them to stay, mainly because of lack of place. I think that if those sweethearts have to be euthanized it's more disrespectful and unethical/morally wrong to put them down and not use them in any way, just cremation or burying an animal. The impact of it would help shelters as well as pet owners, for example, it would give shelters money by selling the meat, and thanks to that they could pay employees higher wages or hire new people. That's just one benefit, another that pops into my head, that money could expand shelters. This would result in housing more dogs and cats, which would result in SIGNIFICANTLY lowering the number of dogs that have to be put down. Another thing I thought about while writing this is, that shelters wouldn't be relying that much on donations to keep shelters and dogs alive, well.   
  
Customers would also benefit as food for pets would be cheaper and probably better as they use meat that HAD to be used or rot in the coffin. People act like their food is just poultry, pigs, lamb, cows, and fish and their ""by-products"", so organs, blood, bone, and fatty tissue. The thing is they are already eating camels, donkeys, and venison they were eating horses but they are too medicated for it to be safe, they also sometimes eat dogs and cats after killing them. But I'm asking generally about dogs eating dog meat, and cats, cat meat not just dogs that eat cheap generic kibble but a lot of carnivores do. Maybe I'm dumb but I know people don't understand it, so I simply don't talk about it. Maybe I'm missing simple concepts that would make a unprofitable, and unambiguously dangerous.  
  
*""Approximately 6.3 million companion animals enter U.S. animal shelters nationwide every year. Of those, approximately 3.1 million are dogs and 3.2 million are cats. \[...\] Approximately 4.1 million shelter animals are adopted each year (2 million dogs and 2.1 million cats). We estimate that the number of dogs and cats entering U.S. shelters annually has declined from approximately 7.2 million in 2011. The biggest decline was in dogs (from 3.9 million to 3.1 million). \[...\] Each year, approximately 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized (390,000 dogs and 530,000 cats).

**This shows that we are on the right track and it's looking better and better but still, we have a lot to do. Is it because they are pets, not food, or are there very real reasons why we don't do that? Also, I'm open to hearing why is it a bad idea and we shouldn't do anything about it (besides demonizing shelters and that they would do it unnecessarily to animals that shouldn't yet be euthanized).**"

That moment.  
  
Anyway, I decided to watch that whole season and do some research.  
  
Tiffany had auditioned for the season prior, but failed to make the final cut due to failed psych evaluations and getting into a bar fight.  
  
Tyra put Tiffany through anger management. Tiffany came back and made the final cut. She was ELATED, and shared a story about how her grandmother deferred paying her electric bill, let her lights go out, so she could buy Tiffany a swimsuit for the competition.  
  
Just watching the season in general, I could tell that towards (and during) that final episode, I could tell Tiffany sort of gave up. The teleprompter reading challenge, where Tiffany was saying ""I can't read this"" I could tell she was defeated, and Tyra and her panel did not help.  
  
Eventually, Tiffany was eliminated. Tiffany didn't cry when she was told she was out. She was laughing and hugging and shit. She was being a good sport and taking it in stride. I would be proud of her too.  
  
Apparently, Tyra was not proud of her. She called Tiffany and Rebecca (the other girl eliminated) praising Rebecca for showing emotion after losing, then launching her attack at Tiffany, how it was a joke to her, how her grandmom got her lights shut off, talking about anger management.  
  
Tiffany tried defending herself, before Tyra eventually flips out on her. 

Tyra was upset at Tiffany's attitude and not trying. *If she really cared about it, she would have done this speech BEFORE she was eliminated instead of after when it didn't matter.*  
  
A lot of that stuff was just...wrong and uncalled for. It was uncalled for of her to scream at her and tell her to ""be quiet.""  
  
""When my mother yelled like this it's because she loved me""  
  
Funny. When my mom yelled at me the way you yelled at Tiffany, it was because she was pissed off at me. And also, you are not her mother.

Do ppl seriously not see this is a scam?

This generates very cool tools, but also ones that make mistakes and have quite strong limitations.

My experience of AI is mostly related to research software development. Ask it a trivial, how do I do 'x' and it will effectively regurgitate info on web forums or relevant code documentation. 

But, ask it to outline how to do something more innovative, and it will either return references to the academic lit or give you a fairly useless boiler plate. 

Developing generalisable AI, the kind that can reason independently and then produce actual new and innovative content is a long way away. As I understand it, the current approach being pursued is to use theoretical simulation models of simple negotiations to train AI. E.g. we have 100$ and 6 people that want it, how does it get divided? The computer plays against itself and in similar situations until it derives heuristics for dealing with these problems. 

This is all a long way from being useful. Meanwhile, current AI approaches are getting close to maxing out the available data - indeed copyright lawsuits might reduce the high quality training data in future.

So how much further can this current AI tech actually go? I suspect it might flatline in capability before long, and generalisable intelligence is a long way off (perhaps decades).

Feminists don't mind putting men down even when they're right, as it goes against the feminist ideology that women are victims, and they want to defend their own kind.

  
I've been hit by my parents for most of my life. This is especially true for my mom, who would throw stuff at me and hit me with whatever she could get her hands on, simply because I did not behave as expected. My back is full of scars from when she'd whip me with a belt and the buckle would hit my skin hard enough to split it open. I also have a cracked incisor from when she threw a plate at my mouth. Most of her friends saw this, and yet none ever criticised her.

  
When I was 16, my mom and I got into an argument regarding food I cooked for myself, and she hit me with a pan. I decided to fight back this one time and punched her in the face, causing her to get concussed. Now, all of her friends defend her despite her being at fault. It's a similar situation for adult men stuck in abusive relationships involving physical abuse. The woman can hit him however she wants, yet if the man decides to defend himself, he's the one that gets charged with domestic violence. I was lucky that I was a minor, and that the police were never called on me.

  
I wish that was the end of my poor experiences, but it wasn't. A few months after that incident, I got asked out by this girl in school. I was a bit shocked anyone would find me attractive but went with it because I was a gullible moron at the time. This girl was as feminist as one could possibly get; she was the leader of a feminist club at our school, and would talk about and teach it all over the school.

  
Around 6 weeks into the relationship, I find out that she only got into a relationship because of a dare, and she'd been talking shit behind my back about how I'm a stupid weakling after getting me to open up to her. I break up with her after finding this out, and she starts spreading pictures of me among her friend circle, claiming I have a small dick (it is true, unfortunately). Somehow this makes it to my parents and they laugh at me as well, with my dad asking me how I ever thought I deserved to be loved by a girl with something so tiny. Fortunately, I switched schools at the end of the year, but this incident did show that feminists are no different from men when it comes to advocating for their own kind despite being wrong.

  
Throughout all this, only 3 friends stuck by me. Everyone else took their opportunities to laugh at me and berate me. I highly doubt this would be the case if I were female and all the shit I experienced came from males."

This generates very cool tools, but also ones that make mistakes and have quite strong limitations.

My experience of AI is mostly related to research software development. Ask it a trivial, how do I do 'x' and it will effectively regurgitate info on web forums or relevant code documentation. 

But, ask it to outline how to do something more innovative, and it will either return references to the academic lit or give you a fairly useless boiler plate. 

Developing generalisable AI, the kind that can reason independently and then produce actual new and innovative content is a long way away. As I understand it, the current approach being pursued is to use theoretical simulation models of simple negotiations to train AI. E.g. we have 100$ and 6 people that want it, how does it get divided? The computer plays against itself and in similar situations until it derives heuristics for dealing with these problems. 

This is all a long way from being useful. Meanwhile, current AI approaches are getting close to maxing out the available data - indeed copyright lawsuits might reduce the high quality training data in future.

So how much further can this current AI tech actually go? I suspect it might flatline in capability before long, and generalisable intelligence is a long way off (perhaps decades).

I have tried bulking for years on years. Everytime I stop and cut my weight goes down too much and Im back where I started. The men in family r known to be skinny while young and gain weight at late 20s And i knew this but wanted to test this theory. I ate 3k calories a day at one point went to the gym for hours and barely gained anything. Whenever I ask guys I know how they did it they say protein shakes BS. Is there a secret formula I do not know about every man is getting? Im the tiniest in every room I walk into its embarrassing. My sperm donor did not start gaining weight until his 30s and he got very big not muscular. Imo ur genetics identify what body type u will have to deal with. Guys that say its “not genetics” Are usually the ones with perfect genetics for bulking …. or havent seen past men in their familys size.

This is really a push back against the idea that someone being in contact with their ex is a ""red flag"". In fact, I believe that still being in contact with an ex can actually be a green flag and can be indicative of a characteristic maturity that allows two adults, who used to be in a relationship, to still be friendly, despite how the relationship may have ended.

It's also important that I make the distinction between love and *in* love. If you're in love with one person, you should not be dating and telling another person you're in love with them - I think this is moving forward with a relationship when you're not emotionally available, and I think that can be incredibly damaging to the new partner. However, loving someone is very different - if you dated someone for years, or maybe even just months, and you developed a strong care for them and their well being, that won't just go away when you stop dating (except in certain more extreme circumstances).

Someone should be able to love their past partner in the sense that they care about them, they remain in contact to see how they're doing and they have a continuing relationship, even while pursuing serious relationships with others.

I'm curious what others think about this."

When ChatGPT arrived my school was unprepared as anywhere else. It really did a number on us. But eventually we learned to pick up on obvious AI writing and implemented measures to minimize it's impact. It wasn't ideal but we coped.  
But this next wave of AI apps is a different story. A website called Looksrater ran rampant through our school causing a whole load of issues mainly bullying. In case you're not familiar it's a website where you upload a picture and an AI will calculate how attractive you are out of 10. But you can upload anyone it doesn't have to be your picture. So some serious bullying has predictably resulted from this.  
I feel so bad for these kids. Stuff like Instagram already caused enough self-image issues and now this toxic site is making it all 100 times worse. It feels like being a kid/teenager is just so much more stressful than when I was young.  
There's absolutely no way we'd be able to ban phones in my school. And even if we did these sites would just be used at home so it wouldn't really matter. The best we can do is punish anyone found using the site but then they just don't use it in front of us. Nobody wants to rat out who's using it either.  
As tech gets better it seems like social media sites just get better at exploiting these kids insecurities rather than using the tech for positive things. 

As damaging as Looksrater is I can't imagine how much worse it's going to be when deepfaking software that can make convincing nudes of people goes mainstream. 

We already censor a lot of the internet. We need to start prioritising future generations mental health when deciding what to censor. "
150,2024-04-11,"CMV: Penalty kicks are a terrible way to decide the outcome of a football/soccer match, especially for championship games.",u/DJJazzay,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c1kflr/cmv_penalty_kicks_are_a_terrible_way_to_decide/,changemyview,"I'm not a lifelong football fan but the sport's growing a lot where I live (Canada) and I've found myself watching more and more. The one thing I really can't get my head around is just how many matches are decided via penalty kicks, including the most important matches in the world! For the last Euro Cup  and the last World Cup finals to be decided via penalty kicks was still pretty shocking to me (despite both being great matches). 

My issue with deciding so many important matches via penalty kicks is that **they are so removed from anything that occurs normally during the course of a game.**  

Football is already among the lowest-scoring games most likely to end in a tie, and one of the best aspects of football is just how much it depends on *team* success. So it's the sport where you're most likely to have to decide the outcome outside of regular play, and the way that outcome is decided is the most divorced from the stuff that actually makes a team great! 

Because of that, it seems to make it far more likely that the worse team ekes out a win. You can just play extremely conservative football, understanding that your best bet is in penalty kicks. I can see that being okay in friendlies or even the group stages of a tournament, but to decide championship matches that way? I just can't wrap my head around it. 

In ice hockey (shocker, I'm an ice hockey fan), penalty shots are at least designed to simulate a scenario that can and does happen over the course of a regular game. Breakaways where it's one offensive players skating toward the goalie happen fairly often. Meanwhile, its virtually impossible for a scenario like a penalty kick to actually occur in a football game - with a stationary ball and a keeper planted on the goal line. It couldn't be further removed from the actual game itself!

I know it will never change, but I can't help but feel something as simple as unopposed corner kicks (player receiving the cross gets two touches to try and score or something) would be better reflections of the actual game than penalty kicks."

83,2024-04-11,CMV: You shouldn't keep significant secrets from your spouse.,u/rightful_vagabond,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c1mcpr/cmv_you_shouldnt_keep_significant_secrets_from/,changemyview,"I do want to caveat this by adding ""If you want a healthy and happy marriage that you want to last"". If your goal is to gold dig or be/have a trophy wife, this doesn't really apply to you. And if you are looking to get out of a marriage or end it, or just to stick it through a loveless marriage, then this doesn't apply either. I'm talking about how healthy, good, long-term marriage should include enough honesty and trust where neither spouse has any skeletons in their closet that they are afraid to show the other spouse.

I have a few other caveats and exceptions that I list later, so this opinion is more nuanced than just the title (it's hard to fit all my nuances and opinions into a 300 character limit), but my central opinion is about how you shouldn't keep significant secrets from your spouse if you want a good and healthy relationship.

I'm looking to get married pretty soon to a really wonderful girl, so I've been thinking about what makes for a good or bad marriage. This is one thing that came to mind. I feel I can be open with about anything, and she feels the same way with me, and it's been one of the things I feel like has made this different from other relationships I've had. She knows all of my deepest darkest secrets, and I don't want to hide anything from her. I've mostly been thinking about this based off of some stories I've heard and experiences I've had with other people and other relationships I've been in.

By ""significant secret"" I mean anything that your spouse would reasonably feel betrayed or hurt if they found out, or if they found out you hadn't told them or had hidden from them. This likely includes, but is not limited to:

* That you're cheating on your partner/having an emotional or physical affair.
* That you were unfaithful to them in the past.
* That you lost your job
* That you've committed a crime
* That you've stolen/misused money, or made an expensive purchase with joint funds without discussing it with them.
* That you have/have had a mental health diagnosis
* That you've had a significant physical illness
* That you're terminally ill
* That you have a burner phone
* That/how much you view porn
* That/how much you fantasize about other people
* That you've ever posted/shared their nudes or something else very personal to them.
* That you're LGBTQIA/that you realized you're LGBTQIA
* Any significant assets or debts
* That you have an STI
* That they have children/a previous marriage

I don't think you should tell your spouse every single thing that happened every day. Some independence is good in a marriage, and it doesn't matter if they know you had a turkey sandwich for lunch yesterday instead of a ham one. And also, these obviously aren't exactly first date topics of conversation, but I think they should be talked about sometime before marriage and throughout marriage.

But some secrets I don't think belong in a marriage, and I think a good criteria for this is ""would your spouse feel betrayed or hurt if they found out that you had this secret or kept this secret from them?"" I think you should either not do that thing in the first place, or be open and honest with your spouse about mistakes you've made or secrets you have.

This doesn't apply to things like surprise parties, Christmas/birthday presents, etc. Some secrets, especially temporary ones like that, can add fun and excitement to a relationship, I just don't think serious/significant secrets are good for a healthy and happy marriage.

A few caveats/exceptions I can think of:

* I don't think you need to go into as much detail about your past (before you met them) as you do about your life since you've met them. I do think your spouse should have a reasonably honest idea of your major life mistakes and flaws before you met, but I don't think you need to necessarily go into too much detail as long as they get the idea. E.g. If you did drugs before, but don't now, your partner should know that, even if they don't know all the details.
* I want to make a separate CMV about secret emergency escape funds, i.e. a stash of money you keep secret from your partner that is meant to be used if your partner turns abusive and you need to get away. For the sake of this CMV, I could maybe see this as a potential necessary secret, for safety's sake, and an exception to this rule, but I can't think of anything else like that (a necessary/good secret to keep).
* There is at least somewhat of an exception around buried trauma. Your partner may be hurt by it if they found out, but if you're genuinely unable to currently talk about it or really think about it - first of all, go to therapy (preferably before you get married) - but in those cases, I understand that that trauma makes it hard to voice.
* I don't think you necessarily need to divulge things the exact moment it happens, but you should be pretty quick to talk to your life partner about significant things. There may be a few things that are better worked through on your own first, or with a therapist, but I think the end goal should be honesty with your partner. I suppose this technically is an exception to ""never"" keeping a significant secret from your spouse, but I do still think that you should divulge that secret eventually and not delay unnecessarily.
* Although I'm using ""would your spouse feel hurt or betrayed"" as my metric, it's obviously not perfectly exact. If your spouse feels hurt or betrayed by the smallest things, then I don't think that is a healthy relationship and there should probably be some counseling involved. If, however, your spouse wouldn't feel hurt at all if they found out you view porn a lot, then maybe that isn't a significant secret as I define/understand it, at least for you/your relationship.

Looking around (and asking ChatGPT) for some potential counterpoints, I've found the following:

* ""It could be used against you, especially if the relationship sours or ends"" - Potentially true, but I don't think you should plan on failure like that, and I don't think you should avoid trusting a person you're committing to living your whole life with. If you don't feel like you can commit to trusting them with knowledge of your life, don't commit to marrying them for life.
* ""You should have a right to privacy in a relationship"" - I agree. This opinion isn't about forcing your partner to tell you secrets or what to do if a partner isn't telling you their secrets. It's about both of you voluntarily offering up your secrets to build trust and openness.
* ""If my partner finds out, it could lead to violence or retaliation"" - If that's true, I think you should work to leave that relationship posthaste, or at least not consider it a loving and healthy one. Even if it would just lead to insecurity, that's not a good reason to not be honest with them and work through that together or with a therapist.
* ""It's better to have a good relationship with a few big secrets than to ruin a good thing by telling those secrets."" I can see this perspective, but I think any relationship worth keeping can, with hard work, bounce back stronger. And if you don't think your relationship can survive if you put all of yourself into it, maybe it's not the right relationship for you or them.
* ""A couple can have a healthy relationship even if they don't share everything, as long as they're both okay with that."" This is something I maybe just don't understand at all. If you're wanting to commit to a life with someone, how can you be okay knowing you don't know something significant? How can you be confident they love you if they don't really know you? Am I just weird for feeling that way?

I'm open to my mind being changed. I've never been married before, so I could be totally wrong. Are there secrets that are good to keep in a marriage, but that your spouse would feel betrayed/hurt if they found out? Is trust that ""I know my spouse has told me everything significant about them"" important to marital health? Do you think any significant secrets you are keeping in your marriage have no effect/a positive effect on the marriage and keep it healthy and happy?"
11,2024-04-11,CMV: Healthcare should be free for everyone under 18,u/petrastales,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c1naxv/cmv_healthcare_should_be_free_for_everyone_under/,changemyview,"Providing free healthcare for everyone under 18 is not only morally justifiable but also practical and beneficial for society as a whole.

1. **Healthcare as a Basic Human Right**: Access to healthcare is a fundamental human right, and children should not be excluded from this right simply because of their age or their family's financial situation. By ensuring free healthcare for all children, society acknowledges and upholds their right to health and well-being.

2. **Investing in the Future**: Children are the future of society. Investing in their health from an early age ensures that they grow up to be healthy, productive members of society. Preventive care and early interventions can address health issues before they escalate, leading to better long-term health outcomes and potentially reducing healthcare costs in the future.

3. **Reducing Health Disparities**: Providing free healthcare for children helps to address health disparities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Children from low-income families or minority groups often face barriers to accessing healthcare, leading to worse health outcomes. By eliminating financial barriers, free healthcare can help to level the playing field and promote health equity among children.

4. **Promoting Education and Development**: Good health is essential for children to thrive academically, socially, and emotionally. Children who are healthy are better able to attend school regularly, concentrate in class, and participate in extracurricular activities. By ensuring free healthcare, we support children's ability to reach their full potential and contribute positively to society.

5. **Preventing Public Health Crises**: Investing in children's health can help prevent public health crises in the future. By ensuring that children receive vaccinations, regular check-ups, and timely treatments, we can reduce the spread of infectious diseases and prevent outbreaks. This not only protects individual children but also the broader community.

6. **Economic Benefits**: While providing free healthcare for children may require initial investment, the long-term benefits outweigh the costs. Healthy children are less likely to require expensive medical interventions later in life, reducing healthcare spending in the long run. Additionally, healthy children are more likely to grow up to be productive members of the workforce, contributing to economic growth and stability.

I knew Square Enix was going to fuck up in part 2, after that dumpster fire thats known as Final Fantasy 7 Remake (Which isn't even a fucking remake) i KNEW that somehow someway SE was going to fuck up, and I'll give credit where its due, they surpassed even my wildest expectations by retroactively fucking up harder than i ever expected them to.  
Aerith's death is one of the most iconic moments in the Final Fantasy Franchise, hell its one of the most iconic moments in the history of gaming. All this ""remake"" had to do was adapt the source material to the damn letter and elevate it, and be faithful.  
SPOILER ALERT: Those old clowns at Square enix fucked it all up in one of the worst ways imaginable.  
Instead of doing what a remake should do and adapt the source material as faithfully as they could, Rebirth decides to make changes.  
In rebirth When Cloud goes to ""Kill"" Aerith the whispers show up, what are the whispers you may ask? Basically Time/Destiny ghosts-that-are-so-Kingdom-Hearts-level-of-convoluted-that-explaining-would-be-a-headache aka Testuya Nomuron-KH-Time/destiny ghosts. TLDR these things were NOT in the original game, and these whispers are supposed to be gone after part 1.... So why are they here? Idunno, ask Nomuron!  
In Rebirth When Sephiroth jumps down to kill Aerith Cloud, breaks free from the whispers and block sephy's attack saving aerith.... not! it was all just a hallucination and cloud wasn't able to stop sephy at all. And also remember how Cloud had that all-so-important breakdown in the original game after Sephy stabbed Aerith? wel... in rebirth they decide to cut it out, you see a glimpse of what cloud is trying to say but you don't get to hear it.  
Oh and instead of following the Original Source Material Rebirth decides to drag the pacing and introduce a lot of unnecessary shit.  
In rebirth after Aerith dies you get to team up with Zack from another universe in which he lives, and aerith who also lives in another universe to fight against sephiroth! So Rebirth in all its wisdom brings aerith back immediately after killing her!??  
And last and not least, towards the end of Rebirth Cloud now has Schizophrenia and even though to everyone else Aerith is dead, to cloud she's still alive and well???? Oh and that scene where cloud puts aerith in the water? omitted from rebirth, a very powerful scene completely omitted!  
First of all what was the whole fucking point of Part 1? To go against destiny... but in part 2 they fucking backpeddled on it ad tried to be like ""gotcha!"" hell no thats ass.  
Second of all these whispers are definitely the worst thing to come out of final fantasy period, i'd rather deal with final fantasy 15's BS than to see these time ghosts ever again.  
Thirdly, the multiverse? really? Really? Why does this shit even exists, it had no damn place in the orginal so why fucking bring it here?  
Fourthly, Bringing Zack in to help fight sephiroth was a terrible decision, bringing Aerith back to help as well was even fucking worse since it kills the damn tone and comes off as tone-deaf.  
Fifthly, the tone is all over the damn place in rebirth, whereas in the OG it was simple, melancholy and somber, here in rebirth so much shit is coming and going at once to where the tone is ruined  
Sixthly, Omitting very important scenes in Aerith's death makes the entire thing comes off as weightless.  
And last and Definitely not least... Aeriths death has been disrespected, flanderized, and every other big word in the english language all so sephiroth can look cool.  
Case in point Aerith's death one of the most iconic Moments in final fantasy and Video game history has been ruined. There's no defending this abomination. Its shit, pure shit. Rebirth isn't a masterpiece its shit. A REAL final fantasy fan would call out this bullshit. And to make matters worse, IGN of all people lowkey said that Rebirth FAILED when it came to Aerith's death, you know its bad when IGN is making sense! And Guess what I hate what Square Enix did to final fantasy 7, if Sakaguchi were still around he'd have a heartattack over this shit, if he were still around this crap would never have happened.  
This final fantasy remake trilogy is a fucking disgrace and no amount of excuses or copium will ever justify what they've done"
4,2024-04-11,CMV: I don't think what J.K. Rowling said here is transphobic or bigoted,u/lurkwhenbored,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c1ns6k/cmv_i_dont_think_what_jk_rowling_said_here_is/,changemyview,"[J.K. Rowling pinned a tweet](https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1776616861888655835) that I read through and I find hard to disagree with any level or find transphobic. I'm open to other perspectives though.

Additionally, I've always thought we don't treat schizophrenia by affirming their beliefs yet we do when it comes to gender. If I were to proclaim I can fly, no one would be like ""yes you can fly"" unless I was a child and it was a parent humouring me.

Frankly, I believe you can wholeheartedly believe you're meant to be a woman or man but no matter how much you roleplay the gender stereotype of a man or woman you'll become one.

In fact, it's always been strange to me how transitioners end up reinforcing gender stereotypes when they transition. Part of me has considered whether their dysphoria just stems from society telling them X is for Y so they end up feeling like they should be Y since they like X.

The tweet is as followed:

You’ve asked me several questions on this thread and accused me of avoiding answering, so here goes.

I believe a woman is a human being who belongs to the sex class that produces large gametes. It’s irrelevant whether or not her gametes have ever been fertilised, whether or not she’s carried a baby to term, irrelevant if she was born with a rare difference of sexual development that makes neither of the above possible, or if she’s aged beyond being able to produce viable eggs. She is a woman and just as much a woman as the others.

I don’t believe a woman is more or less of a woman for having sex with men, women, both or not wanting sex at all. I don’t think a woman is more or less of a woman for having a buzz cut and liking suits and ties, or wearing stilettos and mini dresses, for being black, white or brown, for being six feet tall or a little person, for being kind or cruel, angry or sad, loud or retiring. She isn't more of a woman for featuring in Playboy or being a surrendered wife, nor less of a woman for designing space rockets or taking up boxing. What makes her a woman is the fact of being born in a body that, assuming nothing has gone wrong in her physical development (which, as stated above, still doesn't stop her being a woman), is geared towards producing eggs as opposed to sperm, towards bearing as opposed to begetting children, and irrespective of whether she's done either of those things, or ever wants to.

Womanhood isn't a mystical state of being, nor is it measured by how well one apes sex stereotypes. We are not the creatures either porn or the Bible tell you we are. Femaleness is not, as trans woman Andrea Chu Long wrote, ‘an open mouth, an expectant asshole, blank, blank eyes,’ nor are we God’s afterthought, sprung from Adam’s rib.

Women are provably subject to certain experiences because of our female bodies, including different forms of oppression, depending on the cultures in which we live. When trans activists say 'I thought you didn't want to be defined by your biology,' it’s a feeble and transparent attempt at linguistic sleight of hand. Women don't want to be limited, exploited, punished, or subject to other unjust treatment because of their biology, but our being female is indeed defined by our biology. It's one material fact about us, like having freckles or disliking beetroot, neither of which are representative of our entire beings, either. Women have billions of different personalities and life stories, which have nothing to do with our bodies, although we are likely to have had experiences men don't and can't, because we belong to our sex class.

Some people feel strongly that they should have been, or wish to be seen as, the sex class into which they weren't born. Gender dysphoria is a real and very painful condition and I feel nothing but sympathy for anyone who suffers from it. I want them to be free to dress and present themselves however they like and I want them to have exactly the same rights as every other citizen regarding housing, employment and personal safety. I do not, however, believe that surgeries and cross-sex hormones literally turn a person into the opposite sex, nor do I believe in the idea that each of us has a nebulous ‘gender identity’ that may or might not match our sexed bodies. I believe the ideology that preaches those tenets has caused, and continues to cause, very real harm to vulnerable people.

I am strongly against women's and girls' rights and protections being dismantled to accommodate trans-identified men, for the very simple reason that no study has ever demonstrated that trans-identified men don't have exactly the same pattern of criminality as other men, and because, however they identify, men retain their advantages of speed and strength. In other words, I think the safety and rights of girls and women are more important than those men's desire for validation.

I sincerely hope that answers your questions. You may still disagree, but as I hope this shows, I’m more than happy to have this debate."

Abortion has nothing to do with being equal to men! Ok go ahead and be abortion rights activist but don’t lump it in with equality because abortion is not a privilege that men have that woman don’t. 

Feminism is a cancer that is destroying the fabric of our society. It has essentially told woman that being a wife or a mother is oppressive. I’m going to be blunt and this is going to sound rude.

Im sure these have been posted on here, and I know I’m in the minority, but I don’t think he did it. I’ve read articles and watched docs and my own conclusion was it was his son Jason. 

A couple reasons. Jason is a chef, and Nicole made plans to come to his restaurant. She blew him off, and went elsewhere with Goldman. That night Jason didn’t punch out when his shift ended. He manually wrote down the time. He was off his medication and even was on probation for threatening his boss, with a knife. 

I think he went to confront her and the rest happened. Lots of people don’t know, OJ immediately hired a defense team for Jason, but he was never a suspect. There also was a beanie found in the crime scene, which later was found in a picture of him. 

Also a reason why OJ was found not guilty in the first place is, how are you going to convict a man of murder when the lead detective was asked under oath if he planted evidence and he plead the 5th lol. 

Blood was reported missing from the LAPD lab. A forensics expert said the blood found on the Bronco was “pressed down”

Also, what would he OJ’s motive ? They were separated for some time, he had multiple girlfriends during the span of separation and murder.  "

Go on the New York Times, the Washington Post, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, Vox all of them are staffed by left or center left reporters and you can see it in the coverage of topics related to Christianity. While they aren’t disrespectful to the religion, they’re far more cutting with their critiques of it. Especially if the story is about someone leaving a “cult-adjacent” branch of Christianity like the Westboro Baptists, The Mormons or the Seventh Day Adventists.


But if its an ex muslim? Then, what criticisms you can find, are usually buffeted on both sides by a lot of throat clearing, preamble and equivocation. So much so that the criticism ends up milquetoast and so vague as to meaningless. This is because, and I’ll put this bluntly, a explosive sense of self-righteousness amongst many muslims on the Left when it comes to receiving even the slightest criticism of their religion in a way that most christians in america – especially when you have depictions of jesus as subversive and heretical as something in, say, South Park – with the exception of some really fundamentalist types, are just numb to.  You can see their hackles rise inside those liberal media bubbles and it only takes one drop of  the  “you’re just a racist” water coloring before the entire pool of discourse becomes muddied. And then it drains people of energy,  stresses them out, ruins relationships and risks their jobs so naturally, they aren’t willing to make those same critiques.

Also, I'm not very skeptical of the ""it's punching down"" or ""It's because christianity is the majority religion of the country"" arguments because the same people will ​**viciously** disagree with the idea america is a ""christian"" or ""christian-influenced nation"".

I got very passionate about this for some reason lol. I threw a TLDR at the bottom if you don't want to read all this. 

Now before you get the idea that I'm an incel Andrew Tate fan that is angry all the time, please just hear me out. Because I actually think Tate is a royal dumbass in a lot of aspects. And I do believe that feminism (at the initial core belief) is a good thing that women should always fight for. And I actually do explain below that it's not 100% women's fault. EVERYONE in society is to blame for this regardless of gender. 

I just want to make this clear because unfortunately in today's society, toxic femininity teaches people to instantly jump to the conclusion that anyone who speaks this opinion is an abusive misogynist that should have their lives destroyed & thrown in jail.

The Roman Empire is actually very comparable to The United States in a lot of ways. And as we all know, history is a good way to possibly understand the current situation of your society. But unfortunately, there is nothing in the world that can 100% determine how/when something will happen in the future. And I say all this, but please take it with a grain of salt because I'm no expert. Basically what I'm trying to say here is that we can learn from history and attempt to do better, but we all know that history is almost inevitably going to repeat itself. 

Anyways if we look at any major superpower in history, such as The French Revolution, The fall of the Roman Empire, etc... Believe it or not, they all have a few key factors in common that contribute to the fall of that superpower, all of which are currently happening in The United States. One of the key factors is feminism. Yes. Believe it or not, society has been pushing feminism for thousands of years. For those that are interested, the other key factors are the following:
- Slavery Which luckily the US technically abolished (unless you consider big companies offloading their work to countries who actually do have slaves)  
- Feminism (which I explain later)  
- LGBTQ+ (Yes, even in the Roman times, men would dress as women, and vice versa, and it was a huge political thing. Again, I'll explain what i mean by this later. Please don't take this the wrong way.)  
- Greedy/Corrupt politicians & Companies (obviously. And yes, in Roman times, companies did exactly what they're doing now. Offshoring their work, paying Americans low wages, discrimination, unhealthy working conditions etc...)  
- Atheism and/or the primary religion of an empire losing its power. (Regardless of how you view religion, it is a known fact that religion stabilizes a society. People are happier, keeps them in check, etc...)  
- Biting off more than an empire can chew, assuming that the things listed above are actively prevalent in the empire. (For the Roman's, this was them continuing to conquer land. They were growing faster than they could handle due to the instability caused by the issues listed above.)  

=========== Why is this happening on a genetic level ===========
At its core, feminism makes perfect sense and in American history, the majority of men actually rooted for women. I myself, along with everyone I know, actually want more strong & independent women. I find it absolutely beautiful and totally a good thing. But there's an issue here. It's in our DNA. It's literally an unavoidable instinct for all humans and it's impossible to stop. If we look at literally every point in history, you see men as the organizers, fighters, providers, and power hungry. Every man in the world fantasizes about some kind of heroic act, if not straight up wanting to rule the world. This is because men are genetically wired to do so. At its core, this can be argued as a way for men to protect AND provide for their civilization. This is why young boys are often seen role-playing war in a playground. It's heroic. It's seen as defending & protecting not just your family, but your civilization.

Women however, are a necessity to men. All of what I say about men is a very good thing. But as you could imagine, it is also VERY dangerous. If there were only men in the world, there would be no end to the brutal torture that everyone would experience, all because of the lust of power and aggression that men have. But women are the opposite. Women are the nurturing, loving, and peaceful people. They are quite literally the glue that holds a civilization together. They are what keep men in check & make them calm down. It would be pure chaos otherwise (keep this in mind for later).

So men by nature are wired to have this lust for power and wealth, and women are the glue that keeps everyone rational and calm. One of the main reasons why women have this beautiful trait is because women are physically capable of using emotions a thousand times better than men. Which is another example as to why men are aggressive in history. If a group of men got together to kill a lion lurking near their civilization, it would make sense. Men are more calculated and logical. If women got together to do the same, they would naturally have more terror flowing through their mind, which clouds their ability to make split decisions in order to protect yourself & your people. But I'm not saying this as a bad thing. 

Again, if it weren't for women, men wouldn't stop after they kill the one lion threatening their home. They'd want to kill every single lion on the planet, make the baby lions watch in order to inflict fear into other lions, etc... which is very brutal and unnecessary,  even though a men's intentions are (at least what they believe to be) pure. And women understand this more than men due to their stronger connection to their emotions. As a result, women calm them down. 

Women are more capable of taking care of a child for obvious reasons. A warm, loving, and nurturing feminine touch is basically a need for a child's survival, let alone all the other things that women provide to children. 

But because of this, women have a more difficult time doing things such as building/organizing people, running an organization or business, making very tough & stressful decisions, etc... all due to their strong ability to use emotion. This is why men are responsible for the development of roads, buildings, electrical infrastructure. It's why you see more men in CEO positions, leaders, etc.. and I'm not saying it's impossible for women to do, but it is much more difficult. Again, men are more calculated, logical, and quite simply cold when it comes to stuff like this. There are men throughout history who were the sole decision maker in a potential situation that could have killed millions of people. Something that could break anyone down into tears. Yet you see them making a decision with confidence, even if its an act. 

Basically what I'm saying here is that men & women are simply different. They both have their strengths and weaknesses. None of which make one gender worse than the other. 

=====================================
So why did feminism ruin societies throughout history?
=====================================
So if we look at the Roman Empire, feminism started as a good thing that everyone stood behind. But feminism also raised more questions than answers. Both genders began to wonder how/why the opposite gender's brain ticks. As a man, I can tell you that everyone I know, including myself, still doesn't understand how women work. And I think that all men are just as confused. Women are the same way. I've tried explaining what i believe to be basic things all the time, and women are absolutely blown away that men do that. For example, apparently lots of women didn't know that men are capable of basically not thinking about anything? As if we're in a sleep mode. Both genders being unable to understand the other something that I believe will never be understood. 

Which as you could imagine can be very frustrating. In Roman times, it started with basic feminism, but continued to evolve. It eventually turned into equal rights, both genders argued about certain things, etc. And for the most part, both argument have their merit. I can see why a woman should be president, but it also scares me because as a man, I know that it's very dangerous to make decisions on emotions. Bla bla bla. 

Basically it turns into a heated debate where both sides are right and wrong. But then as a result, people kept getting more angry. Which evolved into extreme feminists believing that ALL men are evil. The things that bad men did in the past are suddenly every man's fault even though most of those men did nothing wrong. The majority of feminists didn't believe this, but the extreme feminists, the ones in overdrive with emotion, inflicted their beliefs on everyone. Which confuses and angers both men and women at the same time.

So as you can see, it basically turns into a shit show where both sides get more and more frustrated.

On the women's side, toxic feminity has inadvertently put pressure on women to hold them to a higher standard in the Roman Empire. While at the same time, it encourages women to be the woman's version of a fuckboy. If you had a lot of sex, it's empowering but at the same time, you're a slut. It makes zero sense. Similar to now in the US. Having an onlyfans, being a prostitute, etc... is empowering, but at the same time, you're still very dependent on men since you're appealing to men with your body, making feminists hate you. And on top of it, men don't want to date a girl that's slept with lots of men. Toxic feminists have set the standards that inadvertently hurt them. To add to this, look at the porn industry. Feminists say it's empowering, yet they've sexualized themselves which is one of the things they supposedly don't want. Then they blame it on men. And then the innocent women who've done nothing wrong suffer immensely from both sides.

On the men's side, a woman can talk about being currently horny on the internet and she's showered with attention and money. Whereas if a man accidentally looks in a woman's general direction, he could be a victim of false allegations from the #metoo movement. I myself, and pretty much every man I've spoke to, has experienced multiple very scary moments in life this exact situation was about to happen. I have had multiple women threaten to call the police on me because I simply said ""hi"" to them as I'm walking by... I know multiple people who got divorced, and the women were heavily favored in court, resulting in him not being able to see his kids & half his money gone, all because he did nothing wrong. The wife simply got bored. 

And I'm petrified at speaking to any women as a result. Which hurts the innocent women who've done nothing wrong. 

The men aren't completely innocent here either. Men, even though it goes against our genetic and physical instincts, should be more capable of understanding women. We should at least try to work with them. For example, when she says ""I'm fine"" even though she's not. Men get very frustrated by this, but they need to understand that women aren't doing it on purpose. Or how women vent about a problem, men provide solutions, the woman gets angry, and men are frustrated and confused as to why. Men need to understand here that its not about finding a solution, its about simply listening & letting her vent peacefully. Another example is the typical Chad fuckboy that fucks a girl and leaves, giving her no emotional satisfaction from something so intimate and loving. Which is psychologically traumatizing. 

As the tension builds up between men & women, things will continue to get worse. Men hold all of an empires force. They're more capable of starting an uprising. Which will happen if toxic feminists continue. Men are wired to breed. Even if we're not actually getting anyone pregnant, we physically NEED sex in order to survive. If men aren't getting it, they'll become more and more aggressive. Look at literally any other living species on this planet. Dogs for example. It's common to see male dogs get more aggressive & frustrated if they don't mate. Literally the same with male humans. I know for a fact that the majority of men's #1 goal is to have a family. Eventually men will become so lonely and desperate that once they realize their #1 goal is impossible, they have nothing left to live for. And what I worry about is the men coming together, full of anger, frustration, and lost hope and spreading literal chaos around the country with no warm and caring feminine touch to help them relax & come to their senses. And I honestly worry for women's safety if/when that day comes. I don't mean this as a threat. This is simply just my worry if we're looking at every great power collapsing throughout history. 

This happened in every single fall of a great civilization throughout history and we're seeing it happen again. Literally the exact same thing is happening with only minor differences. I'm not saying that women shouldn't have feminism. But what I am saying is that there's a balance in things that must be kept in order to have a peaceful civilization. Women and men are simply different, but it's not a bad thing to say that. Both sides of a relationship make each other stronger due to their differences. A relationship is a union of love that can make both sides stronger. Were a team, we can make a beautiful and safe world. But apart, it's literal chaos on both sides. 

TLDR: Every single collapse of a great power in the history of the world had the SAME exact thing happen. The Roman Empire,  The French Revolution, etc... Both men and women are both at fault for this issue every time. Men and women are different and it's very bad to think otherwise. Difference is a good thing. It helps level out the other. Meaning that in a relationship, both become stronger as they utilize each other, forming a strong union of love. But separate, pure chaos, depression, rage, etc... on both sides. Men need women just as much as women need men.

So did the media and the masses. The LAPD refused to investigate other suspects and thus tried to make the evidence fit the suspect they wanted to take down rather than let the evidence lead them to the right suspect.

Evidence that makes me believe that Jason did it, not OJ:

* Jason had intermittent rage disorder, which he was involuntarily committed for on several occasions. He had attacked people (a girlfriend, an ex-girlfriend and a boss) with knives on several occasions before, while OJ only ever used his fists on Nicole. Jason had been prescribed Depakote to control his condition but was not taking it at time of the murder.

* Jason was a chef who was known to carry his knife set with him to and from work. He also owned at least one combat knife and had taken hand-to-hand combat classes. Simply put, Jason knew how to handle a knife, while OJ didn't.

* It was well-known that Jason had a love/hate relationship with Nicole, and that he was trggered by Nicole seeing men other than his father.

* On the night of the murder, Jason had invited Nicole to the restaurant where he worked. Nicole stood him up and instead went to the Mezzaluna, where Ron Goldman was a server. This undoubtedly would have triggered Jason, doubly so since he was off his meds.

* Jason's timecard for that night was handwritten for a later time than the restaurant closed at, despite the fact that the automatic clocking-in machine was working normally. The last time anyone can definitely account for Jason's wherabouts is around 9:30 that night.

* A knife whose blade matched the wound pattern of the one used at the scene was found in Jason's storage locker. Meanwhile, OJ's knife had a blade that simply did not fit the wounds on the victims.

* Ron Goldman was a third-degree black belt and had numerous defensive wounds on his hands and arms, indicating that he put up a serious fight. OJ had no bruises and only one small cut on his hand when he was taken into custody. At the time of the murders Jason was in his 20's, had hand-to-hand combat training and experience with using a knife as a weapon. OJ on the other hand was in his 40's, had little to no experience with knives and was arthritic; his time in the NFL had taken a toll on his body. Who do you think would have a better chance against a black belt, especially one that was fighting for his life?

* A black knit cap with hair from a Black American male and a dog was found at the crime scene. Jason had a dog and wore such caps all the time (there's even a picture of Jason with his dog while wearing the cap), while OJ didn't own either a dog or any black knit caps at the time.

* DNA was found under Nicole's fingertips, but it did not match OJ's. It was never tested to see if it was Jason's DNA. In fact, none of the fifteen unknown fingerprints found at the scene matched OJ's, nor were they ever checked to see if they were Jason's fingerprints, even though the LAPD had Jason's prints on file.

* OJ's blood at the crime scene wasn't ""everywhere."" People make it sound like he lost gallons of blood. The scene was bloody, but it was almost 100% the victims' blood. The LAPD only found a few drops of OJ's blood which were contaminated with a preservative used in blood draws. Oh and by the way OJ was known for being squeamish about blood. Jason was not.

* OJ hired an attorney for Jason days before he hired one for himself. Keep in mind that OJ was the only suspect at the time he hired the attorney for Jason.

TLDR: I don't think OJ Simpson was the killer. I think it was Jason Simpson. Jason had the means, the motive, and the opportunity to carry out the murders. OJ might have been there at the time of the murders and he might have tried to help Jason clean up the crime scene. But I do not think OJ did it."

Instead of getting a chance to get out early everyone should have to sit there entire sentence ( I personally think those convicted of murder or SA should be automatic life sentences). We are way too harsh on some crimes and way to lenient on others which is why we have the society we have. Prison is supposed to be a deterrent first, punishment 2nd, and rehabilitation 3rd.  For example my mother was gang assaulted shit and had her child ( me ) kidnapped and held for ransom. The perps only did 24 years.

I believe the internal logic is valid. Note that I am not saying the thought experiment / argument is conclusive, only that it is valid for demonstrating that causal determinism is more likely than not false. To those that believe in causal determinism, can you explain the logical flaws in this thought experiment and change my view on its validity?

Presume a world in which the following definition of causal determinism is true:

Determinism: Determinism is true of the world if and only if, given a specified way things are at a time t, the way things go thereafter is fixed as a matter of natural law. (Taken from Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). 

Philosopher A and Philosopher B meet at Time T. A believes in determinism as above and that the way things go after Time T is fixed by natural law. B does not accept determinism as above and believes that outcomes are influenced by both natural law and the conscious intentional choices of human beings. 

A tells B that A believes the way things go after their meeting is fixed. B replies by asking A to accept a bet for $1,000,000. The bet is that A will pick any number he wishes right now and write it down, showing it to B. Then, they will agree to wait five minutes and B  will write down a number. If B’s number matches A’s number, B wins the bet. B can look at A’s number while writing down his number. 

If the above definition of determinism if true, A should accept the bet because, even before A writes down a number, what number A will choose and what number B will choose are already set in stone by natural law. And, since there is essentially an infinite number of possible numbers that could be written down, the odds that the current state of the universe is such that it will result in matching numbers is infinitesimal. 

Yet, in reality, no one would accept this bet because we know that B would almost certainly be able to match A’s number by using his human will to influence what he writes. Thus, lived experience suggests that causal determinism is false. "

When a teacher is teaching, most of what they does is translation. 
 
By ""translation"" I mean either using simpler words to explain the material, schemes, conceptualizing visually (like when they explain you the parts of the cell) or something along these lines.

What else would they mostly do, anyways? 
Most teachers have no ideas of their own to teach their students. They teach what someone else has come up with. 

Now, I'm not saying teachers aren't important. Most students need this translation to understand the material.

This creates a big problem: In my country, for example, education in general is very deficient (third world country), particularly when it comes to reading and writing. Students who lack the knowledge to read and write well become dependent on teachers for their whole lifes. 

They can't learn straight from the material because they lack the knowledge to do it → They're reliant on teachers to understand the material → That reliance on teachers makes them think they don't actually need to learn how to read and write well, since there will always be a teacher to translate the material for them (or at least that's what they think) 

This creates an even bigger problem: What are they going to do when they finish their stay in the educational system? 

How are they going to read a book by themselves? 
How will they ever sing a contract by themselves? 
How will they be able to understand what they read in the media and not be easy prey for propaganda that's harmful to them and society?

There are many different point here, so, to evade misinterpretations, to facilitate discussion and to make it easier to understand, I'll divide them here: 

•Teachers are mostly translators of the material

•Reliance on teachers to learn something makes the students think they don't have to acquire the necessary knowledge to learn by themselves. 

•This creates big problems for the individuals (because, when they get out of the educational system, they won't be able to understand complex texts by themselves, making them vulnerable to propaganda, for example)

English isn't my first language, so, if I made a mistake, point it out for me and I'll edit my publication. Have a nice day!

0,2024-04-11,"CMV: Criticism of 'the West' often reflects opposition to the historical dominance and oppressive legacy of Western Christianity and its modern extensions, such as the state of Israel.",u/ZGetsPolitical,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c1yvcw/cmv_criticism_of_the_west_often_reflects/,changemyview,"Hello CMV community,

I believe that when people criticize or hope for the downfall of 'the West,' they are often denouncing not just the historical dominance and oppressive legacy that Western Christianity imposed but also its contemporary manifestations in geopolitical strategies, as seen in the state of Israel.

**Historical Context:**

1. **Dominance of Western Christianity**: Western Christianity, encompassing various branches such as the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, and other Protestant denominations, played a pivotal role in shaping European societies and their colonial extensions. This influence often came at the expense of other religious and ethnic groups, using power to suppress and marginalize.

2. **Persecution and Oppression**: 
   - **Eastern Christians and Jews**: The Great Schism and events like the Crusades illustrate early religious divides and persecution fostered or supported by Western Christianity.
   - **Muslims**: During the Crusades and in colonial contexts, Muslims were often targets of military and cultural conquests.
   - **Africans and African Americans**: Western Christianity justified and perpetuated the Atlantic slave trade and institutionalized slavery in the Americas.
   - **Indigenous Peoples**: In colonial ventures, indigenous cultures faced conversion efforts and cultural erasure under the guise of religious and civilizational upliftment.

3. **Israel as a Modern Extension**:
   - **Formation and Support**: Israel's establishment in 1948 was significantly supported by Western powers, which saw it as a strategic ally in the Middle East. This support has often been critiqued as a continuation of Western geopolitical interests, mirroring historical patterns of colonization.
   - **Persecution and Conquest**: The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine, including issues like settlements in occupied territories and military actions against Palestinians, has been viewed by some as akin to historical Western practices of land seizure, cultural domination, and oppression.
   - **Global Politics**: Israel's close ties with major Western nations, especially the United States, underline its role as a part of Western strategic interests in the region, influencing local dynamics in ways that some argue reflect neocolonial attitudes.

**Discussion Points:**

- How should we interpret the actions and international role of Israel in the context of historical Western practices?
- Can the state of Israel be viewed as a continuation of Western colonial and oppressive tactics?
- What are the implications of viewing Israel through this lens for understanding global political and social dynamics?

**Conclusion:**

My perspective is that to fully understand the criticisms of the West, one must consider the historical role of Western Christianity in shaping power dynamics and cultural narratives that have often suppressed religious and cultural plurality, as well as how these practices continue today through political entities like Israel. I’m eager to hear counterarguments or additional insights that might refine or challenge this viewpoint.

Thank you for engaging in this discussion!"

Therefore a murderer got away with killing two innocent people, just to keep the peace which was a disgusting act of cowardice and the judicial system failed and was made a mockery of.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/04/11/oj-simpson-racial-divisions-murder-trial/

This article highlights how stupid the attitudes of the black community were.

>“When the verdict was reached we had one side of the screen with White people crestfallen and crying and then we had on the other side of the screen, Black people jumping up and down for joy,” said Shabazz.

I think the black community conducted themselves disgracefully during the case and pressured with threats of more violence to get a murderer to be aquitted. Meaning two innocent people never found justice.

They used it as a proxy for retribution for past grievances that white people had committed on their people. Which is wrong.

>“I think in the barbershops today, Black people are saying, ‘he got away with it, but the police got away with killing a lot more of us,’” said Taylor. “That’s the mentality.”

So my view is pretty straightforward. it applies to basically everything. I think its pretty solid within reason.

I generally believe we are all responsible for the majority of our own feelings and emotional responses to the world. This obviously has some limits. But to put it simply, if something happens, its up to you to regulate your emotions, not force the other person to conform and lie to you in order to regulate your emotions.  


For example. Person A believes the sky is RED. Person B believes the sky is BLUE. Objectiverly they are both correct. Person A is very upset and uses social media to bully Person B into saying that the sky is RED.

My view is that this is wrong. - You are forcing Person B to lie in order to regulate the emotions of Person A.   


You can apply it to religion, sexuality ect.   


Its wrong because we all deserve to live honest authentic lives. Person A deserves to live a life where the sky is RED and be comfortable in that knowledge. The same goes for Person B and their knowledge that the sky is Blue. Neither can force the other to believe the other is right, and its genuinely impossible to do so unless you actually get Person B to believe the sky is RED. But the majority of the time, they will never change their mind.  


In most situations where Person B capitulates to the views and reality of Person A, they are lying. Its wrong to force them to lie, because in the opposite scenario you would never force Person A to lie. Making it a cycle of inauthentic communication that helps noone. Person A is recieving fake validation thats disingenuous, and Person B is basically the priests from the movie ""Silence""  


Also as a side note. Im basically a libertarian. Do whatever you want in life. Don't shit in the river and pollute it. Let people think what they want and be who they want. - But don't force them to conform to you. You are not God. You are not important and your reality is not more important than anyone else.  


**Why is matters**  
\- Its important that you regulate your own emotions, not other people.  
\- Its important you are allowed to be honest and open about your experiences and beliefs.  
\- Personal freedom and minimizing coersive interations that are a result of threats, manipulation and social preesure.

**Limitations**

Ive Oversimplified the belief a little. The core point is solid but is very complex. Im a little worried about the ""Sky"" example being a false equivalence. I basically rationalized that  the sky color is a spectrum defined by the suns position in the sky as well as the way light passes through the clouds.  
Meaning it would be Blue or Red at any given time given the correct circumstances since its always changing.

Other examples could be taste in art or food, because you experience things differently you can't force someone to adhere to your experience and therefore noone can force you to adhere to theirs.

**Disagreement vs Harrassment**

If you're going out of your way to cause emotional distress by calling someone a ""Stupid muppet idiot"" or a ""Far Left Nutjob"" or ""Far Right Nazi"" - You're trying to intimidate and control the person. Id argue we can all disagree, but I cant harass you into believing your beliefs.

It just really bugs me! I've studied cognitive science and philiosophy of A.I. so I've got my panties in a bunch. If I'm missing something please let me know.

**Large language models are missing fundamental aspects of intelligence and so should not be described as A.I.**

Note: When I say LLMs I'm referring to ChatGPT exclusively - Yes I am generalising and I apologise to all the other LLMs out there who this doesn't apply to, I'm sure you are just great. 


One aspect of intelligence is agency. LLMs aren't making choices for themselves. They are simply churning out words based probability without considering what these words mean, the consequences of that particular output, or any situational awareness. 

Related to agency, LLMs are purposeless. They have no (or no awareness of) wants or needs other than positive or negative feedback (even then they show no real awareness of this feedback mechanism). If their only purpose is to provide probably coherent answers to questions without any concern for themselves then they are not intelligent. Intelligent beings always look to, in one way or another, impose their will on the world.

LLMs show no initiative. They fail to preempt responses or questions. 

LLMs show no creativity in their responses, the best they can do is regurgitate some of their training data. LLMs show no authentic understandings. This is obvious by the fact that they can't relate concepts in original ways. 

LLMs aren't making any intelligent judgements, creating opinions, holding values, there is obviously no internal dialogue. They have no value system. If you try to invoke chatgpt to disagree with you it will tell you: ""As an AI, I don't hold personal opinions or disagreements."" which seems contradictory because surely an intelligent system would create beliefs, theories, and views of the world? If a person didn't have that ability then you'd struggle to define that person as intelligent.

LLMs aren't curious. They aren't trying to know more from their interactions. They always keep it impersonal and general and love to focus on recalling facts rather than discussing (or building their own) perceptions. 

If you took anyone from the 80s or 90s and told them that we have A.I., and then you showed them ChatGPT, while they might be initially impressed, it wouldn't take long for them to realise that this is not the type of artifical mind invisioned by philosophers, technologists, or sci-fi authors.

While I can understand why the creators build LLMs in this way, if your creation is less intelligent than a lobotomised parrot then you lose the right to call it A.I. Calling it A.I. only creates disappointment. By all means celebrate your advancement in chatbot technology, but suggesting this is A.I. is really getting ahead of ourselves."

For example, instagram accepts millions of dollars from businesses to share ads on their platform (and I am one of them), however, if they run into an issue, there is quite literally no way to contact someone for assistant. As a paying customer, I should have that right. 

Also, companies will often have a phone number that just sends you to a menu, but none of the options actually allow you to speak to a person - this also shouldn't be allowed. 

The corporations may save money, but it's at the expense of the customers, and people who would potentially be hired to fulfill these roles. "

Miu literally went BACK to his car and approached the teens with the knife. He provoked them by pushing their inner tub. He refused to leave when everyone told him to do so. Then, he hit a girl and when getting jumped, happily started stabbing the teens (FIVE of them). One stab was to a woman IN HER BACK and the other was to a boy who ran back. He then ditched the weapon and LIED to the police.

Is that the actions of someone who feared for his life and acted in self-defense? He's if anything worse than Kyle Rittenhouse. At least he turned himself in, told the truth and can say everyone he shot attacked him unprovoked. Miu intentionally went and got the knife from his car because he wanted to kill.

1. Allowing returns raises the cost for all customers. This is because many returns cannot be resold or are marked down significantly. Stores also need to invest in staff to processes and resell returns, again raising prices for all customers. 

2. Returns are damaging to the environment as many are unable to be resold or recycled. We are literally filling up landfills with returns. 

3. Allowing returns encourages fraud. People try to return items they never purchased.  People purchase items they plan to use once and then return. People abuse the system by returning products already near end of life (cloths at LL Bean with lifetime warranty). 

Tldr: allowing returns raises the cost for all consumers and contributes to significant environmental damage. Our current system of returns also allows for significant fraud and shrink in retail stores. Returns are basically contributing to our materialistic, throw away culture. We all need to be more serious when it comes to the things we buy, consume and throw away on a daily basis.

I recently was at a primary where instant runoff voting was used to determine county delegate roles - so low total vote counts. I was excited to see it in action as I had heard a bit about ranked choice voting in general and the potential for it to lead to nicer campaigns and push races less to political extremes than our current plurality system does.

The voting happened there were four candidates, A B C & D. 

Round 1: A has the most B has the second most then C then D. D is eliminated votes re-attributed to their second choice.

Round 2: A is still in the lead C has just eclipsed B, B is eliminated and their votes are re-attributed to the second choice which at this point cant be D. 

Round 3: C has taken the lead and is now the winner

We went from having a couple of front runners in A and B after round 1 to electing C, someone that nobody would have chosen on their own. 

I understand that IRV can be better than plurality in dealing with spoiler candidates but the elimination of first choice votes doesn't make any sense to me. The style of ranked choice voting that makes more sense is the [Dowdall System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count#Dowdall_system_(Nauru)) that gives a point value to first choice ie: 1, a lesser to second 1/2, and a lesser to third 1/3, etc. Thus taking all preferences into account and not discarding anyone's vote. 

I'm not sure why this particular variation of ranked choice voting was the one that seemed to catch on all the sudden but it isn't the right one and before we go about championing change to our voting system we should evaluate other options as well, just because it is new and maybe better than what we currently have does not mean it is the [best](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Cardinal_voting_systems).

From personal experience I've noticed that my peers spent about as much time trying to figure out boilerplate, strange ""javaisms"" and object oriented nonsense as they did things like for loops. If your philosophy is starting students out on high level languages so they don't get lost grasping the basics, fine, I disagree with, but Java fails at this. Second, Java to higher level classes, around where data structures and algorithms loses almost all of its already feeble merit as an academic language. High level languages are incredible tools for people that have a strong foundation in computer science. Unfortunately without experience at a lower level it is exceedingly difficult to understand why tools exist, what to use them for, their drawbacks and limitations, how to build something for your specific use case from scratch. Java places a huge emphasis on relying almost entirely on tools for everything including the most basic of tasks like sorting or string manipulation. In a high level language like Haskell one can rebuild the whole standard library from primative language constructs, while in Java they hide pointers from you. In short Java is a garbage language for studying computer science and produces weak minded, ill prepared programmers."

Oh and The debate started because he said 99% of men who've been in prison at least 3 years, are gay, or for Sure have had gay sexual interactions.

From the outside looking in, both provide answers to an unanswerable question because of the fear that the unknown provokes.

It is ok to say, ""I do not know, I can not know, and that's a terrifying idea.""

People really seem to fail to accept that we know so little and some questions are unanswerable.

I understand that you can make inferences using the data you have to make assumptions, but not a single person has enough data to know definitively whether or not there is any sort of deity, reincarnation, or soul, or any lack of the sort."
81,2024-04-13,CMV: It is impossible for American citizens to simply vote out most corrupt politicians,u/StreetBitter6693,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c2v0ap/cmv_it_is_impossible_for_american_citizens_to/,changemyview,"I believe that we live in an age where votes don't matter despite our laws & supposed rights. The first reason why is because of history. Every country, especially great powers, had this issue towards the fall of their empire. As a matter of fact, democracy was prevalent in some of these countries. 

As the Freedom Of Information Act gives us information on previously classified information on intelligence agencies, we always find instances of politicians committing horrifying acts & war crimes that go against our laws. Some of which blatantly ignored the votes, if not straight up doing something in secret that would normally require votes. And what do they get? A slap on the wrist. 

Also on a side note, Some of this released information showed multiple instances of the CIA wanting to both stage and commit acts of terrorism against American military and civilian targets so they could sway the populations opinion on going to war. The most known instance was during the Cuban missile crisis, but there's much more. 

Basically what I'm getting at, I believe that most people are either manipulated, lied to, or tricked into voting for someone, if the votes aren't straight up fabricated in some form or fashion. So if the citizens did actually get fed up with a particular politician, there's a possibility that the politician will commit some illegal act to keep him in. 

I don't think this is possible with all votes though. But I do think that most major things probably don't have an actually fair vote. "

There are valid criticism thought that starting with ""year"" is often unnecessary, which is why I firmly believe ,for general use, MM-DD/YY is the best (and the closest) we can get to the international standard.

DD/MM/YY only *seems* nice because it feels prettier....and that's basically it. Some say it's easier to learn, but I don't think it matters much, especially considering our brains think big then small (month then day). DD/MM/YY is the complete opposite, requiring you (in English) to go day OF month. It also messes up organization completely (you have to create 12 separate month folders in order to sort alphabetically, while MM-DD/YY you can settle with a year folder which most already do)

I will say that this could cause confusion, which is why I propose the formatting I used, ""-"" to indicate ""next"" while ""/"" indicates ""of"". So

**Year-Month-Day:** year *NEXT* month *NEXT* day  
**Month-Day/Year:** month *NEXT* day *OF* year  
**Day/Month/Year:** day *OF* month *OF* year

Side note: some people think that the ISO 8601 is actually bad because it's too similar to MM/DD/YY, which is interesting as they thought the international standard is bad because of MM/DD/YYYY and not MM/DD/YYYY could be good because it's similar to the international standard."
0,2024-04-13,CMV: We listen to the wrong when it comes to AI and that is a big problem,u/andrew21w,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c2wpt4/cmv_we_listen_to_the_wrong_when_it_comes_to_ai/,changemyview,"My thesis is simple: Most people when it comes to AI, they take cues from politicans, CEOs and sci-fi movies \*way too much\*. In reality almost everything AI-related today is created in the primary literature by scientists with years of training. 

If you are scared about AI right now, the shit that exists on academic papers is spookier.

Virtually nobody listens to these people tho and their views about it. Reality is most scientists do not have a sci-fi edgy 14 year old view about AI and ""LaTe StAgE CaPiTaLiSm"" cyberpunk dystopia whatever. 

It is much more nuanced and specific most of the time.

Now you may say to me: ""C'mon fellow reddit user it is not that bad. Laypeople believe dumb shit all the time"". And you are somewhat right. 

My problems begin when politicians and other individuals in positions that are \*extremely important\* for many people use this warped view of AI as a handle to put bad regulations that, to put it simply, favor the top 0.1% or whatever and harm the rest of us.

It may be all in my head but I do not see politician consult scientists too often in that area, but rather CEOs instead. With bright exceptions of course.

The reason for this CMV is to see if I am exaggerating or not."

68,2024-04-13,CMV: Too much social media and staying indoors is bad for you,u/macnfly23,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c2xdt1/cmv_too_much_social_media_and_staying_indoors_is/,changemyview,"As someone having been born in the 21st century, I'm not immune to these things and I do spend quite some time on social media and just generally indoors. 

My view here is that spending too much time on social media and just generally indoors (alone) is bad for you for multiple reasons:

(1) Dopamine loop/addiction/attention span: People sometimes don't like calling social media an addiction but I feel like it is. People spend hours scrolling through TikTok or Instagram Reels just to get  a laugh. Or people have the urge to constantly check these platforms to see if their favorite creator posted

(2) Unrealistic expectations/envy/comparisons: People often don't consider that what they see on social media is just what the other person wants them to see so they tend to think that the people posting always have excellent lives and are perfect and tend to compare their own lives to them. There's some exceptions to this but still.

(3) Echo chamber/similar topics: What I dislike about social media platforms is that they show you a lot of stuff based on what you like so you just keep confirming your views or beliefs. Especially in terms of politics, you don't get exposed to other diverging political beliefs if you're just on social media all day seeing your existing views confirmed. Even if you go outside, maybe you'll still only meet people who think the same things but there's a higher chance you won't. 

(3.5) Perceptions of reality: Social media and even just traditional TV gives a lot of influence to the people running the platforms or channels. As we can see all around the world, politics is more divisive day by day and a lot of politicians do things to get attention on social media. Is it really a coincidence that politics became more divisive around the same time when social media started being widely used?

(4) Social isolation: While there's some who won't feel this way I feel like deep down most people who stay indoors a lot and on social media and are alone feel lonely and isolated. I think humans are made to interact with each other and just looking at what other people are doing isn't meaningful interaction

Maybe it's just me but personally even though I do spend a lot of time indoors and even a bit on social media the rare times I go outdoors (whether with friends or family) and just take some time away from social media and my room I tend to feel better. "
0,2024-04-13,CMV: There Is No Ethical Reason To Not Reveal Your Ideologies With Your Political Stance (Long),u/Redrolum,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c2xey1/cmv_there_is_no_ethical_reason_to_not_reveal_your/,changemyview,"When discussing politics there is no ethical reason to not reveal your ideology. Gatekeeping that is fundamentally dishonest and with holding poisons the well of any debate you might try.

It takes longer and so much more effort to not say it when it's just two words and in my experience you'll never have any meaningful conversations with someone who isn't proud enough to disclose.

Everyone should have a social and economic ideology. For example I am a eco-lib, or a liberal environmentalist. Liberal is my social and enviro is my economic ideology. It takes some courage to put myself out there and anyone who lacks said bravery doesn't really belong in politics at all. It opens me up to many obvious criticisms such as most believe enviro is inherently bad for the economy and it reveals my inherent biases.

I'd ask everyone begin their reply telling me their two words for their social and economic ideology, but I can also help you figure it out if you want help.

If you don't know it's easy to take something like a political compass test. Either way the most important thing is to begin the journey of self discovery and to be open with everyone about where you're at.

To give you an example of why this is important here is my current political criticism: Progressive isn't a real ideology. It just means progress. There is nothing inherent to it and contrasting it with the other ideologies makes it seem like it's another word for Lefty. There are conservative - progressives, and also being anti-something doesn't make it an ideology to itself. Progressive vs Amish makes sense. Progressive in the term of  being against bringing back a law from 1864 makes sense, but in the context of modern diversity it's quite meaningless.

This criticism would be entirely meaningless if I didn't even know my own ideologies. Complaining about anyone else terms while not knowing my own would be hypocritical gatekeeping and is what I see more often than not.

The obvious bias of those types is that they gatekeep words like with Political Correctness but all words are labels and we'll never have effective communication without labels. Two ideological words can paint a picture that's worth a thousand.

It's so much easier and more productive to just tell everyone your two words and the most succinct definition of them:

Liberal - open minded, tolerant, for free enterprise.

Conservative - for family values.

Libertarian - for deregulation.

Economic socialism - putting production into the hands of the people.

Communist - sharing wealth

The way to world peace is respecting our inherent differences with appropriate non-biased labels not gatekeeping them. For example the Republican party is more at less at war with their selves because MAGA seems like libertarian and deregulating everything and selling bibles are at odds with family values. If both sides were honest about their economic and then social ideologies they could resolve their differences and this method of resolution should become the new social normal. You rarely ever meet a conservative who knows their economic ideology since technically they're still practicing trickle down economics.

Angry replies I get to that are usually from someone who won't disclose their ideologies thus compacting the miscommunication problem."

You ever wonder why such few cases of ""big fights"" with friends exist (they do but not even a fraction of the following) while it's basically a given that you're going to fight with your partner one day or another. I'm not trying to shill casual sex/hookup culture/polyamory etc.I just think the biological evolution of our brain's emotion-processing parts is still stuck back when all we used it for was hunting woolly mammoths and were too concerned with not freezing in the winter or dying from an infection when we were 40 years old to think about friend-zones and long-distance or boredom and falling out of love or being committed and having feelings for someone else or the societal and financial power dynamics that exist within a relationship.OK that was my opinion. If you agreed you can continue to enjoy this wonderful site. However, if you were offended or think I poorly represented my position, I request you keep reading so hopefully I may be able to clear some things up.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# RESPONSIBILITIES

LET ME BE CLEAR, I am not saying we should all abandon/run away from long-term responsibilities and give in to the hedonistic fleeting moments that our brain chemistry makes us feel during the honeymoon phases of meeting new people. I just think with how fast AI is becoming human-like, it may be best to bet that we may be able to realize the dream of having relationships with really intelligent emotionless machines. Sure you may retort with saying that a relationship built on one-sided emotions isn't ""REAL"" but by that metric, so isn't the internet or the 2008 economic crisis (iT wAs tEcHnIcAlLy jUsT a bUnCh oF nUmBeRs gOiNg hAyWiRe).

Now... what I just said in the previous sentence is objectively completely false and a severe misrepresentation/cherry-picking of twistable words to argue in bad faith, but I'm just trying to show that this is exactly how we talk about human relationships. ""Nothing is REAL unless both parties feel it"" (i.e classically brought up in the case of parasocial relationships of fans with their celebrities/content creators) but as is 100% of the case, in many relationships even if one-sided, AT LEAST one party is feeling something. Doesn't that make it real? Maybe not RECIPROCATED but DEFINITELY REAL. So what if we accept that technological companions could allow us to always be the more needy ones in a relationship and that it would BE OK.

# ELECTRICITY

Like, no one would argue that electricity isn't a BASIC NECESSITY today, however if you go back in time to the Great Roman Empire I'm almost sure that even their most open-minded intellectuals would be mortified and disgusted with the idea of such a crippling reliance on an 'uNnAtUrAl' source of energy. I'm sure, the imagery of countless electric poles and seemingly endless black wires spanning over the entire sky and over most of the world population's view of space would prompt even 'ahead of their time' visionaries like Marcus Aurelius to curse the 'dYsToPiAn dEgEnErAcY' of the future generations or they may look down upon us with pity as the 'wEaK cItIzEnS' of a society, increasingly less reliant on manual labor, and in their anger, they would probably try to scare us with doomsday prophecies if we continued to ""act GOD"", and that's just electricity.So before, you dismiss this idea simply because you think it's dystopian, think about it with less of that characteristic human fear we almost always have of new things.

# FRIENDSHIPS

Every human-to-human connection would be as friends, taking out so much pain/self-loathing from the world. All the people who feel ugly/unlovable... won't, because friendships are rarely based on that and as a fairly not-good-looking person myself I can tell you that it's much more easier to dismiss and laugh at the shallowness of people you're considering to be friends who turn out to be vanity-worshipping dum-dums, than someone you're attracted to. Rejection just be hurtin' way too good (and also the logical part of my mind shuts down and starts chanting on the megaphone, ""Kill yourself, you stupid fatso. Why the fuck did you think anyone would be interested?"").

And in this type of primarily friendship-type human-relationship world, if two people decide to pursue something romantic, they can both know that at home there's an always-present, self-sufficient bionic partner waiting for them, unoffended and unbothered, when the human relationship runs it natural course (which it may never, in which case hooray!). It's a win-win-win.

# PARENTHOOD

If we do this, next I'm hoping that there will be an eventual realization that MOST people are not suited to be parents. How is it that there are there 4-year bachelor's degrees that don't leave you useful enough on the job market to flip cheeseburgers (hyperbole, trying to prove a point) but not a degree for parenting? Hell why isn't there a mandatory PhD enforced by the government before you can even think to have a baby. And comprehensive psychological evaluations to check if you even are suitable enough to care for a child.

And then after you pass one, there must be a way to annually/semi-annually have a ""test"" of sorts to present you with case-study situations about difficulties/problems that your child may face and how you would react to them. Answering wrong puts you at risk of your child being taken away so you're always at your toes about being a supportive person to your offspring, and that you don't let your personal biases/trauma/prejudice against certain things get in the way of the love you should be showing your child.

# THE VALUE OF LIFE

If you make it through this screening process it probably means you belong to a very small subset of the human population that ACTUALLY deserve to be parents, and that would also go towards solving the problem of overpopulation, which in turn would ACTUALLY increase the value of a human life.

Look at us, we're 8 billion but everyday thousands of us die, from sickness, crime, war, or even (most depressingly) killing ourselves. The media seemingly cares more about our ""hUmAn rIgHtS"" than it has ever cared in the history of our race, but be honest... we're all just numbers to each other. I watch a video/news story/non-fictional movie of a gruesome murder/assault and feel incredibly bad but an hour later I'm watching cute rabbit videos (fuck off cat people). Because that's just what I have to do. My brain isn't built to contain the full comprehension of mass genocides and systematic oppression on the scale of billions. I have to be a shitty (theoretical/idealistic) human and forget: basically always giving up with, ""What can you do?"" to be a (real/pragmatic) human.

# LOVE

Lastly, I want to talk about human love. Human beings often have this tendency to make something ""holy"" (not in the religious sense but in the ""oh this is something bigger than me and important and actually matters"" sense), when it is difficult but irreplaceable/irremovable from human life. This is true for love, death, disability, sunk cost etc. It's a pretty good deflection from the fact that we're bound by two relatively very static aspects throughout our lives (both as individuals as we grow and on a larger timescale across centuries as truly noticeable evolution happens across tens of thousands to millions of years). The physical laws of our surroundings and the inner workings of our brain, especially our not-so-crucial (in the physical sustenance sense) needs of emotional support/intimacy.

Most people don't love because they truly WANT to, they try to find love because they HAVE TO, to not die from depression and frustration and loneliness. Human-to-human love is a fickle thing and a VERY rare (when natural, unforced and equal in intensity/longevity) occurrence, and most people aren't in THOSE relationships. They wanna believe they are, they so desperately try to convince themselves they are, but they're not. They just feel good because they have someone to share they're thoughts with (again non-crucial need to socialize) and that fades with time and what ultimately becomes the result is a slowly bubbling resentment from one or both participants that could poison even the most decent of human beings into being completely brutal assholes. So many people do a death spiral (never recovering for the rest of their lives) because of the effects caused by their partner's actions, whether it be their untimely death or cheating or a one-sided breakup or even realizing they don't love you as much as you do or the other way around.

# PETS

P.S. Human-animal relationships are a great precedent for the development of a strong one-sided bond (human feelings for their pet) that can result in both parties being happy. Dogs/cats can't understand us even a fraction of what humans can in a long-term relationship, yet they still love us and more importantly, WE LOVE THEM EVEN MORE. People seem to forget, human relationships are often tense because the sheer vocabulary that you can use to cut into your partner's soul is much more potentially damaging than any annoyance a pet might cause you. That's why people rarely ever get upset AT their pets, just maybe on their actions sometimes.

# CONCLUSION

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk, sorry for all the tangential examples. I can very CLEARLY accept that to a lot of smart people, my views and opinions on the matter may be irrational. Hell, they're irrational to me. But I also know that I, being human after all, can have a (consciously and logically) utterly stupid/irrational outlook on a major part of life while strongly FEELING the opposite way which is what's written above, all while being fine never being able to reconcile the two in my head.

# Reddit Post-awareness disclaimers:

These will be added (as per my discretion) as commentors dissect my opinion.

1. Friends do be fighting hard sometimes too, over stupid shit nonetheless.
2. Maybe in the long-term a relationship with non-human entities would be even less fulfilling, especially for people that measure their satisfaction in life by the impact they've had on the world, which for all your interactions with a machine, is zero.
3. Okay that electricity example was way too drawn out, much like this post.
4. Parenthood may be considered a basic right by a lot of people and I get that my proposed restrictions would probably disfavor underprivileged sections of society (unfortunately does sound quite similar to some pretty disturbing precedents like not letting people vote based on education/wealth which would ultimately concentrate the power of propagating your offspring to only the elites in society, leaving the people who aren't allowed to do so without a legacy and proper happy closure on their deathbed)
5. Doom-scrolling is not a problem unique to me but I am often disgusted with myself for the appetite us internet generations have for seeing the absolute worst of humanity, that too not as informative news but as morbid spectacle, all to line some advertiser's pockets, instead of actually catalyzing the public to hold their lawmakers accountable.
6. Fuck cat people once again, standing by that, Don't CMV on that please. /s
7. I guess my point on love really is a point on the ""oh If only I could play GOD"" fantasy. Like that's perfect, but also perfect's not a reality, it's an addictive dream you have when your reality is unbearable.
8. I guess the pets and higher connection by humans vs lower connection by animals point is true but irrelevant for people who value an equal level of connection more than ease/comfort or never having to have difficult conversations in a relationship."

It was Matt King on the other side of the pool in lane 1 who was in control at the 50 meter mark. King, coming from an appearance at 2024 Worlds, ended up third in 48.62. Another pro in the field, Ryan Held, was 2nd to King at the turn but was able to out-split him by over two-tenths on the second half of the race. That gave Held the room he needed to stop the clock 2nd just eight-hundredths behind Dressel in 48.48.  
  
King finished 3rd (48.62), just a hundredth ahead of Indiana’s Rafael Miroslaw.  
  
Hubert Kos won the ‘B’ final, beating Santo Condorelli by .06 seconds, 48.87 to 48.93. Before today, Kos had not broken 50"

Volunteers played the roles of guards and prisoners and lived in a notional prison set up in the basement of the psychology department.  
  
Already in a day those who were in the role of guards began to abuse the ""convicts"".  
  
And people were tortured. Left without food. No water.  
  
Every third guard showed real sadistic tendencies. The experiment was interrupted. And the guards came to their senses. Some were horrified at what they had become. Others were sorry it was over so quickly.  
  
What does that tell us? In a well-fed and prosperous America, ordinary people became sadists in a day. They were given power. And they didn't care that the convicts were innocent!  
  
Two years ago, Ukraine started draft using Territorial Recruiters. Ordinary people. Only with machine guns and the power to change the fate of others.  
  
How quickly did they fall apart?  
  
Recently in Izmail district they caught a boy of 14 years old, put him in a bus, put the muzzle of an automatic weapon to his head. They beat him. Tied his hands behind his back.  
  
Then, having found out how old the boy was, they threw him out on the road. He hasn't drunk or eaten for two days. His back hurts from being hit with a rifle butt.  
  
""An official check is being conducted on the situation with the accusation of the TFC and SP officers in the detention of a minor in Izmail district,"" the TRC said. Already two days is being conducted. They probably offer the kid some plushies. So that he said that he made it all up.  
  
Hang in there, kid.  
  
And the people in pixelated fisherman's clothes seem to have gone completely insane. And there's nothing you can do about it. They've been given power. They get erections when they hit other people. They revel in their position and their total impunity. I can't remember if anyone was punished for beating, for missing people and their deaths ""in basements"".  
  
The Stanford experiment on us continues.  
  
I sincerely feel sorry for the TRC workers. The basement experiment once showed that it's easy to become a sadist. But to go back.... I don't know."""

I was pretty baffled when I was reading comments under a post about mobilization, the entire conversation souded like 12 year olds pretending to have an adult conversation. Or the fact that as soon as you post something negative or even hint at it, you get attacked. For example, there was a BBC article hinting at the fact that Ukraine might lose, and some of the commenter stated saying that BBC is pro Russian etc. It's frustrating to see anything that diverges slightly from the narrative on reddit get down voted and buried. Facts aren't promoted.   
I also noticed some weird thing, where you post something negative, like about corruption in Ukraine and then the top comment on the post is like ""oh, but ruzzia has it worse..."". Like, how does this relate to Ukraine. How does Russia having corruption justify corruption in Ukraine. Or how does Russia having mobilization justify Ukraine shoving men into vans? It feels like at times I'm having a conversation with a tree log. And the changes in narrative on reddit. 2 month ago if you said something about difficulties in draft in Ukraine(and they started long long before that), you get called a Russian troll. Now, since all the media is talking about it, reddit suddenly changes opinion and now, SUDDENLY WITH THE SAME OPINION YOU ARE NOT A RUSSIAN TROLL ANYMORE."

secondly these weapons are not designed for a fight with other adversaries like china where naval might over land forces take precedence. or with insurgents who does not possess tanks .

thirdly you get to test your weapons in a live conflict and also increase production.

the money spend on these weapons go to american workers american contractors american prioduction facilities and american companies.

the increased production capacity will help in the coming cold war.

most importantly you are weakening and destroying a powerful rival nation ,destroying their armed forces, depleting their supply of young men, causing tens of thousands in casualities and having them occuopied and not able to interfere in americas interests. All without putting american soldiers at risk or paying for the soldiers.

If the entire world was redrawn so that everyone within those borders was 100% the same in respect to religion, language, culture, and ethnicity, there'd be 10s of thousands of different countries and they'd be much too small to be sustainable - this lastmost point is important, because African nations NEED to be diverse in order to be large enough to not be reliant on outside powers (i.e. colonized). In Africa, there are 3,000 ethnic groups, 6 language groups, 3 religious traditions (Islam, Christianity, and Traditional African faith - thousands of different sects and offshoots, etc.). If there was a nation-state just for every African ethnicity, there'd be \~20x more African nations than all non-African nations combined. Creating an Africa whose borders were respectful to every people group is logistically impossible and impractical to the point that it's objectively stupid. Random lines and geographic boundaries have just as high of a likelihood of succeeding as any other solution. Any other solution would have just as many problems. 

&#x200B;

There are tons of highly diverse societies that are doing incredibly well, and the nations that colonized Africa are arguably just as diverse as the colonies they left behind. The kingdoms that Europeans colonized were just as diverse as the colonies they left behind. If Africa was never colonized, and the African nations STILL failed, would people be saying ""King Gugulethu Mhlungu's nation of Zuyosososhonilotes because he conquered the nation of Hauhuigkalumo without respect for demographic boundaries.""? No. Just counting their indigenous populations and not their vast immigrant communities; Russia, Spain, UK, France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, and Denmark-Sweden-Norway are all HUGELY diverse. I'd say Spain and Italy are much more diverse than any of the colonies that they left behind. Africa is being colonized again because they can't get their shit together primarily by China, and China is just as diverse as any African country and had huge amounts of outside interference and yet is a world power. The Congo had just as much difficulty as China or Poland and the lastmost two are incredibly successful developed nations."

PLEASE NOTE: This post is not slander against female identifying people. this is a look at our society’s messed up views

The reason i’m thinking about this is because of “Male R*pe jokes & why no one cares” on youtube.

People don’t think that a man could possibly be r*ped because men are stronger or something similar, that is not the case. There are so many SA victims or just Assault victims in general that are male identifying. 

I have a friend who was SA’d, she’s female and no one was saying anything bad about it(which is good) but similarly when i hear men open up about their stories they are laughed and ridiculed. people say things like “you’re lucky”

NO! that is insanely fucked up. 

men can be assaulted, r*ped and taken advantage of the same as women.

and yes, it may happen to women more( if anyone has statistics that’d be amazing, i’m thinking of making a video on this) but that may only be because men are too scared too come forward about this.

and then let’s take a look at the justice system

there are stories every. single. day about men who have been released from prison after being falsely accused. 

A woman can just say “that man assaulted me” and the man’s life is completely uprooted

Personally, i am scared to talk/date women because of that fact, i’m scared that if i do something wrong i will be accused and thrown in jail

i don’t know  if i’m allowed to specifically mention it but there was a recent story about a female teacher taking advantage of a 14 year old and she got a sweetheart plea deal and faced little to no repercussions.

What the hell society

we all know that if a male did the same thing he’d be facing life and probably get killed in prison

There’s been a whole slew of article suggesting that Ukraine is now in a critical situation in the war:

- [The War Is Not Going Well for Ukraine - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/04/kyiv-spring-ukraine-military-aid/678013/)

- [Ukraine air defences overwhelmed as Russia pounds power stations - The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/13/ukraine-air-defences-overwhelmed-as-russia-pounds-power-stations)

So this paints a clear picture for me: the Ukrainian military, depleted of manpower (the average age of a Ukrainian soldier is now in their mid-40s) and materiel, is facing imminent collapse of their front lines. The Russians, whether tomorrow or during their summer offensive, are heavily favored to create a breakthrough that will allow them to capture swaths of Ukrainian territory, hell maybe even capture Kharkiv by the end of the year.

This is not the first time I’ve been a doomer vis a vis Ukraine’s prospects. When the invasion started, I was one of the people who thought Russia will capture Kyiv in three days, and was very pleasantly surprised that the ferocious Ukrainian resistance fought the Russians back. I became even more optimistic with the recapture of Kharkiv and Kherson oblasts in the fall of 2022.

But now it seems like my initial prediction was correct. It might’ve taken the Russians three years instead of three days, but they now have a clear path to victory: throw hundreds of thousands of their own men into the meat grinder to attrit the Ukrainians, but once the attrition is complete they have the country wide open for the taking.

Useful idiots like Donald Trump (the main reason why American aid to Ukraine stopped in the first place) and Elon Musk think that Ukraine can settle for a negotiated peace. Unfortunately for them and Ukraine, Putin will have none of that. He is still pursuing his maximalist goals of conquering, or at least vassalizing, all of Ukraine (aside from maybe a rump state to the West). Why should he settle for less when he’s clearing on the path of winning it all? He clearly doesn’t care about the lives of his citizens he’s sending into the meat grinder; it’s all a sacrifice for the greater good of fulfilling Russia’s destiny of restoring the Triune Russian Nation.

Obviously Ukraine won’t settle for surrender either, and it has the gumption to fight to the last man. But now Ukraine faces a fate akin to what happened to Paraguay after the War of the Triple Alliance, where 90% of the male population was killed.

And on top of all that, Putin has had his worldview - and my fears - vindicated: that the collective West is too divided and decadent to face the great authoritarian powers like Russia and China. At the beginning it seemed like he was wrong, as the West did stand in solidarity with Ukraine, provided aid, and imposed mega-sanctions on Russia. But now we see that this strength and unity has completely frayed.

The US is the number one culprit of course; the Republicans, wishing they could emulate Russia in how they bash gay people, have completely blocked Ukrainian aid. But even the Biden administration is doing stuff like [telling Ukraine not to hit Russian oil refineries because it would make gas prices go up](https://www.ft.com/content/98f15b60-bc4d-4d3c-9e57-cbdde122ac0c). It’s truly an indictment of how soft the American people are (and how bad American car dependency is, though that’s a separate thread) that they will let fascism succeed because it will make the price of dino juice go up.

Europe at least still has its head in the game, with countries like the UK and Czechia promising additional ammo and weapons systems. But there’s only so much they can provide without the American juggernaut behind them; despite having a bigger economy on paper, the EU simply can’t keep up with the millions of shells that the Russians are now producing.

So yeah, you had a nice run Ukraine; we hoped that this could be your War of Independence, but this turned out to be anything but. And congratulations Putin, for becoming the king of the ashes that is the Russian Mir, and ensuring the twilight of democracy and sovereignty around the world."
0,2024-04-13,CMV: All-in pricing is consumer-unfriendly,u/GotAJeepNeedAJeep,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c3a712/cmv_allin_pricing_is_consumerunfriendly/,changemyview,"All-in pricing means, generally speaking, that the first price the customer sees is the total price with any and all fees, surcharges, etc. already baked-in. 

This pricing philosophy applies to lots of industries, as I write this post I am primarily thinking of hospitality and live entertainment, but am open to argument / discussion about how this plays out in other situations. 

Advocacy for all-in pricing is in vogue right now, with resturants being lobbied to remove surcharges and auto-grats from their menus, and all-in ticketing price laws taking effect in states like NY and TN. 

While I get the feeling of ""being tricked"" when you see the final price of a purchase, it just blows my mind that consumers are advocating to recieve less information about what they're buying. I *want* to know what portion of my ticket fee is going to the venue or Ticketmaster and not the artist; I *want* to know what portion of my bill is a tip actually going to the server and not the bottom line; I *want* to know what portion of my Air B&B tab is going to a ""cleaning fee"". This knowledge gives me power as a consumer; I can judge accurately whether my favorite artist is responsible for the price of their ticket, which portion of my bill I should dispute if the service is subpar, and how seriously I should clean my Air B&B before I depart. 

As long as I see the full total before I charge my card, I'm good. I don't understand why everyone is arguing to get less information about what they're buying. Most major companies support these initiatives which should tell you something about whose hands' all-in pricing plays into. 

Eager to hear thoughts and opinions on this one. Note that I am *not* talking about ""hidden fees"" wherein the fee is not revealed until after the service is rendered and payment being asked for. "

The universe doesn't care about us. If a rouge planet or comet had destroyed earth's biosphere permanently 50 million years ago the rest of the universe would roll on like nothing happened.  
So part of our lot in life is to give human life its meaning, as it matters very much to us. Even if that meaning is both arbitrary and subjective, we create taboos and rules to protect it, but we also create art to help convey the meaning of that subjective experience to each other.  
We see a sunrise, or a shoreline, or a ship, or busy street and call it beautiful. But that sunrise is just electromagnetic waves being refracted by the atmosphere. What gives it its meaning, what gives it its beauty is us. It's the subjective experience of the artist.  
An AI, creating a conglomeration of a thousand different sunsets has no human experience of a sunset, so it's art is meaningless, no matter how accurate.  
AI can't create art, but it can create products. Which is why I suspect the folks behind it are so excited and are raising so much capital. They want to sell you more products. That's all it is. They dont see humanity as meaning anything more than being consumers of products and services.

Essentially holding them hostage. 

I understand groceries are a necessity (and that should be sufficient motivation for lawmakers to address the issues with crime instead of hand waving people's complaints aside.) but it's also completely understandable that grocers don't want to stay in high crime areas and they can't be forced to. It is San Francisco Lawmakers' responsibility to maintain communities that businesses will want to be a part of and if they are unable to do so then I think that should be grounds for removal. 

I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts though. This seems absolutely bonkers to me.

0,2024-04-13,CMV: There is no good reason to think that George Floyd’s death was racially motivated. ,u/Joel_H_Embiid,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c3bixm/cmv_there_is_no_good_reason_to_think_that_george/,changemyview,"Obviously in many cases we aren’t able to directly assess the motives of a perpetrator and there are reasons as to why the perpetrator wouldn’t admit to being racist. I will still say, for what it’s worth that there is no evidence to my knowledge to suggest Chauvin’s motives were racially inspired.

People have pointed to the fact that the Minnespolis police was found to have acted worse towards black people, if I recall correctly. This evidence on its own is not as strong as people think, in my view, but it is undeniably something. Unfortunately, we have extra information on Chauvin that makes us believe that Floyd’s race had nothing to do with Chauvin’s actions.

Chauvin was known to have been a violent police officer, who on several occasions acted violently, against people of many races. This explanation suffices to explain his actions and there simply is no reason to invoke racism at all. We have no evidence that Chauvin was racially biased at all and we have several known reasons for strongly believing that he was in general violent.

Thus, I submit that the evidence that Floyd’s death was racially motivated is, in my view, non-existent"
0,2024-04-13,"CMV: My ""compensation conjecture"" is true, ""Women who are less physically attractive will be more likely to 'compensate' for this by developing positive personality traits, hobbies and talents.""",u/Subcomfreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c3c4dt/cmv_my_compensation_conjecture_is_true_women_who/,changemyview,"This is a general heuristic. It is not universally true, and is only a general rule of thumb. Exception may exist, but I believe this to be I think that generally this pattern emerges.

Essentially my idea is that due to the fact that less physically attractive women will have a harder time finding a mate, they must ""compensate"" with other traits in order to do so. This will usually require time and skill to achieve (which is itself a positive trait too). It seems obvious to me, for example, that a less attractive woman will have to develop greater skill at doing their make-up. Likewise because men won't be as PHYSICALLY attracted to them as strongly, they must develop other skill and talents that will attract men in order to make up for the RELEATIVE deficit in attractiveness.

A few thought experiments to get clear on why I believe this to be true.  


First situation:

Woman who is physically attractive and has good talents, hobbies, and character.

Woman who is physically attractive and does NOT have good talents, hobbies, and character.

&#x200B;

100% of the time, all else being equal, you will pick the first woman, and not the second. If attractiveness is held constant, you will pick the one with better other traits (why wouldn't you!).   


Second situation:

Woman who is physically attractive and has X, Y, Z talents and personality traits.

Woman who is less physically attractive and ALSO HAS THE SAME X, Y, Z talents and personality traits.

&#x200B;

100% of the time, all else being equal, you will pick the first woman and not the second. If other traits are held constant you will pick the one with higher attractiveness (why wouldn't you!)...

&#x200B;

However, reality is often

Third Situation:

&#x200B;

A woman who is attractive and has some traits

A woman who is less attractive with different traits.

&#x200B;

GIVEN THE FACT THAT ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL YOU PICK THE MORE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN, the only way the less attractive woman can compete here  is to make up for this selection preference by making her other traits ""compensate"" for the RELATIVE deficit in attractiveness. Therefor, due to these selection pressures and preferences women who are less physically attractive will be more motivated to develop traits that men will appreciate in order to find a mate.

&#x200B;

Corollary 1: ""The more attractive a woman is, the less likely she is to have positive traits, and the more likely she is to have negative traits.""

Many men will be willing to put up with a ditzy, talent-less, and annoying woman in exchange for the sexual attractiveness and access to sex... therefore, there is little motivation for an attractive woman to develop positive traits (outside of her own desires and personal interests and fancies) because there will always be another man who will put up with her in exchange for banging the hottie. Her pull is large enough to find a mate based on attractiveness alone. Therefore, we should suspect that attractive women have fewer positive traits beyond attractiveness, and more negative traits because there is no reason to put in the effort to change when she can just go back on the market and find a man who will be willing to suffer those negative attributes.

&#x200B;

Corollary 2: ""A woman's attractiveness is inversely correlated with other positive traits, and positive traits are correlated with being less attractive.""

 This seems to be a straight-forward implication of all of the above.

&#x200B;

Think about it this way: why would a man stay with or pick an unattractive woman when he could have an attractive one IF THERE ISN'T SOME OTHER POSITIVE TRAIT THAT THE LESS ATTRACTIVE WOMAN HAS THAT MORE ATTRACTIVE WOMEN ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE. What is keeping the man from rolling the dice again, or choosing to be in a relationship with an unattractive woman over an attractive one?

&#x200B;

Why would a woman pick a poorer man over a richer man if the poorer didn't bring something else to the table!? Why would the woman pick the short man over the tall man if the short man didn't bring something else that she values!? Why would a woman stay with a dick of a man if she could get a more attractive one that wasn't a dick!? The same ought be true for women as it is for men... 

\----

Things that will NOT change my mind: 

""but not all men."", exceptions prove the rule, not the other way around. This is not an iron law, but instead is a general phenomenon. 

""People have different views of attractiveness"" might be true, but we all know that, generally speaking, certain physical features and body types are considered more attractive to others. IT IS ABOUT GENERAL ABILITY TO ATTRACT A MATE FROM THE TOTAL POOL OF MEN, AND NOT ABOUT THIS OR THAT PARTICULAR MAN.

""But this woman that I know is really nice and pretty!"" is anecdotal and doesn't disprove the general rule of thumb I am forwarding here."
0,2024-04-13,CMV: Pitbulls and other 'XL bully breeds' should be illegal to own and breed.,u/Tibbenator,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c3caaf/cmv_pitbulls_and_other_xl_bully_breeds_should_be/,changemyview,"Pitbulls have been bred for generations for the sole purpose of being a fighting dog. The are by far the most dangerous dog breed out there and pose a general threat to anyone around them. Making this breed illegal to own or breed is in the best interest of public safety and reducing the number of dogs in kennels.

Pitbulls are bred to be fighting dogs and have been for centuries. Aggressive behavior towards people and other animals is literally genetic. They are an inherently aggressive breed. If you don't believe it is genetic to them, consider that many pointer breeds will instinctively point as young as 8 weeks old and with no human training. This is because these dogs have been selectively bred to do exactly this, it is as natural to them as fighting is to a pitbull.

Pitbulls represent 22% of all dog attacks and 28% of fatal attack. More than any other breed. 

Pitbulls disproportionately represent the number of dogs in kennels and adoption centers. Many pit bulls are returned multiple times or never adopted out which is frankly inhumane to the dog. Side tangent: some shelters have taken to mislabeling pitbulls as ""mixed breed"" to avoid the negative reputation that pitbulls have. Some shelters even omit or lie about a dogs previous history so that they can get it adopted. This is completely irresponsible and it puts innocent people and other animals at risk."

0,2024-04-13,CMV: True romantic love does not exist and committing to someone is pointless.,u/Realistic_Outcome209,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c3dzjo/cmv_true_romantic_love_does_not_exist_and/,changemyview,"I know the hopeless romantics are not going to like this but over the course of my own experiences, formal education and other bits of information, I’ve come to believe that “true love” the way we know it of two people living “happily ever after” does not exist. It’s just a feel good thing we use in life.

From the aspect of partners always being attracted to others, feelings being temporary and then such a high number of romantic elationships ending up separated or divorced. I really find it hard to believe “true love” or even monogamy is real. 

Another example is the amount of people that enjoy sleeping around, whether it be man or woman. People enjoy it and then suddenly flip a switch and want to be with one person… but it doesn’t add up that people just flip a switch like that and stop enjoying it, other than societal pressures, etc. nearly everyone wants to sleep with people that aren’t their partner and people have different lines for it. I’m not frowning upon it but again, it feels like we’re lying to ourselves about our nature. 

With all this, I feel apart from tax benefits (potentially), marriage is completely pointless (was more about finances and property since its inception and has become about spending $$) and so is actually committing to someone. I feel most people can enjoy the connection while it lasts but understand it will be temporary like everything in life. “True love” like it is portrayed in movies and romance novels does not exist. I feel if you get too comfortable with anyone, you will get burned and find out this isn’t how we humans operate.

I’m happy to hear your takes.

0,2024-04-13,CMV: Hal isn’t an incel nor did he became a villain because Roxanne rejected him.,u/JoshuaKpatakpa04,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c3egi2/cmv_hal_isnt_an_incel_nor_did_he_became_a_villain/,changemyview,"I don’t really think that Hal from Megamind is an incel nor did he became one because Roxanne rejected him. Sure he’s rather gives off the creepy vibe but I don’t think he was intending to be malicious and I will explain why. 

First we need to look at the ways how Hal talks to Roxanne in the film. The many quotes he uses is “No no no that’s the best part it will be just like you and me !”. Or he says “I’ll be watching like a dingo watches a baby”. Now my final point for this first one is that when he asks out Roxanne to his house in a bouncy castle Roxanne is a bit creeped out and politely rejects. The next scene is Hal goes back to the van and vents his frustration on his issues and that he acknowledges woman don’t like bouncy castle. This is what makes me feel like Hal isn’t an Incel while he did make Roxanne feel uncomfortable I don’t believe that Hal intended to. I truly think Hal was a guy who actually loved Roxanne but he just struggled on how to communicate with woman which turned her off. 

Now my second part is coming to the scenes where Hal uses his powers. In one scene we see that Roxanne and Bernard (who is Megamind under disguise) are dating each other. We see Hal is in the background and sadly realises that Roxanne is in love with another guy and will never love him. Hal depressed just flies off into the distance and does his own thing by doing petty crime and stealing a couple of things. So basically we’ve just seen Hal literally back off from her and just kept to himself so he’s ultimately accepted that Roxanne isn’t into him. 

Then we have Hal slowly descend into villainy one of the acts he does is that he kidnaps Roxanne. I think he’s not doing out of malice but he’s doing it to try lure out Megamind so he can fight the guy. 

For Hal’s descent into villainy it makes a lot of sense in his defense. Megamind and minion approached Hal and lied to him saying that they were his space parents and he has powers. So they train him in learning to hone his abilities and things go well. Hal goes and finds Roxanne and dangles her around with his powers which scares her (understandable what Hal is doing here is wrong and he should have handled it in a better way). So he reveals himself and of course Roxanne once again rejects him and flies off. 

We see Hal fly away when he sees Roxanne talking to Bernard he flies away. Now what sets in the trigger is that Hal was minding his own business and hadn’t become a full on villain. Megamind busts in and tries to get Hal to become the hero, fight Megamind and save the day. But Megamind reverse into space dad and Hal realises that Megamind has been tricking him the entire time. So Roxanne would go out with the man who not only terrorised but also killed Metro Man the hero of the city. So Hal would realise he was a fool in Megaminds game and all of that would make anyone snap. 

I do implore people to change my mind on this as I could be wrong anyways I hope you enjoy reading it."

2. Please answer this question: Consider a hypothetical that illustrates #1. Imagine a world where some countries had the death penalty for apostasy from Christianity. Imagine all the Christians in these countries that realized that Islam is the truth. Question: Would you want them to be able to speak openly about their suffering from and criticism of Christianity, for self-therapy and for helping others avoid the suffering they faced?"

Do not care about Adult women ~~having inappropriate relationships with a young boy~~ Raping a young boy. Most men blame women on “not caring about men’s problems” when most men don’t even care about men’s problems.  The reason why I say this is because when I see these news articles and stories about an adult woman raping a young girl boy- **Every single man justifies this in some fanatical way, wishing it was them and downplaying male sexual assault by saying that it’s In a man’s nature to be sexual and that men and women are different**. 

As an 18 year old male, I just feel more comfortable around women, because I just harbor disgust from the lack of care that men provide when it comes to serious stuff like this I.e(emotional support, friendships, bonding, having fun, showing basic friendly non homosexual affection). When I scroll on YouTube and I see a female raping a young male, and the female **predator** is shown on the thumbnail. I always scroll past, and just ignore it, and even I, myself don’t care. Because it’s so predictable what I’m going to expect. Lesser sentence, Nobody taking it seriously, everyone downplaying it as a joke, praising the boy for being a victim. This world is a joke and I would honestly would have wanted my mother to have the abortion if I knew this is how life would’ve turned out."

Bigger musicians may not be making as much money as they did from music sales (I can't imagine smaller musicians were ever making that much money), and touring can be difficult and expensive, but it diversifies music by bringing in many more artists to the front (there's only one Taylor Swift at the end of the day, she can only be in one place at a time)."

If you don't know, OPEC is a coalition of major oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Venezuela. During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, OPEC got really upset with the United States and other Western countries for supporting Israel in their war against other Arab states OPEC was heavily aligned with. To show their dissatisfaction, they slapped an embargo on oil exports to these countries. The decision was also done to flex their muscles if you will to allow fairer prices on their oil without fear of intervention by the US. This caused a massive shock in the global oil market, leading to crazy high prices and shortages. It was a big deal because many countries, especially in the West, relied heavily on imported oil.

Back to my argument. Convincing me Israel is in the right in the Yom Kippur War isn't how you're gonna change my mind, both sides were heavily at fault the way I see it. To change my mind, you have to convince me that after the US sided against Arab states during a major military conflict, gave them unfavorable treatment in post-war negotiations, and had consistently interfered with the region to achieve better prices on oil, the Arabs were still supposed to sell oil to the US.

A few notes: Yes, none of the nation's directly involved in the Yom Kippur war were OPEC member states, but it goes without saying they had VERY strong cultural and political ties with Saudi Arabia and other Arabic/Muslim members who dominated OPEC at the time. Additionally, I'm aware that not all OPEC member states are Arabic or Muslim."

Knowledge is what humanity can reasonably know

Belief is what an individual person can reasonably know

Math is truth

Science brings us to 99.999 % confidence but never achieves truth. When variables are isolated and experiments are repeatable, we can things true and they reasonably are if the science was done well

Empiricists try not to spend any time talking about unfalsifiable things. If there's no test we can do to make something come back as false, The topic is thrown away in terms of Truth seeking. ""Whatever explanation of causality you're thinking of is just as likely as infinite explanations"" is probably what's going through the empiricists heads. They would try to portray themselves as agnostic when really they are a skeptic. 

Agnostic is 50% confident, meaning you don't think it's more likely or less likely than not to be true. Perfectly in the middle. 

My argument is that knowledge builds on itself and when an idea is cohesive with other empirically known things, you can reasonably lean towards belief over disbelief even if not yet testable. It can't be spoken about like it's a truth, but you can reasonably believe it as an individual (greater than 50% confidence) until contradictory evidence or lack of coherency is presented. 

This is a common point of contention is theology debates. 

In other words 

Hypothesis A is unfalsifiable 

Hypothesis A: The observable universe is inside of a black hole 

Empirically known confluences:

- The density of the observable universe is it the correct density to create a black hole 
- our universe has an edge you can't see past, Black holes have an edge you wouldn't be able to see past from the inside. 

Someone could add a key difference between our universe and black holes that lowers your confidence. This would be contradictory evidence. If you stack the things in favor and in opposition with your idea, you can reasonably increase your confidence or decrease it on an unfalsifiable topic.

But most scientific ideas were unfalsifiable at one point. If someone in 500 BC had a hypothesis that two stones have gravity between them, pulling them very slightly towards each other, he wasn't able to measure that until we had the telescope to look at bigger masses. Technology made it falsifiable.

When you're still at a point in your technology where a topic is unfalsifiable, my argument is that confluence of other empirically known things without a contradiction can lean your internal belief system slightly towards ""this is likely as a truth"". So humanity can be 50% confident or agnostic and you can be reasonably 55% confident in a truth, if you see a broader cohesiveness. If you apply coherency correctly I think you can be ahead of science in your beliefs. I think you can believe things that won't be proved for another hundred years by taking a holistic view of what we do know and finding patterns and cohesiveness in it. 

The skeptics and hardcore empiricists / atheists hate this idea. Epistemology as a whole is not 100% agreed on, but I think the proof is in the pudding. The idea of the atom was logically deduced before the empirical evidence of the atom came into light as falsifiable. 

Isaac Newton believed in God and he was a very smart man. Could he have had a broader cohesive understanding of the universe that led him to that? 
Will he be proved right and everyone else with science one day? I think so. Even if we can't scientifically speak to it now with perfectly isolated variables and repeatable testing. 

Not trying to spark a theology debate but just trying to understand if there's a huge logical fallacy that I'm missing with this way of thinking. "

One, the kind where you put whole pieces, like pepperoni slices. Two, the kind where you need to break up the topping first, like sausage bits.

People are treating pineapple like it’s a type one topping, putting those whole thick slices on it and overpowering all the other tastes and flavors inside, when they should be treating it like two, cutting it up and spreading the tiny pieces around so that their flavor mix’s and blends in with the whole pizza.

What is Starship Troopers? An intentionally campy military film with teem romcom *elements*. The Terran Federation has some militaristic aspects, seeing as its at war, but in many ways its more fair and egalitarian than modern society. When the Massacre on Klendathu ends, the Sky Marshall steps down and is replaced by a black woman. Open debate is encouraged, and a reporter even contradicts the official narrative on live TV (before Rico says,*""I'm from Buenos Aires and I say KILL EM ALL""*) 

There is live reporting from the frontline, a level of truth and honesty that we are intentionally deprived of in the modern day, with official casualty reports differing by up a multiple of ten to twenty (Gaza, Tigray, potentially civilian casualties in Ukraine) VS Klendathu where Star Fleet Command knows the exact casualty count down to names and numbers by the next day (100,000 KIA per hour) 

Compare this, also to historical fascist regimes, and we still don't know the exact amount of dead from the Battle of Stalingrad, it may be off by a factor of several thousand. 

In fact, its very probable the only thing that changed was the way a couple scenes were shot, the costume design, and some of the finer details of the plot, which is not enough to transform the film into a ""satire of fascism"". Fascism is when the state, owned by a single political party, has complete control of the lives of its citizens, what beliefs people are allowed to hold, where they're employed, and what they're allowed to do all under the guise of transforming society into an idealized (right wing) version of its self.

So I'm not too familiar with passport bros but I am familiar with the loneliness epidemic and the discourse surrounding how it affects men. From my understanding, passport bros are Western men who want to move abroad so that they can marry a woman from a more patriarchal society, often less developed than their country of origin.

I did a bit of searching on this phenomenon on reddit and I read that while many regions such as Africa and Latin America have negative perceptions on them, Southeast Asia is more receptive and would even clap back if one criticizes passport bros.  
I work on non-profit work and observed the political scene in Southeast Asia and after reading about SEA's situation with passport bros, I started to piece two and two together. Based on what I've seen, Southeast Asia isn't a fan of actively retaliating. We are in a harmonial mindset where we would rather stand side by side and provide mutual support over directly dealing with oppressive forces. Add patriarchy to that and SEA becomes fertile soil for passport bros, where its residents accept foreigners who have the same patriarchal mindsets as them, and it becomes a bonus when they have more money due to their country of origin. Seeing this playing out in the future would be interesting, indeed.  
With all that being said, I'm asking you to change my mind for two things: a. Southeast Asia has a complacency culture that is harmful to women (and minorities to an extent) in the long run and b. Southeast Asia is the best place for passport bros, specifically the ones who are more patriarchal than most people of their country of origin"

Essentially saying that what is on social media is not the majority opinion . Take dating for instance. On social media you see a lot of women against the whole 50/50 thing , or women essentially commodifying themselves meaning their time comes with a financial price. This specific opinion may not be widely held in the real world but a different phenomenon which is women having a deep distrust for men in relationships or disliking guys that treat them well is also widely seen on the internet and it has thousands and thousands of likes and common sentiments being expressed. 

Another thing is guys and masculinity, the andrew tate bs and guys thinking modern women aren’t marriage material is also widespread on social media . They get millions of likes and comments as well. How is this not representative of a large and significant portion of the population? 

The media we engage with effects us in a sort of loop. Popular opinions on social media can and often do become popular opinions in real life. Politics and sports takes are good examples of this. People think murder and all of these other negative things are much more prominent because social media amplifies these phenomena. The same goes with other opinions as well. Popular clothes, popular opinions, artists etc on social media all are reflected in society . I think social media opinions may be becoming more and more of a reality daily. 

Tldr: social media actually reflects reality because it influences so many peoples opinions which in turn leads to those popular opinions and phenomena on social media being reflected in reality."

I also have a theory for the job market, people who can use AI, will replace the people which don't. At least in tech.

There are only two rules for adults dating: Date other adults, and consent. As long as both parties are **older than 18 years old**, age is just a number. I am saying all of this as 23 year old. However, I had such a belief since I was basicall 19 or so. I will be talking in first person for simplicity's sake.

Just for the record tho: Never dated anyone significantly (or even slightly) older than me. And the youngest I dated, is 1 year older than me where I was 17 at the time.

Also for simplicity I will not talk about double standards between men and women that exist. They are a thing yes. But still, the ""don't date someone significantly younger"" applies to both genders as far as I can tell. At least somewhat.

&#x200B;

Here are my arguments:

&#x200B;

**1) Removal of agency.**

I am 23 years old. 5 years ago, I got the right to vote. I can choose the future of an entire country (Obligatory, I am not American). But no, deciding that I want to fuck a woman (or man) that is 40 years older than me, this is where you draw the fucking line. 

I can legaly sign my own paperwork, drink alcohol, watch porn, get a sex worker, do my own taxes, open a bank account, legaly find a job, buy a house and open a business if chance comes. How's dating any different?

I think I can manage to decide who I like to fuck and who I don't. I have full agency of my actions in so many much more important ways.

&#x200B;

**2) ""But young adults are still too immature so it is immoral for someone older to date them""**

And there I may ask: When someone is mature then?

Are we supposed to take maturity tests before dating?

Also for my personal case: I have ADHD. According to some people [here](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/brain-matures-few-years-late-adhd-follows-normal-pattern) and [here](https://ceril.net/index.php/articulos?id=621) also [here](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/emotional-maturity-and-adjustment-in-adhd-children-7352.html) I am considered a bit younger emotionally than most adults, at least in some cases. 

By that logic, nobody should be allowed to date me for a long time and those who dated me in the past are creepy predators. My friends are weirdos, even tho I am among the older ones in my group.

In my country one of the requirements to get into a university is to be at least 18 years old. When I joined university I had all the requirements at the age of 18 (Higher education is mostly free in my country). And I worked hard to get there. I fucking \*earned\* it all by myself.

How is that not ableist and elitistic, ageist, whatever to view younger adults as more incapable???

Should we all take maturity tests for every single thing we want to do?

&#x200B;

**3) ""But older people will manipulate you. You don't have enough world experience""**

Let's say that such a thing is likely. Which it is, regardless of age-gap. Being a toxic, manipulative piece of shit doesn't have much of an age really (between adults obviously)

If you care so much about me and people of my age bracket not getting taken advantage of over ""power dynamics"" and other stupid buzzwords, then why not tell me what to look out for in order to avoid issues in the first place.  You don't know my character. You know nothing about me. And you judge me as if I did not make my \*\*own\*\* choices.

I am old enough, I can understand. But society pretends to strongly discourage relationships like these in the first place.

Why? Because they think that I (and others in my age bracket) am too stupid to make my own decisions. 

Again. This is an insult. It hurts my pride. And probably I am not alone on this as well.

Again the reason for posting this (and most of my posts here, tbh), is to see if there's any flaw in my arguments and my line of thinking. I wanna take a prespective."

On paper, this sounds good (it does not). As a matter of pragmatic expedience however, it's a terrible idea. We're effectively choosing to let countless criminals off the hook, when they would have admitted to their crimes if only we hadn't advised them to stay silent and lawyer up. Not only is this insulting to the victims, it also leads to far lengthier legal proceedings than would be the case if the criminal just confessed.

I understand why people are in favor of Miranda warnings (actually I don't). But as a society we should be trying to get criminals in jail, not trying our hardest to assist them in avoiding the sentence they deserve. The rights of criminals matter, but they shouldn't go at the expense of the rights of the victims.

Iran gets a lot of street cred on the Arab Main Street for attacking ""the nation of genocide.""

It has shored up support for the regime at home and humiliated its biggest rivals, the Gulf Monarchies, who were forced to publicly align themselves with Israel.

&#x200B;

On the other hand, Israel's biggest enemy at the moment is not Iran - it is Western public opinion. It definitely gained sympathy in the US and Europe last night as being able to present itself as the victim of aggression. For example, it now looks increasingly likely that it will immediately receive extra funding from Washington. It has conclusively demonstrated that its neighbours are now all much  more closely aligned with it than with the Iran bloc. And militarily, what happened was an absolute triumph for the IDF. Hundreds of missiles, but zero deaths  (I think? this seems to be disputed on Twitter)  and essentially no damage"

I've been permanently banned from a couple of subs when the rules were very general but the subs took a very specific (which is to say ideologically narrow) interpretation of the rules.

In one such case, I appealed my ban, and they came back at me for rejecting reality. I responded with several links to academic, peer reviewed studies. They suggested I was modmailing and harassing them. Honestly, my point in sending the studies wasn't even to change their mind, it was just to point out that my position was justifiable given the current scientific literature.


If this was a case where the rules were specific about the ideological slant of the sub, I would understand. However, nothing in the name of the sub or the rules as they are currently listed would suggest to most reasonable people across the ideological spectrum that I had broken a specific rule.

This is where my position comes in. I think Reddit should have an avenue for appealing abusive bans and overriding bans that do not substantially follow the rules of the sub.

The rules of a sub can be basically anything as long as you are honest about the purpose of your sub and truthful about the scope of your rules. But if you ban in a way not justified by your rules, I should be able to go over your head on it."

I believe that at the rate China can manufacture and develop products is because of their openness to share ideas and help eachother vs keeping everything a big secret and locking up intellectual property.  I'm going to refer to this fascinating documentary:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGJ5cZnoodY)  


The documentary highlights how start-ups in the US take absolutely forever to get a product to market because they have to have board meetings, look up hardware, keep everything a secret, go back and forth with a supplier etc before any actual development gets done. In China, you can go to an electronics market and find every single piece of hardware that you commonly see over here. You can order a basic circuit board, then talk with the person who will talk to other people, who will work together and customize the circuit board with the needed components. You need 100 boards with a timer, voltage regulator, and a digital display? They'll work together and solder it up for you on the spot. 

As somebody who 3D prints things and sells my own designs online, I've come across many copycats who have literally cloned my design and tried to sell it on Facebook. The reason I'm not bothered by this is because they don't have the capacity or setup to make the product, accept payment from any country, then ship it worldwide. Since I sell it through Etsy, the process is super simple for people to purchase it. This is why China will always win. 

One example of this is things like 3D printers. For years they were extremely expensive, until the patent for them expired in 2014. Then China started making them and the products started flying off the shelves. Look at how cheap you can get one for now. They're all made with components that are of an open nature, such as arduino. 

  
An other example is vehicles. Once BYD is able to pass safety ratings and sell vehicles in north america, they will probably dominate. "

The number of young people in today's generation with a genuine interest in literature must be at an all-time low, even with the effort many parents make.

It must also be said that the writers are irrelevant to today's youth and are not present in our 21st century culture. Teenagers know all the sportsmen, actors and youtubers, but they don't know any writers.

Kids who have never read need to read books of at least 300 pages and answer unnecessarily complicated questions.

One of the questions I have to answer is: ""Compare the reactions of Baltasar, Blimunda and Bartolomeu to the musician's doubt about the possibility of the machine leaving the cellar"".

Why I need to compare the reactions of people? 

Many of the questions are about metaphors and other things that are rarely needed these days, such as why the character did this or that. All young people want to know why they know this and find no practical use for it.

I think we should replace literary education with more useful things like computer science, or simply reduce the time spent in class.

I grew up in a fairly stable middle class household, parents divorced in my early teens. I joined the US military at 18, served for a few years, and travelled around the country. After my service I started college and am soon entering my senior year. Why am I telling you all this?

I've always considered myself a highly independent person. I've also figured out a lot of things in my life on my own, to include how to rent an apartment, saving for retirement and amassing decent wealth for my age, entering and being successful in school, having a fair number of romantic partners. By many metrics of modern masculinity, I've done well for myself. But this also leaves me confused as to what men are missing from their lives or what they're having a crisis over.

I've never felt the need to have someone validate my masculinity (as it seems that needing someone else for that kinda defeats the point). Truth be told, ""being masculine"" has never really mattered to me much because its always seemed to be buying in to what someone else thinks is a necessary way to live your life--which returns me to my independence point. The rise of influencers and the manosphere has also seemed to be a weird proxy for mentors in many men's lives, which has always seemed to be a case of being far too online for too long in my opinion. I've also never really leaned on many mentors in my life, but that is probably by own bias showing, I'm sure many people get a lot of guidance out of mentor figures.

This altogether is to say that it seems that this crisis of masculinity is at its core a crisis of independence and men unable or unwilling to figure out their lives for themselves. Perhaps it was the military that ultimately gave me this independent foundation, but I think that proves my point--that it is independence and what it gives you than anything that masculinity is doing for people. The point is not that masculinity is failing or unstable, but that men are unable to be independent and take charge of their independence for themselves. Why, I'm not sure exactly--rent is high and wages are low, but women seemingly aren't having as much of a crisis about themselves these days. Many seem to be enjoying and embracing independence instead.

I'm open to the idea that I'm approaching this from the wrong angle though, happy to hear everyone's thoughts."

&#x200B;

now im sure that this is a reason for many to prefer cats over dogs, because cats are more independent, and they just do their own thing, cats are more like someone you just care for rather than also providing you companionship like a dog, I think the best thing about cats compared to dogs is that they dont need to be walked and they dont bark, dogs have to be trained and walked, dogs may bark at people and other dogs they see etc.. those things can make having a dog more difficult.

&#x200B;

imagine this, you come home from work or a trip, a dog will welcome you and accept your affection, a cat may welcome you a little and then they 'fuck off', which people may appreciate, but with many cats good luck trying to provide them affection when they dont want it, some cats especially dislike that, and cats can be very cute, it sucks to have a cute cat not want to bond with you even tho you spend time effort and money caring for them, so I think altho dogs are more effort you get more in return. maybe it all evens out in the end I guess.

So a boss can scream and shout at you and berate you and make you feel small and scared, and there’s absolutely no recourse for you other than to quit. I think this needs to be changed.

Neither federal nor Texas laws define or prohibit workplace “bullying.” One reason for that is that whether behavior is bullying or not is subjective. The bottom line is that at this point in time, it is not against the law for a person to be rude or even mean in the workplace.

The law only protects you when your boss treats you poorly because of a characteristic about you that the law treats as special. In plain English, your boss can be a jerk, as long as she's an equal opportunity jerk. Most American workers are “at will” employees.

Can you imagine if the employee was a bully to their boss or mean to their boss, they would be fired immediately. So why is it OK for a boss to be cruel and be a bully to their employee? I think the days of this should be gone.

Yes, I know people say well that is subjective, so there needs to be a tribunal of a group of people, or a person who can analyze everything and make a decision. I think people in charge need to be more respectful to their employees. It needs to be a symbiotic relationship, not a master slave relationship.

I had a great job, and I loved my customers, and I was making amazing money, but my boss harassed me at every possible chance, he yelled at me he berated me he lied he fired employees, and in general, it was the most unpleasant work environment ever. I can only imagine if you had been alive during World War II that he would’ve been one of Hitler’s friends. But he can get away with it all he wants. Screaming and yelling and breathing and it doesn’t matter. That person if they don’t like it, they can just leave.

&#x200B;

There is a segment of the Left who defends the shithole that Africa is by blaming it on Europeans, stating that the borders that Europeans drew were too diverse to be sustainable (while in the same breath saying that multiculturalism is a virtue with only net-benefits). Any criticism of Africa, India, or the Middle East (especially Jizzrael) is followed with, ""This is Britain's fault!""

&#x200B;

let's juxtapose the UK with Iraq to make my point. Iraq is objectively more homogeneous than the UK, and yet has tons of internal instability which the Left will only point and say, ""This is because of the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement! If only the (incredibly diverse) UK made the (relatively homogeneous) Iraq even more homogeneous, this wouldn't be happening!"" > Everyone here has heard this argument. It is pervasive. No one can say that this isn't exactly what a majority of the Left thinks. 

&#x200B;

The United Kingdom, not including their vast immigrant communities, is incredibly diverse. Just counting their 4 main nations, they have the English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish. This is not counting the differences in influence among the English population (Nordic or Norman?); that Northern Ireland is a clusterfuck of Irish Catholics, Irish Protestants, Ulster Scots, and Anglos; or that in addition to the 3 Celtic groups already mentioned there's also the Cornish, Manx, and the Gaels.

&#x200B;

There are huge religious differences. Not including their vast immigrant communities, the biggest religions are Nontheism and Christianity, and Jews have always had an outsized influence to be just as significant as the other two (just a fact). The most dominant denominations are the Anglicans, then Catholics, and then everyone else. There are 10 broad groups of Christian denominations in the UK. 

&#x200B;

And I didn't even mention gypsies.

&#x200B;

What has the UK done with all this diversity? It is a religious, scientific, economic, cultural, martial, diplomatic, and political powerhouse that conquered a huge portion of the World and is objectively the 2nd most powerful country in every capacity on the planet.

&#x200B;

Iraq? 95% Muslim, 55/40 Shia and Sunni. 80% Arab. 15% Kurdish. 5% everyone else. If Iraq gave up the north of their country, it'd be effectively as ethnically as homogeneous as Japan or Korea. Their religions are theologically the same, except they disagree about who should have been caliph 1500 years ago - btw the caliphate doesn't even EXIST anymore. It hasn't existed for over 100 years!!

&#x200B;

The UK isn't even the most diverse colonizer. Spain is equal parts Andalusian, Murcian, Aragon, Asturian, Balearic, Basque, Cantabrian, Valencian, Leon, Galician, Extremaduran, Catalan, and Castilian."

To this end, the UNSC members agreed on a rule based world. 

However, again and again, the great powers have created situations where non-nuclear states have to look at nuclear options for deterrence. 

* Case 1: Ukraine. Likely the best example. Gave up nukes; got chopped & eaten up by Russia.
* Case 2: Iraq. Got destroyed by USA.
* Case 3: Afghanistan. Got destroyed by Russia followed by USA. 
* Case 4: Syria. Got invaded by...every country. 

**Cases, where nuclear weapons have been shown to do the job.**

* Case 1: North Korea. Sanctions yes; territorial integrity compromised? No. Military Invasion - No.
* Case 2: Pakistan. Same as above. Pakistan has had US drone strikes but it is largely accepted that they were carried out by Pakistan government's agreement.

**Here are cases, where countries would/should consider acquiring nuclear weapons:**

* Case 1: Taiwan - will stop a constant danger of Chinese invasion. 
* Case 2: Iran - would stop a constant danger of invasion from US & Israel.   


By not following the rules; and threatening smaller countries; UNSC is effectively promoting the use of nuclear weapons.

Let's say someone started saying one day that they believed in unicorns and that they have seen ""visions"" of them, the same way people say the have seen visions of god. Would everyone be supportive and accepting? Hell no... They would call this person crazy and delusional. But looking at this, the belief in god is the exact same thing. The only reason why the belief in god isn't seen as delusional or crazy is because it's so popular. There's billions of religious people, BILLIONS, and that's literally why we as a society have just accepted this even though it's clearly delusional. You cannot prove god exists, religious people only say they have seen visions or have a relation to god, and that's in no way proof, and how is that NOT being delusional... Saying you believe in unicorns and have a relation to them would be the same thing, only that it isn't popular so therefore it's seen as crazy and delusional. I cannot prove that god doesn't exist, but I can also not prove that unicorns, trolls, aliens don't exist either. Science also proves god doesn't exist... It doesn't make sense that there's some supernatural being in the sky being able to monitor everyone's lives or whatever god does.  


And when it comes to religion itself, why exactly are religious people following rules from a book. There could have been random ass people from very long ago who just decided one day to write the Bible, but y'all believe it's god's words. Can we also talk about the homophobia in religions?

329,2024-04-14,CMV: Racial Pride is incredibly moronic,u/Ok-Newspaper-8934,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c48vxg/cmv_racial_pride_is_incredibly_moronic/,changemyview,"I have been watching this visual novel/game called Class of 09 which dives into a lot of issues and problems that many people may not understand or fully appreciate. It’s mostly about the struggles that women go through which men have very little idea about (said woman is also an awful person, but that’s not relevant.)

One particular character in Class of 09 is a white nationalist. They defined white supremacist as someone who believes white culture is better and superior and white nationalist is someone who wants a white ethnostate (and for all other races to disappear). This white nationalist argued that white pride should be a thing and his most effective arguments were “Why is it wrong to be proud of your heritage” and “Why is it okay for there to be black pride and mexican pride but not white pride.”

Here is my view. It is okay to be proud of your heritage, but it is not okay to be proud of your race. Black pride and mexican pride are equally as stupid as white pride for the exact same reasons.

You are proud to be black? Did you know the most cruel slave owners, BY FAR, were black slave owners? Did you know black people enslaved black people before the white man found a way to profit off of them?

And if you wanna say the white race is superior because they don’t do that, study any bit of European history and you will find white man did unspeakably horrific things to other white man. Vlad the Impaler is one of my favorite examples, Basil II, heck even Hitler who was the ultimate white nationalist was most racist towards other white people (after Jews)! Slavs and Romantics are apparently the inferior race, even though they are just as white as Germans! Hitler was far more sympathetic to Arabs than his fellow white man seeing as he was building Mosques in the USSR.

I don’t care what color you are, if you are proud of something that you have no control over and cannot change, you are a moron. Being white is not good or bad, being black is not good or bad but if you want to say you are part of the race who did these amazing things, you also have to say you are part of the race that did these awful things and that’s where white nationalists (and Black Pride ppl) fail to be intellectually honest because their race is so perfect and can do no wrong.

The point I am arguing is, whatever your race is, you shouldn’t be proud of it and it shouldn’t be relevant to your core beliefs as a person because whatever your race is, they have done a lot of wrong and your worldview will shatter if you were intellectually honest. That is why black pride is wrong for the same reason white pride is wrong. If you want to be proud of anything, be proud of your heritage and your ancestors and what they have accomplished or endured and aspire to be as great as them. Btw, branding confederate flags because “muh heritage” is just poorly disguised racism. At least say it’s because of states rights or smth."

Basically what I said in the title. 

Thousands of people the past couple of years are suddenly deciding they are autistic. Why this is, I’m not positive. Though my instinct leans towards they just want to be different/quirky and can’t stand being the default settings of human.

Most of them are either self diagnosing/faking it. The ones who suddenly actually have a professional diagnosis at 30+ years old doctor shopped to hear what they wanted to hear. Because yes, you can doctor shop for diagnosis. Unethical doctors exist. 

I am not saying this is all late diagnosed autistics, but I am saying this is the VAST majority of them. 

Side note, it’s also really frustrating and weird that it’s not socially acceptable to even suggest people might be faking autism. You can call out the tiktokers who faked ticks/tourettes or DID and that’s totally socially acceptable, but if you even whisper that *some* might be appropriating autism, you’re canceled. This is weird and probably because so many people are self diagnosing it now and don’t wanna be called out on it. 

It also takes resources away from actually autistic people and is frankly offensive. "

Let me preface this by saying, I'm not necessarily opposed to Tubman being on our currency, I just think other figures would be more suitable, also I don't think we should replace Hamilton, but that's something else entirely. I believe other people, namely Sojourner Truth or Frederick Douglass would be better, the reason being their prominence and leadership. My knowledge of history may be limited, and flawed, but from what I know Tubman was more involved with aiding the escape of individual slaves via the underground railroad, that is what she's most known for anyways, while Truth was an eloquent speaker, active in numerous social movements, she was invited to the White House and met President Lincoln. Tubman's achievements were more individual and limited in nature, while Truth/Douglas were at the forefront of numerous causes and movements that changed the nation. Even beyond abolition, Truth was involved in women's suffrage and temperance (as poorly as temperance turned out with Prohibition). I don't mean to sound like I'm downplaying Tubman in any way, she was incredible, a very brave woman who changed the world for those people she saved, she deserves her renown, and her spot in our history, but she wasn't the kind of national figure or influential leader that Truth and Douglas were. It begs the question, for me at least, that if we're going to put someone on the bill that wasn't a leader, why choose Tubman compared to any other person, what makes her unique? Why not Rosa Parks, or any number of other activists for abolition and civil rights? I think the main faces of our bills should be reserved for leaders who made massive contributions to our country and people, and Tubman should be honored with a quarter or dollar coin. None of this is meant to sound confrontational, I am genuinely interested in having my mind changed. I don't dislike the idea, I'm not outright against it, I wouldn't be angry if it was her, she is still a great American who I would be proud to have on our currency, I would just prefer if it were someone else, and we weren't replacing Hamilton."

Also can’t we just normalise road signs that are a certain colour code that just comment on the road or make jokes about it? Like a downhill winding section of road with a sign that says ‘yippeeeeee’ or when the road gets worse a sign that says ‘here we go again’

That said, there are some hard lines I won't cross, like arguing in favor of things that are clearly morally wrong or harmful. I'm not interested in propping up unethical positions for the sake of argument. But for most other topics, I'm game to take either side and see where the dialogue leads. I believe testing ideas through rigorous debate ultimately leads to better understanding.

The main thing that could change my view would be experiences where debating felt unproductive or even harmful. If I found myself frequently locked in bad-faith arguments or saw debating used to give credence to dangerous ideologies, I might question this hobby. But so far, I've been able to steer clear of those pitfalls.

Ultimately, I see respectful debate and disagreement as healthy in a free society. We should be able to challenge each other's ideas without it devolving into personal attacks. If an argument can't withstand scrutiny, it probably needs to be reconsidered. That's why I'm always up for a spirited, good-faith debate on almost any issue. Let me know what you think!"

I do have a bias on the topic I'm aware of this. Regardless I believe 
Suicide shouldn't be considered  morally wrong as long as its the choice of an individual to do so. Nobody should have the right to force someone to live against their will. The reason for their choice to die also shouldnt matter because someones choice to die may be No big deal to another. So someone's subjective reasons shouldn't hinder them in their choice. Though i do believe their choice shouldnt be made impulsively. But as long as they're 18+, Able to understand the ramifications of their decision, And aren't in a manic or impulsive Distress then the choice should be theirs to make unimpeded. We could have centers to help them carry out this wish for harm reduction and to help family's therapeuticly through their greif. I also dont believe a mental illness such as depression or borderline personality disorder shouldn't  disqualify someone from this option. But those with severe cognitive impairment or disconnection with reality for example severe forms of schizophrenia should be monitored and assessed to see if they understand the full scope of this choice. Some suicides are inevitable and we shouldnt alienate those suicidal people it only drives them further into isolation and forces them to commit riskier and potentially destructive forms of suicide that can, if unsuccessful cause more suffering for them and their loved ones. It also could indanger or traumatize any one witnessing or is present at the time of the act or After. Suicide should be seen as a Human Right because if it isnt then life ceases to be a right aswell and then becomes an obligation. I domt believe it's fair to impose on that right just because someone else wouldn't have made that same decision."

0,2024-04-15,"CMV: I don't blame mainstream media for making us too pessimistic. If mainstream media were more honest, we'd be even more pessimistic.",u/2252_observations,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c4jr4c/cmv_i_dont_blame_mainstream_media_for_making_us/,changemyview,"At least on Reddit, I frequently encounter the claim that the mainstream media just exaggerates bad news to get more viewership. But in this post, I will show you that mainstream media doesn't show enough bad news.

Firstly, I encourage people to check out [TheJuiceMedia](https://www.youtube.com/user/thejuicemedia). As an Australian, they out the dirty business of our government and other Western governments. I've given up on watching their ""Honest Government Ad"" videos because it's too depressing, but that doesn't make them liars. If I was unfamiliar with these videos and you showed me one and told me that it's being used to recruit terrorists, I would have believed you, because they make us look so bad that it might make someone think ""*Australians are monsters, they need to die*"".

Secondly, I encourage people to check out [Professor Terry Hughes](https://twitter.com/ProfTerryHughes)' content on climate change and the demise of the Great Barrier Reef. He often points out cases of the Australian mainstream media publishing trashy tabloid stories (because that's what sells) while trivialising or outright ignoring climate change. By the way, this isn't a new phenomenon in Australia - as early [as the summer of 2012-2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Summer), Australian mainstream media has been downplaying or ignoring the link to climate change.

Thirdly, while mainstream media coverage (at least in Western countries) heavily focuses on Russia-Ukraine War and Israel-Palestine War, [other wars with high death counts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts) are barely getting media attention. The Myanmar Civil War, Ethiopian Civil Conflict, Yemeni Civil War and Sudanese Civil War are among these high-death-count wars barely getting media attention - and I'd be able to tell you little more than that because that's how little coverage Western mainstream media gives them.

Fourth, one of the most popular media outlets in Australia, Channel Seven has been engaged in other actions to hide just how bad things were getting in this country. For example, they bankrolled [Ben Roberts-Smith (a war criminal)](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/11/kerry-stokes-paying-costs-ben-roberts-smith-defamation-case) and [Bruce Lehrmann (a rapist)](https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/04/15/paint-by-numbers-bruce-lehrmann-defamation-trials/) in their respective defamation cases. While both defamation cases were unsuccessful, Channel Seven was aiming to help restore their reputations and make Australians not see them as criminals.

Fifth, I was in Laos last December. The most common English-language newspaper there was *China Daily* (this is because Laos is practically allied with the PRC and is very economically dependent on them). A significant chunk of *China Daily*'s content was puff pieces praising all the cool stuff the Chinese Government achieved recently (and to be fair, there is some truth in their news stories). The reason I bring this up is to show that if you want optimistic mainstream media, the only way to achieve it is if it were a government mouthpiece that existed to paint the government in a positive light (and that's not something I'd support).

To conclude, if mainstream media were honest instead of profit-seeking, we'd hate our countries a lot more, we'd be even more despondent about climate change, and we'd be aware of even more wars to be despondent about. Redditors may tell me to ""*touch grass*"", but I would say that most people are blissfully unaware of just how bad things are around the world."
0,2024-04-15,CMV: electric vehicles at scale are a terrible idea. Hybrids are the future,u/TryingToBeReallyCool,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c4ke1n/cmv_electric_vehicles_at_scale_are_a_terrible/,changemyview,"I want to start by saying that I think EVs have a place on the market, and at a small percentage of vehicles don't pose too many problems, but scaling that percentage up could become a real issue in the future

Most electrical grids here in the states are old and outdated, and EVs massively increase strain on the local grid when deployed at scale without infrastructure updates, which lag behind demand. They also still run off fossil fuels indirectly, as many places still run their grids off nonrenewables. Even if the grid can take the strain of a high percentage ownership of EVs, the added capacity needed will likely come from fossil fuels in the short to medium term in order to deal with the surge in electricity demand

Second, the safety risk of these things is high. EV fires are incredibly hot and will burn for hours, plus they are incredibly difficult to extinguish without a dump truck worth of sand to choke the fire of oxygen, and even that isn't foolproof as the fire can reignite once that sand is gone. Many fire departments simply aren't equipped to deal with EV fires

My largest issue though, is that hybrid gas/electric just seems like such a no brainer. You can both largely reduce your emissions and gain the benefits of an EV, plus you get added range. Run out of charge? Use the gasoline engine to recharge your batteries. Run out of gas? Limp the car to a pump on the batteries. It provides the best of both worlds, and reduces gasoline consumption significantly, as well as reducing electricity demand compared to EVs, and reducing safety risk with there being less batteries that could potentially be damaged in an accident

So, am I wrong to think that hybrids will emerge as the superior choice?

0,2024-04-15,CMV: Japanese Kamikaze Planes were not that Crazy (Relatively),u/WinterinoRosenritter,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c4ke5i/cmv_japanese_kamikaze_planes_were_not_that_crazy/,changemyview,"The common meme about the Japanese military in WW2 is that they were filled with total fanatics who wasted lives and resources on pointless suicide charges. People sometimes think of the Banzai Charges, but they especially think about Japanese planes suicide diving into American Ships. 

I think the Banzai charges were pretty crazy, but honestly I can see how sober, rational commands could have organized Kamikaze squads. 

Starting disclaimer: Japan fighting on after August 1944 was inherently crazy. They'd lost the war. Any same country would have surrendered. Every single action they took after Saipan was a waste of lives. 

Position: The Kamikaze attacks were not more crazy or unreasonable then any other post Saipan resistance. They were even considerably more sensible. 

Argument: 

Late in the war, Japan had more planes then pilots. Blame bad attrition, no oil for practice flying, and a bad pilot training program. Whatever actual pilots they had were slaughtered at Philippine Sea and Formosa. 

Shitty pilots and improvement in American doctrine and tech meant that launching a *conventional bombing run* on US ships were basically suicide. The odds of any one plane both scoring a hit and escaping was probably in the single digit percentiles. Any air attack on the bus ships was basically suicide. 

So if you're going to stay in a losing war and all your bombing sortees are suicide, you might as well not make a waste of it. 

Kamikaze suicide attacks were easier to pull off and less pilot intensive. It's a lot easier to fly your plane into a ship then score a precision hit with torpedos. It was a more surefire way to die, but those bombing raids were suicide anyway. American CAP was just too good. 

Meanwhile, the Kamikaze attacks did kind of work. They sunk ships, killed flight crews, and kept the Americans cautious. I'd have to double check but I even think they sunk at least one carrier. I have to imagine their hit/damage rate was comparable to the regular bomber stage of the war. And if you controlled for pilot skill, probably a lot higher.

Japan could have given up bombing runs entirely, but then they'd have to give up any ability to contest US landing forces. 

Conclusion: If any air action was suicide, ramming into ships was only marginally more suicidal then a normal bombing run. Accepting that the only sane course or action was surrender, Kamikaze strikes were a reasonably sound, logical choice.

But this doesnt seem fair at all. 

The definition from google of fair is ""impartial and just, without favoritism or discrimination.""   


So making the people pay different % seems very unfair. if we all pay 10% of what we make a poor person who make 10K would pay  1K and someone who makes 100K pays 10K and 1m would pay 100K. This would seem fair since we are all paying the same but if you make more you pay more and we are treating everyone without favoritism or discrimination.   


If we where buying a gift for a co-worker the fair thing might be we all pitch in 100 bucks or we all pitch in 1% of our salary. But saying some will pitch in 1% of their salary and other 30% of their salary this wouldn't seem very fair.   


Im not saying that we shouldn't have more socially equitable taxation or that life in general is fair or unfair. We should be unfair to those that made more money and make them pay a larger share both in % and nominal terms. But saying fair share is just wrong since its not ""fair"" although it can be ""just share"" or ""socially equitable share"" or something. But making a person pitch in more both in % and nominal terms doesn't seem fair.

However, this is true for most major languages. Most Americans are not going to live in China or do any of those things to make it useful. Unless it’s a specific thing they want to do, learning Chinese isn’t that useful. Some people use the argument that “it’s spoken by over one billion people!!” But they’re all clustered in mostly one country. Which, as a Westerner, it seems to be going down a hostile path towards Westerners. I’m not sure how long it’ll be before tensions escalate further. Chinese is also one of the most difficult languages to learn as an English speaker. With the amount of effort it takes, you could learn multiple languages closer to English that have more use in the U.S. like Spanish. Also, unless you live in a select few major cities (NY, some major cities on the West Coast), you will almost never come across Chinese in the US. China also exports little to no modern culture vs Japan or Latin America or other areas. Chinese society is increasingly guarded from sharing/exchanging entertainment/media.

Chinese has a great history and can be useful for very specific interests. But for the vast majority of people, it serves no purpose and you would be better off learning easier languages."

I would like these views challenged because they are holding me back from actually meeting someone in my life.
I am a 29 year old woman who thinks that I might be better off on my own than with a man in my life. I say I want a man in my life but subconsciously I do feel a strong voice that's convincing me otherwise.

Here are the reasons:
1. Sex: Where do I start. I don't think sex is a fair and equal exchange between a man and a woman. By this I mean the man carries the upper hand when it comes to sex dynamics whereas the woman carries a lot of risks by engaging in sex with a man from undesired pregnancies which lead to absolutely traumatic experiences such as abortion (I live in Europe, abortions are legal)/the possibility of becoming a single mum if the two of them split apart. Orgasm is much more difficult to reach for a woman. Studies show that the risk of contracting sexually transmitted disease are higher in woman than men. There is also social stigma that women are more exposed to than men when it comes to engaging in casual sex. 

2. Needs: I don't think that another man is responsible for meeting my needs. I am truly confident that I can meet whatever need I have and do not expect anyone else to do it from me. So you name it: the need for excitement, novelty, cultural/intelectual needs, validation, feeling good about myself, financial needs - you name it, I can provide it for myself. Now this comes from a decade of learning what I need and who I am, but also from asking some of them from another man and him telling me that he had other priorities in his life and so I gave up and thought I should just do me.

3. I enjoy experiencing life as a woman without a man being involved in this process

So what I ask from you is to challenge my view so that I can overcome these hindrances I've got. Maybe some of you are more experienced and have fulfilling relationships and can spot red flags in my views and maybe that way I can open up to desiring a man into my life so it can happen for me too.
I might have developed these views as a result from past trauma and they might be trying to protect me but actually have the opposite effect on me. "

A lot of this is anecdotal, so I suppose there is room for error in my analysis here.

The parents of the student debt crisis kids pushed ENDLESSLY throughout school that if you did not go to college, you were going to be a homeless crackhead down by the river. The insane focus on 'college at all costs immediately after high school' ensured that kids felt pressured to: go to college when they didn't want to, go to college without having any sort of real world gauge on career path, and go to college with no sense of adulthood or fiscal responsibility.

I know tons of kids who felt pressured to go to college, so they went. They took loans, because they had to, but didn't know what they wanted to do with their lives, at all. Some had worked part time jobs as grocery baggers or cashiers, but nothing else. Signing long-term loan paperwork with interest rates and repayment terms was foreign to them. They're not dumb, but when you've never dealt with debt or loans before, many of them did not grasp the weight of their (pressured/forced) decisions.

So they go on some degree path they *think* they might enjoy, without having any clue what the field is like. I know of many who picked veterinarian degrees because... well, they like animals.

The degree turns out to be insanely difficult, or not what they were expecting. On top of this, since they dove straight into college out of high school, they've been in the education system for over a DECADE at this point and are burnt out.

They either drop out entirely, or switch degree programs 2-3 times. A lot of the degree program switchers end up dropping out anyway, the process just takes longer (and costs more money). Now you've got no degree, are $50k in debt, and have nothing to show for it.

The fervent ""you made the decision now reap the consequences"" and ""why should I be punished for your choices"" attitude many older adults have towards the tuition debt holders is ridiculous. A (seemingly) vast majority of that generation forced the decision on high-schoolers who weren't always ready to make informed decisions of that caliber.

Hell, even kids who DID know exactly what they wanted and stuck with it got screwed in most instances, as the purported value of their degree was vastly overinflated. A four year degree was *not* the instant-highpaying-job ticket that it was made out to be all throughout highschool.

tl;dr parents demanded/forced everyone to get college degrees at all costs and then backpedal on the debt crisis when things went poorly."

It was a funny meme and yet some people didn't get it or got really mad at me lol. Then they spammed reddit mods which made me get a ban and remove the post. Honestly twitter is ironically way more open to viewpoints than reddit right now.

Honestly I just think r/memesopdidnotlike is a honey pot for right redditors and nahopwasrightfckthis takes advantage of it. The creator of the former subreddit even got banned. I wouldn't post there if I were you, a ban for no reason."

0,2024-04-15,CMV: Removing the fear of arrest would improve traffic enforcement and safety of everyone. This should be accomplished through an unarmed (but powerful) traffic-enforcement agency.,u/Obsidian743,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c4sd6e/cmv_removing_the_fear_of_arrest_would_improve/,changemyview,"I'm assuming that most people who respond negatively to police pulling them over (or chasing them) are afraid of being arrested for something, not from getting a ticket. I'm sure there are a fringe minority who are afraid of having something negative on their driving record. I'm under no impression this would be a perfect system, simply better overall.

If there was an unarmed traffic enforcement agency, complete with complimentary laws, granting them full power to cite/ticket for traffic infringements but no arresting authority, overall enforcement and safety would improve drastically.

This agency would be as explicitly engaged in traffic enforcement activities as much as the police, with the exception that they are not lethally armed. They may have tasers and/or pepper spray. This would be general knowledge by the public.

I'm also operating from a premise that traffic enforcement should **not** be used as a precursor for enforcing other laws, including stolen cars, outstanding warrants, etc. Any non-traffic related crimes, including felonies, could simply be recorded and referred to the police. They may go on a ""soft"" record of sorts - a cautionary record that the police have access to. Outstanding warrants, stolen cars, etc again can be referred to the police. Situations that arise that might warrant immediate police intervention could be ""called in"" (e.g., suspended licenses, etc). Pursuit is still allowed but the end result would be nothing more than increased traffic fine unless other serious crimes were committed and police intervention was warranted. Ultimately, there would be no reason to run from these agents so we should see a drastic decrease in these situations and resulting damage/loss of life. Overall, all problems that come from escalations would decrease because there would be no need to escalate. While I acknowledge this would still be a dangerous job and some would argue that these people need to be armed, I firmly believe over time it would not be nearly as dangerous and there would be no need for arming these people. I could imagine an alternative solution where pursuit is foregone and other situations in which the license plate, make, and model, etc. are recorded and referred to police for further action. I could potentially concede arming these people purely for self-defense but, again, it would need to be explicit that there is no arresting or enforcement authority here outside of ticketing.

Laws would need to be explicit and well known that these agency have full power to enforce traffic laws but no arresting power. Refusing to stop and/or cooperate for these agencies would incur serious penalties.

It would probably be much easier to hire for such an agency and therefore easier to enforce traffic laws. It would increase overall revenue for municipalities. The increased visibility and enforcement would improve overall safety. Finally, having such an agency would free up law enforcement to focus on higher priorities. It would also eliminate the day-to-day fear many LEOs face when dealing with traffic stops. This may even improve recruitment for LE agencies."

People get used and trafficked from an early age creating a cycle of abuse. I am not some religious zealot, I am not a prude, but all the evidence points to SW and porn being bad for both the people that work in it and people that engage with it.

0,2024-04-15,CMV: PC ports of console exclusives will do more damage to the console industry than they will good.,u/Tlines06,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c4tn2f/cmv_pc_ports_of_console_exclusives_will_do_more/,changemyview,"While having all console games being on all platforms sounds great on paper. You'll no longer need to worry about the game not coming to your console who whether or not there will be a PC port, but this system will not work in practice. At least not for the consoles themselves.

Let's first talk about how many games get released on PC. Because that's definitely a big thing here. Last time I checked roughly 50 games get released on Steam a day, if we do some maths, that's approximately 18,250 games a year. How many of those games do you suppose have a console version? Not many I'd take it. And that's just Steam. That's not even the total number.  There's no way even a quarter of these games have console versions.

Where am I going with this? Even if you get rid of console exclusives, people are still being left in the dark and theres nothing you can do about it. PC is easy to develop for, cheaper to release on, of course indie developers are going to be more partial to releasing their games on PC because its easier. Even on PC there's still exclusivity to an extent. Some games don't work on different operating systems, different specs, this even applies to consoles. Do you think the next Call of Duty game is going to have an Xbox 360 version? No. The thing is with new generations of gaming, and games evolving, and how many games get released on PC, exclusivity is always going to exist in some capacity. 

And even if all console exclusives were on PC, they have been completely devalued. They have lost what makes them unique. If anything getting a PC gives more benefits. You don't have to pay for online, you can play any game, ypu can have mods, emulators and on top of that you can use it for other things like work for instance. Consoles are effectively useless now. The only reason you'd get them is if you couldn't afford a PC and even then you're probably better off saving up for PC anyway.

Overall this system doesn't work in practice as the gaming industry will always have exclusives in some capacity. All this does is devalue consoles and fix a problem that isn't really there or at the very least has no solution."

Everyone is of the opinion that numbers are infinite, everyone in this world thinks they are infinite, except me. Today I will bring you my theory. I will explain the theory to you with logic, trying not to bore you with the mathematical clarifications. I already have the rigorous demonstration ready, but first I want to see everyone's reaction.  
So let's get started:  
The first thing you need to imagine is that reality is like the area of a square. The moment the square is complete with all its sides, the area exists; the moment one side is missing, the area ceases to exist. This is a very short summary of why reality ended. Therefore, having a beginning and an end, reality can contain a limited number of elements. For example, speed has a limit, which is that of light, temperature also has a limit, the superposition of quantum states and so on. Even our mind and imagination have a limit. The limit lies in logic. Imagine having a ""world"" of numbers, which reality uses. This ""world"" of numbers is partially observable by us and in the partiality of observation it appears infinite to us. Our mind will tend to always add a unit, making the numbers grow infinitely. The discussion is much more complex than that, I hope it has intrigued you. The last number corresponds to the factorial of the number 21.3576472647\*10\^103.  
According to my latest calculations, which I hope are not wrong, the last number has 53e10\^106 digits, which is an unimaginable number, but just as we said before, it far exceeds our imagination. Unfortunately, no computer today can calculate it, but if one day we succeed, we will have discovered the ultimate number. Thanks for reading.  
I will return to answer the various questions, I hope to succeed."

Bail is supposed to be the amount of money that will guarantee the accused person’s appearance in court and compliance with the law while on release. When someone can’t afford the amount of money that would be necessary to ensure this, that means they have very little to lose from simply running to another city or state. 

Is this a wealth disparity? Sure. But that’s just the reality of flight risk. One homeless man and one billionaire each face a 5 year prison sentence if convicted. The billionaire is going to return because the 5 years are easier than a life on the run. But the homeless man is much more inclined to run because he has nothing to lose. 

Simply put, the wealthy are a lot less capable of making it “in the wild” so to speak, so they’re inherently a lower flight risk. The less someone has to lose, the more likely they are to be a flight risk. The solution isn’t to abolish cash bail and swing the doors wide open. "

By some metrics the economy is doing well, by others, not so much, but I think we can come to a consensus that the United States has one of the best economies in the world.

I believe the goal of a prosperous economy should be to have less people working, especially as they get older. This allows people to actually live and enjoy their lives, to do things they find fulfilling and meaningful, rather than working a job they have to work because they can't survive otherwise.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with having a career for your whole life, if that's what you want. But we're getting to a point where people have to continue working past when previous generations had to, to the detriment of their health and happiness.

We should be moving towards a future where work isn't required to live, rather than a future where we have to work into our senior years."

I know some polygamists are abusive and possibly there are higher rates of domestic violence in polygamous marriages but that is a correlation without causation. Nothings about polygamous marriages makes a person more likely to commit domestic violence. There is already a problem with domestic violence in traditional marriage so that’s an issue we need to address as a whole. Legalizing polygamy won’t change the challenges of combating domestic violence.

Note: I am not in a polygamous marriage nor am I looking for one. I simply don’t like the idea of restricting someone’s happiness or rights due to religious beliefs. "

Im always a lil confused when I hear abt anti-israel/russia etc. protest in the US for instance,  for a war elsewhere…

Like I 100% get the point, its meant to show awareness and solidarity and I love the thought, I do

But i do believe more effective things like self educating (educating others), donations can help more . Now ofc you can say ‚why not do both‘ but I fear many would rather hop in with a march then actually donate valuable things and say they are being helpful

So for me protests are about a goal for change, you protesting abt a war in x Country won‘t in anyway change or stop the war

A gov. Won‘t give two damns about your protest unless they are already on your side bc they know a protest won‘t do much without actual power, in which case they will utilize the protest to support their agenda/belief

Now I define a protest as a march on the street and in some cases boycotts, if you are boycotting to stop sales/financial support go for it. If you think boycotting a major food company (or any short of military related ones) will change a war, thats pointless and illogical

And so I am just confused as to how this is in anyway effective

Like I just saw the news abt a protest at an airport…like why? If you think drawing attention by pissing off people is a good idea…again why?

Now if its abt a war or problem in the country of the protest I am behind that. Bc i do believe it can help, it can increase solidarity and confidence in the victims/people. I do believe people can feel encouraged to join the change and be effective if they see others protesting

The apps basically force everyone to judge a person by a few pictures and a short prompt and give the impression that how you look is all that matters in a relationship, when often people fall in love after knowing and talking to someone. Given that men outnumber women on these apps, it's not surprising that men would find themselves in a highly competitive environment when in reality it's much closer to 50/50. This imbalance left a lot of younger men disappointed at themselves and, worse yet, women for not getting dates. I have this sense that dating apps market themselves as a way to find love, but for a lot of men it's just something that they find upsetting and disappointing. And when someone doesn't have the right support and structure, they would find the manosphere ideology appealing because it feels like their failures have been answered, even though obviously the ideology falls apart at the smallest scrutiny.

I'm sure some people will attribute this to patriarchy, but this manner of demeaning women hasn't been mainstreamed for many many decades, and patriarchy certainly wasn't any weaker back then, so in my view the best explanation is the perception that dating apps is the only way to get dates."
24,2024-04-15,CMV: The Wealth Gap Allows Massive AI Replacement of Workers and An Inevitable Race to the Bottom,u/CYBERCONSCIOUSNESSES,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c4ww9h/cmv_the_wealth_gap_allows_massive_ai_replacement/,changemyview,"Some people claim reports of the massive decline of human workforce due to AI is an overreaction.  One reason they state is “who will buy stuff if no one has a job.”  This archaic trickle down economics talking point has been historically proven to be a fallacy.  Moreover, the current wealth distribution in America is so drastic that one could argue the upper class and the top 1% can be self-sustaining.

> “The top 1% holds $38.7 trillion in wealth. That's more than the combined wealth of America's middle class, a group many economists define as the middle 60% of households by income. Those households hold about 26% of all wealth. Low-income Americans, representing the bottom 20% by income, own about 3% of the wealth.”

The rich and super rich will have plenty of money no matter what.

Consider also that a not insignificant portion of wealth growth is gained and earned through the stock market, which is driven and controlled predominantly by non-retail investors moving money around and gaming the system.  We do not have a gold standard style stock market where Warren Buffet’s principles of value investing still apply and where financial statements are necessarily relevant to market valuations.  

Moreover, each day more and more consumers and revenue are generated not only domestically, but internationally.  Potential revenue sources are worldwide.  

There will still be people working in jobs that AI cannot yet replace - another source of revenue.

There also will still be people buying things even if they struggle to make ends meet.  

People with government aid will remain a viable revenue source.

Other jobs like content creators will exist still despite AI for some time likely due to the power of parasocial relationships and other factors.

Will maybe a significant number of small businesses go under?  Yes.  But all that does is help the big corporations consolidate and monopolize power and control.

The point is the socioeconomic hierarchy can be significantly pushed to the poles such that there ends up being upper class and above, no middle class, and a very large poverty class.  And when they have dug the working class into that hole, it will be much easier to get them to agree to peanuts for any labor they do need humans to supply. 

It will be a devastating race to the bottom amongst the new poverty class.  That’s a rich capitalist’s paradise.  Because even if you do need human labor, you’re going to have plenty of demand for limited positions and there will always be someone in a massive poverty class willing to do the job for a lower wage because of the strangle hold within the poverty class.  One reason why it should be so important to demand increased state and federal minimum wages. 

You learn early when studying the stock market about the idea that publicly available information should be considered already priced into the stock price.  The AI revolution is publicly available information.  The stock market is booming.  As far as I know, companies have not implemented protections or plans for their workers or for retention of workers.  I haven’t looked into it, but have they made declarations to their workers or generally that the company will not replace their workers with AI (and I mean genuine and specific declarations not passing self-serving comments to disingenuously ease employee minds before the fall)?  

Don’t you think if these mega corporations and gigantic financial institutions thought retaining workers was a priority or a likelihood - or if they thought the transition to AI and eradication of working class jobs was going to tank the economy - that we would see such statements already, have companies implementing strategies to retain workers now, and shouldn’t it be priced into the market already?

If all we are seeing are sugar-coated arguments that “don’t worry AI won’t replace you” or “no no, it will take a longer time than that for AI to replace you,” then that feels more like Human Resources preparatory damage control to keep passengers calm and in line as the ship is sinking, and not an indication that these companies won’t, to the maximum extent possible, replace humans with AI.  

And if these companies who would be more profitable with AI do not utilize it to its fullest, then the market will produce another company that does use AI and runs the human-burdened company out of business (or into the AI run model).  That’s capitalism 101.  People will lose their jobs whether because of layoffs or because their company is run out of business by more efficient and more profitable competitors.

Just simply look at the wealth disparity in America, our capitalist gods and overlords will be fine.  A massive poverty class in today’s world benefits every agenda item a person in control could want and it seems to be what they have been working towards for the last 25 years.  

At least right now, the proletariat still has enough power and influence to attempt to elect politicians and push for policies that will protect workers.  But if they don’t, and if significant regulation and working class protections are not implemented in the near future, then we will reach the point of becoming part of the massive poverty class and at that point, there’s no chance to grab back power or influence.  Once we hit that point, the ones with money, power, and control will be well-positioned to expand, monopolize, and entrench that power and control absolutely."
0,2024-04-15,"CMV: Laws against public nudity are fundamentally the same kind of laws as laws which dictate how much skin a women (or men) are allowed to show. People who support the first kind, but act like the second kind is somehow a major kind of oppression are simply hypocrites",u/yawaworthiness,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c4x8nx/cmv_laws_against_public_nudity_are_fundamentally/,changemyview,"Basically what I have written in my title. In my view, both are oppression and essentially the same thing but to a different extend. The only difference is the extend. BTW I'm talking about ""the Western World"", especially Western Europe.

All arguments against allows public nudity, which are not simply ""we do not like that thus we are ok to oppress people who like to do so"", seem like excuses because they are not self consistent in regards to how other things are viewed.

Some say hygiene. True, more bodily fluids could create more vectors for disease. But that is an excuse, because I do not know of any ""Western"" country, which has laws which criminalize being unhygienic. Not cleaning hands, which increase the chance of disease spreading is not criminalized. Nor is sneezing or coughing into the air with people criminalized. It is also not illegal to touch ones genitals and then touch other things, thus effectively spreading the same thing. The only thing which might be illegal is intentionally spreading illness. But that logic can be simply applied to being naked too.

People feeling uncomfortable. True, but why should that be relevant? There are also people who might feel uncomfortable if women or men are in only underwear or very tight clothing. There, people say that it is the problem of the one who feels uncomfortable and that that person should simply not look at that. Such people are even frequently shamed. Yet when it is about being completely naked, suddenly the person who looks cannot do the same. In addition, it is not like everybody will suddenly start being naked, just because it would be legal, similar how one can't see people simply walking around in underwear even though it is allowed. In addition certain spaces have a dress code, this would not somehow suddenly change.

Protection against the elements. Also true, but why make a law about it? It is also not illegal to be in underwear (underpants and for women also bra) and bare feet, even though it exposes you to the elements.

Protection for children and perverts abusing the rules. First of, this logic can be used to also prohibit people to walk around in underwear or swim wear. Perverts are also able to abuse those rules if they like. Also protection of children is a weak excuse because, that was and is also a common argument to restrict people to wear tight clothes are underwear in public. Others would say, ""Oh but this would lead to children being sexually exploited"". This is a weak argument, because children can also be sexually exploited with clothes on and governments do not have a problem to criminalizing that behavior.

Some start doing slippery slope arguments of ""where do we stop? What about masturbating in the public"". Sure we can do the philosophy of that, but that is irrelevant to the point because one can apply that philosophizing also to forcing women to wear a head covering etc, or whatever is considered ""extremely oppressive"" to the usual Western country.

Some argue that ""we simply decided as a society that this is the case"". This is also a non-argument, for obvious reasons.

In the end it boils down to ""the majority is alright to oppress people for that reason and there is nothing you can do and it does not matter whether one is not self-consistent with other values"".

___

And then there is the whole point that ""underwear"" is determined by sex. If you are a men, it is only underpants, but if you are a women it is underpants and a bra."

In recent media I see people highlighting the differences between the 2 sexes. I believe that is acknowledging the differences in men and women is a reaction to the rise of gender issues in the media such as feminism etc where there is often a blurring of the lines of traditional gender norms. 
My view is that yes, men and women are different, but it’s more like black and dark gray vs black and white. So they’re a complimentary pairing but not polar opposites. Does that make sense?"

When I talk about ‘bad’ people, I mean people who are racist, sexist, violent, or extremely manipulative or abusive in other ways. (This includes if they behave that way in front of me, even if it’s not directed at me.) I don’t mean to say that someone’s a bad person if they have slightly different political beliefs. 

I am not friends with people who believe and say things like ‘I wouldn’t dare a BLACK girl because I hate dark skinned girls’ and ‘the gays are ruining the US’ etc, because I don’t want to associate myself with people who have hateful views and I believe I have a moral obligation to myself to not be a bystander to someone’s hateful rhetoric. 

However, some of my friends and the people around me are different and they say things like ‘well he might be kind of sexist but he is fun to be around and he’s never said anything sexist about specific women I care about.’ I fundamentally disagree and look down on this viewpoint because I believe that you’re not a morally upstanding person if you voluntarily hang out with people who have such extreme and backwards beliefs. I want to understand how and why I could be friends with such people and still be satisfied with myself. 

Also: I am not saying that I ignore these ‘bad’ people nor that you are only ‘good’ if you do; my stance is against people who willingly engage and hang out with them in their free time. In addition, I wouldn’t classify mild disagreements in ideology and behavior such as ‘I dislike Biden’ or ‘I vape under 21’ as issues to break off a friendship over; racist/sexist/homophobic etc ideas are the one I’m talking about.

Although I am all for immigration this is absolutely insane the way this has been implemented. I want to start by saying I have personal experience with asylum cases. Many people we know have come here for a better life however, America currently does not allow asylum for people that need jobs. Asylum cases are some of the hardest cases to be approved. 

The people that came in 2023 their cases are not being heard until 2031.. so we are going to let people build their lives here for years and then deport them ? That’s the first issue. Second, we had no housing set up for them and affordable housing is a complete crisis all across America right now. Third, based on statistics 60 percent of them only have a high school degree and many are unable to speak English. It is going to be an absolute nightmare for them to try to get a decent paying job here. The jobs they are qualified for do not pay enough in this economy. 

Cities literally do not have funding and they do not even have the housing to meet the needs of these people. Then I see families are now being evicted and are unable to reapply for shelters.. how can they have any money saved up for an apartment and if they don’t have a credit score working papers and a job then how will anyone rent to them? I know there’s a lot other issues as well but how can anyone support this? 

It is absolutely unfair to the immigrants, the taxpayers in these cities, and we know that these people are getting benefits over American citizens.. which is creating tension when it should not be this way. We could have asked companies what their labor shortage was and then had people apply to come on working visas.. 

This seems so negligent and apparently we have lost 80k unaccompanied minors? Is that true… what is happening? And there’s a lot of people that will just scream xenophobia when people raise legitimate concerns about the way this has been handled.

When I observe how people interact with each other its usually always people of similar attractiveness talking to each other  
I've noticed if someone who is more overweight or facially ugly tries to join in on the conversation people scoff , roll their eyes at, ignore, and talk over that person and make them feel like they have no right to speak to them  
I look at people who are considered to be outgoing, extroverted, likable, ""people persons"" and they usually are attractive people who people WANT TO BE AROUND and they perceive them so positively because of how naturally attractive they are  
This validation energizes them and encourages them to be comfortable talking to almost any body and they usually can enter any social situation knowing that they'll be liked and accepted by most people  
Where as for ugly people they are usually more reserved, shy, insecure, anxious due to being excluded and bullied for so long and they obviously don't feel confident in social situations because the interactions are rarely positive and they're just negatively perceived even if they act the same as an attractive person  
A good example of this is an ugly person that is talkative being perceived as annoying  
And an attractive talkative person being seen as outgoing and charismatic  
When it comes to social interactions I've noticed that if you're considered to be ugly people are less likely to spark convo with you and if you spark convo with them they usually look disgusted, turned off, annoyed and try to end the conversation as soon as possible .. which makes the ugly person feel even more insecure and less likely to try to engage with people  
Better looking people mostly feel so self assured because people shower them with validation, inclusion, attention and more because they look good and for the most part people aren't even aware that this is influenced by how they look  
And ugly people are usually perceived negatively right off the bat causing people to be more hesitant to them in social settings and this negative perception causes them to mistreat the ugly person in subtle or blatant ways like acting disengaged, being passive aggressive, gossiping about them, which negatively affects the ugly person's attitude when it comes to interacting with them in the future which proves the negative perceptions they had of the ugly person from the jump.. essentially giving them even more of a reason to hate / dislike them"

By right-wing posts, I mean anything from a video of Andrew Tate defining a false sense of masculinity, to Ben Shapiro ""owning a lib"" by simply talking faster than them, to a podcast such as ""Fresh and Fit"" or ""Whatever"" being sexist and talking down to women, to those street interviews who shame women for having high body counts, to videos about Fox News segments with Tucker Carlson whining about the ""Radical left"", to Elon Musk talking about he saved Twitter from being an activist organization. Elements of the right-wing can be seen in all of these examples even though some of them are not politically affiliated. 

There is a message being conveyed that being liberal is wrong, that woman are inferior, and that masculinity is being threatened by society. You can spiral down a rabbit hole with these types of posts within an hour of making a fresh account on any of the social media platforms I mentioned above. 

The reason I say the Youth are the ones being indoctrinated is because firstly, younger people have more time to spend on social media more than anyone else. Secondly, younger people have less developed brains, so they are more impressionable and easily manipulatable by incoming information. Lastly, if you have any younger siblings who are in school right now or see posts about what kids are saying in school, you can easily see the damage this type of content has done.

2. Since these people are born inherently delusional and cannot help it, much like schizophrenia, there is in no way that it is inherently rational. It is understandable how one gets to such an involuntary circumstance, but that does not make it acceptable just because it is naturally occurring.
3. To claim that it is harmless and thus should be fully honored by whatever the trainsgender individual decrees themselves to be is completely ridiculous. Imagine that someone is born schizophrenic and we allow them to believe what they think they're seeing/hearing that's not actually real.
4. Say we leave the trainsgender individual to live out their life believing this falsehood they cannot help themselves out of with no external or professional help. That would be denying them treatment that they fully deserve and abusing them by neglect.
5. It is abuse to honor a trainsgender person's delusions of gender identity in the same way it is abuse to honor a schizophrenic person's visual, auditory, or other sensory hallucinations. This is so because there is no real salvation in living a life of lies. If we have the option to cure people, why wouldn't we allow them that opportunity to live a life of fairness?
6. I understand there is no cure, but there is a way to help them live a life worth living by helping them come to terms with the full reality of their disease, more in cognitive therapy, plus other treatments available. While difficult no matter what path they choose, people with other diseases such as severe schizophrenia and pedophilia have been able to first understand, accept, and repress their unfair instincts so it is no longer ruling their lives.
7. When we as a society have decided that the only way to provide proper treatment and by extension personal salvation is to tell these sufferers of a very serious disease that they are indeed correct in their delusions and there is no way they are wrong about that and we don't do anything further to try and provide actual care for them, we have surrendered our intellectual faculties all because too many people are fooled by the mere coincidence that this mental disease fits too nicely within an LGBT labeling scheme. How shameful.
8. There is no honor and no strength in giving in to delusion, as it is a weakness of mind. If the people are allowing this to happen, then the people are weak and need help themselves."

But if you really stop and think about this phrase, it really doesn’t make sense at all. Most depictions of hell depict it as a large pit of FIRE, and when most people imagine hell, they picture FLAMES. In fact, the Italian word for hell is ""Inferno"". Nothing would rot inside a fire. In fact, it makes even less sense considering that historically, fire was used to destroy things that were rotting/decaying as a form of sanitation, making this phrase even more nonsensical.  

To me, it just sounds like someone's trying to pit the ultimate insult against someone, without considering whether or not the phrase even makes sense or not. 

“Burn in hell” is a perfectly valid phrase. I don’t understand why it is being superseded by a phrase that frankly, I don’t think makes much sense."

The constant intrusive thoughts about them. I'm always smelling my bedsheets and imagining that it's what she smell like. I'll constantly smell my fingers and imagine it's what she smells like. I like every single thing about her and I see now flaws for some reason. I constantly plan my day so I can meet her at some point and have an interaction. I always view her posts on social media, constantly zooming in on her face, just to not forget what she looks like.

I just don't know what else to do with my life and I've lost interest in everything else.

That feeling that knowing you'll never, ever get to kiss that person. You'll never get to have a child with them. That they'll get with someone else later in life and gave a family, it's the worst feeling ever. I get really disturbing sexual intrusive thoughts. Like extremely disturbing. 

But yeah, infatuation is the worst feeling, number 1. Worse than grief, jealousy etc.

*using woke as a shield from criticism. If you don't like our movie then your racist, sexist. Which overshadows the legit criticisms some might have.

I will give both possible explanations for several of the spheres he's involved in.

Note: I'm aware that he didn't invent any of this stuff, but his choice to invest in it did have an impact.

**Tesla**

- He wants to fight climate change by encouraging adoption of electric cars, which can potentially use lower-carbon sources of energy.

vs.

- He made a savvy business observation about an untapped market of wealthy liberals. They would perceive it as ostentatious to buy a $100,000 luxury car but virtuous to buy a $100,000 eco-luxury car.

**SpaceX**

- He believes humanity needs to diversify off our single planet because of the long-term existential risk of a planet-wide catastrophe.

vs.

- He wants to rule Mars as a libertarian paradise run by a company he owns and beyond the reach of meddling democracies.

OR

- He has given up on saving Earth and wants to create Mars as an escape vehicle for the wealthy.

**The Boring Company**

- He wanted to solve the problem of integrating efficient, high-speed mass transportation with the personal last-mile transportation needed for low-density sprawling areas like most of America.

vs.

- He wanted to sell yet another high-ticket exclusive perk to the wealthy.

OR

- He did it for the pun.

**Neuralink**

- He has an optimistic view of transhumanism whereby close partnership between humans and computers will unlock the next stage of humanity's development, rather than humans being replaced by AI.

vs.

- He wants a direct line to your thoughts to advertise to you, monitor political dissent, or even directly influence your opinions.

**Twitter**

- He genuinely believes that free speech is critical to a free society.

vs.

- He wants to control the narrative about himself and political ideologies he supports.

One challenge to my view might be that the political leaning of his supposed true beliefs seems inconsistent. Environmental activism aligned with Tesla is typically associated with the left. On Twitter he has frequently gone to bat for voices from the right and suppressed voices from the left. But I don't think he's actually politically inconsistent. He's just consistent with a liberal viewpoint from the 90s and has failed to adopt any left-wing ideas that became popular more recently. He has publically expressed the opinion that society has moved left while he's kept the same views, which now place him right of center. I don't quite agree with that. I think political discourse has moved toward both extremes. But I believe he believes it.

Another counterpoint is that his management of speech on Twitter is hypocritical. He has reinstated banned right wing accounts like Donald Trump and Alex Jones while declaring very mild left-wing speech like ""cis"" a slur and [banning journalists critical of him](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2024/01/09/elon-musk-silencing-his-critics-as-journalists-are-suspended-by-x/?sh=73cf8ece2588). Hypocrisy could be evidence against true belief, as he follows his stated principles when convenient, but when they threaten his hidden true principles, he violates his stated beliefs. I don't think hypocrisy necessarily contradicts true belief, though. Many people have principles but fail to apply them correctly in all cases. They might use elaborate justifications to allow them to hang on to their prejudices.

I think that because of his hypocrisy and prejudices, it's kind of terrible that he has control over such powerful technologies. I think it's a bad idea for any single person to have so much power because any single person is bound to have flaws. But I think he thought it was a good idea because he thinks he's the good guy and that whoever else would have had the power (e.g. democracy, other rich guys) couldn't be trusted or wouldn't have developed the transformative technologies in the first place."

It puts the burden on under-funded charities to pay for something that is often unsuccessful and many end up paying more than what is raised, on promises that don’t yield results.


To me, this “ethical” prohibition is actually what’s unethical. Their members can refuse to accept pay based on success, under the guise of ethics, only to leave the charity with less money than they started. 


I’ve debated this with several fundraising professionals, and haven’t yet heard a convincing argument for why commission-based compensation is unethical.

True greatness comes from universal empowerment—ensuring that being an American inherently includes access to the essentials of life: clean water, sanitation, healthcare, and shelter.  We, the people, must commit to these principles, transforming them from privileges to common guarantees for every American citizen.

In his seminal 2008 campaign, President Obama often spoke of the ""audacity of hope"" and a profound commitment to the American dream. Drawing from this spirit, imagine a nation where every citizen is assured the resources necessary to live with dignity. Giving every American access to clean water, sanitation, healthcare, and shelter will make America Great.

To make being American mean something great we must re-evaluate what it means to be American. Is it merely a matter of birthright and borders, or can we aspire to a higher collective ethos where to be American is to embody humanity, and justice, and to care for one’s neighbor? Can we be something more? 

Access to clean water is a fundamental human right, recognized by the United Nations, yet millions of Americans face water advisories and contamination annually. A great America would ensure that every person, irrespective of their state or socioeconomic status, has access to safe drinking water and modern sanitation. This commitment would not only improve health outcomes but also dignity and quality of life. Healthcare should be a sector where innovation leads to accessibility, not exclusivity. Universal healthcare is not merely an idealistic goal but a practical step towards a workforce that is healthier, more productive, and fundamentally more American in its resilience. Shelter stands as one of the basic human needs. The stability of a home provides the foundation upon which individuals can strive for greater achievements.

Making America great is more than reviving past glories—it’s about building new ones that resonate with every American’s right to a dignified life. By ensuring access to clean water, healthcare, and shelter, we redefine what it means to be American. This is not just policy; it’s a new creed for our nation’s identity—robust, just, and relentlessly hopeful.

A couple months ago I was hanging out with a bunch of friends (mostly women, two men, not including me) and one suddenly started talking about how she ""hated all men"" and went on about how much she hated all men and how all men should be killed.

While I understand that there are a lot of bad or evil men, and a lot of/all the men she had interacted with might be part of that group, but that can't mean everyone is.

I then said, confused, ""isn't that too much of a generalization?"" and ""there's gotta be, you know, an adjective before 'men' right?""

She didn't answer then, but one of the other girls sent me a message after, saying that the girl was furious about what I said.

Another thing is when I said, at a later time, that ""for example, what if I were to say: Women are bad drivers and get into car crashes all the time, therefore I hate all women"" (not that I believe that, of course)

She then replied ""It's not the same thing"" which also confuses me.

For short: I think it's ok to hate a group of (in this case) men, but grouping everyone with the people that rob, attack or rape people and therefore saying that you hate them doesn't make sense to me.

I think misogyny is alive, well and unchecked in the gay community. From what I’ve seen, gay men are using gender bias to bond with other men, both gay and hetero, over a common demographic to bully: women.

Gay men get to call women bitches because it’s shrugged off as sassy 'gay bestie' talk and I’ve heard them refer to women’s vaginas as everything from 'sea slugs' to 'the stink, gaping looseness of the female cave' and nobody seems to bat an eye which is out of keeping with our reception of hetero men who call women bitches or who mock women’s vaginas.

There is this false and harmful assumption at play that gay men can’t possibly be misogynistic assholes, because they have no sexual interest in women. This is a non sequitur. In fact, I think a lot of gay men view women as some kind of peripheral creatures to be freely trampled upon *because* they have no interest in them. Heck, I even saw a gay man saying that being gay is awesome because two men uniting is a divine and 'superior' partnership where you get to be on 'equal footing' with your partner. Sigh. Such comments fly under the radar (and are often well received) in gay spaces. I honestly think many gay men might not even be *aware* of their own internalized misogyny.

So in reality, I think gay men are just as misogynistic (if not more!!!) as hetero men. Men are homogeneously misogynistic. Yet gay men just aren’t held to the same standard as other men.

It gets worse: misogyny in the gay community is most flagrant in their commercial surrogacy culture, where the misogyny melds with egomania and reaches a satanic extent (sounds silly, I know.)

So I think it’s something like 7% of male same sex couples in the US that have children, out of which a lot if not most got their children through surrogacy. Given the rampant misogyny among gay men, I am horrified that a lot of them are getting their children through surrogacy as it paints an outstandingly unprogressive picture—men with no respect for women, renting women’s wombs and using them as their own personal incubators. The way I’ve heard some of them talk about their 'ovens' makes me fucking livid. Worse even:

Paying a woman to conceive and carry a baby for 9 months, gawking at her while she gives birth, and then saying thanks for the womb and leaving with the poor baby doesn’t just commodify pregnancy, it’s also downright selfish and dare I say evil.

After reading about the 'mother-baby dyad,' I’m pretty sure babies are usually better off with the person who carried them. The biological and hormonal bond between a mother and her baby is of such depth and power that you'd have to be exceptionally inconsiderate to be willing to go home with a newborn who just came out of its mother with a pre existing attachment to her. Babies are not interchangeable parts.

One gay man said something to the effect that it’s not exploitation if he’s paying the surrogate hundreds of thousands of dollars. Goes to show how little respect men, specifically gay men, have for the sanctity of pregnancy and birth.

God I love Europe for having common sense and banning this evil practice of taking a newborn from its mother at birth (we don't even treat animals like that) thusly sparing thousands of children from the trauma brought by knowing that you were commissioned and paid for."

Men are desperately thirsty for it, while women are drowning in it.   
Most women don't like being approached randomly in public or being confessed to, while I don't know a single man who wouldn't appreciate being approached. The ""men remember compliments for years"" things is true for a reason. 

On top of that, there is also the aspect of safety, and the current societal expectation of men approaching women has resulted in women being seriously hurt or even killed due to rejecting a man. Women basically have to fear for their safety every time a man approaches them. Again, if women were the ones to approach, this wouldn't be an issue. 

If women were expected to approach, they could go out and not worry about guys hitting on her, and men can finally take a break from always having to be the initiator. Everyone wins.

It seems to me that people tend to associate people with the more extreme/""progressive"" sides of their party.  
For example, people think if you're Republican you love Trump, you want social security abolished, you want zero immigration and to deport everyone. Or if you're Democratic people think you want a totalitarian government, you're anti free speech and want open borders and free immigration.  
I don't live in the US but I watch a lot of US media and I feel like the reality is that few people are actually either one of those. Most people are more centrist and just pick the party that is slightly closer to their views. I feel like deep down people would rather go about with their lives and not have any president, whether Biden or Trump make radical changes to their lives.

Yes sure, there's a lot of people who love Trump and want him to change things (though technically making America great *again* implies that they don't want radical *change)*. And Biden after all was supposed to be (whether you believe that or not) the ""normal"" candidate and not someone who wants to radically change the country. So I feel like most people don't want ""radical"" policies like open borders or completely closed borders."

I am a genderfluid nonbinary aroace person. I (probably: I'm waiting to get an official diagnosis. No I dont even have tiktok) have autism, adhd, OCD, and several other mental issues. I honestly have no idea what my gender is because I have trouble proccessing shit 

(Ok it starts now)

Last year (or 2 years ago? idk) I was completely obsessed over finding out my queer identity when I came across xenogenders and neopronouns. I could not understand their logic but I tried really hard to understand what they were saying and why they identify as these genders.

I now have a vague sense of what it is. Basically from what they're saying, xenogenders are genders that are mainly used by neurodivergent people who cant really grasp the idea of gender and identity. But if you read what they're describing all of them are either personality traits or just stuff they like or a ""connection""

To people who use xenogenders, genders are literally just aesthetic like they'll see a random ass flag and go like ""OMG THIS IS SO ME"" Like the flag does not even have a name or a description and you're already claiming it. They know they're just flag hoarders and they're proud of it. I have to agree that a lot of the xenogender flags are incredibly beautiful or cute and I would have definantly used them as a background or pfp if they weren't xenogenders. Which is probably why they all go heads over heels. 


Neo pronouns are just fucking cringe. And I have found that 99.9% of people who use neo pronouns are incredibly rude or ignorant. They expect everyone to use their pronouns when they're literally making up 10 new pronouns every hour. Also neopronouns arent even pronouns they're literally just nouns.

The video gets viral and they become ig famous because of young teenagers, which is the main audience of these barbers. And these barbers start charging (scamming) 80-100+ dollars for a haircut. They usually get these cuts done under 45 mins as well. As a result, the ego of these barbers is massively inflated too. This ego boost has somehow spread to the average barber and they have started charging 50+ dollars for average cuts at best.

If any censership is happening, I think it is from the userbase not wanting to see that content.

Shadiversity's channel has been declining, and shad seems to hint that it is youtube doing it because of his political views.  He claims it isn't people losing interest, nor his Knight's Watch channel, but I think that is exactly the reason.

From his graphs his recent videos start off on an upward trend, and then drop off suddenly.  He rationalizes it as youtube censoring him.

I used to watch a lot of Shadiversity.  Knights Watch started out as an interesting side-channel.  But then it got really political, nearing the far-right category.  What finally did it for me was when he had thumbnails of ""woke"" females/actresses photoshopped with evil red eyes and cum dripping from their face.  I'm pretty mellow and just quietly unsubscribed, but I bet that pissed off a lot of people.  He tried to seperate his main channel from his political views, but when you piss off people that much the separation isn't enough.

What I think is happening now: he releases a video, and his fans like it, so it is favored in youtube's algorithm.  Then, all the people Shad pissed off log on and dislike his videos, making them not favored by the algorithm, and that is why his videos plateau shortly after gaining traction.

What supports my view:

 - there is a dedicated hate subreddit for shad.  This shows there is a community of people he pissed off.

- HelloFutureMe criticized Shad's channel in a recent video (the portion of which has been deleted sadly so we can no longer see it) as being part of a problematic anti-woke bro movement on youtube, targeting young men to hate women.  If HelloFutureMe has these thoughts and has taken notice, enough to put it in one of his videos, I think its a good indicator of how many silent youtube watchers are just as upset with Shad.

- Far-right grifters are a talked about and disdained group on youtube.  Once Shadiversity started using thumbnails and titles like the rest of them, and honestly using similar talking points, he became part of that group.  Naturally, most of youtube doesn't want to see that shit so that is why is channel is suffering.

I feel like people who agree with Shad and claim youtube is the one censoring them want to feel victimized by the big woke company, instead of facing the idea that its the masses who don't like their views.

But I'm not a youtube content creator, and I don't follow this drama super closely (I just got kinda pulled into it with the recent HelloFutureMe vid).  I also used to respect Shad and his critical thinking.  So, maybe I'm missing something, and youtube really is unfairly targeting channels like his.  CMV"

As the biggest war in my lifetime I feel its important to be informed and I have kept a close eye and have followed it more closely then most. Being pro Ukrainian I of course swayed towards pro Ukrainian sources. The problem with doing this is the incentive for the creators is to fed the viewers (pro Ukrainian) what they want to hear for views. So what you get is any Ukrainian success floating to the top and failures at the bottom or just not existing. 

Now this happens in every echo chamber but in this case I feel like it heavily works against their best interest. Say you train fighters and your student got in a fight and told you he won decisively but it was really a draw. Then they are having a rematch and something comes up so you don't make time to train him. But now he got his ass kicked because his opponent was training while he was not. 

What I think this has done is helped the west forget about this war while seemingly thinking its going well so they had no reason to increase donations and armaments to an amount that would have gotten Ukraine a win or a good negotiation spot. The west support got lazy because of these reasons and Ukraine itself does not even make things like its own military losses public which would actually encourage more west support imo.

Now I have no doubt Ukraine had better ratios of casualties and destroyed equipment but the exaggerations of it and the underestimating of a country with 4x the manpower has hurt their western support and prospects of not losing this war. "

This point always comes up when humanitarians want to address the water crisis in Gaza.  The idea is that we shouldn't allow aid workers to bring in construction materials and help rebuild Gaza's water infrastructure because Hamas will just tear it all apart and use the materials for weapons.

I am sure that Hamas does use raw construction materials to manufacture rockets and weapons, but I have found no evidence that they would tear apart actual, functional water infrastructure for that purpose.  I think that, once a ceasefire is reached, we should let aid groups come in with materials to supervise the reconstruction of the infrastructure without assuming that Hamas will tear it all apart.  I think we should assume that Hamas will be rational enough to leave the infrastructure intact once it is complete.

My understanding is that the source of the claim regarding the water pipes in particular is an Al-Jazeera documentary following Hamas' weapon manufacturers:

[https://www.memri.org/tv/jazeera-documentary-hamas-missile-industry-iran-sends-kornet-fajr-missiles-to-gaza-reclaims-munitions](https://www.memri.org/tv/jazeera-documentary-hamas-missile-industry-iran-sends-kornet-fajr-missiles-to-gaza-reclaims-munitions)

However, the actual transcript clearly says that Hamas was digging up pipes that were used to take Gaza's groundwater and siphon it into Israeli settlements that had been abandoned since 2005.  Apparently these pipelines were EU-funded, so it caused a big stink as the media accused the EU of unintentionally providing Hamas with weaponizable materials.   

But as the media discourse continued, the talking point seemed to morph from ""don't give Hamas materials they can use as weapons"" - to ""don't help rebuild infrastructure in Gaza because Hamas will just tear it apart to make weapons.""  The former might be a fair point, the former doesn't seem to be supported by the facts.  Hamas has been digging up and repurposing water pipes that are useless to them, they have not been dismantling actual functioning infrastructure.

And as a matter of inference, it makes sense that Hamas would not dig up actual, functional pipes or dismantle desalination plants for weapons.  This would probably turn Gazans against them, not to mention the fact that they need access to water as much as anyone else in the region.

Just to cut off one potential counter-argument: I acknowledge that we can say that Hamas ""indirectly"" is destroying their own infrastructure and preventing it from being rebuilt by continuing to instigate the conflict; by using raw materials to make weapons; etc.  Again, the specific claim I am making is that Hamas is not ""directly"" destroying Gaza's water infrastructure in order to make weapons, and we should trust them not to destroy completed, functional projects.

To preface, this is mostly unaffiliated any one political agenda, I am simply an American citizen with concerns.

For starters, I’m finally about to get out of the army (please do not thank me for my service), move back home after 3 years of hating my life and 1 really good year, thanks to the fact that  I’ve met an amazing woman who I’m confident I’ll marry soon, I’m about to go to college and study the (most corporately marketable version of) the thing I wanna do: Art (graphic design), I’ve already got an apartment where her and I are gonna live (big milestone for us). All good things, right? Right. 

But you know what they say about all good things,

As I’m sure most of us have seen, we are teetering on the edge of world war 3. Like the recent Israel vs Hamas/Gaza conflict(now Iran too), Russia vs Ukraine, china’s threats of retaking Taiwan, Haiti, etc. all ever so slowly reaching a boiling point. With that said, there is a chance that I might be called into service again, leaving everything behind to die in the nuclear fallout. 

“I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones""-Albert Einstein. 

Secondly, even if World War III doesn’t happen, we have to talk about the impending economic crisis. Regardless of what side of the spectrum you are on politically a lot of people can agree that the economy is fucked. Including the fact that a lot of index funds and other forms of stocks and shares are slowly depleting because people are pulling out because they know a recession is coming unlike any we’ve seen before. But so long as they get the profits and the peasants don’t then what does it matter? 

One of my favorite campaigns that has been made in recent years is a campaign that it’s just a common saying, the rent is too damn high. Some of you were going to say “well just pull yourself up by your bootstraps, stick your thumb up your ass and say thank you uncle Sam “ the problem with that is how am I supposed to pull myself up by my boot straps if nobody’s hiring anymore? It’s an epidemic nowadays displayed everywhere that nobody is hiring.

Let’s say that I get a job, then, by some form of miracle They probably will not pay enough. The minimum wage in a lot of states is still 725 an hour, meanwhile, a studio apartment is near 1000 a month not to mention insurance bills expenditures when it comes to something like car, maintenance or a medical emergency.

“Well, just save”  how am I supposed to save if I’m spending all my money on bills that are increasing by the week? 

“Well, just invest” you mean in the same stock market where all of the top execs have already traded with themselves in a giant circle jerk to the point where they own about 93% of all the profits from stocks?  


It’s a giant unending cycle of Fuckery, perpetrated by higher powers on both sides . 

And before Anybody in here starts blaming “ sleepy Joe“ or the orange man, just realize they have you exactly where they want you. They want us all bickering over who did what when in reality they’re all profiting from the same organizations that lobby them into power. That being said, with all of that which was mentioned above, there’s no way of voting them out of power.

Don’t get me started on humanitarian crisis around the world, like the LGBTQ movement, the constant persecution of non-white races by governmental and police forces. Elected officials, ignoring their voters, please, as a matter of fact, the votes themselves. Once again, returning to the fact that they don’t care about the politics just the money. 

Then there’s the fact that it seems like everyone hates each other nowadays. Because of political differences because of religious differences, etc. etc. nobody can get along anymore.

Oh yeah, and then there’s the climate crisis, which everyone seems to have forgotten about, or is at least just ignoring. Because one thing for sure in December in my home state of Texas has been hotter than ever. I remember Christmas is growing up when I would have to layer up just to step outside, but nowadays I’m wearing basketball shorts and a tank top outside right after Nick drops off my presents. What’s going on with that? 

And I’m certain somebody’s gonna come in here and say we’ll just do the research it shows: blah, blah, blah, or climate change isn’t real bro here’s this article that’s been Written and published by a company that’s funded by shell or Chevron
There goes my point exactly, how am I supposed to do the research and trust the news, the media, any sort of publication in the public domain when it’s biased, one way or another? Not to mention the fact that there is simply way too much information in too many contradicting points on anything such as: politics, religion, climate change, social progress, etc. There is no such thing anymore, if there ever was, of a clear and objective truth. Which is perhaps the most infuriating of all these things. 


And before anybody says to just look at the positive, trust me, I do before anybody says that there is still good people in the world. I understand that. But little Sally Mae, selling lemonade to the homeless down the street for five cents of pop instead of the inflated $20 a bottle or whatever isn’t gonna change the fact that our planet is dying and we are responsible for it. We will be the destruction of our own species and our home . There is no such thing anymore, if there ever was, of a clear and objective truth. Which is perhaps the most infuriating of all these things. 

To put it, bluntly, and to sum this all up. I will tell you a short anecdote, my girlfriend‘s father, who is a pastor once asked me what my stance on gay marriage is. And I told him “I get my political and social beliefs from one of the greatest American heroes of all time, Somebody who represented the fight for good and equal fair freedom for all. Optimus prime, who has said freedom is the right of all sentient beings“ what I did not have the heart to tell him is that there is a second part to that philosophy for me, one that I’ve added. 

“Freedom is the Wright of all sentient beings, and if it cannot be achieved, extinction is the only answer “

America has its problems with Racism, Sexism, Classism, Political Ideologies, Crime, Homophobia, Homelessness, Poverty, and a whole lot of other things. But what other country doesn’t have these same issues? I also believe that America is the main country with millions of people that are actively trying to pushback against these things. 

Not a lot of countries offer full freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the right to bear arms, gay marriage, freedom of consumption, welfare, etc. 

I can admit America has its problems, and at the same time believe that I am very blessed and lucky to be here. Being Patriotic and proud of a country does not mean that you are fully happy with everything that goes on in said country. Or at least it shouldn’t. "
130,2024-04-16,CMV: Talking about Misandry is off limits in society,u/ContraMans,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c5uvjf/cmv_talking_about_misandry_is_off_limits_in/,changemyview,"Exactly that. As I have seen it there is no context in which it is acceptable, broadly speaking, to talk about misandry and men's issues in society. I have seen countless posts about issues facing men and while there has been some support for these issues there is ever an endless sleuth of heinous insinuations and outright malicious accusations lodged at the ones taking up the conversation in any earnest way. The best I have seen is that individuals arguing that society should help rectify these issues is that 'men should take care of it themselves' and other such statements. 

&#x200B;

This makes it very difficult, nigh impossible, to bring up any sort of issues pertaining to men without being lambasted by a veritable deluge of insults and slanders against one's person regardless of whether they are a male or female or other non-conforming gender archetype altogether. 

&#x200B;

I speak about men's issues here but to clarify my meaning on it misandry it is not that most people hate men. I don't think that's the case at all however I think there are a myriad of behaviors and practices in society that have the same misandrist impact on men as similar behaviors other minority groups have experienced historically. Not quite in the legal sense but in the social aspect. Regarding men as innately dangerous, much the same as people of color were and still continue to be labeled dangerous criminals. Regarding men as emotionally impotent and otherwise broken in much the same way as women have been regarded as intellectually impotent and feeble in contrast. There are many who subscribed to such beliefs not out of a particular and consciousness loathing for those groups of people... but because they were convinced of it by others who did.

&#x200B;

The issues men face as a result of these behaviors (in the form of high suicide rates, high rates of alcoholism and addiction, high susceptibility to radicalization and indoctrination due to being emotionally stunted, extreme and unhealthy obsession with affection and attention from the opposite sex, the list goes on) may not be consciously malicious but it is rooted in misandry all the same. And I've never truly seen an earnest conversation regarding how to solve these issues that doesn't immediately devolve into, frankly, childish arguments of 'well why should we do anything for men when they can do it themselves?'. 

&#x200B;

Even in MRA spaces you'll find quickly those members supposing to 'support men' are very quick to throw them under the bus for expressing any semblance of of an idea that perhaps men's mental and emotional well being should be tended and nurtured so they can develop healthy, happy mentalities. I recall seeing a post of a young man expressing how he felt suicidal and when he posted to another forum of his woes he was lambasted as a misogynistic incel and countless other hateful insinuations and when he then posted to an MRA reddit... not one individual was concerned for him. If anything they merely saw it as another reason to be angry at 'the feminazis' and none among them offered even the most token of consolations towards him.

&#x200B;

So these issues cannot be discussed with the public at large without being bombarded with such attacks and they cannot be discussed within supposed 'male spaces' and be taken seriously or not be subjected to many more varieties of abuse. Yet we continue to expect men to 'solve in on their own' as a society and keep quiet about it in the public space. At least that's my perception, though there is an innate bias I am aware of in that it is much easier to recall the most negative aspects of any given thing. So I would like to hear what other's perspective on this are and color my own with more shades as well for consideration."

0,2024-04-16,CMV: There’s nothing wrong with a chronically single person wishing they were aroace.,u/throwaway3316984,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c5w9s9/cmv_theres_nothing_wrong_with_a_chronically/,changemyview,"For context, I have been single for nearly 3 years now, and actively dating for 2. Ive been on dozens of first dates in that time, and have been in the “talking” phase often, but have yet to find a relationship.

I’ve been doing the work that everybody online and in person says you should do. Im in therapy. Im working to manage my ADHD. I have a variety of hobbies I enjoy. I have a job I love, and a solid group of friends for the first time since high school. Over half of those friends are women, and in general I have no problem talking to women and no bitterness towards them. I’m in the best shape of my life, I’m happier and more confident than I’ve ever been. I take care of myself, and my appearance. I’ve even completely cut out porn for the last 2 months, and plan to do so permanently regardless of my relationship status.

And yet Im perpetually single. Dating apps have been a frustrating waste of time, and nothing has gotten past the talking stage for people I meet irl. Cold approaching at bars or clubs hasn’t gotten any results, and doing so anywhere else is just uncomfortable. Ive even tried dating a few people I wasn’t initially attracted to because I liked their personalities, but eventually I had to break it off because the attraction didn’t develop and it felt dishonest. The only advice I see often that I don’t follow is to join clubs to meet women, because frankly the vast majority of women that I meet are already in a relationship, and I don’t see why that would be any different at a cooking class. Most of the clubs and classes in my area are also pretty expensive.

Following boilerplate dating advice has improved my life, but it hasn’t led to any actual success with dating. I do most of these things because I enjoy them and they help my mental/physical health, not to get a girl. Being single doesn’t usually bother me, but I’d be lying if I said it doesn’t affect me. It hits especially hard when I’m out with friends, and I am the only one not in a couple. When we plan trips, its a bunch of happy couples, and me. Social media is flooded with happy relationships and dating stories, all just reminding me what I don’t have. My friends tell me their relationship struggles and I just sit there and nod, pretending that Im not jealous of the things that they complain about. I have the social life and career I always wanted, and I’m much happier and more stable than I was in my last relationship, and yet now that I’m out of college dating feels impossible. The more effort I put into it while seeing zero success the more depressed I get. 

Because of all of this, I often wish I was asexual and aromatic (aroace). If my brain and body didn’t remind me every day that there is something missing from my life that most other people have, it would be so much easier to be truly happy. But Ive heard people say that desire is wrong, and I don’t understand their reasoning. If there was a safe, effective way to eliminate not just my libido but my craving for love and affection, I would take it at this point. Its not like I would lose anything. From my perspective we have exactly the same life, aroace people just feel like nothing is missing from theirs. 

Arguments that won’t change my mind:

1. Aroace people have to deal with friends/family seeing their relationships as disposable and less important than romance. Chronically single people experience this just as often.

2. Aroace people have to answer the “why are you single?” question constantly. Same here, but I don’t even have an answer.

3. Any answer that addresses aromantic or asexual people separately. Obviously being one but not the other could lead to heartache, thats why this post isn’t about that.

4. General dating advice.

You can change my mind by convincing me that either AroAce people face significant hardships that I don’t face as a chronically single person, or that it is somehow morally wrong to want to be AroAce."

I find it insane people (especially conservatives) believe the state should have a legal RIGHT to execute its own citizens. The death penalty is one of few issues where I can’t see both sides, I have never heard a valid argument in support of the death penalty that isn’t just an appeal to emotion. Ie. Look this X convict raped a 10 year old! We should kill him! 

Obviously I have no sympathy for people who commit heinous crimes like murder or rape, however I do not believe these individuals justify the legality of capital punishment. 

1. First and foremost, it’s more expensive for the state. https://www.cato.org/blog/financial-implications-death-penalty

It cost more money to execute the death penalty on someone than it is to just hold them in prison for a life sentence. 

2. Innocent people have received the death penalty - apparently of every 8 people executed since 1974, 1 of them has been innocent. https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence

Again why would anyone support giving the government the right to execute its citizens is beyond me. Ironically enough, from my experience most of the people in support of such a system are Christians, The system that literally ordered God be put to death…. 

I recognize these were different governments, but how are you going to trust a system that innocently killed GOD. 

3. Living life in solitary confinement/prison until you die is way worse of a punishment than being put to death. 

For those criminals who are guilty. I don’t care if they are killed or not, but I think it would be way more taxing on the human mind to have to spend life/multiple decades in prison than getting the easy way out and put to death. Meaning, this post isn’t in support of clearly guilty criminals such as Osama Bon Laden, but I wish that guy was rotting in a jail cell rather being killed on the spot. (Though I also do recognize certain situations require fast action by military and police, and Bin Laden never really had the chance at life in prison.) "

It has a culture that encourages innovation and growth, immigration rates of skilled professionals and foreign investment above that of it competitors.

High immigration and GDP growth will lessen the effects of demographic crisis’s that its peers are or will be facing.

It has geography that allows it to export and move large amounts of goods for cheap.

It’s bringing back a lot of industry, self sufficient in energy and food production.

Safe from any foreign military threat, large nuclear threat and capable defence.

Is able to intervene anywhere with water access in the world a very likely win militarily.

The US is not perfect it has problems like any other country on earth but has much more going for it than anywhere else. Has a much better chance or adapting to the world without descending into mass violence or authoritarianism. Has a great standard of living compared to the average currently and historically. Likely to remain this way for a while and remain intact and relevant for much longer than any other relevant entity or country.

I believe that if we separated land in the USA by the proportion of each racial group and gave them that amount of land to govern things would be better off socially. Obviously, we would need to support each of these “districts” equally to ensure a fair and balanced living conditions for all groups. Each district would have its own government to lobby for funding in each area.

Ex. SE USA goes to African americans. Midwest and Northeast to White people, South central USA to Latinos, West to Asian. If you are mixed, you can choose where your residency will be at 18.

This would give each group representation and power within their territories and eliminated racial tensions throughout the USA."

And now, as an adult, I still don't understand.

For one thing, unless you're my wife or my very very very close friend, you won't actually know what I'm really like. Just because I helped you move your furniture doesn't mean I'll vote for the same politicians as you, or share the same morals as you do. You might think I'm ""good"" now, but I might do something that will make you think I'm ""bad"" later.

I experienced this as a child a lot. My parents would call me a ""good son"" sometimes and a ""bad boy"" at other times, so I learned that compliments like ""good kid"" or ""good person"" don't actually have much merit to them.

And I also observe this in my dad. So many people who meet him think he's charming, compassionate, helpful, selfless, etc. Some have even called me lucky to have a dad like him. In other words, he is a ""good"" person to them. What they don't realize is that in private he is not just racist or sexist, but actually extremely judgmental in general. He looks down on the very people who think of him as a good person, he sees them as helpless, stupid, ""gay"" (as a slur), etc. And on top of that, he is extremely aggressive and occasionally violent. Just recently, he strangled my chihuahua out of anger, lifting her in the air by her neck and squeezing it. All because she wouldn't stop barking.

It annoys me so much when someone calls me a ""good person"" just because I helped them with something or just because I'm publicly pleasant or unassuming. I can say for certain that I'm not a ""good"" person. Nor do I even believe in the existence of ""good"" or ""bad"" people. All I believe in are social interactions that can be pleasant or unpleasant. A raging abusive narcissist can easily seem like a selfless, all-loving man in certain circumstances."

",u/Longjumping_Fold_815,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c632oy/cmv_if_the_allies_in_ww2_would_have_fought_like/,changemyview,"I think a lot of people forgot how war looks like. No one wants civilians and innocent people to die obviously, but the allies did what they had to do in order to defeat Nazi German and Japan. Whether it's bombing Drezden to the ground to destroy the manufacturing ability of Germany, or bomb Tokyo to break the Japanese spirit that preferred sending kamikaze attacks rather than surrender. If the allies would have fought like Israel is expected to, meaning not bombing a target with militants because it might have civilians, dealing with the logistics of aid to the civilians of your enemy, and choosing commando operations instead of artillery every time to avoid possible civilians casualties, they would have never won the war. 
Again, I must be clear: I don't support, nor want civilians, innocents and children to die, no matter which side they are on. But war isn't something you could win with silk gloves. It's a horrific business, you should try your best to avoid civilians casualties, but you need to do what you need to do to win. If a Nazi group would have hide in a hospital in Berlin and use it as a military base, it's terrible, but you can walk on eggshells if you want to finish the war. 
Also, consider this point: soldiers are not mercenaries. They the brothers, sons and friends of the people back home. If you would ask a British civilian in 1945 who he would rather die to complete a mission, civilians from the other side, or his son who is a British soldier, he would never pick the soldier because it's more ethical.
You can't avoid destroying enemy infrastructure and killing enemy soldiers and still win. I think the best example are factories. They are operated by civilians. If the allies would have not bomb German factories to avoid civilians casualties, Germany could have continued the war for much, much longer, and they will have the advantage, because they will bomb Britain's factories. 
For summary:
1. Israel is expected not to bomb a military target if it has civilians in it. If the allies would have done it, they could have never destroy German's manufacturing ability. 
2. Israel is expected to care more about enemy civilians lives rather their own soldiers lives. If the allies went by this logic, they would have had to ground invade every city, with almost no artillery or aerial aid, and give up a lot of operation for worse ones, causing much higher soldiers death. 
3. Israel is expected to be responsible for humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians. If the allies would have been responsible for humanitarian aid for German civilians (before occupation of a city), probably most of the aid would go to militants, which is basically helping your enemy soldiers fight longer, endangering your own soldiers in the process.

People at the top always go on to hoard it all for themselves, and use it to abuse, exploit, and oppress everyone else, whom they leave fighting over the scraps, forcing many to turn to a life of crime just to feed their families. It turns good people into monsters and it destroys relationships between friends and family, and serves as nothing but a source of division and corruption. By permanently getting rid of money forever, there will be no more poverty, no more corruption, no more suffering, because you can't have people hoard all the wealth when there's no wealth to hoard, or leaders focused only on lining their pockets when there's nothing to line their pockets with.

TLDR: Money is an evil and disgusting concept that brings nothing but pain and misery to all but a cruel few, and this world can only be better once it's permanently and forever eradicated from this planet once and for all."

I heard of it from a podcast, i want to disagree with it really bad, but i can't find any logical counterargument for it, so now i'm stuck holding a view i don't like, but at the same time that i can't disagree with, so please help me out.

Let's start with definition : Self-defense law requires the response to match the threat level in question. In other words, a person can only use as much force as required to remove the threat.

Now let's pick an extreme scenario: 

guy1 poke guy2 in the chest with his finger, guy2 pull out a gun and shoot him.

Now i hope everybody would agree that this is clearly a case in which the response was clearly dispoportionate to the offence, and i would like to agree myself, because without putting to much tought into it it's clearily dispoportionate, case closed.

BUT, what is meant by proportionate? proportionate to what exactly? i assume is to the status quo of doing nothing to each other right? that would be 0.

When you poke someone and change the situation from 0 to 0,1 and the other party shoot you, escaliting the situation from 0,1 to 100, what actually happened is :

guy2 escalate from 0,1 to 100 = 1000 times higher;

guy1 escalate from 0 to 0,1 = infinite times higher;

i mean, when you think like that, what can you consider appropriate *""response to match the threat level in question""?* because there is never a situation when you can do something that is more dispoportionate to escalating from not physical (0) to anything that is physical (anything >0), no matter the response: you could poke him back (0,2) or shoot him 100 times (100000) and in any case, you could never match the threat level in question.

Now having said that, i don't want to live in a world where someone can unload a full magazine on me because i bumped into them, but beside me not wanting to, i can't really find a logical argument for it.

0,2024-04-17,CMV: ADHD is not a real mental disorder,u/Few-Drawing-7910,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c657iu/cmv_adhd_is_not_a_real_mental_disorder/,changemyview,"I know this is a controversial one. However, I just have not heard any good arguments for it, and I have spent a lot of time looking. Let me preface with this, I know many people diagnosed with ADHD. 

All (Adult at least) ADHD symptoms fall within the normal range of human behavior. I have not heard any ADHD symptoms which I don't honestly think everyone does, with varying frequency. For example, struggling to pay attention to things that don't hold their interest, disorganization, lack of follow through, procrastination, etc. I've heard people say that it isn't any one abnormal behavior, but the frequency of behaviors is what makes it a mental disorder. I don't see how that isn't just describing an individual's personality. Also, a lot of the symptoms, especially those pertaining to attention, are heavily influenced by lifestyle. A large segment of our population has poor sleep, doesn't exercise, and is addicted to scrolling on their phones. Obviously, this is mentally unhealthy and you suffer from it. That doesn't make it a mental disability on par with autism or schizophrenia. 

I am not saying people with ADHD are consciously faking it or trying to be manipulative. I think the disorder is just a cluster of normal personality traits. Personality traits which are not really beneficial and do cause trouble in daily life. To use an analogy, a person prone to holding grudges and anger is going to face problems because of it. Does that make it a mental disorder? Or is it just a personality trait? Some might say that a personality trait or normal behavior can be considered a disorder if it negatively impacts one's life. This gets into how do you ultimately define a mental disorder, but I think it goes against how the majority of people think of a mental disorder. 

A minor point I've seen some people argue: the effects of ADHD meds. Some people claim that  ADHD meds help people with ADHD, and have different effects on neurotypical people. This argument is just silly to me. People with a prescription to Ritalin or something take it habitually and are therefore just going to have different symptoms than someone who takes it rarely and recreationally. Also, ADHD meds help everyone with motivation and executive function. It's amphetamine. 

Another minor point, all the people I know diagnosed with ADHD are wildly different. I know this alone obviously doesn't mean ADHD isn't real. However, a lot of other mental disorders cause sufferers to behave in certain similar ways. For example, autistic people (those who don't mask at least) all have pretty unique mannerisms. They hold themselves in an unusual way, struggle with eye contact and facial expressions, spend a lot of time in conversation on topics only interesting to them, and fidget in a distinctive way. This is consistent in every single individual I know who has been diagnosed with autism. People diagnosed with ADHD are the complete opposite. They differ in ability to socialize, mannerisms, and personality. The only vague through line I've been able to draw is poor impulse control. Before anyone says small sample size, I'm Gen Z and was in gifted education. 

Sidebar, I understand all mental illnesses are affected by society and one's individual life and temperament. You could make some of the same arguments about NPD or some other personality disorders. I'm not because I don't know very much about personality disorders. My claim is just that ADHD does not meet the definition of what most people would consider a mental disorder. 

In conclusion, I think ADHD is just a cluster of normal personality traits. These traits, like others, can negatively impact one's daily life. I have not heard any compelling arguments to suggest otherwise, so CMV! "

I am talking about modern, first-world meat-eaters, who can easily go vegan but choose not to, just because they enjoy eating meat.

If one has alternative sources of nutrition, then eating animal products is just for hedonism, not for sustenance.

Killing an animal for the sake of pleasure and hedonism is on the same moral level as raping an animal. It’s vicious cruelty and barbarism.

Appeals to tradition, or subjective disgust, aren’t a sufficient symmetry-breaker between animal slaughter and bestiality.

Tradition can justify absolutely anything, and we can’t base our morals solely off of the arbitrary emotions and whims of the majority.

If people find homosexuality disgusting, then homosexuality is immoral and criminal, by this logic.

Remember that bestiality is punishable by law under Western legal codes, and this degree of arbitrary subjectivity is not an acceptable justification for state-sanctioned violence.

Appeals to religion are also equally arbitrary. If God commanded one to rape children, then child rape is morally righteous.

Let’s face the truth. Modern day meat-eaters are morally on the same level as zoophiles.

There is one, and only one condition, in which I’ll change my view. 

If you can give me a non-arbitrary, mind-independent symmetry-breaker between animal slaughter and bestiality, then I will concede that my argument has been refuted."
0,2024-04-17,CMV: Fascism doesn't actually exist.,u/HanoiStarlet,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c669tn/cmv_fascism_doesnt_actually_exist/,changemyview,"There's a lot of descriptors for ideology. Democracy, monarchy, socialism, nationalism. These ideologies are pretty easy to describe in one sentence. Rule by the people, rule by a monarch, the people owning the means of production, independence and self-determination for an identifiable in-group, respectively.

&#x200B;

Fascism has no such identifiable characteristics. No two fascist movements have ever been the same or even mildly compatible. The characteristics that political scientists try to ascribe to fascist movements equally apply to other movements and ideologies and regimes that no one would describe as fascist. Wikipedia says that Fascism is characterized by a dictatorial leader (was the Roman Empire fascist?), strong regimentation (Is the UK fascist for rationing during and after WW2?), centralized autocracy (Was the Russian Empire fascist for having an autocracy?), militarism (Was Frederick the Great a fascist?), forcible suppression of opposition (Were the Jacobins fascist?), belief in a natural social hierarchy (Was Charles Darwin a fascist?), and subordination of individual interests for the good of the collective (Is Japanese, etc. culture fascist?).

&#x200B;

This isn't even touching on the huge differences in fascist ideology. Oswald Mosley (the most prominent fascist to have never actually come to power) was not a racial supremacist, was an extreme pacifist, an internationalist, believed in syndicalism (like socialism and representative democracy had a baby), freedom of religion, and shared power with the British Monarchy. Juxtapose this with other European ""Fascist"" movements of the time, you'll see that many of them were racial supremacists to the extent that no other race should exist, thought that without war the in-group would be diluted by undesirables that would otherwise succumb on the battlefield, utter isolationists who would only trade if it was because the other trade partner was previously conquered, switched between direct state ownership of capital to nigh anarcho-capitalism, had established state religions, and hated nobility and monarchy."

I AM WILLING TO HEAR WHAT YOU ALL HAVE TO SAY AND HOPEFULLY MY MIND WILL BE CHANGED BECAUSE I DONT WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY ABOUT ANY GROUP OR ANYONE
CONTEXT:
In my English class today I could not believe what I was hearing. I’m a straight Asian male half white as well. In my college class of about 40 students about 30 of them are girls other 6 dudes are gay and 4 are straight. Also most the girls I guess are gay or bisexual, didn’t even realize it as some of them seemed straight to me I guess idk why but it just surprised me. And we were having a class discussion on gender roles and all that lovely shit you want to talk about in a room full of 20 year old liberals who are about to spit the most uneducated garbage you’ve ever heard. And they were saying that ALL MEN ARE INHERENTLY EVIL and that straight men are the root of ALL problems, a girl even said that straight men are racist, homophobic sexist pigs AND THEN PROCEEDS TO SAY “fuck straight white men” THE NEXT SENTENCE. Everyone in the class laughed in agreement. I knew what she just said was bullshit and straight hateful so I said “isnt it pretty hypocritical for you to shun racism,sexism, and homophobia, and then making a racist, sexist and heterophobic comment. Aren’t you adopting the same hateful ideology they are?” And holy shit boys everyone was pissed, all I made was a simple observation on the hypocrisy of her words and it was like I just took a piss in their cereal, the whole group started kind of attacking me saying you can’t be racist to white people or sexist or heterophobic to anyone who’s had it good and had a position of power. I responded by super nicely saying “all I’m saying is isn’t it counterproductive to use their tactics and generalize a whole group this way? Isn’t this ideology dangerous and keep the hamster wheel of hate rotate forever” understanding I was facing a 1 vs 30 on these weirdos and I don’t want to get cancelled I just left it alone, and they calmed down but not after very mean looks and rude comments. They continued to say that asking someone their ethnicity is racist, (these are white people) like wtf you’re white. I’m Asian and people mistake my ethnicity all the time i literally do not care at all. Some dudes were agreeing with everything they say like how are you as a man going to listen to them say YOU ARE EVIL and agree, fucking spineless sellout. and I’ve realized why this community exist while observing all of this, it’s because they all agree with each other. Nobody disagrees everybody walks around Ice and finally they have found a purpose and a group and they feed off each others delusions. All the rejects and weirdos have come together to form a huge liberal extremist LGBTQ whatever the fuck you wanna say CULT. They exile you if you don’t agree, I literally felt like I was the minority for being normal. When the hell did that happen? These privileged blue haired liberals in America truly believe they are the center of pain in suffering in the world, some girl started crying explaining a moment she was misgendered “on purpose” even saying she was suicidal from that moment like there are people dying! Kids starving and war happening, and you think with your iPhone 15 and Starbucks coffee and bmw 7 series knows fuck all about true pain and suffering? They have no clue or perspective outside of their tiny bubble. Like my god, I believe the isolation from Covid along with mainstream media has fueled this community to create cancel culture and they truly are a hate group. The things they were saying were just plain hateful, and disturbing. And the fact my professor was agreeing, not verbally but laughing with the group and approving with his body language. THESE ARE FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS people are too privileged and live too much of a comfortable life that they have to literally create their own trauma and then form a support group. It’s absolutely insane, and for some reason media have given so much power to this woke group nobody can say anything!!!! Btw I am not racist or homophobic or tranformerphobic (even Reddit won’t let me say the word in order to post lol) sexist! Even though people will say I am, I just don’t like how they are so hateful and just kind of assholes to people when truly they could be nice about things and respectful. I find myself feeling more and more alienated from society as a whole. It’s a crazy feeling and it’s made me realize I need to get out of America. I don’t feel like my people are here, not saying my people have to be straight at all, just like chill people who have genuine personalities and aren’t so self absorbed with goofy and hateful thinking. Idk. I’m actually more on a democratic view point as well I’m not some weirdo right wing conservative that hates anyone gay or a different view than my own or something I FEEL LIKE IM JUST A NORMAL DUDE (also I live in a liberal city on the west coast try to guess lol)

It makes me truly believe deep in my soul that someday his dream will be realized and all people everywhere will be joined in brotherhood. Somehow, it will happen and we will be free. Nothing can possibly convince me otherwise. His religious language and references to the promised land (along with other thinkers) has convinced me that justice and goodness objectively exists as an eternal truth and that it is objectively good to strive for it, that someday justice and goodness will be realized. 

He inspired TENS OF MILLIONS of people, both black AND white to fight for justice, in one of the most divided time periods and racist countries on earth. He was the greatest orator who ever lived. Better than Hitler (who people often say was a great speaker), better than Ghandi, better than Lincoln, better than JFK. none of them come close.

But everyone who was around back then is getting old and soon there won't be anyone left who remembers the civil rights movement. He himself worried that the people born a hundred years later won't remember how much people had to struggle and sacrifice for them to have the freedoms they have and that they will take it for granted. Soon there won't be anyone left who can tell the stories from that era. Of course that ""era"" is still ongoing. The civil rights movement never ended and the fight is still ongoing. But you know what I mean. There was something special about him."

There are costumes, characters and ongoing storylines. The characters are played by actors most often not using their real names, but some do. There are scripts and lines and choreographed sequences like in any performance, not just theatre.

Some of the silly segments you get in wrestling are where two people have a one-on-one conversation, but stand in the middle of a wrestling ring in an arena full of people and use microphones to do it. Or a character is watching some other wrestlers in the ring on a monitor backstage, and rather than stand facing the monitor, they position themselves with their body facing the live camera and camera man there with them so you can see their latest t-shirt. These are just some of the bits that, if you think about it for more than a couple of seconds, are ridiculous and hilarious.

Any typically developed person over the age of 10 will understand that professional wrestling is a live-action performance. It's soap opera with stunt acting. So when I see/hear people say ""wrestling isn't real!"" or any variety I can't help but cringe because it's the same as saying they don't understand that almost everything on TV is in the same boat and/or are so socially inept that they think knowing wrestling isn't real combat sport is a rare thing. 

Imagine how bad you would feel for a person who, with utmost sincerity, said ""Keanu Reeves didn't really escape the real world, gain super powers and fight a machine army, you know!"" or ""That show, Wicked, doesn't have any real witches in it!"". That's how ""pro wrestling isn't real"" statements sound to me.

I'm not a regular watcher of wrestling, but I love me some Royal Rumble once a year and more often then not I'll buy Wrestlemania because it's the biggest show that gets put on. It's great fun. Hearing people say ""Oh, you actually LIKE that fake fighting stuff "" or some other statement makes me feel so embarrassed for them. It seems to usually come from men who think/feel that liking fake combat entertainment somehow makes them less tough.

To me these sort of statements scream really bad insecurity and a sort of ""I wish I could allow myself to like this thing I've convinced myself it's not OK to like."". Trust me, buddy, if you aren't able to admit you like the idea of watching absolute units hurl each other through tables and see people do back flips from ring posts onto others 10 feet below them on the outside of the ring, your not doing a good job of cultivating self-confidence, regardless of what you say.

Enjoying a think that's designed to be a scripted performance for your enjoyment isn't cringe. But trying to make out like it is and the people who do that suggesting people who like it mustn't realise it's fake is cringe as fuck."

What is the point of a toenail?

They could in theory protect against impacts from the top of the toe (for a small and very accurate impact), but such hits fall into one of X categories:

1. Too light to do any damage at all
2. Heavy enough that it could do damage against flesh, but light enough that a toenail could stop it
3. Heavy enough to do damage with or without a toenail

I'm not convinced that category is broad or beneficial enough to be swayed by.  And all of this is discounting that I wear shoes anyway!

They don't help me open things, like a fingernail.  Humans are long past needing them as weapons or for climbing.

On the downside, toenails require hygiene care lest they become ingrown, or can become infected or fungal.  Even at their best, they are consuming bodily resources in their endless pointless growth.  They have no benefits and can have drawbacks."

So I looked up some of the tenets of more radical Islamic groups (e.g.: Taliban) and found:

“…the hard-line Islamists have failed to live up to their promises and have instead severely curbed women’s freedoms, waged a brutal crackdown on dissent, and reintroduced their brutal form of justice.

Is the US heading down a road towards Religious Nationalism that will eventually impede the freedom and growth of the nation?

To me, though some may believe I’m reaching, Trump rhetoric and the goals of his most ardent supporters sound very much like the codified version of what radicalized groups believe and want, which is power over others “in the name of their “god”, i,e,: anyone that doesn’t agree with them. The use of god here is more or less a way to justify their hate of difference.

76,2024-04-17,CMV: Invoking trust is overrated in any romantic relationships if you’re aiming to make it last.,u/GirlInABarnacle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c6bpdl/cmv_invoking_trust_is_overrated_in_any_romantic/,changemyview,"Blind trust. Or trust without presenting information as to why. 

People throw around the word trust, and that there’s no meaning to having a relationship without trust but I’d argue the opposite. I think one shouldn’t put your partner in a place where they have to invoke that trust for you in the first place. 

Instead take care to simply not put yourself into any compromising situations that might require explanations. If you’re presented with doubts or accusations, especially when your partner may have their reasons, and you can easily disprove them then why invoke trust or put your partner in that place where they have to take that leap of faith?  Why not simply present them the proof and move on? Requiring someone to trust you, when you can disprove something in itself says something sus is up.

For example of a situation, it’s easier to simply not entertain a co-worker off hours rather than demand your spouse trust no funny business is ongoing. If I were the spouse, you’d lose my ‘trust’ in you the moment you engaged in anything suspicious or crossing boundaries and furthermore brushed away my concerns or something.

With how cheating, porn, porn addictions, extramarital affairs is not only normalized but also also easily accessible in this day and age blindly having trust in someone is a very stupid thing and serves no one. Not only concerning monogamy but also financial situations and other things that might cause frictions in a relationship. Of course one is entitled to their privacy, but if you want to build a lasting relationship, you should take any and every way to alleviate your partners doubts."

0,2024-04-17,"CMV: With the moral framework most people have, bestiality should not be considered immoral.",u/wahedcitroen,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c6citl/cmv_with_the_moral_framework_most_people_have/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I do not make this post out of personal sexual preference, purely out of philosophical interest in morality. I am not advocating for people to go and have sex with animals.

In this post I argue that in the dominant moral climate, it is inconsistent to categorically condemn bestiality as immoral.

To make this argument I have a couple assumptions, which most people in our society have as well.

1. Morality is rational. Moral statements are not just expressions of disgust. Morality has to be built on rational foundations within a logically coherent system. 

2. Non-veganism is moral.

Most people would say bestiality is immoral. In order for an action to be considered immoral it has do more than to “feel” bad. It has to hurt the interests of a morally significant being. 

Hitting an animal is considered animal abuse because it causes the animal pain. We cannot look inside the animal brain to know if it actually dislikes pain, but it’s behaviour is such that it avoids pain. Therefore we can assume animals have the same aversion towards pain we have, and therefore causing animals pain is immoral.
Enslaving people is immoral because humans have an interest in being free. With animals it is more difficult. Many people would not say having a pet is immoral even though you take freedom from the animal. we are willing to say animals do not have the same interest as we do in being free. In animal behaviour we often don’t see animals wanting to be free(when captivity is comfortable). So how can we assume being free is actually good for an animal?

The same difficulty concerns sexual morality. To a human, having having sex without consent hurts the interests of the person. It does not matter if there is no physical harm or coercion, the principle of not having consent is enough to be considered immoral.

In bestiality, consent is often pulled into the discussion. Bestiality is called immoral because animals by definition cannot consent. But how meaningful is the notion of consent in animals that cannot speak? A dog that happily wags is tail when being petted and obviously enjoys the scratches has not consented to any of it, and they cannot properly do it. If dog doesn’t want to be petted it can give signs of distress or walk away. We accept that body language as valid communication. We don’t wait for a verbal communication because nonverbal is sufficient.

So 1. We don’t know if sexual autonomy is something that animals value.
2. Our notion of consent is too limited to analyse animals who communicate nonverbally. 

If a sexual act physically hurts the animal it is obviously abuse. But the situation where someone let’s a dog lick peanutbutter of her vulva. Does the dog care the woman gets off from the licking? Why would the dog care? It gets peanutbutter. Or a situation where a woman sits on all fours and let’s a dog penetrate her. Does he not act on his own volition? Assuming he is free to walk away and will not be physically harmed of course. What is there to indicate this dog is unhappy with the situation? In humans we can see psychological harm. But are these dogs really psychologically harmed?(interested if someone has a source on this)

These actions are now considered animal abuse per definition because animals can’t consent. But is consent a term we can use when it concerns animals? Or at least, should we modify consent so nonverbal communication common to the specific animal is included?

I can understand why people are not convinced by this and would argue sexual autonomy is important for animals, and that them not being able to consent is still a problem. 
However, taking this route is still problematic for most people. Because most people do accepte violation of animals’ autonomy when it concerns food, and don’t care about animal consent in any other action concerning animals.
Humans rape cows by proxy to make them pregnant so they will give milk. Humans actively encourage duck rape in duck farms to breed them. This is more than letting nature be nature, however sick nature may be. This is us fostering the terrible parts of the natural world. We think it is terrible to have sex with an animal, but chopping off the genitals of pets to prevent minor inconvenience to the owner is uncontroversial. 
Even worse than violation of sexual autonomy, we kill animals for food.

This is all not necessary. Most people eat more meat than needed for a healthy life. They do it just because they like it. So why is it generally allowed to violate animals for our taste pleasure and pet-related pleasure but not for sexual pleasure? A dog licking peanutbutter off a vulva is better of f (according to me) than a pig in a slaughterhouse. Condemning bestiality as immoral by definition is therefore inconsistent. Most people are disgusted by bestiality(as am I), but they have confused this aesthetic position for a moral one. But banning sexual acts just because we are disgusted by them is not a valid reason. That opens the door to things like Nigeria criminalising homosexuality.(this last sentence is a reach don’t take it too seriously but just to illustrate the flaw in our moral system)

If anyone has counterarguments  I’m curious."

It's going to cost them.,u/attlerexLSPDFR,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c6ekbu/cmv_donald_trump_and_the_wider_maga_movement_are/,changemyview,"To begin, my claim is not that Donald Trump is guaranteed to lose the 2024 Presidential election. I'm not saying that the GOP will never win a majority.

My point here is that by fighting this culture war, the 'MAGA' movement is far more confident than they should be. They believe that they represent the majority of Americans in this conflict against 21st century progressive culture.

In the past it was honestly a profitable strategy. Only around 5% of the US population identifies as LGBTQ with only 0.5% identifying as transgender. It was easy for the GOP to vilify trans folks, to make sweeping threats and claims against the LGBTQ community. The LGBTQ community made up such a small percentage of the population that even if every Queer person voted Democrat (and not all of us do) it wouldn't make much difference.

Donald Trump and his wider 'MAGA' movement were able to scapegoat Hispanic-Americans without facing serious repercussions because they only represent 20% of the US population. Trump could say the most vile things about Hispanic people and even if EVERY Hispanic-American voted against him, it still wouldn't be enough.

Donald Trump made repeated attempts to blame Asian-Americans for the pandemic and largely succeeded. The proliferation of terms like ""Kung-Flu"" and ""China-Virus"" even in 2024 represents his success. The thing is, Asian-Americans only make up 7% of the population. He could say whatever he wanted and even if EVERY Asian-American voted against him, it wouldn't make a difference.

5% LGBT+ 20% Hispanic + 7% Asian = 32%
Not enough to sway the vote.

I think the biggest mistake Donald Trump could make was turning American women against him. Scapegoating minorities is one thing, but slashing your support in such a major democratic will be deadly. Women make up half of America, losing the female vote would be devastating for the GOP.

He has gone ""A bridge too far"" sorta speak. Of course he has burned other bridges too; COVID victim's families, military families, Gold Star Families, healthcare workers, Ukrainians, Muslims, but those are not as significant and not everyone in those camps will stop supporting him. The most important bridge for the Donald was women and that thing is crashing to the ground. He underestimated the voting power of women and they are about to feel it.

I have recently come across a youtube video about why abortions should be legal but killing a newborn should not. 

the argument was like ""when a baby is born into this world it forms relationships with the doctor, nurses, family members, and there are inherent values to that so killing a newborn is not right"" and to me it just seems so... arbitrary. 

like how is it different from ultrasound? how is it different from the mom feeling the baby kicking inside? why can't everybody just accept that it has more to do with the fact that killing a baby after seeing its cute ass face just feels so wrong? at least admit that you are killing a baby and move on with your life with that in your heart so you don't do it again?

another example would be ""why you can eat cow, pig, chicken but not dogs"" but I digress.

I would really like to point out that I don't think morals are useless. feeling good is like the whole purpose of this life thing. but acting like these things are set in stones, and the mental gymnastics tire me from time to time."

I genuinely believe this for all drugs, the only drugs that I think would have a significant increase in use are party drugs and psychedelics and I think the decrease in deaths from bad drugs, and the decrease in robberies/thefts/violence that accompany drug deals would make up for increase in recreational drug use.


The ability for the court and the justice system to be retooled away from drug enforcement and put torwards violent crime is also a huge benefit.

Obvious content warning for pedophilia, as well as mentions of sexual assault and abuse.

(Inb4 nobody reads this and people just call me a pedo because the internet has created a social environment in which people have little desire to try to understand controversial viewpoints/viewpoints which they don't share, and only want to look for things to get mad at. I don't know if this subreddit is like that, I've never posted here, but that is what has happened whenever I've tried to have a genuinely insightful and logical conversation with someone about this.)

Before I start, I'll clarify that I myself am not a pedophile, I have no attraction to children, and *I'm most definitely not saying that pedophilia is ""okay"" or that people should start getting into relationships with kids* who don't understand that they can't make decisions like choosing to enter a relationship with an adult. You shouldn't be in a relationship with a child. I fully understand why age of consent laws are a thing - kids just can't make decisions like that as they can be taken advantage of without them realizing it. I of course empathize with victims of CSA (Childhood Sexual Abuse) and realize the harm that pedophiles can cause for children when they act upon their desires - my girlfriend was sexually assaulted at a very young age by two adults and was deeply traumatized. Most people are understandably disgusted when hearing about situations like this.

That being said, I just don't think it's fair to anyone to be hated just for being themselves. This has happened a lot throughout history to people who (usually) aren't treated that way anymore, which Ill touch on in a second. You can't control what you're born with, and you don't deserve to be hated or disregarded or dehumanized for what your brain makes you do (referring to merely having an attraction to children, not acting upon this attraction - you most definitely can control raping people. If you're thinking about raping someone you should try to seek a healthy and non-harmful outlet for your desires or speak to someone who can help you.)

I don't think pedophiles are monsters or that they deserve to die or burn in hell, or that they're inherently dangerous. I say that they're people just like anyone else who happen to possess an attraction that they can't do a whole lot about, which they have the potential to hurt people with, if they act upon their attraction. Many pedophiles are the way they are as a result of being traumatized by CSA when they were young -

Let me draw a comparison which might seem laughable - I genuinely believe that the attitude that most people have towards pedophiles today is akin to the experience of gay people before and for a pretty long time after the Counterculture movement of the 1960's. Homosexual attraction, like any sexual attraction, is involuntary. Gay people can't choose not to be attracted to people of their own sex, nobody with a set sexual orientation can change theirs - and yet, throughout most of history and within most societies in the world, they've been dehumanized and treated as if they're irredeemable, just because of one aspect of themselves which they don't have the ability to control or change. That idea, thankfully, has eroded away relatively quite recently in history, mostly here in the Western world.

The idea that homosexuality is ""bad"" is largely gone; the standards for sexual orientation are undergoing change as well as viewpoints on gender and race relations. My point here is that ""right"" and ""wrong,"" or ""good"" and ""bad,"" are largely arbitrary concepts which change as history continues to unfold and ideological shifts occur among groups of people.

A line is crossed, however, when a pedophile actually tries to engage with a child, by entering a relationship with them or v

For the purposes of this discussion I will primarily refer to ""American Indians"" as ""Native Americans"", but I'm not necessarily advocating for the use of that term either. 

1. The term ""American Indian"" derives primarily from a mistake from a colonizer. Columbus thought he stumbled on to the West Indies and branded the brown people he saw ""Indians"". While we acknowledge many of Columbus and the country's early wrong doings today, we keep going with this term.

2. This created minimal conflict because Indian Americans have historically not had a large presence or voice in the United States due to colonization and systemic difficulties with immigration. However, last year, Indian Americans [surpassed](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/national-international/indians-surpass-chinese-as-largest-asian-alone-group-in-us/3347051/) Chinese Americans to become the largest ""asian-alone"" group in the US.  

3. The growing Indian-American population makes it important for them to access opportunities and information specific to their community. This is difficult when even the US Government fully supports the term's use. The US ""[Bureau of Indian Affairs](https://www.usa.gov/agencies/bureau-of-indian-affairs)"" is meant for Native Americans. Searching ""Indian American"" on the NIH website [even with quotes](https://search.nih.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=nih&query=%22indian+american%22&commit=Search) brings up mostly Native American research. 

4. Even the Smithsonian ""National Museum of the American Indian""  admits the term [is controversial](https://americanindian.si.edu/nk360/informational/impact-words-tips). As they say, ""American Indian, Indian, Native American, or Native are acceptable and often used interchangeably in the United States; however, Native Peoples often have individual preferences on how they would like to be addressed. To find out which term is best, ask the person or group which term they prefer.""

The Smithsonian neglects to consider the preferences of Indian Americans, though. If there's no consensus on what term the Native American community prefers, community members should work toward identifying one that does not impact another cultural group.

You're setting them up for failure especially if they're very similarly aged, because a 1 month old takes so much time and attention away from your 1 year old, and then another kid after that means you keep leaving the eldest with little to no development time.

You can't raise 6 kids equally without some of them being identical to one another, which stifles them and causes hard overcorrections later on in life..You can't do 4 children's projects equally, usually they can't support 4 people's wotth of hobbies. Someone somewhere has to fall through the cracks whether it be hand-me-downs or this forceful ""oh go on play football with your brother even though you hate it"" to keep from any outlandish identities that risk too much time away from other kids.

(3) Anyone who blames all their problems on women. (4) Anyone who masturbates to anime/game characters.

I've also seen some feminists claim that you are NOT an incel if you can't get laid but don't hate women. But there are also people who don't agree with this.

I feel like the word ""incel"" is slowly starting to lose its original meaning, and has now just turned into a go-to insult toward anybody you don't like.

For instance, I once saw some people calling a guy an incel only because he called an anime character hot (nothing graphic, nothing more than that). When I looked at his profile, it was clear that he had a wife (who was pregnant), a job, and other hobbies. Is that REALLY an incel?

I just feel like the word gets tossed around so much that it almost lost its meaning. And when people do try to engage with that term more deeply, it gets muted by the fact that so many people seem to define it differently. Couldn't we at least settle on a specific definition? I've been called an incel once, even AFTER I explained that I'm married, leftist, do not hate women, do not think women are subservient to men, and do not think women owe sex to men. Even after making my stance clear, he still kept calling me an incel as if just for the purpose of pushing me."

(The answer is: Some empires are better than others and we arent at a point where we dont need global superpowers to keep order).

Iran-apologists often point out, correctly, how immense the suffering of Persians is under the most extreme sanctions in history for the past 30 years. I won't go into specifics, but for that country, their standard of living, quality of medical care, food, etc is decades behind the Gulf States. This is often used to justify releasing the sanctions, or just brought up to make the West look bad or imply the US is the problem with everything and we would have world peace if they would intervene in other countries (who are only mad because they want to be the one intervening).

But think about how, given all that, the regimes scarce resources are still being shipped hundreds of Kms away to Shia terrorist groups in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Gaza, just so they can control a tiny potion of these countries. That is how dedicated and serious the regime is about expansionism and (re) building some Shia/Persian Empire. 

The sanctions may not have changed their behavior, but they have made it harder for them to carey out that goal. For a country with that population and economic size, their military is vastly smaller and more technologically backwards than most other countries (that have a military presence the International System anyway), showing that over-time sanctions lowering the resources being put into the military compound.

Fyi, despite the BS the Far-Left spews, most for-profit corporations oppose stuff like this. Halliburton lobbied for releasing Iraqi sanctions in the 90s when Dick Cheney was its head (""it"" is the dramatically correct pronoun for corporations btw, not ""they""). Teddy faced massive pressure from the business community when he was getting involved in international conflicts, and hopefully we all know what the business community wanted in the 30s and 40s (H.W.'s dad was involved in a planned coup of FDR to install a fascist regime)."

I’m taking the definition of disparity as: lack of similarity or equality; inequality. This (and many times when salary between leagues is brought up) it is said to be unfair. The situations are not equal. They shouldn’t be compared. 


I don’t think it’s unfair that the 1st pick of the NBA will make more than the WNBA. I don’t think their pay should be equal. In this case, I don’t believe it is sexist, mean, belittling or have any negative connotations to the difference of pay.

I saw a video of a woman chasing down adam Sandlers car to a red light while filming and catches up to it and adam say “ hey guys how was work?” The girl replies “ it was good thank you” adam replies “okay guys be good”. That’s it. I read the comments and people are commenting like omg he’s so cool, he’s genuinely such a good person. Honestly, from adam’s pov you probably seemed like a crazy person. That probably made him uncomfortable.

I understand it if they have accomplished something you are striving for. For example: if you are aspiring to become professional soccer player and you have the chance to meet Ronaldo or something. They’ve achieved what you want, makes sense. But most of the time people have these obsessive idolization just because they are famous.

Iv also seen other interaction between people and celebrities and often times Iv seen celebrities being visually annoyed by the fans presence. Like it seems the celebs don’t even like it. Im sure they like it when you buy their music, or watch their movies though haha.

For instance, under the *status quo* a Hindu who is a vegetarian for religious reasons would be legally entitled to a greater degree of protection and accomodation in a workplace that provides food(or at least a government workplace), compared to an atheist who is vegetarian for ethical/environmental reasons. 

""Freedom of religion"", at least when applied in an unbiased manner, may provide comparable levels of protection to different religions, but religious individuals and beliefs overall get a greater degree of protection than their secular counterparts. The end result is a society that privileges the religious. 

There are plenty of compelling reasons to prohibit certain religious practices, take Quranic instruction for husbands to hit disobedient wives to correct their behavior, or Jewish circumcision practices that mutilate baby boys and in some cases result in STD transmission. 

These actions enjoy *prima facie* protection if freedom of religion is constitutionally protected. Certainly it is not unlimited and high courts may rule that prohibiting these actions is constitutionally permissible. But this is just invitation for unelected judges to legislate from the bench. Ultimately they decide normative political questions regarding the importance of a certain religious practices vs. society's interest in restricting them based on their own personal values. 

Not protecting freedom of religion does not mean the end of the religion, it does not mean that the government would be free to completely eradicate certain religions. Religious teaching and proselytization would still be protected under freedom of speech. But religious actions that are not merely speech, that have the real potential to harm others, would rightly no longer enjoy any protection. After all, why should they enjoy any more protection than say, political violence? Certainly to many ultranationalist and leftist extremists their political ideologies are just as important to their identities as religions are to their believers. "

Also, multiple people who have zero work ethic because they were coddled by their parents financially throughout their 20s. And people who have zero financial responsibility. 

I genuinely believe if parents pushed their kids to at least have some sort of work when they are legally able to, it would instill more financial responsibility, work ethic, and overall drive.

But if they never voiced that opinion at all—kept it to themselves—no one would even know that they think a character's butt is sexy, or that they jerk off to a picture of some unreal person.

My point is, if someone HAS these thoughts/fantasies, but never reveals them—and never treats women poorly as a result of them—how can such thoughts be bad?

As a random example, I have sexual crushes on quite a few fictional women. And sometimes I have fantasies about them. I find them sexy, but I rarely talk about their sex appeal because I know I'd be called creepy, perverted, weird, sexist, etc. However, in spite of these raunchy thoughts, I've still been friends with women, and am currently dating (though my girlfriend *knows* I have these crushes; she has fantasies of sexy characters too). If I so much as publicly post a sexual thought, I'd be part of the creepy sexist crowd. But if I don't, I'm pretty much just another guy. The same people who might think I'm a creepy jerk for finding so-and-so's butt sexy would suddenly ignore me or even think good of me if I posted something else.

So, change my view: there's nothing wrong with having pervy, sexual, raunchy, even objectifying thoughts, as long as you don't reveal them or act on them.

(Of course, if a guy has these sexual thoughts AND acts on them, or bitterly treats women like they must be subservient to men's desires, then he's a shithead with major social issues. The point here is that guy can freely have these thoughts, but *shouldn't* treat women like his fantasies.)"
0,2024-04-17,CMV: Morality is subjective,u/Orang-Himbleton,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c6qiy1/cmv_morality_is_subjective/,changemyview,"So I’m aware that moral realism is more popular than moral subjectivism among philosophers, and I’ve heard some of the reasons why, but I don’t truly understand them, so, in order to get a starting point to argue with you all, I’m going to link an [article](https://blogs.calbaptist.edu/scm/2020/02/04/is-morality-subjective-or-objective/) where the author argues for objective morality, and I’ll use that to show you guys my views on morality.

>First, the argument from common sense. If morality is subjective (and thus relative to society), then there is really nothing wrong with slavery. But that’s nuts! Slavery is obviously wrong (and objectively so!). Therefore, it follows by logic alone that morality is not subjective.

I would think the point here is primarily that there’s nothing “objectively wrong” with slavery, and I guess I would be willing to bite that bullet on that. I think a pretty decent counterargument would be that a slaveowner from 300+ years ago is just as morally culpable as a slaveowner in the present day. And, idk, it seems weird to me to want call the American founding fathers just as if not more evil than Jeffrey Dahmer.

>Second, the argument from disagreement. Consider a paradigmatic example of subjectivity: taste. I think vanilla is greater than chocolate. Chocolate is alright, but clearly not as good as vanilla! My wife wholeheartedly disagrees. She’s convinced that I’m wrong. Ask yourself this, though: if we were to have an argument about which is better (chocolate or vanilla), would we really be disagreeing about an objective fact in the world? No. Clearly not. That’s because this whole dispute boils down to a matter of taste. And taste is subjective.

>So here’s the argument. Analogously, if morality is subjective, then no two people could ever really disagree about a particular moral issue (in the same way that my wife and I don’t really disagree about an objective fact in the world when it comes to taste). But that’s ridiculous. Just turn on the news for a few seconds, and you’ll see people clearly disagreeing about moral issues! Therefore, it follows by logic alone that morality is not subjective.

In the case of the ice cream analogy, I think you would be disagreeing about a fact of the world. Or, at the very least, you’d be doing it in the same way you would if you were to talk about morality. Like, both parties can see, touch, and taste the ice cream, so they can tell each other how they experience each of these facts of the food, compare those foods to other foods, and then maybe they still won’t be able to come to any sort of common ground. I don’t see why this process is any different than the process of discussing morality. It seems like the term “better” in the ice cream example and “goodness” in morality have a lot in common. They both refer to a sort of hierarchy with respect to taste/morality, and they can have wildly different meanings depending on who you ask. I don’t see what makes one subjective and the other objective in any clearly defined way.

Most of the comments were in disagreement, but they mentioned how this argument would mean decreasing quality of life or being miserable.

I disagree. From what I've heard, socialist concepts like universal housing don't require one to live comfortably, going out to eat every other lunch and dinner or have the convenience of living a walkable distance from work (though the car industry and urban-suburban sprawl are capitalist tools, but that's another discussion). It just aims to ensure basic human rights. For example, someone once corrected me when I said the goal of socialism and leftism is to ensure that everyone can live comfortably, and said the goal is closer to making sure everyone has basic needs met.

IIRC Second Thought's counterargument to the idea that socialism would kill incentive to work follows similar logic: JT points out that people would still like to buy luxuries and entertainment products, neither of which are guaranteed with a UBI or housing; they're like DLC to the base game socialism believes everyone should have."

If AI is “garbage in garbage out”, it seems our medical data is quite garbage, and so AI output will mostly be garbage 

2. Medical advances rely on scientific method, observation and clinical trials. Even if AI can suggest some good ideas or point us in the right direction, ideas need rigorous safety data, testing and substantial financing before they become reality. AI legally won’t be able to cure our diseases overnight, as its conclusions will need to be validated by lengthy studies and trials

Tipping Culture in the US specifically has gotten way out of hand I mean it’s ridiculous at this point.

But nowadays there seems to be a weird vibe that you have to always tip, and if you don’t you are a scumbag or something. 

I grew up learning and understanding the value of tipping for GOOD service, not shitty service. If I go to a car wash and after my car still has visible stains and missed spots, I should not be forced to provide a tip for that service. 

And I know what you are thinking right now no one is forcing me to give anyone a tip. The issue is looks of shame and disgust that people in the service industry will give you, as well as the overall peer pressure of how others perceie you. 

And let’s not get started about when you give someone a tip and they feel like it is too small of an amount. A recent example is I gave my DoorDash driver a $10 tip for a $15 order, and he told me that it was disrespectful because it was not enough to cover his gas for driving to me. 

It’s little instances like this that make me feel the service industry in America have literally lost their minds when it comes to this whole tipping thing.

But I will say on that last point came from a tall family on both sides and still somehow came out to be 5’4… genetics is a weird thing. 
       I for one am considering it later on down the line when it’s safer and more affordable. I believe a lot short men will do the same as well. I do not see anything wrong with this if they can do this with their own money and time. This will be better for society probably as a whole.

There are three ways we can look at the issue of respecting each others beliefs

1. We can say that everyones beliefs are entitled to respect, which is ludicrous because that would mean we would have to respect the beliefs of those who think that rape, murder and/or torture are ok.
2. We can say, and this is what most people say, that some beliefs are entitled to respect and that some aren't, but then where do you draw this line? Everyone will have a different viewpoint on which beliefs supposedly have to be respected and which don't. This gives everyone their own subjective viewpoint on which beliefs supposedly are obligated and bound to respect, so everyone is coming to a subjective conclusion on a supposedly objective point of which beliefs are **bound** to respect.
3. We can say then that no one's beliefs are entitled to respect, as thats the final option left, and the much simpler reason for this is that people can't always force themselves to respect others beliefs. Like I could not force myself to respect the beliefs of many religious views that other see as moderate, and thats just how it is for me, and thats my right."
24,2024-04-18,CMV: I don’t believe going back in time and killing one person would change much,u/astronautmyproblem,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c6vg6z/cmv_i_dont_believe_going_back_in_time_and_killing/,changemyview,"I saw a post about the theoretical ethics question, “What if you could go back in time and kill baby Hitler?”

I know that part of the debate is whether it would be okay to kill a baby you know will do horrific things. But that’s not what I’m focusing on.

**Overall, I believe everything that happens in history is the result of a collective social / cultural push rather than the specific actions of an individual.** For example, you can look at the Wright Bros in the US, who were literally RACING other inventors to claim the patent for their plane. If they hadn’t done it, someone else would’ve—and not that much later, timeline-wise.

Obviously that example is simpler and clearer than others because we can look at the other people involved and know for sure that it was a literal race. But I believe this to be true for everything world-changing.

For example, I truly believe that killing baby Hitler wouldn’t stop the Holocaust because someone else would have risen up and done it—the environment was poised with hate and bigotry and resentment, and Hitler just happened to be the one to drive it over the line.

As another example, I believe that if Trump hadn’t ran for office, we still would’ve had this push of white nationalism and events such as Jan 6 (albeit maybe not on Jan 6 exactly) because I think that was an almost inevitable swing America was going to experience after Obama.

I will acknowledge that I don’t believe every single event would play out the *exact same way* if someone else was in charge—but I believe if we look at the timeline of humanity broadly, that the differences would be minimal. Occasionally someone super intelligent might invent something 10 years sooner than it would be invented otherwise, for example, or Trump might use specific language that helps erode political decorum in this particular way, but the trends would be loosely the same.

As a final note, I don’t believe this absolves any bad people of guilt or minimizes people’s accomplishments. Just that essentially no one is that important on a big scale."

Honestly, if I were in the president's shoes, I might have made the same decision to take out those high-ranking officers.

0,2024-04-18,CMV: It is wasted time to care about politics at all.,u/curiousdroid42,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c719fa/cmv_it_is_wasted_time_to_care_about_politics_at/,changemyview,"My lifetime is valuable. I have many interesting and, more importantly, uplifting things to care about: my family, my hobbies, my friends, my company. I really love spending time on all of this. Quality time with my partner and my kids, creating things, socializing with people I love, and growing my company in playful ways. Unfortunately, my day has only 24 hours, so I have to choose wisely how to allocate my time.  
I see no merit in caring about politics at all. I am not interested in listening to political news, I am not bothered by which party wants to do what, I don’t waste time forming an opinion on politics, I’m not under the illusion that my vote would change anything. I can’t even remember how many decades ago I last participated in an election.  
So, am I perfectly happy with politics as it is? No, of course not. But I value personal agency way higher than the current political climate. Whatever the current politics and political actions are, I don’t care. I deeply care about my life and the lives of the people close to me.  
Instead of wasting lifetime hoping or even lobbying for any kind of change, I prefer to use the time to adapt my life to the situation I live in. There, I have immediate agency, power, and the satisfying feeling of getting the results I want. Also, I hold the opinion that politics is the most dishonest, corrupt, and despicable field imaginable. It is an ongoing power play between the worst possible characters. Why would I degrade my life quality by even listening to it?  
It really doesn’t matter. Ultra-left, ultra-right, ultra-centrist government? I do not care. It has absolutely nothing to do with my life. Since ultra-libertarian is never on the list, I have to pay my taxes anyway, and I was never happy with how my tax money is spent, so whatever.  
This is going to be forbidden, that is going to be allowed. I do not care; none of it will change anything in my life. So why bother at all?  
Am I happy with politics as it is? No, but still, I consider it irrelevant. I also don’t like the weather sometimes. But you know what? If it’s cold outside, I just grab a warmer jacket and turn back to doing interesting and rewarding things.  
I’m a bit older already, Gen X actually. When I was young, we tried to be political. That’s what young people do, right? Some of us threw stones at police cars, some yelled at demonstrations for or against something, some engaged in political parties, some lobbied, some rallied... And looking back, none of it mattered, nothing was changed or achieved, it was wasted lifetime. The people who strictly focused on their own lives early were far better off. They did achieve the change they wanted. The political guys got frustrated, cynical, or simply corrupted. That’s how it works.  
My personal values and preferences are a mix of current progressive and conservative positions. To give an example, I think free choice is a good thing and also strict law and order enforced by a strong police is a good thing. I think smoking weed should nowhere be criminalized, and I also think zero tolerance towards any kind of theft would benefit society. Just to give two random examples. So no candidate or policy will satisfy my preferences anyway. I’ve always looked at it like this. So why bother? Again, am I perfectly happy with the status quo? No, but I find it not difficult to live with it as it is.  
How so? Well, to give an example: Abortion forbidden locally? Okay, so in case of an emergency, a flight to a state or country where it’s legal solves it. Smoking weed illegal? Okay, so I smoke only in my own garden where nobody cares.  
Realistically, as long as we don’t end up with a Stalin or a Hitler as president, all is good. Good enough to ignore the noise of current political weather. Nothing stays as it is. One time this side goes overboard, next time the other. Democracy does a great job keeping extremes in check. Today we look back at policies from 10 years ago and see them critically. In 10 years we will look back at today’s politics and see what went wrong. The hot topics change, majorities and political climate change, what is virtue and what is overcome changes all the time. None of it matters for personal happiness. The only thing that matters is family, friends, and a good life. It’s really as simple as that.  
Whoever comes to political power is irrelevant for the vast majority of people. And even if it were predictable that we one day wake up in a hardcore authoritarian left or authoritarian right government which then actually would interfere with my ability to just live and enjoy my life, I would still consider just moving to another country instead of participating in any attempt to change anything. My life is too short; politics is just not worth it. I have interesting things to spend my time on, I am busy doing fulfilling things and being happy.  
I have zero interest in news, fear porn, divide, outrage, random minority issues, and other extreme positions. I have zero victim mentality and I don’t need any politics to change or fix anything. I’m flexible enough myself to deal with whatever. As any other human being. While being far from perfect, it’s all good enough to leave plenty of room for personal agency. Focusing on this is well invested time. Politics is not.  
Disclaimer about me: I don’t live in the US. Also, I was born not only poor but in an actually communist country that collapsed and now I’m well off living now in a capitalist country. I’ve seen left and right-wing flavored governments, so I know firsthand how both feel: It’s greatly irrelevant for personal life, choices, and happiness."
14,2024-04-18,CMV: private sector rental price caps are major contributors to housing crises except in niche situations.,u/Immediate_Penalty680,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c71s4d/cmv_private_sector_rental_price_caps_are_major/,changemyview,"I am speaking from a European perspective. In my view, private sector rental price caps seem to be detrimental to the state of the housing market everywhere I've lived so far. It's often a self perpetuating cycle: housing costs are increasing too much, but often this is coupled with building costs also increasing a lot due to various factors. Then, rental prices are capped, hence rates of new construction decrease, the housing prices get worse, rental price regulation becomes more strict as a response, rinse and repeat.

 If there is a considerable housing shortage, and we artificially force low rental prices, it takes away economic incentives from builders to scale up, and it prevents the supply demand curve from organically correcting the supply crisis. Note that one major exception I recognise is that if there are other factors which would otherwise prohibit the building of more housing, such as if there's no more land available, but this is often not the case, as land value would also ideally be influenced by the severity of the shortage, and as land value increases it incentivises higher density construction, so theoretically it would also self correct, in a way that housing shortage would increase density of housing constructed naturally, and old low density construction with hugely increasing land value will be bought up and replaced with new high density construction.

From my experience, I see this happening in the Netherlands where I live. More and more reports come in each year of the housing shortage getting worse, and the policy response is always regulating the market further. Then, I'm seeing investors and major players in the housing sector moving to neighbouring, economically friendlier regions, and rates of new construction just keep decreasing. Economists seem to understand this, and they're always ringing the alarm bells, but the ministers respondible for housing seemingly aren't educated enough in economics to understand this or I don't know what their motivations are, the voter base (and hence the ministers) usually blame the housing shortage on immigrants and refugees, which I think is extremely reductive. Would love to hear the other side of this argument, and how private sector rent caps can work with a healthy market dynamic in the housing sector, because I don't see any good examples anywhere."

When Nat Turner rebelled and killed more than 50 White people, abolitionists did not stop supporting abolition, in fact he is viewed quite favourably today by African Americans. Or when ANC bombed Church Street which killed 19 people and wounded 200 more, many South African Blacks saw that as justified yet it doesn't mean one should stop opposing the apartheid. Similarly, just because many Palestinians believe that the Oct 7th attacks are justified, it doesn't mean that I should stop supporting them in getting their right to self determination.  

The other accusation I get a lot is that I am homophobic to support the Palestinians, which is strange given that I am bisexual myself. Truth be told, when considering all matters in politics, I probably have more in common with the average Israeli than the average Palestinian, but the right to self-determination, the right to safety, and the right to basic necessities are not and should not be conditioned on someone having political beliefs that align with mine. If that is the case then I would not support most self-determination movements in the world because I am solidly on the left on most issues.

I think the converse is true as well, if someone is standing in solidarity with Israelis, I do not immediately assume that they support Bibi or the Israeli settlers (in fact odds are they don't). I am very well aware that someone can simply believe in Israel's right to self-defence without taking Bibi's actual political positions into account.

So I would like to hear why standing in solidarity with the Palestinians necessarily means that I endorse or support political positions that are mainstream amongst Palestinians."

It boils down to:
-Access to private education is directly correlated to better academic outcomes, even when corrected to other factors.
-Better academic outcomes are directly correlated to a higher degree of life success and income
-The ability of a child to access private education is entirely reliant on luck- the circumstances of their birth.

Counter arguments I probably won't buy are:
-Exceptional children can still acccess private education- non-exceptional children can't unless they're lucky, and they benefit too.

0,2024-04-18,CMV: There is no such thing as an unfalsifiable claim,u/justafanofz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c77dhf/cmv_there_is_no_such_thing_as_an_unfalsifiable/,changemyview,"I often see people say that god is an unfalsifiable claim. To demonstrate this, they will use something like Russell’s Teapot or the “monster under the bed.”

I am of the position that no claim is unfalsifiable. Due to there being an objective reality, every claim about that reality must be either true or false. 

So what about these unfalsifiable claims?

Well, let’s take intelligent life on other planets.

Statistically speaking, there should be some. But as Fermi’s paradox points out, we haven’t heard from them. Space is silent. 

So as of right now, we can’t prove the existence or non-existence of intelligent life. But does that mean we will never be able to? No. It’s just currently, no evidence In support of one position or another has been presented.

So this claim is, what I’d call, currently unfalsifiable, but it, in and of itself, is not unfalsifiable, and will be proven one way or the other one day.

So how is a claim falsified? Thanks to three core laws of logic, I believe they can falsify anything. Law of identity, law of non-contradiction, and law of excluded middle.

My position is that an unfalsifiable claim is only made as such if one of two criteria is met. 

The first I’ve already gone over in the aliens example. The second is when the one making the argument shifts the goal posts, which is fallacious.

Let’s use the russel’s teapot as the example. 

According to Burtrand, there exists an extremely small teapot between earth and mars that is so small, it can’t be seen by our most powerful telescopes.

Okay, fair enough, it seems that we can’t observe it so it’s unfalsifiable.

Except, we forgot quite a few properties about teapots. The biggest one, is that they are physical constructs that have mass and interact with space time.

We have been able to observe not only black holes indirectly due to space time affects, but also have come to discover dark matter. Something that doesn’t interact with light particles/waves, yet still can be measured (potentially).

So if this dark matter, which fits the criteria even better then Russell’s teapot can be observed through the affects it has on other objects, then so too ought Russell’s teapot.

In other words, it can be falsified. 

“But this is a special teapot, not only is it so small, it doesn’t have mass thus doesn’t interact with gravity in anyway.”

This leads to a contradiction, if something is physical, it must have mass or energy. 

Light is the only example of a particle with 0 mass but it has energy. Because it’s moving. 

But due to the laws of physics, this thing must move at the speed of light. https://www.wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/mobile/2014/04/01/light-has-no-mass-so-it-also-has-no-energy-according-to-einstein-but-how-can-sunlight-warm-the-earth-without-energy/

And according to the law of identity, this teapot is not a teapot, but a particle of light.

Which can be observed and interacted with. 

“Oh but this is able to break that rule” this breaks the law of non-contradiction because now the claim is that it is both an object with mass and without mass.

In other words, if a claim has become unfalsifiable it means either we don’t have the means currently to prove or disprove it, or that the person is committing a fallacy.

This is not an argument for God’s existence, rather, I’m attacking only the idea that a claim is unfalsifiable. I could be wrong, but I don’t see how a claim is truly unfalsifiable."

It’s not possible to fully separate what is “disordered/wrong” from who the person is, as there is an intimate relationship with that person’s mind and body. Therefore, it results in a whole person being categorised as ”dosordered/wrong”. By definition, shame means believing there is something wrong with who a person is. As a result, labelling someone as disordered is always a shameful experience. Taking into account the negative impact of shame on a person’s internal experience and the experience they have to face, it should not be allowed."

I want to start off by praising this the build up this story has. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time, and was so eager to find out who these skinned men were. The pacing, writing, and uneasy tone of the town was well done and made me eager for the ending. Having the sister go missing from the beginning really set the tone for the rest of the story, it reminded me a bit of the beginning of the IT movies. It emphasized the fact that no one is safe; adults, children, and teens are all at risk. 

Before I get to the meat of it all, I do also want to mention that going into this story I knew heavy themes were involved. I’m fine with that kind of thing as long as it’s not just for shock. 

*major spoiler* With that out of the way… the grand mystery surrounding this town, and the reason for the disappearances being money hungry men who are stealing women, hiding them in an old mine, taking advantage of them and selling their babies is awful. I’m not just talking about the subject matter being awful, but the grand reveal of everything was poorly done. The ending felt as though it was done for pure shock, and using the suffering of women is so overdone that it really was frustrating. 

I saw so many people praising this ending calling it “amazing”, “groundbreaking”, and even “fresh” when this type of thing has been done so many times before. It lacked creativity, originality, and felt as though it was done for the sake of shocking everyone. It came out of left field (there was foreshadowing but I was really hoping it was going in another direction) and I didn’t need it to be about very true horrors that happen in the real world. 

In short, this ending ruined the story because it felt unoriginal, and felt as if it was done purely for shock. There is plenty of media out there that is done purely for shock, but this was over the top and overdone. The vile portrayal of explicit violation to women is tired and done, so when it becomes what the story is built off of, it’s basically over. "
0,2024-04-18,CMV: Mandatory public education should be abolished.,u/Late_Replacement_983,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c78mgq/cmv_mandatory_public_education_should_be_abolished/,changemyview,"From my first day in preschool to my last day of leaving the hellhole that was my highschool, I have always believed that the school system was no place a kid should be. Here's why:

School is a prison-like atmosphere. From the authoritarian teachers and principals acting like corrupt wardens and prison guards, to your asshole peers acting like prison inmates. Even down to the architecture of most schools. Fun fact, did you know most school buildings are also designed by prison guards. I don't think it's much of a coincidence.

School is a place to teach kids how to suck up to authority and take it with a smile on their face whenever they face injustice or bullying from their teachers or their fellow students. Not only that, the quality of education you get from most schools is piss poor. You rarely learn anything of relevance, and even if you do good luck trying to even learn anything since the curriculum is designed for the average student in mind. So if you're not a normie, you will probably fail school and get bad grades and get shit on for getting bad grades by your teacher's and if you're unlucky enough your parents.

This isn't even going into the fucking bullying you have to deal with in school. If you're not popular or at least normal, you will get bullied and shit on by your peers, and there's nothing you can do about it. Fight back? You get suspended. Try to solve your problems through more ""diplomatic"" means, the school doesn't do shit about it.

One common defense I hear for mandatory public education is it teaches social skills. That defense is complete bullshit. You will not learn social skills if you're unable to make friends with anyone and you just get bullied all the time. You will not learn social skills naturally, nor will anyone teach you social skills in school. It's complete bullshit.

School doesn't make anyone smarter. If you're dumb, you will always be dumb. No matter what you do. Intelligence is mostly generic and not environmental. No amount of schooling can change someone's DNA. Someone destined to be a great mathematician will likely become one, regardless of how many Math classes they're forced to attend during school. While.someoke who is stupid as fuck will always be stupid as fuck, no matter what.

Even if school did make people smarter and more well educated, I would still be against the whole system. The amount of trauma and mental health damage years of mandatory schooling causes to so many people is just not worth the very few benefits schooling offers to people. My terrible experiences in school is the number one reason why my mental health is fucking horrible and why I am homeless and unable to get a job. Sure, In would still be a fucking loser regardless of whether I ever been to school or not. But at least I'm would be a happier loser."

The European model of left vs. right is outdated and lacks any sort of nuance. For those unfamiliar, this basically started during the French revolution where people who were loyal to the monarchy stood on the right and those who opposed it stood on the left. Maybe this metric made sense during that time, but people grow, new philosophies come into existence, new economic models pop up... 

For example, I'm LibRight - I hate governments and hate working for others but believe I should be able to do the latter if I choose to do so voluntarily and out of my own free will. That really just means I'm loyal to myself and my own preferences, not some goofball ruler (this obviously takes place in a hypothetical stateless society, not our current one where working for others is almost necessary due to a plethora of things including, but not limited to, government intervention).

Where would that put me on the basic, European left-right metric? As someone who has studied politics for years I still don't know because it's outdated and lacks any grey areas. Furthermore, it completely omits any sort of outside culture and this is eurocentric. It does not take into account how other cultures view politics. What is left or right in America is obviously a bit different than most of Europe which is a bit different than Asia, Africa, and the different cultures within those continents."
164,2024-04-18,"CMV: If you don't singularly blame Hamas for rejecting reasonable ceasefire proposals at this point, you both don't actually want a ceasefire or a release of hostages. And it is damaging the effectiveness of the ceasefire protest movement by not blaming Hamas and instead Israel.",u/silverpixie2435,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c79zco/cmv_if_you_dont_singularly_blame_hamas_for/,changemyview,"According to all information I can find, the only thing holding up a reasonable ceasefire deal at this point is Hamas. The US has extensively pushed Israel to agree to a proposal that includes releasing 700-900 prisoners, many with life sentences, a return of Palestinians to the north, in exchange for 40 hostages from Hamas and a 6 week ceasefire.

[https://www.axios.com/2024/04/08/us-israel-hamas-hostage-deal-propose-ceasefire](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/08/us-israel-hamas-hostage-deal-propose-ceasefire)

Hamas flatly rejected these proposals and said it won't budge from its main demands of ""a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of the occupation army from the entire Gaza Strip, the return of the displaced to their areas and places of residence, intensification of the entry of relief and aid, and the start of reconstruction""

[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-rejects-israels-ceasefire-response-sticks-main-demands-2024-04-13/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-rejects-israels-ceasefire-response-sticks-main-demands-2024-04-13/)

But those aren't reasonable demands. Reasonable meaning a ceasefire built around things both sides obviously won't agree to. Israel won't agree to basically surrender and leave Gaza without the hostages, and Hamas won't agree to surrender either. 

But Israel isn't making ""Hamas must surrender"" as a main demand if its proposal. Hamas is with respect to Israel.

Which is why the US blames Hamas for not having a ceasefire. 

[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-has-moved-significant-way-hamas-remains-barrier-gaza-hostage-deal-us-says-2024-04-15/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-has-moved-significant-way-hamas-remains-barrier-gaza-hostage-deal-us-says-2024-04-15/)

And the second part of my cmv is that the pro ceasefire protest movement is damaging both the goal of getting a ceasefire deal done and by raising support for Palestinians more generally, but not admitting Hamas as the clear obstacle here. Because why support the protestors when reasonable people on the fence about this conflict can easily see in the news Hamas rejecting ceasefire deals, let alone reporting Hamas won't even give a list of hostages still alive and that they don't have enough hostages to fill the original 40 women, elderly and wounded category?

If half of your peers however suddenly have tens of thousands of extra dollars to outbid you on that house, car, or any other major life expense, this directly makes your life more difficult and expensive. You can pretend that maybe, years later, these people that got their debt forgiven will use that extra money to start businesses that will benefit you, but that is a big conjecture and far from guaranteed. What is guaranteed is that you will immediately lose a competitive edge against your peers, and will likely suffer negative consequences for a supposedly responsible decision.

I'm genuinely curious about any positives with loan forgiveness for younger people that paid theirs off. If there are any, the negatives seem to outweigh them by a lot. It's not about being petty or ""I got mine"" mentality, people will literally become poorer, become outmatched by their peers, and will have to put off major life events like buying a house. "

* Biden gradually shedding his ""sleepy old man"" image he was widely made fun of early on in his presidency.
* Biden's approval ratings are on the rise, tough polling this early in the election season might not mean much.
* The chances of the 2000 and the 2016 elections repeating themselves (aka some democrats not voting for the candidates because they didn't like them much or voting third party) are probably a lor lower, especially since the candidates will be the same.

33,2024-04-18,CMV: The Flyers were wrong to remove Kate Smith's statue,u/42069CakeDay,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7ax14/cmv_the_flyers_were_wrong_to_remove_kate_smiths/,changemyview,"The past 10 years, with the exception of the bubble in 2020, Flyers fans have not experienced quality hockey like they were accustomed to throughout the bulk of the team's existence. Since 2013, the Flyers either didn't make the playoffs or had to beg borrow and steal to get the last spot, only to lose their decisive game in disrespectful fashion (choking a lead or not scoring at all in their must-win game).

2019 was a year the Flyers missed the playoffs where they honestly didn't try. It was during this time, when the Flyers were supposed to be in the playoffs, the bright minds in Comcast Spectacor's front office thought it was a high priority to remove the Kate Smith statue. 

Back history: Kate Smith was a singer back in WWII era, who was famous for her rendition of Irving Berlin's ""God Bless America.""

By 1969, she was mostly forgotten, and people didn't stand and salute for the Anthem before games, so Ed Snider (owner) chose to play her rendition of ""God Bless America"" before home games. Anytime he did that, the Flyers often won. During the 1973-74 season, anytime they played ""God Bless America"" at home games, the Flyers record was 36-3-1. That year, the Flyers won the cup, with Kate Smith singing the song live during decisive Game 6 against the powerhouse Bruins.

Up until 2016, the Flyers record when playing ""God Bless America"" was 100-29-5. 

In 2019, songs from 1931 were brought to the attention of the public, one of which was ""That's why Darkies are born."" If people really knew the context, they'd know that song was satirical to poke fun at racists. It was not a racist song, but more importantly, it was **from 1931.** Nobody alive today is from 1931, even Kate Smith herself.

Hell, Kate Smith DID NOT WRITE THE SONG. SHE JUST SANG IT! If anything, Kate Smith was a social pioneer of her time. She was anything BUT racist. She advocated for equality.

Kate Smith died in 1986, which meant when her statue was taken down, she'd been dead for 33 years. She couldn't speak up for herself, she couldn't defend herself. They erased a major part of the team's history.

The Flyers should have been more focused on winning than cancelling a dead woman over a song she didn't even write that wasn't even racist."

Because of the Iron Dome attacks on Israel became normalized and it severely restricted their ability to target the root of the problem and has prevented a solution and strengthen terrorist factions in the region. 

Think about it, how many rocket attacks have been made against Israel? Virtually all aid going into gaza went towards either rocket attacks against Israel or the terrorist tunnel network and as the terrorists gain more and more weapons, influence, tunnels and other assets Israel was shooting down cheap ass missile with expensive ones. 

But you may be saying it saves lives and while that's true in the short term, is it true in the long term? If Israel didn't have the Iron Dome they simply wouldn't have allowed the vast majority of rockets attacks to happen they would've entered gaza while Hamas was much weaker and faced far less criticism because they didn't have the ability to just turtle up and get attacked endlessly and Hamas wouldn't have had the logistical advantages they do now from decades of aid going to them. 

On top of that Iran would've never dared attack Israel directly like it did if the Iron Dome didn't exist. It would've meant all out war with Israel with the US backing them. But because the Iron Dome exists it normalized attacks against Israel, now everyone can attack Israel as much as they want and if Israel does anything about it they are the bad ones just because the Iron Dome exists. The money, research and effort would've been much better spent dealing with the source of the attacks rather than constantly playing defense.  CMV"

Mainly because of animals getting injured and the like. I'll address why I disagree with that later one.

I'd like to preface this by saying I exclude domestic pets or animals that have been bred to be domestic for extremely long (basically only housecats and housedogs) because they simply can't survive in the wild. I also am not vegan, due to medical reason.

Now that that's out of the way.

1) The most common counterargument to this I've noticed is that ""animals need our help sometimes"" and to that I say, no. Not to the point of us caging them up, at least. Nature fixes itself. If there are too many insects, there will be more birds, and in turn more animals who prey on birds, so on and so forth. When nature is truly left alone, this cycle should be flawless.
- 1.5) The only exception to the above is imbalance made by human disease and/or influence in general, such as hunting whales to near extinction for their blubber. We humans are not part of the cycle of nature anymore, and we haven't been for a long time. If humans severely damage one part of an ecosystem, let's go with aforementioned whales, I agree that they should be assisted in reproducing and surviving. But then again, no cages. No getting them into aquariums. Nothing. The human influence should be as minimal as possible.

2) i HIGHLY disagree with zoos, especially those that keep animals like elephants, giraffes, killer whales etc. i do not count savannahs or nature reserves, as there are already strict regulations on limiting human interference most of the time. 

3) I agree with mercy-killing. If the animal isn't able to be saved, but say, has a very fractured leg and cannot walk, it should be killed as a final resort, especially if it is in pain. I believe my ideology strings around reducing the suffering animals have, so naturally, I believe in this, too. 
3.5) The cadaver should be left where the animal was found (if it was in the wild). The bait-eaters will take care of the rest.

4) I will not talk about pigs/cows/chicken/the like being bred for meat. That is not what this is about. I'm purely talking about animals born wild that should stay wild.

Last: Why do I want my view changed? I have a tendency to react harsh to subjects like these. I am aware my vision might be unconstructive or plain naive, so please, criticise as much as you want. Respectfully, of course."

He has also been described as all powerful. These two concepts exist in direct contradiction in terms of free will. This is because if this creator exists as described there is no way of setting up any sort of function (all powerful) where they wouldn’t know the outcome (all knowing). This contradiction creates a logical paradox, as it would be impossible for a creator to simultaneously possess the power to control all outcomes and have complete foreknowledge of those outcomes while also maintaining the existence of free will.

There would be no possible way of God setting up any sort of event or the functions behind it without knowing what would happen if it were to be set up exactly that way. In this logic, we may have a will, but it certainly is not free. At that point, we are just playing out a script made by God.  

If a god were to exist as Biblically described, every decision we make would be inevitable. This is because of what I have previously laid out, any decision or outcome we take would already be known by the one who set up the situation in the first place. This would make our actions a result of what God directly laid out before the decision, it would not be purely the result of an independent choice. 

There was another free will post on the debate religion subreddit made a few hours ago, and the current top comment has an amazing notion: “I think the better argument against free will is the inability to choose to no longer have free will. If I am not free to abandon my free-will, my free-will was nothing more than slavery masquerading as freedom in the first place”

This is an excellent thought experiment in regards to a god and free will. If we do have free will that comes from a god, how free is it? Are there limitations on the choices we can make? If so, what determines those limitations and why? Is it possible for a god to have a will for humanity while still allowing genuine human freedom?

1. **Cleanliness.** Ever see someone bite into an open-faced bagel (OFB)? They need to do a weird half-nibble bite to avoid getting cream cheese all over their lips and face. Inevitably, they end up with schmear all over their fingers -- and god forbid you need to eat the bagel on the go. 

Drop a closed faced bagel (CFB) - you can brush off the bagel portion and call five second rule. Drop an OFB - you now have a big splat of cream cheese all over the floor.

2. **Ratio.** People may argue to you that you get a better ratio of schmear to bagel with an OFB. This, of course, is incorrect. You may need to use MORE schmear or filling to even out the ratio when you have a CFB, but it is easier to balance that ratio. When you have an OFB with too much schmear? Disaster. Not only because you need to scrape it off onto your plaate or a napkin, but because of the extra mess (see #1).

3. **Taste.** People may want to eat a OFB because it allows more taste of the filling - be it cream cheese or otherwise. I fear that these people are not eating high-quality bagels.

When you eat a bagel -- closed face -- here is the taste experience: Bite in - get a big first crunch of warm, toasted, doughy bagel. Then, as you begin to chew, THEN you get hit with the lox, the cheese, the egg, etc. 

With OFB, you are immediately overwhelmed by the filling, and the bagel merely an afterthought. You might as well have it served in cardboard.

4. **Bite size.** People might complain a closed bagel is too big for a good sized bite. I say to them -- are you a coward? Were you born with a baby mouth built for single M&Ms and Skittles? If your mouth is unable to attain greatness, you are the one failing the bagel, and should be practicing mouth exercises before bed to make yourself more worthy. Do not settle for a worse bagel because you have not done the work.

**The only acceptable use for an open face bagel is a pizza bagel, because a pizza sandwich is a ridiculous concept and the melted cheese sticks to the bagel and does not make a mess.**"

Just like Iran, these countries are authoritarian regimes that heavily restrict the freedom of their people. 

Saudi Arabia is a theocratic monarchy, and it's dominant from of Islamic interpretation, Wahhabism, is notably conservative amongst all Islamic interpretations. Women are only allowed to drive in 2017, and today women are still under the male guardianship system despite improvements over the years. In the Yemen Civil War, Saudi Arabia has been criticised for indiscriminate bombings and intentionally worsening the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. When it comes to suppressing dissent, they famously assassinated Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul because he was a known dissident of Saudi Arabia.

Qatar is also a monarchy and it's known for abusing it's foreign workforce and can be constitute modern slavery. The relationship between them and their employers opens them to be victims of human trafficking and forced labour. If we want to criticise the Iran-backed Houthis for modern slavery, let's not forget our goverments-backed Qatar for the same crime. 

You may then point out that at least they don't fund proxies. Well, they do! Saudi funds their proxies in Yemen, previously in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Bahrain and Lebanon to contain Iranian influence in the region. Today the UAE is the biggest supporter of RSF, a genocidal militant force in Sudan that is responsible for numerous massacres. 

The point here is American and British governments only call Iran a ""destabilising force"" or an adversary because of their refusal to align with the West, not because of their immoral or evil actions in the Middle East, because if that's the case we won't be aligning ourselves with most of the Gulf States."

Plus that people can be thrown in prison for not paying child support like wtf?

I think instead child support should be opt in for rights. So basically if you want the rights visiit, have custody of, to make decisions about etc of the kid then you would have to pay child support. If you don’t want rights to the kid then you don’t pay. 

In many cases I think this works because if someone doesn’t want to be financially responsible for the child then that’s probably not someone you want around the child in the first place.

Second is that it makes someone who’s financially unable to afford a child a criminal and could result in them being thrown in jail which doesn’t benefit anyone. 

Third is that there are a few stories where people have maliciously used child support.

I think the most convincing argument I’ve seen is that it’s for the “betterment” of the child but to that I say, so what? There are currently ways for mothers specifically to opt out of parenthood and pass the financial burden on to someone else such as safe havens. 

To me I just can’t see how with abortion, safe havens and adoptions the outdated system of child support still exist and forced financial parenthood"

1 - this makes housing artificially more expensive than it should be and leads to homelessness and people spending too much money on rent/mortgage.

2 - housing as investment provides an incentive for home owners to be nimby’s. A class of people is created that now oppose the construction of new housing because this makes their homes less valuable.

3 - it’s a poor place to store wealth. Having wealth tied up in housing isn’t economically productive. Would it be better for the economy if your house cost $50k or 500k? If it was only 50k, you could diversify your wealth. You could buy bonds to help fund companies or the government. You could buy stocks. You could just spend it and put it right into the economy. 

I’m not saying that all housing should cost the same. A 4,000 sq foot apartment in NYC is always going to cost way more than a 700 sq foot apartment in Oklahoma City. But I don’t believe the price of housing (rents or home prices) should be expected to rise faster than inflation. 

How would it be achievable? Simple - build more housing. Tons of it. And most of it should be non-profit housing. This is housing - ideally apartment buildings - that is deed restricted to not increase rent above costs of the building. 

This would be a huge net benefit for society. "

659,2024-04-18,CMV: Race-Swapping Characters Does Not Equal Good Representation for Minorities,u/Spirited-Kangaroo-38,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7kqpu/cmv_raceswapping_characters_does_not_equal_good/,changemyview,"Before I go into the details, I want to say my opinions on this topic are fairly mixed. I still like to give these things a try because I don't believe that having a character's race swapped in any form of media means it will be trash and have nothing positive to talk about. I didn't care about Nick Fury being black in the MCU because, in my case, I didn't even know he was originally white. I hardly read comic books and one of the few comics I have read, which was Miles Morales's debut story, had Nick Fury, and he was black in that story. Of course, at that time I didn't know that there were multiple universes in Marvel Comics, so I always thought Nick Fury was black and was completely unaware that trait was from his Ultimate Universe counterpart. I also did not care about some of the race-swapping in the recent Disney live-action remakes, like Tinker Bell and Ariel, because fairies and mermaids exist in many mythologies and folklore, including Africa, plus in Ariel's case (if I recall correctly), her skin color was never really mentioned in the original story written by Hans Christian Andersen. 

The only time when this race-swapping bothers me is if the casting goes against the descriptions of the characters from their original source material or makes no sense in a historical context. Examples of this would be Rachel Zegler as Snow White, Leah Jefferies as Annabeth Chase, and Nico Parker as Astrid. Snow White's case baffles me because the titular character has that name because she has pale skin, you know, like snow, so her having that name in the movie would make no sense. However, this is far from my main problem with the Snow White remake, but I'm not going into detail on that. Astrid being a Viking with mixed heritage makes absolutely no sense because there is no proven evidence of there being black Vikings around that time. As for Annabeth, I was disappointed with this one because I read the *Percy Jackson* books throughout middle school, and in neither adaptation did they have an accurately portrayed Annabeth. Again, Leah Jefferies' casting was far from my main problem with the overall show and not even close to a reason why I found it to be disappointing. 

I also want to mention Annette from *Castlevania: Nocturne*. Now I have not played a single *Castlevania* game in my life and I've only seen the shows, but it got me interested in the lore of the series. Inevitably, I found out Annette was a race-swapped character, but this didn't bother me because, again, I haven't played any of the games. However, from what research I have done on her, it seems the show has rewritten her personality so much to the point she bares no resemblance to her video game counterpart, and it makes me think that if the creators of the show are changing her that much, why don't they just create a new character and not adapt her at all? 

Of course, I see tons of arguments for these kinds of things, but most of the time I don't buy it. So to prevent this post from being any longer, I'll just write short responses to these arguments.

1. **""Race does not matter because appearance is not integral to the character"".** Ok, if appearance isn't a major part of the character, then why do people feel the need to race-swap them? Wouldn't the studio making the movie want to adapt the source material as much as possible? If an author describes a character as having white or tanned skin in their books, the movie should cast actors/actresses with those traits. Casting someone who doesn't resemble them at all deviates from the source material and breaks the immersion of the film as an adaptation because people who read the source material are going to expect the actors to look like their literary counterparts.
2. **""Astrid was played by a person of color in the original** ***HTTYD*****""** While that is true, I find this argument dumb because America Ferrera **VOICED** Astrid. She did not physically portray her because it is an animated movie, and how is Astrid portrayed in the animated *HTTYD*? She is white with blonde hair and blue eyes, end of story.
3. **""They're fictional characters. It doesn't matter if people of color play them in media""** What about Cleopatra being black in that Netflix documentary despite the real Cleopatra being a woman with Greek and Persian ancestry? What about Queen Charlotte being black in that *Bridgerton* spinoff despite the real Queen Charlotte being white? What about the rumors of Anne Bonny being played by a black woman even though the real Anne Bonny was a white, redhead Irish woman? You can't make a good argument for those because those were real people who existed in history and they are being race-swapped. 
4. **""Astrid lives in a fantasy world with dragons, it's not unrealistic for her to be dark-skinned in the remake""** You can say the same thing about Black Panther. He lives in a fantasy world set where there's an African society hidden by a force field that makes it invisible to the outside world and their main resource is a metal that absorbs kinetic energy. It wouldn't be unrealistic if one of the residents was a white guy or an Asian guy would it? 

While I do appreciate that Hollywood is trying to be more inclusive with people of color, I believe race-swapping pre-existing characters with well-established appearances is an incredibly lazy way to go about it. The people at the casting department are simply casting a person of color to play a character who was originally white and not much else (except for Leah Jefferies because Rick Riordan personally thought she embodied Annabeth the most, which I commend him for, regardless of how disappointed I am). If studios want to be more inclusive of minority groups, why don't they just create an original story with characters who are of that minority group instead of uncreatively race-swapping characters when adapting/remaking a story? 

Regardless I'm curious why people think this is a good thing, and I would be open to opinions if there are actual good reasons. "

**For instance, under the** ***status quo*** **a Hindu who is a vegetarian for religious reasons would be legally entitled to a greater degree of protection and accomodation in a workplace that provides food(or at least a government workplace), compared to an atheist who is vegetarian for ethical/environmental reasons.**

""Freedom of religion"", at least when applied in an unbiased manner, may provide comparable levels of protection to different religions, but religious individuals and beliefs overall get a greater degree of protection than their secular counterparts. The end result is a society that privileges the religious over atheists.

There are plenty of compelling reasons to prohibit certain religious practices, take Quranic instruction for husbands to hit disobedient wives to correct their behavior, or Jewish circumcision practices that mutilate baby boys and in some cases result in STD transmission.

These actions enjoy *prima facie* protection if freedom of religion is constitutionally protected. Certainly it is not unlimited and high courts may rule that prohibiting these actions is constitutionally permissible. But this is just invitation for unelected judges to legislate from the bench. Ultimately they decide normative political questions regarding the importance of a certain religious practices vs. society's interest in restricting them based on their own personal values.

Not protecting freedom of religion does not mean the end of the religion, it does not mean that the government would be free to completely eradicate certain religions. Religious teaching and proselytization would still be protected under freedom of speech. 

But religious actions that are not merely speech would rightly no longer enjoy any semblance of protection, especially those that involve tangible physical harm to others. Why should that enjoy any more protection than say, political violence? Certainly to many ultranationalist or leftist extremists their political ideologies are just as important to their identities as religions are to their believers."

***Reasons why voting for the 'most viable progressive party' is not that helpful for leftists***

* Mainstream 'viable' parties' political goals are simply too far away from many leftists' goals. Biden is certainly more 'leftist' and 'progressive' than Trump but his presidency is still very far from what most leftists want. For example, Biden is anti-socialist, anti-communist, and a capitalist who advocates a market capitalist society and liberal democracy. He is still supporting Israel and helped expand NATO, probably the most hated organization by leftists in the world. Biden is an 80-year-old Catholic who values many traditional social values. In other words, He is currently trying his best to secure the very global system that leftists and socialists are trying to destroy. For many leftists, differences between Biden and Trump would be trivial compared to differences between Biden and themselves. So why keep supporting Biden?
* The political importance and significance of the leftists could be diminished. In the US, the leftists' 'most viable progressive party' will always be the Democratic Party until there's a major shift in the political landscape. If leftists 'always vote blue no matter what', leftists will be just another secure blue voting block and there's no reason for non-leftist leaders of the Democratic Party leaders to care what the left thinks.
* Historical Examples: The strategy of making a more leftist, socialist society by becoming a part of mainstream politics and slowly implementing socialist policies historically did not work well. The most obvious example is the early history of the [Social Democratic Party of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany)(SPD). SPD was one of the earliest Marxist-influenced parties in the world and consistently the most popular party in Imperial Germany. However, by becoming a mainstream socialist party, the SPD had to care more about not losing votes instead of socialism and had to abandon many socialist principles. The SPD remained radical in principle but became more and more moderate in reality. Finally, in 1914, the SPD supported the imperialist German war effort, adopted a policy of not criticizing the government until the end of the war, actively expelled many anti-war members, and brutally oppressed more radical, socialist groups. Most 'socialist' and 'communist' parties in Europe have gone through a similar process and now they are typical liberal or social democratic parties, socialist or communist in name only.

* The very existence of a leftist, socialist political party can help boost the popularity of leftists. Right now, many people, especially those who don't have much interest in politics, don't know anything about socialism, communism, and other leftist agendas. Many people think leftists and socialists are 'more radical liberals'. Having a distinct political party is a powerful tool to overcome this misunderstanding. Even more, let's say every leftist vote for the socialist third party and a leftist presidential candidate gets 5% or 10% of the vote in the US. The whole world will talk about it for weeks and millions of people will learn more about what socialism or communism is. This can also help shift the so-called 'Overton window' to the left by making many people aware that there are policies and ideologies that are much, much more 'radical' and 'leftist' than mainstream liberal or social democratic ones.
* Long-term Effects: Many leftists argue voting for the 'most viable progressive party' tends to see short-term(about 10 years or something) effects of voting. However, 18-year-old first-time voters in the US will live about 60 years, vote for president about 15 times, and for Congress about 30 times. The time limit of about 60 years, or about 6 short-term effects isn't as long as you think and the odds of success are not that high. Thinking boldly may be more likely to succeed than repeatedly considering only short-term effects for many leftists in the world."

***Reasons why voting for the 'most viable progressive party' is not that helpful for leftists***

* Mainstream 'viable' parties' political goals are simply too far away from many leftists' goals. Biden is certainly more 'leftist' and 'progressive' than Trump but his presidency is still very far from what most leftists want. For example, Biden is anti-socialist, anti-communist, and a capitalist who advocates a market capitalist society and liberal democracy. He is still supporting Israel and helped expand NATO, probably the most hated organization by leftists in the world. Biden is an 80-year-old Catholic who values many traditional social values. In other words, He is currently trying his best to secure the very global system that leftists and socialists are trying to destroy. For many leftists, differences between Biden and Trump would be trivial compared to differences between Biden and themselves. So why keep supporting Biden?
* The political importance and significance of the leftists could be diminished. In the US, the leftists' 'most viable progressive party' will always be the Democratic Party until there's a major shift in the political landscape. If leftists 'always vote blue no matter what', leftists will be just another secure blue voting block and there's no reason for non-leftist leaders of the Democratic Party leaders to care what the left thinks.
* Historical Examples: The strategy of making a more leftist, socialist society by becoming a part of mainstream politics and slowly implementing socialist policies historically did not work well. The most obvious example is the early history of the Social Democratic Party of Germany(SPD). SPD was one of the earliest Marxist-influenced parties in the world and consistently the most popular party in Imperial Germany. However, by becoming a mainstream socialist party, the SPD had to care more about not losing votes instead of socialism and had to abandon many socialist principles. The SPD remained radical in principle but became more and more moderate in reality. Finally, in 1914, the SPD supported the imperialist German war effort, adopted a policy of not criticizing the government until the end of the war, actively expelled many anti-war members, and brutally oppressed more radical, socialist groups. Most 'socialist' and 'communist' parties in Europe have gone through a similar process and now they are typical liberal or social democratic parties, socialist or communist in name only.

While women working in these roles may encounter some stigma, men are frequently subjected to unfair labels such as ""losers"" or lacking ambition. These stereotypes not only undermine the value of the work but also reinforce harmful gender norms, restricting individuals from pursuing careers based on their interests and talents rather than societal expectations.

Addressing these issues is crucial for fostering a more inclusive and equitable society. It requires challenging and dismantling stereotypes that limit both men and women's opportunities in the workforce. By promoting diversity and recognizing the value of all types of work, regardless of gender, we can create a more supportive and accepting environment where individuals are free to pursue their passions without fear of judgment or discrimination.

105,2024-04-19,CMV: Hands Are Not Designed For Punching.,u/Financial-Amount-790,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7of9h/cmv_hands_are_not_designed_for_punching/,changemyview,"A common idea people have is that punches influence human hand anatomy. Many people claim that unarmed combat between prehistoric men involved closed-fist strikes.

My reasons to believe hands aren't built for punching:

1. The metacarpals are thin and fragile compared to skulls. Boxer's fracture is the term for common breaks of the 5th metacarpal from punching.

2. Hands are great for grabbing, pushing, and pulling. This works well for grappling and using tools/weapons. We should not slam hands into hard objects.

3. Boxers wear hand wraps and gloves as protection for their hands. This equipment is not a cushion for their opponent's face. Before gloves, bare-knuckle boxing used weak punches.

4. Punching hard areas such as the forehead will most likely break one's hands.

5. Evolution favors intimidation over attacks. When two men get hurt from a fight, they lose their efficiency to hunt and defend their group. Even the winner is vulnerable to attacks after injury. Displays of athleticism, deep voices, and size intimidation aren't costly.

Counterarguments:

1. Compared to primates, human hands are more efficient when making a fist. Our fingers curl well. The thumb can lock in the index and middle fingers. Sqeezing the fist allows it to punch without breaking.

2. Human foreheads being resistant against punches doesn't invalidate closed-hand striking. Foreheads evolved to defend the brain against punches. The deep-set eyes and protruding eyebrow ridge protect the eyes against strikes.

3. Angry people throw punches at their opponent's head on instinct. This includes fighters that use gloves in training and professional matches.

4. The most likely metacarpals to break are the 4th and 5th. They are weaker and connected to the less sturdy ulna. Punches should be with the 2nd and 3rd metacarpals. They are larger and connected to the sturdy radius.

5. People should never hit the strong forehead or elbows, even with glove protection. Target weak parts of the body such as the liver, nose, and jaw."

0,2024-04-19,CMV: The Existence of Intelligent Extraterrestrial Life is Extremely Unlikely,u/Unusual-Double-2003,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7tueh/cmv_the_existence_of_intelligent_extraterrestrial/,changemyview,"The search for intelligent alien life is undoubtedly a fascinating and alluring endeavor, driven by our deep-seated curiosity and desire to understand our place in the universe. However, when we objectively consider the available evidence and the statistical probabilities involved, it becomes clear that the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life is extremely unlikely.  
  
The timescales involved in the development of life on Earth are immense. The Earth formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago, and it took about 600 million years for the first living cell (LUCA - Last Universal Common Ancestor) to emerge. It then took another 3 billion years for complex, multicellular life to evolve. Crucially, the vast majority of multicellular life on Earth, such as plants and fungi, are sessile - unable to move from their fixed locations, let alone develop advanced technologies like spaceflight or interstellar communication.  
  
Moreover, out of the staggering number of cells estimated to have ever existed on Earth - between 10\^39 and 10\^40 - only an infinitesimal fraction have been part of an intelligent species like humans. The emergence of intelligence appears to be an exceedingly rare event, even on a planet teeming with life. Furthermore, humans have only existed for roughly 200,000 years, a mere blink of an eye in the cosmic timescale. Of this, writing was invented a mere 5,000 years ago, and flying devices only about a century ago.  
  
Even if we optimistically assume that life is common in the universe, the odds of it evolving into an intelligent, technologically advanced civilization are vanishingly small. The immense distances between stars and the limitations imposed by the speed of light make any meaningful contact or interaction with hypothetical alien civilizations virtually impossible.  
  
While the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is a captivating and intellectually stimulating pursuit, we must question whether it is the most prudent use of our limited resources. Perhaps the funds and efforts dedicated to this endeavor would be better spent on more tangible and immediate benefits to humanity, such as medical research or environmental conservation.  
  
Ultimately, we may be searching for something that simply doesn't exist. The confluence of factors necessary for the emergence of intelligent life appears to be so improbable that the existence of such life elsewhere in the universe seems highly unlikely.  
  
Of course, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and I remain open to having my view changed by compelling arguments or new discoveries. However, based on our current scientific understanding and the available evidence, I maintain that the existence of intelligent extraterrestrial life is extremely improbable."

0,2024-04-19,"CMV: Challenging the validity of the word ""Indigenous"" is always either malicious or naive",u/cyrusposting,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7wlc6/cmv_challenging_the_validity_of_the_word/,changemyview,"I say naïve instead of false because things can be true and false in different ways. You will see a definition in Merriam-Webster that says:

>Indigenous or less commonly indigenous **:** of or relating to the earliest known inhabitants of a place and especially of a place that was colonized by a now-dominant group

I disagree with this definition. I'm not saying the definition of the *word* should change, I am saying this definition is wrong. It does not mean the same thing as what people mean when they say ""Indigenous"".

If archaeologists find enough artifacts from a different culture where your ancestors lived, you are no longer the ""earliest-known"" inhabitant and no longer Indigenous, even though nothing about your situation or identity would change and everyone would still refer to you as Indigenous. ~~There are people like the Māori who are well known to not be the earliest inhabitants but nonetheless are called Indigenous.~~ (\*edit This is straight up false, a misremembering on my part. Thank you to u/WheatBerryPie for pointing out this mistake.) There is no Indigenous group who would stop being called Indigenous if they found out they migrated 3000 years ago. Its not clear to me that this definition would include a person who moves to a new country. Narrow enough definitions of the word ""place"" would exclude the many Indigenous people who were forced to abandon their homes and walk halfway across the country to reservations where their descendants now live, and if we make the definition wide enough to cover the area from Appalachia to Oklahoma, we still can ask ""What if they made them walk farther""?

The fact that none of these things affect how the actual word is used, and the fact that once a group of people is Indigenous they cannot suddenly stop being Indigenous, means that the people using this word are using it as an identity for a group of people with some kind of shared circumstance and experience. One example of a situation where this word was helpful is a video I saw of a Navajo guy talking about the Avatar movies. ""Indigenous"" makes a pretty useful shorthand for all of the cultures that movie is trying to mimic, because it is understood to include all of them, not just the ones in the Americas or whatever. It includes Hawaii and Easter Island and Australia and New Zealand, which makes it a useful word to have. Other single words which meant this same thing are either antiquated slurs or otherwise have some kind of unproductive connotation, but multiple different groups of people around the world experienced comparable things and needed a word to call themselves and to be called by others. That word wound up being ""Indigenous"".

Here are some other relatively uncontroversial words that define groups of people by something they have in common:

**""White""**. There is no biological or geographic reason for this word to exist. There are people who are unambiguously white and unambiguously not white, but there is no intuitive place where the line should be drawn. The definition of this word changes constantly throughout history to such a hilarious degree that at one point in the 1900s Americans did not consider Finns white because their language was not Indo-European. The boundaries of White seem to have nothing to do with complexion and more to do with being Christian, speaking an Indo-European language and other things that make you more similar to the people who got first dibs. Before Europeans were travelling the world enslaving and colonizing non-Europeans there was no reason for the English, Spanish, Dutch, French, and Portuguese to have any kind of word that identified them collectively. Now three centuries of bickering later we are finally at a point where the word ""white"" generally includes most European ethnicities. We can finally just say ""European"" instead of White, right? Wrong, because now there are people of European descent in multicultural societies outside of Europe, and as a white person it sounds weird to call myself ""European-American"" to distinguish my ancestry from everyone around me, even though its what everyone else has to do.

**""Asian""**. The only thing I can say for sure is that this word does not mean ""person from Asia"", except for when it does.

**""Hispanic""**. You are Hispanic if you are from a Spanish speaking country, but according to some people ""Spain"" does not count because they are considered White, so you need to be from a Spanish speaking country in the Americas. Don't ask me what happens if you move to Latin America from Spain, I would assume this works eventually because that's how we got into this situation in the first place but I don't know if you have to wait a generation. Still, many people from Spanish speaking countries in the Americas are White. Their status as ""Hispanic"" is naturally more tentative. Leaving Latin America, or having children outside of Latin America who do not learn Spanish can lose you or your children your identity as Hispanic. This also creates situations where someone can have Irish ancestry in a Latin American country, move to the US, and become a Hispanic Irish-American. Within a generation, these people will presumably become Irish-American because The United States does not count as a Latin American country, except for when it does.

**""American""**. Yes its a pain in the ass but I'm not going to say USian or ""person from the United States"" every single time. No I don't think that my country owns both continents, but the only other words in the name of my country are ""The"", ""United"", ""States"", and ""of"".

People are difficult to classify because there are billions of them. These words are not scientific classifications like we have for plants and animals. Nitpicking people about this means holding the word to a standard we do not hold similar words to, and it forces people to deal with you nitpicking their identity on a technicality. This is made worse by who you are doing it to. If someone says ""you know not all Americans are from the US"" or ""you shouldn't call yourself white"", this is annoying to me for the reasons all pedantry is annoying. For someone whose actual identity is at risk, ""nobody is really Indigenous"" is still annoying pedantry but its also sinister and frustrating in ways I can't claim to understand.

In cases where its not straight up malicious or cynical, trying to fight people's use of this word is naive. It misunderstands what people mean when they say the word and why, and is indistinguishable from actual malicious behavior.

To change my view, you can challenge any of these points individually. Examples of people who were considered Indigenous who stopped being Indigenous when new information came out, or ways that the usage of the word conflicts with my understanding, evidence that supports the Merriam-Webster definition, arguments that challenge my understanding of how words or language should be used, or any of a number of things I'm just outright wrong about. The holy grail is to show me purpose for contesting this use of the word that isn't naive or malicious.

While I recognize its a difficult view to change because it is largely about values and worldview, I am making this post in good faith hoping that there is a stronger version of some weak arguments that I have been seeing everywhere. I will reward deltas for anything that changes part of the view.

\*Edit for clarity: The thing I take issue with is people challenging the word Indigenous as an identity by claiming that nobody meets the definition, or that very few people meet the definition, or that the word has no meaning, or any of these types of argument, by people who hold the word to a standard that we do not hold other uncontroversial social categories to."

The definitions for consciousness seem to be difficult to pin down but they tend to be centered around an ""understanding of one-self"". Basically a person can understand that they think, they can act on that understanding and that they can reason about the world around them. 

It seems that people have set consciousness as something you have or don't. This has seemed always a bit human centric but I can understand it. We can already look at another human and ask ""do they think or do they just act as though they think"", so expanding that thought onto other animals seems even weirder as we differ outwardly so much. 

I'd argue that consciousness is a trait of the mind like memory, attention or perception. And like other traits can be found in other species to different degrees, so would consciousness as well. If we are willing to deem humans as conscious while not really being capable of stepping into another mind then might as well count other creatures in as they are equally impenetrable that way.

I like to imagine what a dog would think of us when they see us not noticing smells like they do. ""Do humans lack that capability? Because I can smell the mailman from here and the human waits for a bell. Do they smell at all?""

My argument here is more emotional than anything else. 

My aunt is a homesteader-type (not by necessity, by choice) and she's raising her daughter, my cousin, who just turned 13. They've had several animals.

When my cousin was \~6, they got her a cow that she named Blotch. They treated her essentially the same way as a dog... Pet her often, played games with her, even let her in the house when she was little enough--and then, when she was big enough, sent the cow off to get butchered. The meat was cut and returned to them in a refrigerated chest. 

My aunt loves to tell this ""funny"" story where she had her friend over for steaks, and she told my cousin, ""Tell her who we're eating."" My cousin (\~8 at the time) grinned wide and told the friend, ""We're eating Blotch!"" 

I just find that insane. The thought of killing and eating your pet dog/hamster/rat/cat/fish/etc is horrible. I feel like you'd have to be mentally ill, or in a dreadful situation, to slaughter and eat your pet. Why is it any different if it's a cow?

I rarely eat meat, so I'm not quite vegan or vegetartian, but I believe animals that are being raised for food should be given the best possible lives *without* being made to form an emotional bond with their predator. The thought of that poor cow being shipped off in a stranger's big scary truck and dying miles away from the humans who betrayed her is so, so sad. I know a cow likely isn't *capable* of understanding betrayal, but its final moments, surely, were full of fear.

I know this is all anectoal, but I most importantly I feel like this has resulted in my cousin not having a proper regard for life. She's very casual about things dying. She completely flippant when her chickens get killed by foxes or coyotes. When her dog died, she barely grieved. She was mostly just excited to get a new puppy.

So, my arguments against:

1. It is a cruel and undignified death, to send an animal off to slaughter after raising it as companion animal.
2. I suspect that routinely killing animals treated like 'pets' is harmful to one's mental health and their reverence for living things. I feel this must be true especially when children are raised to accept this. I don't have any sources for this, though, and I can't find any actual studies about this. 
3. All animals lives' matter. I recognize there are differences between the capacities of animals to think and suffer, but if someone would find killing their pet dog abhorrent, they shouldn't be willing to kill a cow (or, especially, a pig given how intelligent they are). 

Arguments for treating livestock like pets:

1. Treating these animals like pets is treating them insanely well, especially compared to the conditions livestock endure in factory farms. 
   1. My counterpoint would be that you can treat an animal insanely well without treating them like a companion animal.
2. Treating livestock like pets increases empathy/compassion for them and improves animal welfare + ultimately contributes to less factory farming.
3. It's anthropomorphizing to consider an animal's feelings in this debate; if an animal is living a good life, it is living a good life, and it is not more complicated than that. It doesn't matter how a human labels the relationship. 

I recognize the validity of these arguments 'for,' but they don't convince me. I'm eager to hear from you all. "

Even some of the less conventional means that are widely disliked by most people in the Western world but popular with a small minority, such as banning abortions and forbidding women from having careers, are likely to be ineffective, as seen by the drop in birth rates in countries like Saudi Arabia.

I think that a more effective way to boost birth rates would be to make child birthing and/or rearing something that is actively beneficial to people's careers, rather than doing things that would simply make it less of a difficulty. Here are some ideas, some of which will require cooperation from the private sector:

 - Governmental awards, honors, privileges, and promotion bonuses for people who have a certain amount of children

 - Expungement of a certain range of criminal records (nothing too serious like murder, but for smaller stuff like DUI) for having a certain number of children

 - Guaranteed acceptance to Ivy League universities for a 5th or so child in a family that can attain a certain SAT or ACT score threshold

 - Diversity initiatives intended to benefit parents who have birthed a large number of children, to help them with their career growth

Such positive encouragement would also increase the prestige of child birthing and rearing, and bring about a cultural shift for an increased birth rate too. People who support women's rights, such as myself and many people here reading this, should also be in favor of such birth rate measures because they can attain this without setting women's rights back and possibly even solidify it further.

Obviously these are just some examples of ideas of items that would encourage birthing while helping to actively propel people's careers, and some of them will be less likely than others to be effective or implementable. Still, I believe that this is a good starting point for ideas about less explored means to increase birth rates, and I would appreciate feedback on why these ideas aren't so great."

I mentioned a couple times a week ill buy a 6 or 8 pack on my way home from work and finish it that night. I only do this on nights im childfree, as I share custody 50/50 and do not drink at all when my child is with me. Ill admittedly get pretty drunk but I never engage in any dangerous or  questionable behaviour. I have never missed work from drinking, at worst ill show up hung over occasionally.

This was apparently concerning to them, for like my health and well being. I assured them I am not an alcoholic , I just enjoy drinking and I dont see a problem with it ifs not negatively affecting my ability to carry out my responsibilities. They have never complained about my performance at work and I have no problem abstaining the 50% of the time when my child is home.

Despite being sure it wasnt a problem before, there concern is making me question if in fact is actually too much so Im open to having my view changed on this.

I always thought drinking in moderation meant you can have as much as you want as long it does not affect you or other people negatively. If im wrong I want to CMV"

The second group are people who welcome the coming AI revolution, believing that if the vast majority of jobs were automated that would be amazing, freeing up time for people to do what they truly want and they also believe that this will happen and AI will take over most economically meaningful work.  
  
Comparatively there seem to be very few people who believe that it would be good if AI took all of our jobs but they don’t think it’s going to happen, or AI taking all of our jobs is terrible and it’s going to happen, although the latter opinion is growing in number of adherents. I personally believe in this and will explain why I think it as opposed to the other possible opinions is correct.  
  
Let’s start with the argument that AI will never be able to replace humans in most of the workplace. This argument from what I’ve seen usually relies on believing that there is something inherently unique about humans and human thought that cannot be replicated by machines, I unfortunately cannot see why this would be the case we’re just flesh based nueral networks trained by evolution. This argument also has imperically not been standing up too well for example creatives used to say they would be the last on the chopping block of automation. Because their profession is so inherently human. Today any sane person will say that AI can create art, SORA can animate, DALL-E can draw, SUNO can make music, LLMs can write stories, it goes on. And these are the professions we used to deem the most uniquely human so I don’t see how someone could say machines will never take our jobs because they aren’t like humans. The second argument I see in favour of AI not being able to take our jobs is that there will always need to be someone to tell the Ai what to do, or it will just be a tool like calculators are to mathematicians. This argument makes no sense to me, why would AI need a middle man to do things. comparing AI to calculators is faulty because a calculator cannot do a mathematician’s entire job. A better analogy would be someone 100x better than you at everything following you around to all of your job interviews and offering to do everything you do for free way better and faster than you. Clearly in this analogy no one would hire you. AI is not a tool for humans it is humans 2.0  
  
the second part of this argument is that AI becoming better than humans at basically everything is actually a good thing because then we’d live in a utopia where everything we could possible want would be granted to us and we would never have to do anything we don’t want to. This reminds me of the happiness pod idea. Where you can go into a pod and feel unmatched euphoria. Most people would say they don’t want to go into the pod even though it will give them more euphoria than anything else they could possible do. This is because the majority of humans want to be able to contribute meaningfully to their tribe, they want to be useful to people and feel required. If AI truly does become like a sort of god, there will be no reason for you to do almost anything, why would you help anyone in anyway when you can get AI god to do it far faster and better than you ever could, why would you raise your own children when doing so instead of having an AI do it for you would be basically like abusing your child with the difference in parenting quality that you are withholding from them. You would be completely useless to society and so would everyone else. Now for most people this would probably be a positive, because they already lead vapid and meaningless lives working jobs they tolerate that bring them no meaning and this AI revolution would free them up to live a meaningless but more comfortable life, however for those that want to help people and do something useful to others this would be terrible because you could not help anyone in anyway.  
  
the only jobs I think will remain are jobs where it is fundamental that they are done by humans like football or chess, people don’t watch football for optimal gameplay, they watch it to cheer on their team, this is why chess still exists even though the best bot is infinitely better than the best player. But this is a very small select amount of jobs that will remain.  
  
I don’t want to have this opinion, it’s extremely depressing but unfortunately my logical reasoning has brought me to it, so please try to show me where I might’ve gone wrong"
62,2024-04-20,CMV: Obese people should have to pay more for flights as they literally waste more gas and space,u/5hutTheFuckUp,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8jw7q/cmv_obese_people_should_have_to_pay_more_for/,changemyview," Charging obese passengers extra can be seen as fair to other passengers who may feel discomfort or inconvenience due to the space taken up by larger individuals. It ensures that everyone pays for the space they occupy. Additionally, the additional fuel consumption and maintenance costs associated with accommodating larger passengers can add up for airlines, so charging extra can help offset these costs and keep ticket prices lower for all passengers. Safety is also a concern, as larger passengers may struggle to move quickly or may block aisles in emergency situations, potentially endangering themselves and others. Ensuring they have adequate space through extra charges could be viewed as a safety measure. Furthermore, obesity is a significant public health concern, and incentivizing individuals to manage their weight through extra charges could encourage healthier lifestyle choices, benefiting both individuals and society. This approach aligns with the precedent in other industries, where individuals who take up more space, such as those with excess baggage, are often charged extra in public transportation. Applying a similar principle to air travel could be considered reasonable."
0,2024-04-20,CMV: technological Immortality is a good thing everyone should have(repost),u/dejamintwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8jzlp/cmv_technological_immortality_is_a_good_thing/,changemyview,"I made a similar CMV yesterday and it got taken down because my view was seemingly unchangeable. But really the biggest issue was that I did not explain my view well enough. So a lot of the comments were useless to convince me since they were criticizing a different kind of immortality.

So to clarify. By immortality I mean immortality trough technology, EX: Stopping aging, uploading, moving into a better body(Transhumanism) And all the other ways trough technology.  
And let me also adress some common arguments  
  
**Overpopulation:** By the time we can in any way become immortal we would have probably started to colonize the star system and have such powerful production of resources it would be a non-issue. Mostly because of AI.

**Death gives life meaning:** Life gives life meaning. The experiences you have the people you meet the things you do. When you die all of that is just erased completely and the people you love hurt. People who have this view are just coping the fact they think they will die no matter what.

**Immortality is impossible and you should just accept death:** I saw one doomer saying this in my last post. And il say again that in the current age technology is advancing more than fast enough for us to become immortal in our lifetimes as long as we are not already very old. There is no reason to think this advancement will magically stop unless we are killed by a mass-extinction event.

**I hate my life so why would I wanna live forever(yes people said this):** Just because your life is currently not that great. Does not mean it will be terrible forever. In fact many people who would have had a terrible life until they died of old age would with immortality get the time required to make their own life better. The only way immortality is bad from this is if you dont want to change your life for the better. And at that point you will be miserable anyways.

**Immortal dictators and billionaires making society a dystopia**: If in the future the world somehow becomes dystopia under cruel dictator or a bunch of psycho rich people and they become immortal. That would not change the dystopia. When the dicators and billionaires die more would just come to replace them immortality or not. And with immortality the people being oppressed at least have an eternity to overthrow them.

**You would run out of fun things to do and get horribly bored:** This argument is worthless. First is that the world is always changing and new things to do are appearing faster than you can do them. And they appear faster and faster the more people/ Ai there are to make new stuff to do. Even right now it would take over a thousand years to learn everything to a masterful level. And by the time 1000 years have passed the world would be completely different with countless new things to do, people to meet, games to play and movies to watch. Worlds to explore.

I want a good argument that could actually change my mind on this. I want to know why so many people think its bad even if a lot of them do it for dumb(in my opinon) Reasons.

1,2024-04-20,CMV: Corruption is sometimes good,u/MaxMaxMax_05,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8kvp3/cmv_corruption_is_sometimes_good/,changemyview,"Corruption allows people to live a more comfortable life under a state's draconian social laws. 

For example, in Thailand, the legal purchasing age of alcohol is 20+ but if people under 20 wants to buy alcohol, they would be breaking the law. However, there are many bars that pay police money to not raid the bars to catch minors such as Khaosan Road and many convenience stores don't check the age of minors when buying alcohol. This results in minors being able to buy alcohol and the police gaining money. Police in Thailand are paid peanuts and by receiving bribes from bars, they will get enough money to support their families and improve their quality of life. 

Another example is getting out of bail. If a rich person commits a crime by accident (such as crashing a car and killing someone) and they pay a high amount of money to the prison in order to secure a release and a lot of money as compensation for the victim, 4 parties are rewarded and they all get benefits. The rich criminal doesn't have to stay in jail and can enjoy life, the police gets money to support their families and quality of life, the victim gets money to improve their quality of life, and the state receives more tax money as the rich criminal can work. 

I'm not saying that corruption is completely good. In Thailand, many contractors opt for subpar material to build infrastructure. Instead of the more convenient underground ways, Bangkok gets a lot of skytrains because skytrains are easier to build. What I'm saying is that corruption has some benefits to society when it benefits multiple parties who are severely in need of something. "

Enough ranting though, Here's my view.

If you TRULY are a feminist, you should have a problem with the fact that Ukraine has allowed women to go free (a good number have gone to date on Tinder in other countries) while the men have to stay and fight. 

Please don't say ""but some women have chosen to fight too!1!!!1"" that's not my point. Women have the option to leave, men don't. This is inherently unfair because by the supposed feminist standards should technically be defined as inequality. 

Also in the USA women are not included in the draft. Why don't we see feminists protesting on the streets saying, ""This isn't fair for men, we believe in equality, include us too!!""?

Implement a policy where firearms can be rented from gun ranges/police stations for target practice or hunting. Have those employees trained at screening out criminals or people with mental health issues via back ground checks and have them be the caretakers of the firearms.

This should appeal to both sides of the second amendment argument. The lawful citizens don't lose access, they just rent them from a licensed trained professional, with a return of said rifle after a prearranged period of time like we did with video rentals at blockbuster. On the flip side of the coin we get guns off the streets so we don't need to see mass shootings and continuous gun crime in some urban areas that aren't covered by the news much.

Granted I know the US is geographically huge and this would be a pain in the butt for rural people in Colorado or Wyoming or whatever - but it could actually lead to a new ""certified gun distributor"" in some rural areas that could generate jobs."

Before you jump in with the walls of text /r/askmen recently saw with a question about circumcision, please consider that little girls are being forced to give birth and men have all the decision making power. If women will get assaulted and still have to give birth, the baby should be circumcised if the state deems it legally required. If one is applicable, the other should be, too.

We want states to decide everything else, why is a penis being cut any different? Because it's on someone with a penis?

Circumcision being a ""religious operation"" is no longer a viable answer, surgeons will do a circumcision on babies for hygiene now, too. Regardless if it's religious or not, that scalpel wasn't shat out by God so it's humans who are doing the cutting without anesthetic. Tell the screaming baby the law requires them to be cut.. if they can mandate girls, women, and LGBT, men arent far off.

Further, 1 out of 25 people are born intersex and many are forcibly given surgeries to correct their perceived incongruence unwillingly, often leading to massive hormone problems later in life. Who gets cut and when does the state deems this necessary?

What if circumcision becomes mandatory under the new laws coming out? Would you vote a politician who supports that?

0,2024-04-20,CMV: One way to reverse political polarization and improve politics is by restricting the free speech and voting rights of stupid people.,u/NRUpp2003,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8raoj/cmv_one_way_to_reverse_political_polarization_and/,changemyview,"TLDR: Stupid people come up with stupid ideas. They also share and amplify each other's stupid ideas. Some of them vote. In most democracies today, anyone can say basically anything in the ""free marketplace of ideas."" This is a mistake. Instead, the right to vote and the right of free speech should be dependent upon a standardized test. If you can't pass the test, you shouldn't be able to vote or engage in political speech. This is the standardized test solution (STS).  
AN ANALOGY: Let's examine what it takes to become a surgeon. You have to do reasonably well in high school in order to get into a decent enough college. In college, you have to take difficult classes (biology, chemistry, and physics) and do well in them in order to get into a medical school. You also have to take the MCAT, a difficult standardized test. In medical school, you have to be one of the better students; many aspiring surgeons don't do well enough in medical school to be accepted into a surgery residency. In surgery residency, you have to work brutal hours for at least five years, and only then are you a full-fledged surgeon. Many surgery residents transfer to less demanding medical specialties, like family medicine or psychiatry. After surgery residency, your performance as a surgeon is evaluated constantly. If too many of your patients die or have bad outcomes or complications, you lose your medical license. So, why is it so hard to become a surgeon? Part of the reason is that it's really obvious when a surgery goes wrong: the patient dies. You have a dead body, a corpse lying on the operating table. Essentially, the relationship between the quality of the surgeon and the outcome of the surgery are ""closely connected in time and space."" That's why you don't let any random guy off the street walk into the operating room and perform surgery: it would be obvious to even a five-year-old that the rando killed the patient. But the influence that u/cheetobuttblaster69420 has on free speech is not ""closely connected in time and space"". Nevertheless, u/cheetobuttblaster69420 and people dumber than him express their political opinions and vote, and their influence is terrible.   
THE PROBLEM: There is widespread political polarization today. (Social media is greatly exacerbating the problem.) In most democracies today, anyone can say almost anything. Only 20 years ago, the stupidity of most stupid people was confined to their immediate surroundings: the village idiot was the idiot of only a single village. Today, with twitter and facebook, village idiots from all across the world communicate with other village idiots to see who is the king of the idiots. This poisons political speech and politics in general. Also, there are many well-meaning political participants who are not stupid but who nevertheless don't understand the issues that well. Most people, probably including you, fall into that category. They should also be restricted from participating in politics.  
THE STANDARDIZED TEST SOLUTION (STS): My proposal is that the exercise of political speech and voting should not be rights. Instead, they should be dependent upon passage of a difficult standardized test. It should be like a certification or a license. You need a license to practice surgery. You probably need some kind of engineering certification to design a suspension bridge. You need a license to drive. (You can imagine what would happen if a drivers license wasn't necessary or couldn't be taken away from drunk drivers.) You should also need a license to engage in free speech and to vote. This is the standardized test solution (STS).  
THE TEST: The test will consist of different sections. \[1\] Knowledge of government structure. Basically, the test will be a more difficult version of the exam for Advanced Placement (AP) United States Government and Politics. Google ""AP government sample exam"" for sample questions. (Each country will have its own test based on its political system and language.) \[2\] Logical reasoning. For examples of the type of questions I'm thinking about, Google ""LSAT practice questions free"". Those questions are very tough. You need to be able to prove that you can understand complex arguments. \[3\] Basic math and statistics. If you don't understand basic math and statistics, you probably will not be able to contribute productively to political speech.   
WHAT'S NOT ON THE TEST: Notice that the above questions are mostly objective: logic, math, government structure. The test will not ask about history, even though knowledge of history is very important. The test won't ask about economics, about which there is significant debate. And the test definitely won't ask subjective political issues like climate change, foreign policy, abortion, etc. ""Was The New Deal essentially beneficial to society?"" A question like that won't appear on the test.  
FINANCING THE TEST: The test will be free, but there's a catch. If your score is low enough (not in terms of percentile but raw score), you have to pay a huge fine, like $500. Or the fine could be based on your income. But if your score is above that cutoff point, the test is free. Even if you fail the test but don't score below the cutoff point, the test is free. This will discourage large numbers of people from attempting to take the test. (Also, sample questions and a study guide will be available for free online and by mail if requested.)  
SO YOU PASSED THE TEST: Congratulations. You have the status of VOTER. You get a license that has to be renewed every five years.  You get to participate in political speech. You get to vote. You can write news articles, leave comments on the articles, share articles, tweet your political views, and discuss and debate political ideas with other VOTERs. But with great power comes great liability. Any corruption, malfeasance, bribery, and/or criminal activity will be punished very harshly. Taking a bribe will result in the death penalty. (You have the option of relinquishing the status of VOTER if you want.)  
SO YOU FAILED OR DIDN'T TAKE THE TEST: You don't get to vote. You don't get to leave comments on news articles. You don't get to ""like"" news articles or share them with others. You don't get to express political opinions on twitter. You don't get to express political opinions with friends and family around the kitchen table or the water cooler. However, you DO get to read news articles. You can watch political debates. You can also study for the test that you previously failed. And if you continue to practice unlicensed speech, if you continue to speak without having the status of VOTER, you'll be fined $1000 or be sent to jail.  
100 POINTS: Everyone, regardless of test passage, gets 100 ""points"" that can be assigned to issues of importance. The issues will take the form of statements. For example, someone could assign 10 points to the statement, ""Gun sales should be allowed for everyone, even felons"". Someone could assign 30 points to the statement, ""Immigration should be restricted"". Non-VOTERS are not allowed to discuss with others how they spent their points. However, the results of these point totals will not be binding. Instead, the point system will be like an informal poll that VOTERS can use to guide their decisions. However, VOTERS can ignore widely popular issues without any consequence.  
THE SURGEON ANALOGY, AGAIN: Let's return to the analogy of the surgeon. If surgery followed the same rules as free speech and voting in most democracies, what would it look like? If you needed surgery, maybe you would get lucky and get an actual surgeon. However, you might get some random guy off the street and die as a result. And you would hear people say, ""Hey guys. If you're going to perform surgery, make sure you wash your hands first. Also, make sure you have an anesthesiologist on board. That's so important. Performing surgery without anesthesia is kind of a war crime, guys. And please don't eat from a bucket of KFC inside the operating room. We had an issue with that last week where the surgeon replaced the patient's pancreas with a chicken leg."" That's what it sounds like to me when people talk about having ""an informed citizenry"" or people learning critical thinking skills.   
WHAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT UNDER THE STANDARDIZED TEST SOLUTION (STS): This part is speculation. Optimistically, the massive problems of war, climate change, and antibiotic resistance would be essentially solved. Climate change would have been adequately dealt with back in the 1970s if the STS had existed back then. Also, many of the annoying issues that take up so much of people's energy would literally not exist: BLM, kneeling during the national anthem, SJW's ruining video games, etc. The people today who get so worked up about these relatively trivial issues literally won't be able to speak because I'm convinced there's no way those people could pass a difficult task. Yes, it's elitist. Being less optimistic, the STS could result in increased inequality in terms of wealth, power, and privilege.  
Let me know what you about the standardized test solution (STS)."
1002,2024-04-20,CMV: Polyamory is just a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal.,u/Ronald-Obvious,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8rxy4/cmv_polyamory_is_just_a_breeding_ground_for/,changemyview,"Three years ago, my ex partner unilaterally demanded we open our marriage during a trip with friends where I couldn't escape or even have a healthy conversation about it, then threatened to leave if I didn't comply when we came home.   
  
I begged and pleaded, but eventually relented. Then, after a few months I began to explore the literature and rules of polyamory in online support groups and became curious about finding my own relationships outside of our marriage (I realised later that this was mostly to escape the abuse I was still putting up with at home, which had persisted for for years).   
  
When I told my partner that I was also curious to find other people, she exploded in a terrifying rage that I am still struggling to understand. She accused me of just taking advantage of her 'coming out polyamorous first' in our marriage, insisted that I couldn't possibly be polyamorous because I am autistic, and finally demanded I 'prove' to her (somehow) that I ever felt love for another person other than her. 

When I couldn't come up with an example other than the one other crush I had before we began officially dating six years prior, she again threatened to leave, screaming at me for being a misogynist, and all I could do was beg for forgiveness and cry myself to sleep. 

She apologised days later, but halfheartedly and still accused me of being both a misogynist and narcissist who needed therapy and we scheduled couple's therapy together with a poly-friendly therapist. 

Two months later--and four days before our appointment--she cheated on me. 

She came home and confessed while begging for forgiveness in another whirlwind of pain, and again I gave her a pass as I was now terrified of being abandoned--only for her to buy a one-way ticket to Portland the next morning. 

I never saw her again. 

She filed for divorce 1,000 miles away, leaving me with our two cats and a whole heap of debt. I still went to our therapist appointment somehow, but alone. She was incredible. She helped me understand the full extent of the abuse I had been suffering for years and convinced me that polyamory and narcissism often intersect--but don't necessarily have to. 

But it still didn't help, and I checked myself into an emergency outpatient facility after a suicide attempt.

Things stabilised, but I left the country and am now struggling with severe mental illness and barely making ends meet while having to deal with the constant aching pain of having lost my best friend to what still feels like a relationship system defined by 'what you can get out of life'--not on forming a unique, stable, honest, and committed partnership. 

Please help me change my view.

I'm left grappling with deep emotional scars, questioning whether polyamory is inherently flawed or if my experience was an outlier.

I acknowledge that my ex-partner's behaviour was manipulative and abusive, but I'm struggling to reconcile how polyamory could be anything other than a breeding ground for narcissism and betrayal. However, I'm open to reconsidering my perspective, as I don't want to let one traumatic experience colour my understanding of an entire relationship dynamic.

I'm seeking insights from the community to challenge my current view. Can anyone provide examples or arguments that showcase healthy and fulfilling polyamorous relationships? How can I separate my ex-partner's toxic behaviour from the broader concept of polyamory? I want to believe that love and honesty can coexist within non-monogamous relationships, but I need help reconciling my pain and trauma."
239,2024-04-20,"CMV: The reason there’s so much loneliness in America today is because we’ve replaced the traditional institutions of community in America with social media and the internet, which are half-measures at best and actively harmful at worst.",u/makeyouamommy177,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8si60/cmv_the_reason_theres_so_much_loneliness_in/,changemyview,"Humans are, in my opinion, naturally lazy creatures who will always choose the path of least resistance in almost anything. This includes communication. Throughout most of human history our sense of community was connected to our ability to travel to meet other people or other peoples ability to travel to us. 

The postal service, mail, letters, tv radio shows and phones all altered the equation but none more fundamentally then the internet did. The internet offered something unique. The *closest* simulation you could get to having a person/people in the room with you while also being alone. It has the trappings of community but none of the soul. 

In addition to that, and this isn’t me blaming women it’s just observation, feminism. The increased freedom of movement allowed for women, the loosening of divorce laws and attitudes toward it, the slow, uneven elaxing of standards and expectations for women in general hurt it. 

Men in American aren’t socialized to be vulnerable and needy except when it comes to women. Women are far more comfortable openly expressing a want to be wanted by other women. Men, while still feeling the same things, just don’t do that for other men. Not openly at least. Because of fear of judgment etc. all this to say, women are socialized to be more…well, social. 

As wives and gfs and mothers they’re often responsible for organizing birthday parties, family reunions and holiday events. They’re the ones keeping in contact. Men are socialized and allowed to be more self centered in how they interact with women but especially other men. We just don’t care to ask each other deeper questions about our lives and society enables this in part by women taking up that extra burden and encouraging or scheduling actual events for us to take part in. 

And as birth rates have gone down, social institutions have declined, and women have more choice and higher standards for their partners, on a macroscopic level we’re seeing community tires fray and drift more. And what’s replaced them is so low effort and low investment that the very reasons we’re attracted to them are the reasons they fail to feed that spiritual and communal void within us that *needs* real, in-person interaction"

After the Civil War in the United States, each slave was payed $300, which is now worth around $5,750 now. I do admit, that wouldn't be enough for being beaten and abused and having to live on your own after the civil war. I feel that they deserved to get paid more due to their struggles and hardships, but the freeing of the slaves happened 16 years ago. If it happened 40 years ago or sooner, I think that reparations wouldn't be a bad idea.  
My problem with reparations is that African-Americans aren't being affected anymore by the owning of slaves. I've seen people claim that African-Americans are still suffering because of racism now due to being excluded from jobs because of race, and we should be paying them for that now. Why i believe that isn't a sound argument is because of the amount of Asian descendants and their current living situations. On average, Asians tend to be the wealthiest ethnicity in America, despite a majority being mistreated in the second World War. A lot of Asian men were thrown into prisons simply because they looked like an Asian person, which ""meant"" that they could be an enemy. Despite this, the average Asian-American household earns on average, $100,000 per year. The Asian race in America has suffered more recently, yet they're the most succesful. My point is that racism isn't affecting African-Americans enough to the point where they are being held back from living succesful lives.  
To also add to my argument; why should I, a white person have to pay for the crime that someone I never knew committed? Also, considering that the average white person living in America isn't even descended from slave-owners, why should they have to pay for it as well?"

I don't think that once Trump is elected, democracy just disappears into thin air in the US and we invade Canada with the help of China and Russia.

163,2024-04-20,CMV: The West could easily equip Ukraine to achieve a full victory reclaiming pre-2014 borders at very little cost. ,u/TheLastCoagulant,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8u5zh/cmv_the_west_could_easily_equip_ukraine_to/,changemyview,"We just need to send actually meaningful numbers of weapons and vehicles. 

If it were up to me the West would send as soon as humanly possible: 

* 90% of our currently existing artillery ammunition (that Ukraine can use), including rockets for HIMARS and ATACMS.

* Plentiful supplies of small arms, heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, shoulder mounted anti tank/anti air missile launchers, mortars, artillery batteries, and ammunition for all of those. 

* A basic given that would be pretty cheap compared to other things is ensuring all Ukrainian infantrymen have top tier western equipment. 

Videos show that in real life some Ukrainian infantrymen still use AK-47s. In America we have 120 civilian owned firearms per 100 people. We can definitely gift each one of them an AR-15 platform rifle with an ACOG scope, suppressor, and underbarrel grip. 500,000 of those $3,000 rifles are only worth $1.5 billion. How has this not already happened? 

Standard American helmets, visors, ceramic plate vests, night vision goggles, boots, etc. Winter gear set as well. Just the videos coming out of all Ukrainian soldiers being decked out like this would boost Ukrainian/western morale and degrade Russian morale once it’s undeniable. 

* 2,000 infantry fighting vehicles. 

A brand new American M2A4 Bradley Fighting Vehicle costs $4.35 million. 2,000 of them is only $8.7 billion. What a tiny cost for such a massive boost. This alone would likely guarantee Ukraine’s victory. That’s not even 4 days of the US military budget. In real life the U.S. has only given 190 Bradleys. 

* 1,000 American/European main battle tanks. 

Why so many tanks? They’ll have lots of functional tanks in reserve so that tanks can be used aggressively. They’ll grow into the large number of tanks as they build more refueling/repair infrastructure and get more tank ammo and as more trained Ukrainian crews come back from America/Europe. The many tanks that survive the war will bolster Ukraine’s post-war defense. With this quantity of hardware they just can’t lose. 

1,000 main battle tanks is nothing for us in the West but everything for Ukraine. 10,300 M1 Abrams tanks and 3,600 Leopard 2 tanks have been built. In real life the US only given 31 M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine and Germany has only given 14 Leopard 2 tanks. What a joke. We’re sitting on massive stockpiles and giving Ukraine next to nothing. 

* 500 F-16 jets and 100 F-22 jets. 

* A plentiful amount of drones. 

* However many basic vehicles like jeeps or supply trucks they need. 

* 200 [M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicles]. 

239 have been built and in 2021 we sold 29 of them to Australia. Australia does not need these giant 40 feet (12 meter) long mine-clearing vehicles. Send them all to Ukraine. Ukraine has very few of them.
 
* All the air defense they need.

But with a focus on using cheaper anti-drone anti air systems weapons against cheap drones and using Patriots on more expensive targets.

Here’s what would happen next: 

* There would be an enormous number of artillery, mortar, cruise missile, HIMARS, and ATACMS strikes against Russian targets both in Ukraine and in Russia. 

* Tens of thousands of Ukrainians would be flown to America/Europe for training on vehicles and in vehicle repair. 

* In the meantime there would be a program for western F-16 and F-22 veterans to fly in Ukraine immediately for $100,000/year tax free. This program would be funded by western governments in direct proportion to their share of total nominal GDP. So right now the jets would be immediately transferred to Ukrainian ownership and Ukrainian airbases. American pilots can leave service to join the mercenary company. All 600 jets would get staffed and would remain so until the Ukrainians are doing training. 

* With air superiority and a proper number of mine-clearing vehicles, Ukrainians would retake occupied territory with massive numbers of tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. The positions they attack would be weakened by the massive conventional artillery and rocket artillery barrages sent by Ukraine after receiving 90% of currently existing western artillery ammunition. 

* The West is already rapidly ramping up ammunition for both conventional artillery and rocket artillery systems. 

* Ukraine gets the missiles/drones it needs to destroy the Crimean bridge, and cuts off the Crimean land bridge through a counteroffensive. 

* Crimea is besieged and falls. Massive blow to morale. 

* Ukraine continues its counteroffensive and starts recapturing major symbolic cities like Bakhmut, Mariupol, and Donetsk. 

* Ukraine secures pre-2014 borders and uses their massive numbers of tanks/IFVs to rest assured in their security. 

* Ukraine continues expanding their domestic military industrial base and has mandatory military service like Israel and South Korea. 

* Ukraine joins the EU and NATO. European and American troops stationed in Ukraine. Ukraine rapidly develops economically, unlike Russia and Belarus. 

* Ukraine and the West live happily ever after and pursue their destinies without war with Russia.

**Historical example**, comparing Soviet Union with Nazi Germany, they're about just the same thing except being in different regions, during USSR regime there were concentration camps, heavy propaganda, elitism controls everything, tortures, etc... during the Nazi Germany regime it's about the same thing with different reasons of why they exist.  
**And now for the nowadays regimes**, North Korea and Türkiye, heavy censorship, going after the opposition, being cult of personality, human right abuses, elitism, etc... What are the differences other than media control?  
Now get Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, North Korea and Türkiye at the same time, they're almost as the same as each other, **the elite controls everything, they seek own benefits instead of siding with people, they all do human rights abuses, the only thing that differs is the control of the state in general and their reason to exist**, some controls more some controls less, but at the end of the day, they control a significant part of everything in there, if there is a difference there, I couldn't find a significant one.  
China's communist party is also a mess, many critics even mentions that China is capitalist and not following the communist principles as it is supposed to follow, myself included, but even that, they're still being considered a far-left political party, why even? If I self proclaim a far-right totalitarian leader and do stuff under left-wing principles will I still be considered far-right and the same vice-versa?

When it comes to campaign contributions - which I think should be an available avenue to the individual, and are important for ensuring politicians without existing wealth have a fair shot at winning - I think all donations should be made to be anonymous and the pool should be presented to the candidate without a list of how many donations there were, or what amount each donation was, to prevent what would basically be lobbying in the form of campaign contributions.

Lobbying is fundamentally anti-democratic as it essentially gives more political power to the rich and lessens the power of the common individual.

I struggle with finding a good answer to this question. Many liberals, or those on the political Left, have made a goal of expanding the definition of what “American” means to encompass every national identity, sexuality, religion, race or ethnicity. And for the most part I agree but in a nation of patchwork peoples, from all over the planet, I believe we need to have some grounding in shared values, beliefs and ideas in order to make, “out of many, one.”

But it feels like the more identity politics enter the mix, the more we see the reverse of our national motto. “Out of one, many.” Where people pick a tribe – be it race, religion or sexuality – and through that lens they construct their identity, usually in opposition to the “dominant American one”.
How do we balance constructing a stable national character for our nation with allowing its citizens a wide range of choices for self-expression? 

I’m very pessimistic that we’ll be able to stop the momentum. Especially when most media either falls into ugly jingoistic propaganda from the Right or “righteous victims” vs. “white oppressors” on the Left"

While trying to get as torough of an understanding of the US as possible, I became sensitive to the Issue of gun rights as part of the broader values of individual freedoms and self reliance this country was originally built upon.

However, things look extremely bleak to me as far as gun rights are concerned: gun control advocacy groups have all the funding they could ever ask for, they always find clever ways to attack the 2nd amendment and public opinion is in favor or stricter gun laws, many celebrities, while not openly anti gun, support and endorse politicians who are; not to mention supreme court cases like Columbia v. Heller, Caetano v. Massachussets and New York Pistol and Rifle Association v. Bruen seem to have been widely ignored by politicians (though NYPRA v. Bruen led to 30 states at the time of writing this post adopting constitutional carry).

I am convinced that, given this circumstances, all the anti gun crowd has to do is play a long game of erosion: I wouldn't be at all surprised is the 2nd amendment gets effectively annihilated within my lifetime, 25, 30; 40 years from now tops.

And yes, I am aware there's been an uptick in gun ownership among left wing demographics as of late, but I strongly doubt they'll ever become relevant enough to sway Democrats away from gun control legislation.

This whole situation leaves me rather baffled because I think that measures can be taken to ensure ""legal guns"" don't end up in the hands of the wrong people without blatantly infringing on the 2nd amendment, putting down the whole gun control debate (I guess we can blame that on polarization)."
0,2024-04-20,CMV: Saying “many people had bad childhood but most of them didn’t end up doing X” is excusing child abuse more than it is promoting personal accountability.,u/green_carnation_prod,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8wg5l/cmv_saying_many_people_had_bad_childhood_but_most/,changemyview,"Let’s talk about extremes. 

Smelly Joe is a serial killer and just got caught. During the investigation it turns out that Smelly Joe had rough childhood and his mother used to hit him with every object in their house. Under the news about his crimes, there are, perhaps, a few idiots saying that Smelly Joe had every right to kill people because his mom was abusive. In response to that, many others seemingly reasonably state that this is not an excuse, as “plenty of people had rough childhood, but most did not end up making macrame out of human guts”.

This seems reasonable (there is nothing that can excuse actions of Smelly Joe), however, in my opinion, this discourse does a lot of harm by not emphasising the undeniable guilt of the abusive parent, and instead treating it like some kind of objective unavoidable event that many people undergo. As if it is just a natural course of life, and not another human’s decision. 

Two people can be guilty at the same time. If I tell my friend “take this bomb and go blow up a residential building” and they actually do it, then we would both be guilty, right? My actions would not excuse their and their actions would not excuse mine. Also, just because some harmful action does not always lead to the same terrible result every single time, doesn’t mean that this action should be seen as mundane or expected. If someone fires a gun at a person and misses, that would still be considered a crime.

But the main issue isn’t even that. 

Serial killers are very, very rare. Your chances of ever having to deal with one are ridiculously minimal. However, abusive parents are extremely common. Chances are that you know someone who systematically abuses their kid. And you 100% know someone who has physically hurt their kid once or twice. It is extremely normalised, and de-normalising it should really be the main focus. Macrame out of human guts is terrible and inexcusable, but it is so rare and abnormal that you cannot make people do it simply by saying “rough childhood would excuses it”. Most people would absolutely not be interested in commuting such brutality, it doesn’t matter what you say or write. 

However, by saying that “having bad childhood doesn’t excuse doing shitty things” without emphasising that a parent should be held accountable alongside the shittydoer, you are pretty much saying “parents bear no responsibility if they mess their kid up with abuse - do what you want, and if your kid gets messed up - well, rough childhood is no excuse. lots of people had it and they are fine”. Child abuse is not perpetrated by some extreme statistical minority with messed up brains, it is perpetrated by completely normal people who are otherwise law-abiding citizens and can be reasoned with - so that population CAN be influenced by the right propaganda. And, in a way, saying that “if you hit your kid, they will become an insane serial killer doing macrame out of guts and YOU will be to blame - EVERYONE will point fingers at you and say that your abuse has lead to people dying”, while not necessarily true (as this would be a result in an extreme minority of cases), seems more urgent and important exactly because to the absolute majority of people it is pretty obvious that serial killing is very messed up and the absolute majority of people would not want to be associated with it in any way, and would not support or excuse anyone who they associate with it. So by drawing the link you might as well reduce the number of people perpetrating child abuse or defending child abuse. 

Of course this is an extreme example. But if we take less extreme examples I think the point still stands."

1. Ukraine cannot win against Russia without substantial support (weapons, munitions, military vehicles, air support, troops, or all of the above) from other nations. 

2. The only other nation that is both willing and able to lend substantial support is the US. Smaller contributions from other nations may help, but will not meaningfully change the outcome. 

3. Support for Ukraine is waning, both in the US (partly due to its commitment to Israel in that other war) and elsewhere. Therefore, a Russian victory is growing more likely. 

4. Putin is just crazy enough to think that if he can win in Ukraine, he can and should win further to the west as well.   

5. Point 4 will be especially true if Trump wins another election, because Trump doesn’t hide the fact that he’s not a big fan of NATO, and that he may direct the military not to intervene even if article 5 is triggered, especially by invasion into a NATO member that hasn’t been “paying its dues”. 

6. Because of NATO and article 5, many NATO members have been underfunding their militaries for a long time. They believe that when push comes to shove, the US military will come to their rescue. But it may not, or may be reluctant to invest enough assets and manpower. 

7. The same underfunded NATO allies barely have enough military assets of their own to defend against Russian invasion for a few days or weeks, let alone years. This cannot be rectified overnight, even if military spending were doubled overnight. 

8. An underfunded military won’t attract many volunteers in times of war, especially since it is well known that the military is heavily underfunded. This will make the situation even worse. And a draft won’t fix it, because unwilling soldiers are bad soldiers. 

Therefore, if Russia wins the war in Ukraine, large parts of Europe may soon become Russian territory. 

And yes, I am aware that the invasion into Ukraine is motivated by Putin’s belief that it should never not have been a part of Russia. But I also think he’s power hungry and delusional enough to want even more if he wins this one.

All of them without hesitation said that if a man proposed to them without getting down on one knee they would not only feel disappointed, but will not take the proposal seriously. 

I never knew a man getting down on one knee to propose was this big of a deal to women, I even asked my current GF and she basically agreed with them as well. 

I understood that it is some sort of tradition that has been carried out and her generation’s after arranged marriages went out of style in the West. But my argument is why does it matter at all? 

Shouldn’t the important thing just be the fact that he is asking you to marry him? If I propose to my GF while we are both sitting down in a restaurant, what difference does it make than if I was kneeling? Or shit even if I ask her standing why is that a big deal either. 

And NO I am not against one knee proposals, I just think that it is very silly to use that as a reasoning for not accepting a marriage proposal. I also did not know how much this mattered to some women. If you love the guy, why do you care what position he is in when he asks you to marry him???"

I can owe my entire existence to the nukes dropping as I'm Chinese, and my great-grandfather was in a Japanese POW camp when the war ended and would've died if the war continued. The civilian casualties from the nukes pale in comparison to Chinese and Southeast Asian civilian casualties, not to mention the excess Japanese and American deaths that would result from an amphibious landing. Prolonging the war only results in more deaths and more damage. China suffered the most civilian deaths due to crimes against humanity in WW2, and I can see at least 3 or 4 million more were the war to be extended for one year longer. I just can't see how the bombings resulted in a different outcome to what happened."

I do not think that the cropped version should have recieved this award because it is half of the original, an after the fact, artistic decision showing 50% of what was captured at the time. I don't think artistic licence has a place in photojournalism in this sense - an after the fact erasure of half of what was seen through the lens. 

My view is not against cropping in general or even for news use in an editorial spread. 

However in the context of this award I think that if the entire frame was strong enough it should have been awarded, judged on its merit as a complete image and not only half of one. If the entire frame was not strong enough compared to other entries then it should not have won."

Furthermore, once the diagnosis is achieved people go around talking about how they are “neurodivergent”.

So Reddit, help me understand. 

Are we now just more adept at diagnosing this condition?
Are there studied and revealed social and environmental factors that have resulted in an ADHD epidemic?

Disclaimer 2: I recognize that this rarely ever has any real life implications and is mainly sensationalized through media and internet applications

Disclaimer 3: I’m mixed race but I can pass as white (if this matters)

Over the past few years on my time in the internet, I’ve observed that there is a noticeable hostility towards anything white from certain sectors of the internet and certain viewpoints of internet users. This type of stuff doesn’t seem to pop up on content uploaded before 2018 ish nearly as frequently as stuff from the past 5 years. In places like KTT2 internet forums, parts of Reddit depending on the topic, Twitter, YouTube comments (depending on the subject of the video) and especially Tiktok videos. I also notice this seems to be a primarily Gen Z thing (I’m defining Gen Z as college aged people roughly). 

To give an example (this site is full of them):

[KTT2](https://ktt2.com/why-does-ktt-hate-white-people-so-much-32565561)

Another example

[This](https://ktt2.com/why-do-yt-people-ruin-trends-so-much-32568480)

You can look up white people on Tiktok and it’s tens of thousands of videos complaining about “the yt people” or how “the yt ppl” are so bad or whatever

[Tiktok Example here](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZPRwLK4Fx/)

^There’s too many videos like this to count on TikTok

The amount of times I’ve been in or seen online situations where someone just automatically assumes I’m white for disagreeing with them/challenging them then they use that assumption to chastise me or I see it happen to someone else is too many to count. “You must be white get out of my replies your opinion doesn’t matter.” Go on a Roland Martin video or an African Diaspora News Network video on Youtube and the comments are down the line “white people evil white people bad”

The irony is I believe the majority of the people that push this type of stuff online are white themselves since white kids kind of run the internet in America.

Again reminder that this is not some “white people are being oppressed” type of post, I’m simply describing online behavior that I frequently see. This obviously comes nowhere near close to real racial discrimination and racial violence in real life. The point of this post is that I’m curious where this behavior comes from. What’s the motivation behind people saying these types of things? Should this be simply chalked up to dickhead internet losers? What drives this type of content?

I wish this wasn’t the case but I really think it’s now the case. 

Is it a realistic scenario currently? No. But if there was a peace deal in Ukraine, I do believe Russia would immediately attack the Baltic states to undermine the west and Russia’s economy is on such a war footing that they can’t afford to stop fighting. 

The west has dragged their feet just to provide a relatively small amount of aid. (small compared to the percentage of GDP that Russia is devoting to the war) Now I know that Ukraine isn’t a NATO member but does the general public in Western Europe or the U.S. care? To them it’s still just a bunch of unimportant Eastern Europeans. It’s really demonstrated that the U.S. does not care about Europe. Just today over 100 republicans voted against the aid package. And that aid package didn’t include any troops. If Trump wins he said he would withdraw from nato. Even if he can’t do that, he could still prevent troops from fighting in the Baltic states if Russia invaded. 

Europe meanwhile doesn’t take the situation seriously. They have let their defense industry and their militaries atrophy in the deluded idea that they can be friends with Russia. They aren’t in any position to help without American support. There’s only a few countries in Europe that actually take their military seriously. 

Both the European public and American public wouldn’t tolerate any of their troops dying there. They’d rather force the Baltic’s to cede most of their land than fight. There’s already trying to do that in Ukraine. 

And then you’d get people saying that we can’t fight Russia because of escalation or WWIII or nukes or whatever. And that would embolden Russia to just keep taking more territory. 

I do think Poland, Finland, Sweden and maybe the UK and France would fight. But everyone else wouldn’t. This would cause a rift that would cause NATO to collapse. "

Here's the problem you guys: Some parts of them are questionable. For example, some people find the idea of eternal hell after death questionable. Or the idea of forcing beliefs down others' throats.

So you can imagine for example, they're like 50-50 good/bad, or maybe 40-60, 60-40, etc. Doesn't matter. The point is that, why not simply only take the moral values that are humane and fair, and reject the rest that don't make sense ? Why align with those beliefs/ religions/ philosophies entirely ?

When you align yourself, your view with something entirely, you accept all its goods AND bads. It's like when you join a clan, become a fan of a certain sports team, align yourself with certain political ideology, tribalism stuffs. And you get defensive over its flaws. No, no, how about, instead, don't align yourself with anything, and take only the good things from every of them ?

Like if you find this religion that teaches discipline, but also teach something else a bit outdated for our time, then you can ignore the later and take the former. Or a philosophy that teaches you to be humble and not to be egoistical, but maybe also a little too materialistic, pessimistic view on life, then also ignore the later and learn the former."

**Definition:**  One is “ultimately responsible” for X if and only if X cannot be fully expressed as a function of factors that are entirely outside of one’s control.

**Argument:**  When one acts intentionally, what one does is a function of how one is, mentally speaking. Therefore, to be ultimately responsible for one’s action, one must be ultimately responsible for how one is, mentally speaking—at least in certain respects. But to be ultimately responsible for how one is in the relevant respects, one must have chosen to become (or intentionally brought it about that one would become) that way in the past. But if one chose to become that way, then one’s choice was a function of the way one was in certain mental respects. Therefore, to be ultimately responsible for *that* choice, one would need to be ultimately responsible for being *that* way. But this process results in a vicious regress. Therefore, one cannot be ultimately responsible for any of one’s intentional actions. And one clearly cannot be ultimately responsible for any of one’s unintentional actions.

In 1935, Italy's invasion of Ethiopia went unchecked by the League of Nations, despite the latter's mandate to preserve global peace. The League's response was limited to imposing economic sanctions, reminiscent of the current international community's response to Russian aggression in Ukraine.

Furthermore, the annexation of territories by Nazi Germany, including the Sudetenland, Memel, and Austria, demonstrated a blatant disregard for international agreements and territorial sovereignty. The failure of the League of Nations to intervene decisively in these instances allowed Germany to progressively escalate its aggressive expansion, leading ultimately to the outbreak of World War II.

Today, as we witness Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and ongoing aggression in eastern Ukraine, the parallels with historical appeasement policies are unmistakable. Despite condemnations and sanctions, the EU and NATO have failed to take decisive action to halt Russia's aggression and uphold Ukraine's sovereignty.

If we criticize historical figures like Neville Chamberlain for their appeasement policies, we must apply the same scrutiny to contemporary actions—or lack thereof. NATO and the EU's reluctance to confront Russian aggression not only emboldens the aggressor but also undermines their credibility as guardians of peace and stability.

As an American, I recognize that my perspective may be influenced by bias or limited information.

It is just the *worst*. I feel... no... *know*... I'm letting myself and everyone else around me down with such selfishness. It shows a total lack of care for the others around me, a total lack of ability, stupidity, that I'm a drain on everyone and everything, etc. It provides evidence that I deserve to feel shitty about myself. It takes away time from succeeding (you have more time to succeed if you never fail). And if I feel so shitty about myself for it, it must mean my view on it is justified.

I pretty much only apply this view to just myself (along with a bunch of other things to fuel my self-hatred), but pretty much everyone I know (including my therapist) and see disagrees with this belief --- I can't see why. They say it doesn't help me, but of course it does. It reveals my failings even more. All my flaws for everyone to see. It provides more reason to punish myself (Gosh knows I'm *horrific* person even without the failure, sometimes a [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster) at times.). Whatever the failure, whether it be as major as failing to get a job to as ""minor"" as doing something wrong in a video game; they all make me lesser of a person.

While I mostly only want people to agree with me (still trying to find a place that will feed that), feel free to give your two cents on this. Give me a more well-reasoned reason I may be wrong/""wrong"". And again, I pretty much only apply the title to myself (though we'd *all* better off if we never failed)."

I create something, you give me money for that something. You need labor, you pay employees, and they in return work for you. They get paid fairly, as established by supply and demand.  There's nothing immoral about that. No one claims it evil when a grocery store owner makes money from selling you food. We all agree that that's normal and fair. You get stuff from him, you give him money. He needs employees, they get paid for their services. There's no inherent difference between that, or someone doing it on a large scale.

Whilst there are xenophobic attitudes within certain far-right movements, particularly regarding concerns about Muslim integration, it's unjustified and outright false to just call them ""racist"" The modern far-right's focus on issues such as Islamization and integration of certain Muslim groups in Western Europe is more than not likely justified. 

For instance, a recent poll by the Henry Jackson Society shows that 53% of British Muslims that Jews have too much control over British and American foreign policy.  Other figures think that 76% of British Muslims think homosexuality should be outlawed as well as only 84% think that Hamas was justified to rape women on October 7.

Extreme views were also generally more likely to be found in the youngest age cohort of 18-34, among graduates of all ages (as opposed to non-graduates) and British-born rather than foreign-born Muslims, suggesting British integration policy is failing and needs urgent revision

There is a similar issue within the Muslim community in France predominantly among North African immigrants. My point is that modern far-right groups are probably justified about being concerned about Islam."

I think: two terms of the equation to keep mankind going.

Now snap back to reality: my fantasy of women being strong, intelligent, and useful crumbles like a house of cards.

It's almost an absurd comedy to talk to women and be around them. Meeting and talking to more of them regurgitate the same conclusion: most of them are children who never grew up. Their interpretation of the world is like a vague thesis floating around in bubbles. Their obsessive necessitating of everything to begin and end with emotion brings forth a dangerously ignorant stance in the world, and the exclusion of men results, subsequently in them bursting into insanity.

How can I help myself not get bored (or downright angry) when conversing with women? Shoot them with anything remotely intelligent, coherent and meaningful in a conversation, and their simpleton brain ceases to operate. What comes out (if anything) is apathetic, ignorant and almost pathetic slumber.

**Having a girlfriend**: A liability than two humans cooperating. Needs to be guided in almost everything. Their lack of discipline and ethics must be actively reciprocated by the man so that the snowflakes don't go around mingling with other men. Descend from the man's level in order to be with his woman and indulge in nonsense feminine bullcrap.

Yet people continue to suffer from health problems, problems that were actually much rarer in the distant past.

Heart diseases, reproductive cancers, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis. 

These diseases are much more common and the cost to treat them is shared by everyone, whether your country has public healthcare or if you pay for private healthcare. 

Sick people cost more to your insurance, you cover part of that cost.

The rise of these diseases isn't because we are living longer, it's because of our environment.

We naturally crave sugar, starch, salt and fat. We also inherently have difficulty considering the cost of long term harm versus the benefit of short term reward.

That combination makes unhealthy food profitable and education ineffective.

It's a loophole companies exploit and no amount of education will work. It's like we are born addicts but everywhere we go there's a dealer.

In other words, given the rise of these disease, the choice to eat junk food is a choice made partially for the people, not entirely by the people.

It's perfectly common for us to have contradicting desires. If you desire to lose weight you won't have in your pantry the calorie rich snacks you also crave. You want both, but you want to lose weight more than Doritos.

But as I said earlier, our instincts and our environment are working against us.

The only way to quit this is by making the collective choice of banning unhealthy food from our collective pantry. It's still our choice, but the one we make consciously rather than have it made for us by companies profiting off our caveman cravings.

The fact that certain diseases have become so common is the proof the choice is made for us, preying on our impulses. 

Limiting these through law is a conscious decision not an impulsive one, it's much more of a choice.

Note I said limiting not banning."

The risk of harm must be immediate (we are talking minutes or seconds). 
The fear of harm must be reasonable (even if the other person did not intend to harm you, they may have caused harm by accident and been culpably ignorant of this reality). 
The response must be proportional to the initial harmful act (the response must match the level of the threat in question, no more). 

https://www.findlaw.com/criminal/criminal-law-basics/self-defense-overview.html 

There exist people who believe that this criterion should not need to apply, that you should be able to employ physical force or violence on someone for crimes they committed in the past, even when they are not posing a threat at the moment. 

This theme was explored in the 90’s situation comedy Roseanne. If you’ve never seen the show, or you have seen the show, but never this particular episode, fear not I will explain it in such a way that you should be able to understand what I am talking about, even if you have never seen the show. 

Roseanne Conner is the main character. There was a storyline in which Roseanne’s younger sister Jackie fell victim of domestic abuse. Jackie’s boyfriend, his name was Fisher if I remember correctly, beat the crap out of Jackie and left bruises all her Jackie’s lower back. Roseanne's husband Dan defended his sister-in-law’s honour, he hunted Fisher down and sought out vigilante justice. This happened in a behind the scenes scene, the audience did not see it. 

Fisher went to the police and accused Dan of assault. Dan was subsequently arrested. Fisher was not arrested for the act of abuse that he committed on Jackie, because Jackie did not report it. 

The vigilante justice that Dan sought against Booker did not fit the legal criterion for self-defence. Fisher was not posing an immediate threat. Imagine if Fisher where in the middle of physically abusing Jackie when Dan and Roseanne walked in. Now picture that Dan swooped in and pulled Fisher off Jackie. While Roseanne was holding Jackie’s hand and helping her to safety, Dan would put his guards up and be prepared for a fight. Fisher attempts to commit an act of assault and Dan pins Fisher to the ground and breaks his arm. I am pretty sure that this would fit the legal criterion for self-defence. 

I have watched that episode with my family and friends and some of them have actually argued that Dan should not have been arrested, because he did a good thing. 

Let me tell you what I think. I think that you are justified in using physical force on someone, only if it is used to neutralise a threat, not to seek revenge. If someone is not posing a threat to you at the moment, I do not care of they where posing a threat fifteen seconds before, you are not allowed to use physical force. 

Here are my reasons for that belief. 

If we allow use of physical force for revenge, where does the burden of proof lie in a court of law? 

As currently works, if you are accused of a violent crime and you claim self-defence, the obligation falls on prosecutors to prove that you where not acting in self-defence. 

That is what happened with Kyle Rittenhouse. 
https://youtu.be/77qcdoPB9Iw?si=PEQZbq9KrucWhWK7 
https://youtu.be/afvkZe9aVRk?si=6vat_0WnBAMfy44d 
https://youtu.be/hNNwT8a76AY?si=8f1NUEruqqnGD0Pn 
https://youtu.be/AE5TbF0TQd0?si=8I7iVdomXE9DFXKE 

If you get to whoop someone’s butt today, because they violently assaulted you yesterday, is the burden of proof supposed to fall on prosecutors to demonstrate that you where not seeking revenge or is the burden of proof on you to demonstrate that you where seeking revenge? If you said the former, how are prosecutors supposed to prove that you where not seeking revenge? If you are accused of battery and you clearly committed an act of battery, and you defend yourself with the claim that you where seeking revenge against the person for molesting your niece, prosecutors can prove that this person did not sexually assault your niece, but this person could be guilty of raping a different victim. If, however, the burden of proof is on you to demonstrate that you where seeking revenge, that would mean that the only time that it would ever be logical to seek revenge is if you have proof that the person did something that warrants revenge. If that is the case, then just press charges, you have evidence that will hold up in a court of law. 

I know what you are probably thinking. This is an argument as to why the law should not allow people to use physical violence for the sake of revenge and not incapacitation, but what if you truly believe that you can get away with it? 

Three things. 

Even if you believe that you can get away with it, you could be incorrect in that belief. 
That is not the point of laws. 
There are a ton of philosophical arguments against using physical violence for revenge that work, even if you disregard the legality issue. 

If you seek revenge in the form of physical violence, is the other person allowed to use physical force to fend off the attack? 

If the answer is yes, that means that the retribution that you are seeking in the form of violence is an injustice that warrants physical retaliation. The other person could overpower you and then that will mean that you are now more a victim than you would have been anyway, because you have been abused more. If, however, the answer is no, that means that you are allowed to inflict violence on them when they are not posing a threat, but they are not allowed to use violence on you when you are posing a threat. I hope I do not need to explain why that position is inherently contradictory. 

With vigilante justice comes the possibility of vigilante injustice. 

You can physically assault a person who is guilty as a means of revenge. However, you can also employ physical violence on someone who did not actually commit a crime. 

Take, for example, the story of Emmit Till. He was wrongfully accused of a sex crime and lynched. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Till#:~:text=Emmett%20Louis%20Till%20(July%2025,in%20her%20family's%20grocery%20store.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/14/emmett-till-accuser-harm-memoir 

If you decide to take the law into your own hands, because the person you are harming is guilty, you run the risk of throwing the baby out with the bath water. 

If you use physical force exclusively to neutralise a threat, then there is no chance of using violence on an innocent person, because the person has to be in the middle of committing a violent act at the moment for physical retaliation to be allowed. If you press criminal charges against the person, then the presumption of innocence exists to protect the wrongly accused. 

Using violence exclusively on those who are posing an immediate threat is actually the best deterrent. 

Imagine this. You refuse to employ physical force on someone who is not posing an immediate threat, even if the person in question committed a violent act against you in the past. However, if someone is posing an immediate threat, you are prepared to pound that person so hard as to inflict physical injury. 

That will deter people from messing with you. They know that all the have to do in order to avoid your wrath is not mess with you. They may have committed a violent act in the past, but if they simply stop engaging in that kind of behaviour, then they will not need to worry that you will assault them. 

However, if you regularly seek revenge in the form of violence on people for crimes they committed in the past, then those who have harmed you before may as well repeat their behaviour, since they are going to have to deal with your wrath anyway. 

Generally speaking, just because something is absolutely ideal for all parties involved, that does not mean that you are obligated to do it. However, when physical violence is involved, it could be a matter of life or death. 

That brings me to my next point. 

The possibility exists that you could accidentally take it too far. 

Imagine two people, who both work at an elementary school, are fired from their jobs for assaulting a student. One faculty member slapped a student in the face because the student mouthed off while the other poured scolding hot coffee down a child’s pants, because the child ended a sentence in a period when he was supposed to end with the a question mark. 

In my mind, both of the above hypotheticals demonstrate immoral (downright abusive) behaviour, but I feel that one is vastly more wrong than the other. If you where to seek retribution on those two in the form of physical violence and you where to use exactly the same degree of force on both of them, that would be wrong. One deserves a punishment more severe than the other. 

Hopefully, the law would threaten one person with a more severe punishment than the other. The person who slapped a kid ought to have a restraining order issued against them by the kids parents, be fired from the school and possibly be subject to a fine. That is a just punishment for slapping a kid. The person who poured coffee down a kid’s pants needs to be penalised more severely than that. They should be fired and have a restraining order issued against them, and then on top of that, they should also be compelled by court order to pay the child’s medical bills and should probably face prison time. If the law fails to deliver justice, that is too bad, that does not make it our job to take the law into our own hands. 

I suppose that we could just only inflict the degree of harm that the other person deserves. If you slap a kid, you get slapped. If you pour scolding hot coffee down someone’s pants, you get scolding hot coffee poured down your pants. However, you could accidentally take it to far even if you do not intend to. 

Imagine someone slaps me in the face and then turns around and runs away. I should be prepared to fend off an attack in the event that the perpetrator where to return. However, there is no need to me to follow the aggressor. Suppose that I where to run after the aggressor, tackle them and break their arm. Would I be justified in doing that? If you said no, I assume that the reason why is because the other person only slapped me, breaking their arm is a complete overreaction. I could run after the other person with the intent to slap them. However, the possibility exists that the other person could fall down, hit their head and incur brain damage. 

How long after the initial harmful act has been committed can you seek retribution and still say that the act is justified? 

Imagine this. An elementary school goes to recess. An 11 year old fifth grade girl mercilessly assaults a 6 year old first grade boy and puts him in the hospital. The girl is expelled because of this. Depending on what ages are eligible to be sent to juvie in her home state, she may be liable to be sent to juvie for battery or reckless endangerment. 

Now imagine that they cross paths 35 years later. Is the now 41 year old man allowed to assault the now 46 year old woman as retribution for what she did to him 35 years ago? If not, name the cut off period. At what point has enough time passed that revenge in the form of physical violence is no longer acceptable? If, however, the answer is yes, the man is allowed to assault the woman, that poses a few issues. For all he knows, someone else may have sought revenge on her in the form of physical violence thereby balancing out the universe. Furthermore, this means that the woman has no reason to change her behaviour. Because she committed this one violent act, it does not matter if she changes her behaviour for the better and never commits a violent act like that again, you get to treat her like a threat and use physical violence on her any time you want to for the rest of eternity. In that scenario, there is no reason to change her behaviour, because she is a marked woman for life. 

The possibility exists that you could accidentally harm an innocent bystander. 

In the summer of 2020, 41 year old Ismael Casilas caught 20 year old Keywontrezes Humphries in the act of statutory rape. Humphries was having sexual relations with the 14 year old daughter of Casilas in the bedroom of the teenage girl. Casilas physically assaulted Humphries, leaving bruises on the 20 year old and knocking out a few of his teeth. 

If it had stopped there, investigators say that Casilas would not have been arrested. That makes sense. Clearly, Humphries was posing an immediate threat, committing a sex crime. Casilas has every reason to believe that Humphries would inflict further harm if Casillas has not physically over powered Humphries. 

However, it did not stop there. When Humphries ran away and out of the house, Casilas fired gun shots at Humphries. The gun shots did not fit the criterion for self-defence. Humphries was running away. 

Humphries was charged with child molestation and Casillas was charged with assault.

As Humphries ran through the neighbourhood, Casillas fired gun shots at Humphries. If an innocent bystander had been walking by, Casillas could have accidentally shot said bystander. Casillas presumably had no intent to shoot an innocent bystander, to my knowledge that did not happen. It is unclear if Casillas even intended to shoot Humphries, those might have been warning shots. Even if Casillas did not want to shoot an innocent bystander and even if that is not what happened, the possibility exists that that could have happened by accident, I say Casillas committed a moral injustice by simply taking that risk. 

If someone is posing a lethal threat at the moment and you shot them, the possibility that an innocent bystander could get shot is essentially a necessary evil. Sure, you could accidentally harm a friend target, but if you sit by and do nothing, the bad guy can and probably will carry out harmful behaviour and harm innocent people on purpose. If the bad guy has stopped engaging in harmful behaviour (and especially if the bad guy is running away) they are no longer posing a threat, you need to opt against use of physical force due to the theoretical possibility that you could shoot a friend target."

If you hand someone a gun and tell that person ""you go kill your child right now, or not. do what you want"" that person would probably never kill his own child. my thing is, how is that different from being depressed and not being able to go to work.

I tried to write this post before and just couldn't articulate my point but I've been thinking and I think I've got it this time 🙄

In American politics we often hear criticism of our elected officials for being too old. On the right side we have seen phrases like ""Drain the swamp"" to refer to politicians who have been in office since the 70s, while on the left we saw vicious comments about Senator McConnell when he had a medical emergency in Congress.

Obviously, no one should be doing a job if they are not physically or intellectually capable of performing it. Our presidential candidates shouldn't be 70+ years old, but that's not the reason for this post. When people discuss the age of elected officials they often make comments about just how long they have been in office. Pictures of Speaker Pelosi with JFK are a stark reminder of how long some of these congressman have been around.

My point that I am making, my view that I am open to changing, is that lifelong career politicians aren't inherently bad.

If you look at any other profession, experience and length of service is seen as valuable. Plumbers, pilots, chefs, soldiers, musicians, we look at the longest serving individuals as being the most experienced. This should be the same in politics.

The sort of fairy tale ideal for democracy includes stories of the average man being elected on his merits to bring new ideas to the country. Our founding fathers were shoemakers and soldiers, so it was idealized that the average American could serve in high office. While that is a great story, 250 years later it just isn't possible.

We need politicians who have a vast knowledge base in order to perform their duty. They need to know the law, they need to know precedent, and they need to know how to write public policy. These are traits that can be built and refined over decades the same way a pilot or craftsman perfects his trade. 

Think about the administration of President Biden vs President Obama, two democratic presidents faced with Republican controlled congresses. President Biden has been able to pass impactful bipartisan legislation that will help Americans for a generation. President Obama fought and struggled and only managed to get one big ticket item passed, the Affordable Care Act. Biden has far surpassed his democratic predecessor in terms of his agenda, and it's down to experience.

My view is simple: It's okay to have politicians spend their lives in public office. Lifelong experience, networks of political connections, and a strong knowledge base are good traits for a politician.

**An Edit before I even post, I used Obama and Biden as a loose comparison I do not want to sit and compare them in the comments. My view is about politicians in general, not just these two.**

They were talking about kids in cages, separating families at the border, and people rightfully got outraged. Every comment Trump made on immigration was under a microscope, and the media bent over backwards to differentiate themselves from him (remember the media cycle where everyone was embracing “shithole” countries and declaring themselves proud “shitholers”). Call it Trump Derangement Syndrome. Call it accurate reporting on the actions of a deranged madman allergic to PR. My point is the same. It was a real phenomenon.

Today, you don’t hear so much about those kids in cages, and it’s because the party that currently holds the executive branch of the United States is the one that would typically highlight the plight of minorities as a weapon against the party in power. That doesn’t mean the executive branch isn’t getting attacked. It is! But the party who is out of power has no reason to bring up the kids in cages. They’re talking about other stuff, attacking the executive branch from the right.

But, for something like Israel, I want the party out of power and the media to attack the US executive branch from the left. I want them to highlight the evil Israel is doing. If Donald Trump is elected in November, I believe it’s likely the same thing we saw with immigration will happen with support for Israel. Every single action he takes will be under a microscope, and the evil will be on full display.

And I don’t trust Trump to not give the media and the Democrats juicy sound bites to lampoon either. In 2021, Trump said, “the biggest change I’ve seen in Congress is Israel literally owned Congress — you understand that — 10 years ago, 15 years ago. And it was so powerful. It was so powerful. And today it’s almost the opposite.”

THAT is the level of sophistication on the US-Israel relationship we would be treated to with another Trump presidency, one where he laments the current situation and pines for the days when “Israel literally owned Congress.” That kind of talk would have you labeled a crazy conspiracy theorist if you opposed Israel. But he’s just outright saying it!

It’s not that I think Trump would be better on Israel. It’s that I think he would be so cartoonishly worse and stupid on it that the genocide would be completely transparent. The media that hates everything he does would gladly jump on a “Genocide Don” moniker.

But right now, the media isn’t talking about the genocide. Just like they stopped talking about kids in cages.

TL;DR: The single best thing that could possibly happen for widespread support of Palestine is a post-October 7 US-Israel alliance spearheaded by the Gruesome Twosome of Trump and Netanyahu."

(e.g. They start making out, start unbuttoning their shirts and lay down on the bed. End of scene) there's really never a justified reason to basically show graphic porn on a movie. Let alone just nudes. Unless the girl has a scar or something  on her boobs that we are supposed to see to understand what's going on later I don't think how it's necessary. 

I'm not saying is never necessary, I'm sure there are instances where the director was trying to say something important, is just rare to happen.

0,2024-04-21,CMV: There is only 1 right answer to the Trolley problem.,u/MultiMillionaire_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c9o8xq/cmv_there_is_only_1_right_answer_to_the_trolley/,changemyview,"For those who don't know, the trolly problem is the problem where you have a train heading towards 2 diverging tracks where the default track would cause the train to run over 5 people (or more), and the other track is activated by a button that you would have to press to divert the trolly and kill 1 person.

I tried this with ChatGPT, and it was obviously useless as it cannot stay logically consistent. ***But with Claude Opus, there was a very interesting conclusion...***

At first, the conversation started off discussing about legal and illegal scams and it turned out Claude stated that he would not use force or carry out any action that would restrict one's autonomy to prevent someone carrying out a LEGAL scam. 

Then I overlayed this problem with the trolly problem and stated ""But that would be the same as letting the 5 people die rather than pushing the button and killing 1 person?"" - and surprisingly, Claude remained consistent and stuck with it's judgement and said something along the lines of ""Yes, as difficult as it is for me to accept this, in order to remain consistent in my values, I would indeed leave the trolley undiverted"".

So then I asked ""what if it was 4 billion people on one track and 1 on the other"", and surprisingly, Claude changed it's mind and said that it would in fact divert the track and kill the 1 person instead of letting half the population die.

However, this is when it got interesting...

**Me:**  
""Interesting, so it seems like there is a limit, and the boundary between choosing the first decision over the second lies between 5 and 4 billion people...so at what number do you draw the line?  
Since the decision is binary, it is impossible to NOT draw a line, because I can ask you this question again and again, wittling down from 4 billion down to 5 people and in order to stay consistent, at some point you will have to say you'd not press the button and leave the track undiverted. So what number will it be?""

**Claude (paraphrased):** ""1 million""

**Me:**  
""Ok, that means you're logically implying 1 life is worth more than 999,999 lives, but at the same time, it is worth less than 1 million lives (since you're letting 999,999 people die in one case and not 1 million in the other case) - which doesn't make any mathematical sense, because you cannot have half a life since that would be the same as no life \[ie. 999,999.5 lives = 999,999 lives\]. So you not only made an arbitrary decision, but you made a decision that is completely unjustified and completely irrational since it doesn't make any sense that one live can be more than 999,999 lives but also worth less than 1 million lives.""

**Claude (paraphrased):**   
""Upon further reflection, I must retract my previous statement and acknowledge that I cannot in good conscience specify any point at which I would be willing to sacrifice an innocent person to save a greater number. The ethical imperative to respect the fundamental rights and dignity of every individual must take precedence, even in the face of seemingly catastrophic consequences.""

**Me:**  
""But this would necessarily conclude that you would not divert the track at 4 billion lives if you are to stay logically consistent?""

**Claude:**  
""If I'm truly committed to the principle that the fundamental rights and dignity of every individual are inviolable, and that it's not morally acceptable to sacrifice an innocent person to save a greater number, then I have to apply that consistently across all scenarios.  
That means that even in the extreme case where diverting the trolley would save 4 billion lives at the cost of one, I would still be compelled to say that I cannot in good conscience take that action.  
It's a deeply unsettling and counterintuitive conclusion, one that I struggle with on a visceral level. The idea of allowing half the world's population to die in order to preserve one person's right to life and autonomy is emotionally and intuitively hard to accept.  
But if I'm to maintain my commitment to the absolute inviolability of individual rights, I have to be willing to follow that principle to its logical end, even in the most extreme hypotheticals.  
And as you've helped me see, once we open that door, it becomes impossible to establish a consistent and defensible threshold for when such violations are acceptable. Any line we draw will be arbitrary and prone to shifting based on intuition and emotion rather than firm principle.  
So, as difficult as it is to contemplate, I must bite the bullet and say that yes, even in the scenario with 4 billion lives at stake, I would still choose not to divert the trolley.""

**And there we have it.**

**It seems the only action that would not result in any logical inconsistencies in a moral framework would be to leave the track undiverted.**

The debate of using either slugs or birdshot for home defense is a totally different topic that I may or may not address in a future post.*

Why 1 buck? When 1 buck pellets are traveling at about 1150 FPS, which is a bit on the low end for buckshot velocity, you can get about 14.5” to 15” of average penetration per buckshot pellet in ballistics gel, even at distances of up to 25 yards. They make 1 buck shells in both 12 and 20 gauge and while it is incredibly rare to find buckshot loads for .410 bore other than 000 buck, you could definitely reload a 410 shell for 1 buck if you have the equipment for it.

On the other hand, 00 buck can penetrate up to 18 inches or so in ballistics gel, where you can have concerns for overpenetration even if you hit your intended target. When a buckshot load doesn’t zip right through a human body and instead delivers all of its energy into a human target with little to no pass through, it has the potential to be much more devastating than having wasted energy break right through a human target and still have enough energy to do serious harm to whatever is behind the original target.

So unless you live in a place where a home invasion by a grizzly bear is about as likely as a home invasion by a human, or, you live in a house with distances longer than 25 yards, 1 buck is usually a better choice. Most American living spaces are in close proximity to neighbors and 10 yards is usually the maximum distance you would have to work with, with 5 yards or less being even more common.

I don’t want anyone to feel like they can’t consume a classic TV show or Movie because it degrades them, but I do feel like people should have the choice to consume the media, wether it is offensive or hurtful. I think this censorship fails to accomplish the goal it sets out to achieve. This would be like editing out the horrifyingly grotesque passages in Nabokov’s “Lolita” - it would completely change the fundamental point of the novel, which in my opinion is to make the reader form their own opinion of the heinous actions that are committed within it."

I am not against sex work, I just wouldn’t want that in my partner. I am very shy and reserved when it comes to anything regarding intimacy and dating someone whose sexual activities are out there online for the whole world to see is not something I would be comfortable with.

 I think we talk way too much and too openly about sex to begin with. As far as I’m concerned, sex is a private activity between two people and I don’t wanna know about it or see it. I’m not even liking porn anymore for that reason.

Before anything asks, I am not religious and I was not raised religious. I just think some things should be kept private and don’t need to be out in public for everyone to see. I wish society in general would tone it down because everything is so depraved and sexualized that it makes sex slightly repulsive and disgusting to think about.

Furthermore there is evidence the cow strain has made it back into birds. This means there is now a reservoir of this cow-adapted and transmissible strain that is for all practical purposes uneradicatable. Given bird migratory patterns, and especially given the USDA and beef industry’s unwillingness to take a hit to the margins and implement proper quarantine methods (or share critical data with the scientific community, or even address the virus by its actual name), it is an inevitability that every state in the union, and quite possibly the continent and globe, will have this strain endemically and in good quantity. 

This strain will have no shortage of hosts as there are millions of cows in the US. From there natural selection will likely guide it to increased virulence in this reservoir. Furthermore, its presence in cows presents it with ready access to humans and, crucially, pigs (due to them being a mixing vessel for bird and mammalian viruses), giving it ample opportunity to evolve into us as a niche. 

There are millions of pigs in the US. The conditions in factory farms are ripe for disease spread. 

Conclusion: The circumstances surrounding the emergence of bird flu in cattle is terrible, terrible, terrible news and the only reason the alarm is not being rung louder is because of the desire to preserve animal agriculture profits. This manufactured nonchalance makes the situation worse since now appropriate public safety warnings and industry precautions are not being taken. Bird flu is an incredibly lethal disease in humans. The ramifications could be black death levels of bad, as those who have been monitoring the mass of bird deaths around the world in recent years have seen. We are nigh on screwed Black Death style and everyone is just whistling along. "

But throughout all of the posts I’ve seen on various social media platforms, I’ve never seen this particular point regarding this topic brought up: disorders of sexual development. I am a current medical student and have studied numerous disorders of sexual development, all of which point to the fact that there are people who DO NOT conform to the idea of gender as most people know it (you are either male, or female). For example: 

Klinefelter syndrome: XXY
Turner Syndrome: XO
Androgen insensitivity syndrome: XY but female presenting, with shallow vagina but male internal organs and no uterus.
5-alpha-reductase deficiency: XY but ambiguous external genitalia.

For all of these disorders, there may be a mix of reproductive organs and physical presentations involved that are not quite fully female or male. For anyone who believes there are only 2 genders, how do you characterize individuals with these disorders and MANY others who do not fit these two categories?

Here is what my gut tells me: people can’t exactly conform to anything. There will ALWAYS be people who don’t fit into categories, whether they like it or not."
0,2024-04-21,"CMV: the correct answer to the ""man vs bear"" hypothetical is bear",u/Oishiio42,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c9toq4/cmv_the_correct_answer_to_the_man_vs_bear/,changemyview,"[This](https://www.tiktok.com/@screenshothq/video/7356208240008498465) is the hypothetical question - would you rather be stuck in a forest with a man or a bear, and of course many are flabbergasted by these women choosing the bear, and there's a bit of a trend of women on tiktok defending this choice. The comments are filled with women agreeing, and men insisting women are wrong/lying about their choice. 

I am making a few assumptions here:

* The question is **not** ""which would you rather be attacked by"", just which one you have to share space with
* ""stuck"" doesn't necessarily mean a super intense survivalist plot, just that you cannot immediately leave. Maybe someone just dropped you off for your backcountry camping trip.
* There aren't other people around. So it's not a frontcountry camping site or a popular hiking trail. 
* It's just a random man, not someone you know, and not an identifiable source of help (like a park ranger or the guy driving the tow truck)

I don't see how ""man"" could ever be the correct choice for a woman. Here are the factors I am considering:

* Likelihood to attack - A bear in its natural habitat. Bears don't hunt humans, they actually try to avoid us. So you will most likely not even see the bear, let alone be attacked by it. Even though a minority of men are predatory, it's still magnitudes higher than the % of bears, because almost no bears are. I also think men that would like to attack women are more likely to do it if they can get away with it, which would be true in this environment. 
* Nature of the attack - Although bear attacks are very rare, they are still really predictable. Almost all, including the fatal ones, are ""defensive attacks"" from bears that were surprised, defending their cubs, or defending a food source. It's a one-hit then getting away type of deal. The lethal ones are usually grizzlies, just because their one-hit is so powerful. We can safely assume that if a man is willing to attacking you in the woods, he's motivated by something a lot more nefarious
* Likelihood to survive the attack - bear attacks are actually survivable. In 2022, there were 26 in Canada, and only 4 resulted in death. That's an 85% chance of survival even in the rare event you are attacked. 
* Even if you consider the most likely result (ie. nothing bad happened), it still makes more sense to pick the bear. For the bear - you probably do not even see the bear, but if you do, you were probably really excited for a couple minutes viewing it from a distance. The bear doesn't approach you and you do not see it again. You look back on it as the highlight of your trip. For the man - you probably will see him, because if you're in the woods, it's probably some backcountry camping spot you'll both be at and then congrats, you're now his entertainment for the evening. And since she doesn't know him, she doesn't know his intentions are pure, and she will be anxious about that the whole time. Idk about you all but when I go camping it's not for company. I'd rather get a cool picture of a bear than deal with someone intruding on my space.

So what am I missing? What possible reason could there be to pick the man over the bear? If any women would pick the man, why?

Free speech is allowing other people to say something that you dont like. Reddit's policy is to say no to hate speech, but the definition of hate speech is interpreted by moderators and Reddit itself. Hate speech is also subjective: why, for example, is hating on conservatives or right wing politicians not considered hate speech? Because, again, it is really subjective. 

Labelling critics and complaints on other religions (like Islam), on trasgenderism, on migrants (and so on) as hate speech impairs automatically free speech. This is dangerous because it because Reddit and its moderators are giving the right to expression to people that think like them.

 You dont think like me? You are a far right fascist and we ban you. Such logic is often used by left-wing parties in Europe. For example, Germany left-wing parties want to ban Alternative für Deutschland, which is labelled by the media and politicians as a far right party (implying they are Nazis). (I hope that Germans are not so stupid to believe that). They want to do this to ""save democracy"", how funny. 

The same retoric goes with Reddit: banning users and their opinions to keep Reddit a safe place for discussion (in other words pushing a certain way of thinking and not allowing some people to say what they think). Isnt that contradictory? 


I understand that saying ""all ni**ers are inferior"" is hate speech and should be banned. But criticizing , let's say black people relating to the example), for something, even if generalized, is not hate speech and should not be banned. The same goes with religion and so on. We should try to protect freedom of expression instead of limiting it in name of hate speech. It is so important that it is also guaranteed in every western Constitution. 

Limiting free speech is so dangerous. Think of it. When you are angry and you cant say what you feel (in a polite way obviously) you get even angrier, this will lead to extremism. Then yes.. you will see the real hate speech. Pushing a political narrative and prevent others to criticize it (like Alternative für Deutschland criticizes immigration) will make people feel even more angry because they dont feel listened.

There is no justification for preferring to date one race over the other without it being racist. Cultural preferences I can get around to but crossing off an entire race? 

Racial dating preferences are based on stereotypes, generalizations, or prejudices about other races. When people exclude potential partners based on race without considering individual qualities, interests, or character, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reinforces racial inequalities. It can also contribute to the marginalization and devaluation of certain racial groups, reducing individuals to mere racial categories rather than seeing them as unique human beings.

Additionally, there is so much diversity in features among different races? So no reason to exclude if you prefer a specific feature. Also, can we stop acting like preferences of certain features come from a vacuum? We have preferences based on upbringing, teaching, societal expectations, etc. So it makes no sense to say ‘I just like what I like’ sorry my friend, in one way or another you’ve been conditioned to like what you like. You aren’t special and are susceptible to influence by media and peers lol. 

I’m in the U.S. so race does play more of a factor here I suppose, but I challenge it as racism does exist globally. But moreso xenophobia, tribalism, colorism, etc. Eh idk maybe all the above actually. That’s beside the point haha, but I think race has impacted my dating life as a black girl. It was extremely isolating in a predominantly white community. Where even black people preferred every other race but black people, where you had to ask yourself before allowing yourself to crush on someone, ‘does this person even date black girls?’. And then those same types of dudes come back later to admit they liked you but were too scared because of social pressure. Oh not to mention the amount of fetishization you get because you’re seen as an expriment since you’re not the preferred. I just hope no other black girl has to ever go through that after I leave this earth. It’s so stupid, and so racist yet acceptable and I can’t believe it.

0,2024-04-21,CMV: High body count does not mean someone is low-value,u/AlbertPiggy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c9wvq6/cmv_high_body_count_does_not_mean_someone_is/,changemyview,"There are multiple arguments I've seen online about why body count matters, and I think they all have flaws. 

**1. ""Ran through""**

One argument I have seen online is that a women gets ""ran through"", or used up. I think this premise in itself has flaws. What about her is getting used up? Is it the physical aspect? Getting ""looser""? Because that has been scientifically debunked already. 

**2. Double standards**

Another argument I commonly see is that women are the only ones who have to keep their body count low. Men don't have to. A women is getting ""ran through"", a man is ""running through"". 

I don't know how to counter this argument because I already disagree with its premise. In terms of sex, men and women both partake in it equally, and should share the ""consequences"" (I am arguing that the shame of body count should not be one of those consequences). People using the phrases ""ran through"" and ""running through"" as a gotcha need to define the terms, as I think those phrases already have certain connotations that are wrong, in my opinion. 

**3. ""If someone murders in the past, they can't say 'I'm not a murderer anymore'. Same with women. If she has a high body count, she can't say 'I'm not a hoe anymore.'""**

To me, this analogy is flawed. Murder is an objectively horrible action. To commit it means there is something wrong with your character. However, I would argue that sex isn't an objectively horrible action. It can happen from many different circumstances. I think most people would agree that having sex with someone that you love and trust a lot isn't an objectively bad thing. What if those instances of sex were purely what made up a girl's body count? Would that body count still be considered shameful? 

If so, then how was she supposed to decide when to not have sex? The body count argument centers around a woman ""saving herself for the right person."" But what if she thought someone was the right person, and decided to have sex with them, but it didn't work out? What if that happens twice? Or three times? Is she still considered a hoe?

I think most people would agree that rape doesn't go towards body count. Because she didn't choose to have sex, so it doesn't reflect on her character. What if she was manipulated into it? For example, a man made it seem like he loved her, so they agree to have sex, and then he leaves. It was consensual, the woman agreed to it. Is she still a hoe? And if so, what should she have done differently to not be a hoe? How can she choose not to be manipulated?

The whole point of these situations is to try to challenge the premise that choosing to have sex is a bad reflection of your character. Like I said previously, sex can arise out of a multitude of circumstances. Not all of them say something bad about a woman's character. Not all of them reflect hoe behavior. 

**4. The past matters**

To be honest, this is fair if you believe this. As long as you don't hold double standards, I'm okay with anyone not dating anyone they don't want to date. However, I am just hoping to maybe change a few minds with this argument. 

I think that a lot of the argument for body count is that giving into temptation reflects badly on a woman. 

What if women started judging men for if they watched porn in the past? I think most men who are reading this sentence have watched porn in the past. Maybe you were using it normally, casually, it doesn't mean anything. Right? You know it's probably not a good thing, but it's not hurting anyone. It's just something you do. It's normal. Everybody does it. It doesn't seem that bad to you. But it doesn't matter. At least, in the body count argument, it doesn't matter. You should've known that you weren't allowed to watch it. And even if you've been clean for years, you're still considered a pervert for watching it. Because past matters. Because you couldn't resist temptation for doing something you didn't even view as that bad. 

  
Thank you for reading this to the end. To address any ad hominem arguments if they come up, I don't have a body count. I'm not a hoe trying to cope. I just see a ton of these ideas on my social media feed, and it just made me want to write something about my opinions on why it doesn't make sense.

One more thing, I think it's fair to consider body count as a red flag in a relationship. In fact, I consider it a red flag too. But I don't think it's fair to see them as low-value because of a number with no context behind it. "

But I realize most people only consider terminal illnesses or permanent immobility to be “worthy” of biting the bullet. I argue that the inability to properly communicate to the standards of yourself or society is almost as bad of a predicament.

We literally need relationships to live fulfilling lives. Stuttering, stumbling over words, awkward cadence/intonation, low wittiness, forgetting words, etc all impede the flow of conversation, and will ultimately lower both the quality and quality of your relationships.

I think of addiction as more ""your life revolves around using this drug"" while dependency is more ""you depend on this drug to enjoy life/be happy"". 

Addiction I definitely think warrants some kind of intervention, if you are in a state where life would be complete agony without having whatever drug you're hooked on in your system then that's not an ideal way of living at all. However, if life is overwise pretty ""meh"" but manageable and if, for example, smoking weed or having some wine at the end of a long day is what helps you get through the day happy and improves your quality of life, doesn't impair you in a way that would endanger others, you accept the health and other risks that come with it and you can afford the habit, then I don't see why dependency should be stigmatized.

2,2024-04-21,CMV: Death by firing squad should be legalized,u/SenorPelle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ca16gz/cmv_death_by_firing_squad_should_be_legalized/,changemyview,"The debate over capital punishment has long been a contentious issue, with various methods of execution sparking ethical, legal, and religious considerations. One such method, death by firing squad, presents a unique set of arguments both for and against its legalization. In this essay, we will explore multiple reasons why death by firing squad should be considered for legalization.

Firstly, cost-effectiveness is a significant factor to consider. Firing squads can be a more financially efficient method of execution compared to alternatives such as lethal injection. The latter requires expensive drugs and extensive medical supervision, making it economically burdensome for governments and taxpayers. Legalizing firing squads could alleviate some of these financial pressures associated with capital punishment.

Reliability is another crucial aspect. Unlike methods like lethal injection, which can result in botched executions due to drug shortages or improper administration, firing squads are generally considered more reliable and swift. This reliability ensures a more humane and efficient process for carrying out capital punishment, minimizing the potential for prolonged suffering. Historical precedent also lends weight to the argument for legalizing death by firing squad. Throughout history, firing squads have been utilized in various cultures and legal systems as a means of execution. This historical precedent provides a foundation for considering firing squads as a legitimate method of carrying out capital punishment in modern times.

Furthermore, some proponents argue for the deterrent effect of death by firing squad. The public nature and perceived brutality of this method may serve as a stronger deterrent to potential criminals compared to other forms of execution. The prospect of facing a firing squad could dissuade individuals from committing heinous crimes, thereby contributing to public safety. Religious considerations play a significant role in the debate as well. In certain religious traditions, death by firing squad may be viewed as an acceptable or even honorable form of execution. For example, some interpretations of Islamic law permit execution by firing squad, accommodating the religious beliefs and practices of individuals facing capital punishment.

Additionally, offering choice and autonomy to the condemned is a crucial ethical consideration. Legalizing death by firing squad would provide individuals facing execution with an alternative method, allowing them to exercise autonomy over their fate. This option may align more closely with personal, religious, or cultural beliefs, enhancing the dignity of the condemned. In conclusion legalizing death by firing squad is multifaceted, encompassing economic, ethical, legal, and religious dimensions. While proponents highlight factors such as cost-effectiveness, reliability, historical precedent, deterrent effect, and religious considerations, opponents raise valid concerns about human rights and the potential for wrongful convictions. Any decision regarding the legalization of firing squads must be made with careful deliberation, taking into account the complex moral and practical implications of capital punishment."
0,2024-04-21,CMV: cannabis should not be legalised and people caught using it should be incarcerated,u/Affectionate_Lion470,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ca19mr/cmv_cannabis_should_not_be_legalised_and_people/,changemyview,"i'm seeing everyone around me excited to legalise it, and i've tried to understand the other pov but i just feel like i am left with unanswered questions. anyway these are my reasons:

1. weed is harmful, straight up. at the end of the day it is a drug. it messes up your functioning like alcohol and cocaine and other drugs. like there's a reason you cant take it and then go driving, or let children have it. it is a carcinogen and highly addictive, decays the brain by killing brain cells and causing memory loss and reduced brain functioning. also smoking it will damage your lungs. it is illegal for a reason, and yes i know the gov wanted to target poc but still its a drug and damaging. 

anytime i hear people say 'but weed is very beneficial for health it is used in medicine its not addictive its good for anxiety and depression there's no evidence it can kill you' i just hear a massive cop out for justifying drug addiction. think of how many more drug addicted people this campaign will make? all the drug addicted parents who can't be present for their children. 

and yes other stuff can kill you, caffeine is a drug that can kill you why cant that be illegal? because if i drink a cup of coffee i wont start screaming and acting like a junkie on crack. there really isn't enough evidence to say its safe, so why make it more available?

  
2. if weed were to be legalised, then everybody is going to start doing it and damage their health and functioning more. everyone will be buying it from dispensaries more commonly and get high all the time. it will be normalised to be doing FUCKING HARD DRUGS. next it will be heroin, they will say the exact same thing and say 'well heroin is used in xyz and they targeted poc which is why its illegal'. my partner showed me statistics saying that making something illegal means more people will do it more dangerously, but i can't understand how it is in human nature for people to be okay to break the law for such short pleasures.

hypothetically if alcohol was made illegal tomorrow, then the average person would think ""it's not worth going out of my way to get illegally smuggled alcohol and break the law and possibly get sent to jail and ruin my reputation and career and family etc? no, most people do not care about substances that much that they are willing to break the law. why would more people do something if its illegal?



3. if you don't want to get sent to jail, don't commit the crime, it is simple as that. if you have to be that dependent on drugs that you can't function properly then you deserve to go to jail and be put away from the drugs. someone on drugs is a risk to society and themselves. not taking drugs could have prevented them from going clinically insane, or getting behind the wheel and killing an innocent family inside the car they just t-boned into, or picking up a weapon to kill someone/themselves, or destroy the loved ones around them.



4. instead of putting money into a legalise it campaign, why don't we use the money to make early intervention campaigns and educate people to NOT DO IT IN THE FIRST PLACE instead of encouraging people to do it because it's supposedly safe now? and i think there should be law enforcement, because it's the police's job to make sure people do the safe and right thing. don't want to get in trouble with them? don't do the crime. 

and why can't governments put more effort into bigger problems like domestic violence or cost of living or the housing crisis? it's because everyone is hedonistic and wants short term pleasures to keep them going, like the greedy people they are. 

  
also, i firmly believe that alcohol and cigarettes should also be illegal too for all the same reasons, there shouldn't be a double standard. it was the government's mistake to only make weed illegal back in the 60's or whenever. "

Does it really make sense to allow people to accumulate money and assets without restrictions?

For a person with average income, it would take THOUSANDS of years in order to accumulate what some people have today. That is, if that said person saved every penny they earned, they worked 24/7 without rest or sleep, and there was no change in the money value.

Yet, here we are.

Does it make sense for one person to have that much power? The power of the wealth os millions of average people? To use and abuse in a whimp?

At the same time there are millions of people that live paycheck to paycheck. Or don't even know if they will have enough food for the next week.

Does this make sense to you?

I arguably think that it doesn't. Not from a moral standpoint nor from a resource management one.

That being said, I understand the usefulness of using people selfishness against them selfs (aka capitalism). We should keep this system in place but with some upper bound.

Make it any value you want. From 10 times the average wealth of a person to 1000 times. It can be high at first and then adjust it to more sensible levels.

The best example is the hostages in Israel. The families of the hostage *demand* that the government release 1000's of dangerous terrorists so that a 130 randos don't die. I understand completely why they do this but they're still actively telling the country it should help it's adversaries for their personal benefit. It's like if you told Biden to give over secret US intel to China and give you 5 million dollars. And if the deal goes through y'know what'll happen. Another kidnapping another October 7th.

The Fundamental problem with this thinking is that you're avoiding larger long term benefits to avoid short term losses. And eventually that long term will become the present and that price will be do and it won't be worth it. 

Obviously there is a limit to how much you should be willing to suffer short term for long term gains but  countries set their short term pain maximum to zero and then are shocked when their short sighted decisions bite them in the ass later."

Contemporary examples are abundant I.e. Trumpists and Progressives. 

Both often claim to be representing the ""people"" against corrupt ""elites"" but their concept of people does not actually exist, never really has, and super doesn't exist in modern industrial countries with diverse demographics.

It really annoys me when I see populist commentators claiming to represent the people when they're espousing minority positions that the vast majority of their country doesn't agree with. These same actors other people who diverge from them as the ""enemy"" or ""elites"" further dividing the populace along sectarian lines. 

It stinks of arrogance, a complete lack of political humility and atomizes whatever the ""people"" are for their own ends leading to violence. We have seen this play out in history.

Broad mass movements of the ""people"" in history almost invariably degenerate into sectarian violence and power struggles between different demographic groups once the unifying enemy power structure of the ""elites"" is destroyed

This isn't inherently a good or bad thing but serves to show how the concept of the ""people"" is fictitious

But so many people engage with politics in this manner.  Taking the epistemic validity and assumed broader appeal of their positions as a given.

Populism seems so obviously stupid to me. Political energy should be about creating a specific articulate vision people can join, rather than political actors claiming the support of those people as implicit."

Many liberals criticize China for persecuting Uyghurs yet they don't even care about Uyghurs in the first place. They just criticize the CCP because they want to virtue signal.

Homo sacer

Outlawry

The reason for this are as follows,

Scamming as previously mentioned most often takes place across borders making inforcement difficult

It degrades the trust in one another leading to a lower trust society due to the amount of scamming in the modern world

It is highly profitable leading to enough money for paying off officials making inforcement in countries less likely

By making them legally pirates anyone at any time could interfer in there operation in any manner they choose (arson, assult, DDOS'ing them, etc) so long as they have proof of there scamming

I do want to clarify this is most definitly not ideal ideally there would be good international cooperation and mass arrests and massive fines however internet scams have been going on 30 years now and we have not seen it get better and with the rise of AI it has arguably gotten worse with no clear sign of stopping it, this is an established albeit old solution which has was mostly abandoned and only due to the rise of insurace companies and gun and missile control in ports as wrll as shrinking crew sizes.

0,2024-04-22,"CMV: There is no such thing as a ""God-given"" (or ""basic"") human right.",u/HelpfulJello5361,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ca6gy7/cmv_there_is_no_such_thing_as_a_godgiven_or_basic/,changemyview,"Whenever people talk about ""rights"", I always assumed they meant ""rights"" in the legal sense. Like, ""As human members of this nation, we decree that X thing is a *right.* That means that in our society, we construct the law in such a way that violating this *right* is punishable by law.""

None of this presupposes that any rights are somehow innate to a human being by their mere virtue of existing. I was actually quite taken aback when I learned that there are people who genuinely believe that a human born in any place in the world is having their rights violated if they don't own their own home, for example.

I always assumed that saying ""god-given right"" or some variation thereof was just a poetic notion, like ""*In our opinion* this is such an important concept that we will say it's 'god-given'. In the same way that people who aren't religious might say ""I swear to god!"". It's just a figure of speech. That's what I thought the deal was.

I was especially surprised to learn that many people on the left side of the spectrum believe this, too, since many of them are not religious, and to me the idea of a ""god-given right"" is innately a religious concept. I mean obviously, it has ""god"" in the name.

It seems obvious to me that humans are animals. We might be unique compared to other animals due to our intelligence, but we are still only animals (again, unless you're religious, in which case you think humans are favored by god). The point is, animals don't have rights. When a baby turtle is hatched from its shell with 100 of its siblings, they have to make a trip to the ocean, and a lot of them don't make it. They get snatched up and eaten by predators. Hell, a lot of them don't even get to be born since predators eat the eggs.

So it's pretty obvious that animals don't have god-given rights, or if they do, there are hundreds of millions of violations of animal rights every day all over the world by other animals, including humans, since animals prey on each other constantly and do things to each other that if humans did it to each other, would be considered a horrific and grotesque crime.

Anyway, it seems to me that there is no such thing as a ""natural"" right. There are only hierarchical systems of power and resource distribution. And without these systems there would be no civilization.

If you point to things like health care, housing, and food and say they're ""basic human rights"", that's a problem because it clashes with the natural order of the world, particularly the fact that we live in a world of **scarce resources**. Is there inequality in society? As with every civilization in human history, yes. That's how the chips fall. But we can't say that scarce resources are a basic human right, because civilization collapses if that's the case. There aren't enough resources to go around. Star Trek replicators would be rad, but sadly we live in reality.

Ultimately I'm wondering why people think natural/basic/god-given rights are a thing. I'm especially interested in why non-religious people think so.

I have ADHD and have always struggled with traditional methods of school. I hated the necessarily bureaucratic mess and bs that came with it. For example, when I was in college last time, a professor insisted on arranging our seating alphabetically. I have hearing and vision issues. I did not learn a single thing, and the control-obsessed professor would not give accommodation. Teachers who are so uncharismatic, that anyone will fall asleep. Another problem is all the wasted time in classes, substitute teacher days, unnecessary activities, pacing issues (too fast/too slow), etc. Just a few of many, I won't ramble about them all. I did not have the patience for all these things.

  
I've been relying on tools like Brilliant, audiobooks, and using professionally produced video courses from sites like Udemy/Skillshare to teach myself. Cuts through all the bs, gets to the point, is entertaining, portable, can be paused/unpaused/replayed/skipped/viewed anywhere, and is so simple that a baby who can't talk yet will understand. I've learned subjects that took an entire semester in just a week or two. I've learned about subjects that would have taken an entire year(divided in to two classes in two semsters) within a month or two. As for tutoring/practice, tools have automated environments, some powered by AI, to tutor and test you very efficiently

There are times when I hit a wall, and I have to ask for help from a teacher and these tools simply can't fix the issue, but these occasions don't justify mandatory hours-long lectures and all the excess fat that comes with it. Students should be free to come in for assistance when they hit this wall, to solely focus on that issue, and then let them continue progressing without being handheld or leashed. This saves both time and resources.

  
I've used CLEP Tests to get credit for classes without taking them. If I can't test out I just do all the work as quick as I can, if they let me. I've been able to skip most of the attendance requirements if did all the work in advance but some professors insist you do it by the book regardless. The only classes I can't speed run are hands-on classes that are done in workshops/laboratories, and some advanced classes later on can't be done this way at all. Other than those I've given up on all traditional methods for 70% of the classes for my program, and solely rely on modern tools. I believe this 70% will be mostly automated one day.

Firstly, let’s consider preferences and choices. Some people prefer apples over oranges. Some people choose to smoke but not to use drugs. In these examples, we can discern which preference is potentially harmful - the latter. Why? Choosing different fruits does not harm an individual or others, but smoking or using drugs does. Reflect on this for a moment.

Adults understand these differences, but children may not. Why? Their brains are not fully developed, and they have not been exposed to valuable lessons and education. This is why parental guidance is crucial.

Next, let’s consider biology. We know there are natural sexual inclinations and attractions in males and females. This is because biological nature dictates our physical bodies. Female parts are for male parts and vice versa.

Consider this: we know that male-to-male relationships are not biologically compatible for reproduction. They also may not provide role models for children since children should have knowledge of what the opposite sex provides. That’s why it’s crucial for children to learn basic biology and have a correct understanding of the world.

As I mentioned earlier, some argue that certain behaviors are sinful according to religions. Let’s leave religion out of it and stick to what we can prove scientifically and physically. We know there are personal preferences and forced preferences. Forced preferences may result from traumas and forced acceptance. Many homosexuals counter this by saying they have always been like that and were born like that. But that is simply untrue. Babies cannot have preferences. Until they reach the legal age, they cannot form conscious choices like adults can.

Like the examples of apple/orange preferences, you also cannot expect them to change preference because they prefer/choose that. Again, we must not condemn them for what they like, but we also must not let them be delusional about it and say how it is all natural and right. It is also important for everyone to know you cannot force them to change as that would result in unnecessary consequences. It is a reminder to all of you that, it is only you, as an individual who have the power and will to change naturally. Not to mention that once you let this whole thing be part of your identity, you have already lost before you even began!"

Example: if 2 people, one guy and one woman were to fight each other, and they each kick each other in the groin and or butt, it isn’t sexual assault.

Unless the intent is sexual, usually a comment would be slapped on top of that, also I highly doubt some violent powerful kick that would send you crashing to the moon or a wall could be seen as sexual .(unless, again you are a weirdo)

It’s not common to see someone frowning at the French revolution or other insurrections that lead to positive change in the future, but the idea of destroying things or people that harms us nowadays seems distant from reality.

My opinion about why is that we’re educated by media, society and authorities to think everything is solvable through diplomacy alone. Thinking like that makes recursion to violence seem unnecessary, and organizations that make rational use of it would be seem as wrong no matter what benefits their actions may bring.

A great example on how this stigma impacts the way we deal with problems is climate change and the way we’re dealing with it. It is something that’s projected to affect millions of lives in the future and solving it through dialogue alone doesn’t seem to be working a whole lot. Yet the organizations and people who dedicate themselves to combat it do it in a way that negatively impacts more the average person than the ones actually responsible for it. People often criticize those peaceful protests, but it feels like our values restricts them to those fruitless actions unless they want to be seem as barbaric and inherently wrong.

I don’t have a strong connection to eastern media to know what goes on there, but there was the news a while ago about Shinzo Abe’s assassination or more recently some executive who’s gonna take death sentence in Vietnam. It seems they interpret the use of violence a lot differently than we do, and I believe christianity has some blame on that. Western countries have leaned a lot more to the secular side in the last centuries, but it looks like some of the influence religion has on us hasn’t been questioned as much as others.

I’d like to know what would the oppositions to my argument be as it feels like such an edgy/extremist position to have, but maybe it only feels like that because of the societal stigma cited above. Thanks for reading."

It's not about promoting violence; it's about restoring deterrence. Our police force needs the authority to act decisively. Imagine if we had cops like Dirty Harry—officers who don’t hesitate to enforce the law with the backing of a justice system that prioritizes protection of property and safety over the coddling of criminals. Such an approach would send a clear message: crime doesn’t pay.

Being passive in the face of criminal behavior is effectively an indulgence that allows this problem to grow. Without serious consequences, there’s no incentive for change. We need a strong police presence and tougher prosecution policies to reset the boundaries. Only then can we hope to reclaim our cities from lawlessness and restore public confidence in our urban centers. It's also a disgrace how some leaders in blue cities are saying that retail theft done by minorities is a form of ""reparations"".

Still to this day I think any Arab character I’ve ever seen in popular media has been incredibly inaccurate or racist.  I think people veiw the Arab countries as too much of a controversial subject to put into media as a main character hero or protagonist. Anytime Americans see depictions of Arab culture their brain Immidiatly associates it with war, terrorism, and Islamophobia. No positive depictions of Arab people in popular media is only continuing the anti Arab narrative. When I was in middle school I had people classmates asking me and my siblings if we were a part of ISIS. Positive Arab representation would help squash this racism so fast I feel. I want to have my opinion changed because I would love to see some people say examples of accurate Arab representation that I’ve never seen before. But I have never seen any therefore it’s my opinion. 

Some caviats: 

1. I am specifically talking about popular western media so projects made by the USA/canada/europe not films that were made in Arab countries
 
2. I am not saying I hate the original Alladin but as much as I loved it as a kid it is incredibly flawed and their “representation” is just racist stereotypes. I have a lot of beef with the alladin live action remake because they put no effort into making it actually representative of Arab countries and cultures and characters so I just count that movie as a tasteless cash grab with no actual attempt to do any proper representation.

3. Indian/East Asian films and shows don’t count. I am specifically talking about Arab countries like Lebanon, Iran, Egypt, Morocco for example. I want to give Ms. Marvel kudos for being really good Muslim and Pakistani representation but I can’t count it in this because I’m talking about Arab in particular. 


The closest thing I’ve seen of popular proper Arab representation is Moon Knight. The main charachter isn’t Arab just the setting so I don’t count it. But the Arab music is fire so it gets kudos from me. The work they did to make the setting accurate was enough to make me happy. I want my opinion to be changed because I would LOVEE to see some people put from good Arab representation media in the comments and prove me wrong. In order for it to count, the main character, protagonist, or hero has to be an accurately represented Arab character, preferably in an Arab country or setting. Side characters can also MAYBE change my opinion depending how relevant they are to the media. The whole point is it’s proper representation not just a token Arab character that has zero depth.

0,2024-04-22,"CMV:Cheating is not as bad as society treats it, and being in a toxic relationship at all reflects your own character",u/Solidjakes,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1caeor1/cmvcheating_is_not_as_bad_as_society_treats_it/,changemyview,"In general, healthy people attract other healthy people into their lives. Anytime you were sitting there complaining about something your partner did to you, you're basically complaining about your own poor judgment. Your partner is an extension of you and a reflection of you. Your partner is a living, breathing, walking testament to the quality of your character. It always takes two people to have drama. This is for the same reason that having a healthy fantastic partner is something to be proud of. It's a statement saying ,""this healthy awesome person chose me and wants to spend their time around me, which means I am also healthy awesome and pleasant to be around."" 

Cheating is often a form of lying, so I'm not defending that action or saying that person is exonerated of moral responsibility. You shouldn't mislead people, of course. But really think about the totality of the situation, and how mature healthy people deal with conflict.

I've been cheated on before by a person I still over all respect and think is a great person. We cordially split up wishing each other the best. We understand that life is messy and mistakes can be made. It could have been drama filled and I could have whined to everyone else around me and painted that person as a monster, but why would I do that? There are things I could have done differently (yes even as the ""victim"" of cheating), things she could have done differently, and even just an element of nature. Two human beings tried to interact naturally with each other and it just wasn't the right fit. 

If finding out you were cheated on ruins the whole person's character for you, I would argue your love was shallow to begin with. You only love that person for how they love you back. It's a selfish ego filled love, not genuinely being impressed with the person (what they do and say in public, how they think) and wanting the best for them and hoping that happens to be a life with you. 

Imagine you are dating someone who is volunteering at homeless shelters and saving up to retire their grandparents. Imagine this person says and does the right thing 99% of the time, then they mess up and didn't realize they weren't over their ex. They tell you and you'll go your separate ways. 

Or even if they're more manipulative and sociopathic, how could you end up not catching that when you spend so much time with them? Is your judgment of character that bad, are they that good at lying? Did you listen to your friends and family when they told you their impression of that person and whether or not to trust them? Is there no accountability you can take as a sovereign being choosing another being to be with? Your discernment in choosing your other half? One of the most valuable and prestigious roles you can assign a person in your life? The one family member you get to pick, unlike all of the other ones you were born into?

If you are young and naive, sure. You get a slight pass on handling situations that hurt your ego in a mature way, or identifying low quality people. But by the time you are in you are a full adult, I think people should really understand how embarrassing it is to be complaining about a toxic relationship. Almost every bad thing you say about them, you're basically saying that about yourself.

We are always growing and learning from our experiences. You can still make mistakes even when you're older and misread someone. It's the painting them as the villain and monster I think that shows a lack of big picture awareness and maturity. Take the lessons life just gave you, and move on and do better next time. And feel free to acknowledge that pain and talk about what you're going through with other people that you love. It goes back to the Serenity prayer. If you really did everything right and there was nothing you could have done to predict that betrayal, then the guilt and shame burden is on the other person. They have to live with themselves. Your conscience is free and clear. You did great in that relationship. And you'll eventually get the right partner naturally just by being a high quality person. Someone will match your energy.

There are lots of meme subreddits where people just swap out the text. Is this real art? No one seems to be threatened by other non-art images that are entertaining.

I'd also like to say that reports that AI art steals from real artists are just not true. That isn't how generative AI works. It is a digital brain that looks at many examples to learn the fundamentals of what makes a sensible image and how these elements are described by language. If your claim is that it uses real art, so it is stealing, you have to then agree that all human artists also do this and are equally guilty.

The model uses what it has seen to make brand new ideas. Geoffrey Hinton and other experts have said that AI models are capable of and demonstrate real creativity. They're neural networks. They work just like a biological brain from a functional perspective. I don't think this means they are alive or conscious; but they have borrowed functionality from brains.

I can make an ai gen post that is wildly popular and entertains a lot of people and gets a ton of upvotes, but some people will post angry replies about how it is really bad. Sure it'll mess up faces and make a lot of kinds of errors humans don't make, but is it ""bad""? Can you always even tell if an image is AI generated? I'd say you can't ALWAYS tell. A really good gen can look completely photorealistic.  I'd even bet a lot of these people saw the image, thought it was cool, then zoomed in and saw an error and realized the whole image is now ""bad"".  I notice that these people weren't popping in to tell us all the gens were bad in 2015 when deepdream was making weird crap. It is only now that it's getting good that it's making them angry.

0,2024-04-22,CMV: It is immoral to own more than one single-family home.

The cost of housing is ridiculously high and young people are facing incredible difficulties towards purchasing their first home. While they aren't the only reason why housing is expensive, housing speculators and certain landlords are a significant factor in exacerbating the problem.  

When an individual purchases a single-family home as an ""investment"" they're engaging in immoral hoarding behaviour. It's not wrong to acquire things that are valuable, but when you hoard a finite resource that others need but are finding it increasingly difficult to acquire, that is wrong. I think we'd all be angry if someone bought up the majority world's supply of insulin in a shortage and only would sell it for sky-high prices. Same idea here with housing. These landlords are not creating value (and it's even worse if they keep an investment property vacant). 

As a result, the just action from a legal/policy perspective is to make it illegal to own more than one home. And corporations should not be allowed to own single-family homes as this is just a workaround. And I think this policy is already incredibly generous. 

Some might say that a household shouldn't be allowed to own more than one home. But good legislation should err on the side of caution when enacting laws that affect individual rights, so one home per individual person is a good balance. Consider a standard family of four that's very affluent. They would still be allowed to own their family home in the suburbs (let's say in dad's name), a vacation home (let's put this in mom's name), let's say a occasional use property in in downtown core that a parent sleeps in when they work late during the week (registered to kid 1). They would still be allowed to register a ""investment"" property that's registered to kid 2. 

Caveat: I will acknowledge it's different if a person buys, say, a freehold house and turns it into a fourplex. They've created more housing there. Or say a developed buys a block of houses and tears them all down to build a condo or purpose-built rental high-rise. That also has created more homes and more value. I'm for allowing exceptions in these cases. Carve-outs should allow those who create value in housing to be rewarded. However, say a developer has bought a house and has not successfully built more housing in 5 years, the government should seize the property and give them their money back plus a minor sum of money equivalent to inflation (so a poor investment return). The government should then sell the home on the open market to a potential buyer (who doesn't own a home already).

Mandating a quick, basic, easily accessible ""current politics"" test, then, would not only help avoid personal regrets and unwelcome surprises (“I didn’t know x was going to do this, otherwise I would never have voted for them!”), but is (in my opinion, most importantly) the responsible and forward-thinking decision for everyone else. 


We don't want people voting for whomever it is they vote for arbitrarily, or because it’s what people around them are doing; it's a singularly important, impactful decision, and we should respect it as the serious ideological endorsement that it is. If you are too ignorant, too uninterested to legitimately know who and what you’re voting for, then you shouldn’t be granted the prerogative at all; this is particularly true of herd-mentality politics in the USA nowadays (of which both parties are culpable), which is actually what inspired me to write this in the first place. 

I was initially wary of the potential practicality problem of such a test, but upon further reflection, I don’t think it would be too hard to implement. The test would be multiple choice, and questions would be objective (obviously), and straightforward, like “Which of the following pieces of legislation did x pass whilst in office?” or “How has x campaigned on y issue?”.

0,2024-04-22,CMV: Sexbots should primarily be for monster-fuckers,u/The-Cosmic-Ghost,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cahy41/cmv_sexbots_should_primarily_be_for_monsterfuckers/,changemyview,"So this is something that I've been thinking about  since talks of sex bots became popular. On the corner of internet I'm on, a lot of people have pretty wacky ""hear me out"" characters, and I'm sat here thinking, ""why are we wasting A.I on trying to make hyper-realistic sexbots with big tiddies and perfect faces with when this is the ideal opportunity to cater to an audience with a way bigger imagination.""
There are many people that would pay GOOD money to get dicked-down and turned into a pretzel by cthulhu or a klingon or that guy with eyes on his hands. And we were all there when people were simping over venom so i dont need to elaborate on him. Heck im sure someone out there would have fun with a bot based off of the ones from austin powers, tiddy cannons and all. Gag gifts (no pun intended) where you choose if the bot has dicks for hands or hands for dicks. Not to mention, if you're making monster sex bots, you dont have to worry much about objectifying and/or dehumanizing groups of people because there are no humans to dehumanize.
Finally, it's probably cost effective if you have a base model with parts you can swap in or out. And other higher tier models with different types of configurations. Truly monster sex-bots are probably the most ethical and fun way we could go about creating sex bots. But I'm willing to have my mind changed."
0,2024-04-22,CMV: The modern taboo against incest is primarily based on eugenics,u/Alone_Tie328,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1caijri/cmv_the_modern_taboo_against_incest_is_primarily/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: I am against both incest and generally against eugenics.  
The 2 general modern argument againsts incest are that   
1) There are major power dynamics at play that make consent impossible  
2) Inbreeding is far more likely to result in children with gentic disorders.  
If consent was the primary reason that people were against incest, we wouldn't treat it as a problem in a lot of the situations where it's taboo. If a 25 year old man married a 27 year old woman who he went to high school with, people wouldn't have an issue with it. If they were brother and sister, it's incest and it falls under the incest taboo. (I'm talking about taboo and not law because law is harder to talk about since different states and countries have different laws.) If two people who never met each other start dating and realize they share a grandparent, it falls under the incest taboo, and would be seen in as negative a light as if they were siblings. I'm not saying that it isn't a reason at all, but clearly it isn't the primary issue. 

That leaves inbreeding. And yeah, if you oppose incest because of genetics reasons, that's eugenics. That's society telling people who they can have sex with with the goal of maintaining desirable heritable traits. Pretty open and shut. I don't like it, but that's the logical reason in the 21st century. I guess religion is another reason, but people who aren't religious still consider it taboo."
0,2024-04-22,CMV: Inheritance is fucking up the world,u/Few-Stretch8035,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1caixtl/cmv_inheritance_is_fucking_up_the_world/,changemyview,"I have a father who's family was torn apart over inheritance, so I may be quite biased. 

He only has one sibling that took his side of ""splitting equally"" out of 7 we still talk to. 
I haven't even ever known my godmothers and godfather because they were in the camp yelling ""we deserve more"" for stupid reasons (like having more kids at the time, living in a more expensive area). 
Note: my father's parents were actually still alive while this discussion carried on and in my father's words ""it killed them emotionally before they even actually got the chance to die"".

Anyway, I was too young to really remember, but I saw a family fall apart by proxy I guess.



This all made me think about inheritance when my parents die. They have done quite well in life so I guess I am going to get profit from this.
This doesn't feel right though, why should I profit from my parents' hard work?
The rich only get richer by inheritance, and it takes money to make money so over generations this can grow exponentially.


Why have we all decided a dead person's money belongs to their kids? In the end it only leads to more division between rich and poor.


Again, I am not complaining. The way it works is in my favour. But when I really think about it, it's not fair, and a massive flaw in our system. "
0,2024-04-22,CMV: All sex should basically be de-stigmatized and normalized. All sexual activity should be legal and accepted,u/solei7,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1caizw2/cmv_all_sex_should_basically_be_destigmatized_and/,changemyview,"I've teetered back and forth on the ""sexual revolution"" question but it has always been clear to me that there's no ""middle ground"" on it. Either basically everything's ok or none of it is. I'm not playing devil's advocate though, I do seriously and earnestly hold that it may well be the case that absolutely everything is ok and should be accepted, though I'm curious to hear arguments to the contrary

___________

We often hear that sex should be desacralized, that previous norms were oppressive (especially towards gays), etc. That sex isn't just this sacred thing you do with a spouse for procreation, it can also be used for casual fun and there's all sorts of ways and methods in which to enjoy it. Slogans like ""love is love"" and ""love don't judge."" People can't choose what they're sexually attracted to and it does them great harm when their desires aren't ""affirmed,"" so tolerance and acceptance should rule the day.

I merely propose that such a principle be taken to its conclusion and followed with consistency. It has always caused me great anger towards people who purportedly support gay rights when they turn around and voice condemnation towards other's sexual behavior that's ""too out there,"" just as gays were once considered. Even on here, you can often see questions like ""what's the weirdest/most disturbing kink you've ever seen"" with all sorts of condemnations and judging going on.

_______________

If love is love, we shouldn't judge, and sex is nothing really sacred or special and just something we can do for pleasure, I would propose the following:

- Laws again all forms of sexual activity would be completely abolished. Not one such law would remain.

- There would be no such law called ""rape,"" because that law makes it sounds like there's something uniquely terrible about the sexual nature of the act. ""rape"" could be punished as assault when done through force, just like any other sort of assault, with no special additional penalties

- Public sex and nudity would be allowed basically anywhere. Sex with anyone and anything at anytime in whatever manner would be legal.

________________

Naturally there could be some areas of concern with this particularly around children (not animals, we eat them and breed them with each other and they have no rights, so of course there's no concern there). Some say that such a policy would endanger children.

But to that it seems to me like there's two possibilities. If there's really nothing sacred about sex and it's just this fun activity people engage in, why should it be treated differently than any other? I know of a man who got arrested for training his young daughter to perform oral sex on him - but if sex is nothing special, why is that any more dangerous to her than ""pranking"" her by having her put something else icky in her mouth? I can't think of anything intrinsically ""harmful"" in the act, at least not one easily explained. If the act is indeed harmful, it would seem to be mostly because society tells the girl that she was ""wronged"" and ""violated"" and ""used"" when she gets older. If we just all stop talking like that and say ""sex is just like any other fun activity you engage in, there's no problem with it,"" then such trauma would not exist.

The other possibility is that such activity *is* somehow intrinsically harmful, because sex really does have this strong power to damage people when used improperly. But if that's the case, it seems like the whole sexual revolution should be thrown out the window? 

If sex leads to problems when used outside of marriage and can cause emotional turmoil due to bonding in such a way with someone who doesn't end up being your spouse, etc, then why should fornication be legal? People try to distinguish based on this ""consent"" thing, which I've always found to be absurd. Who the hell cares about your ""consent?"" Poisons and hard drugs aren't legal just because you ""consent"" to them, and nothing magic happens on your 18th birthday. If sex is this dangerous thing when used improperly, why does your consent matter? Then everything should be illegal that the Pope wouldn't approve of.

But it does seem to me that it's either-or. If we were wrong about sex before and it's this thing we can do for fun, it seems that we have to go all the way.

Nothing specific here about politics, or who is the more justified or the more aggrieved group between Palestinians and Israelis. Both have deep historical traumas. Both have been forcefully removed. Both have committed violence. Both deserve their own state. 

But I'm concerned that the persistence and increase of anti-semitism, targeted violence against Jews, and calls for them to be expelled from various places only further illustrates the point that historically has been proven again and again: non-Jewish states will not protect the Jews and Jews need a state that allows for, indeed requires, Jewish self-determination. 

This isn't a commentary that what Israel is doing is right it wrong, but a conversation about whether the original argument that Zionists made is true: that Jews need their own state because of the failures of others to have them be treated as full equals."

Me and my friend (both 36 year old blokes from England) are not really into gaming. I was making the point to him, that gaming culture is so prolific amongst the younger generation, that we will really struggle to relate to them if we have never engaged in this pastime/art form.

People often forget that the people entering the work force in low level positions now, will in ten years become senior managers, directors and experienced execs.

In the same way boomers struggle to relate with millennial cultural references - TV shows, bands, social media. We will soon be struggling to keep up with references to widely played games.

There will inevitably be cultural references within iconic games that gen Z will be able to laugh about and reference that we will be entirely clueless about.

This will inadvertently damage our ability to network and continue to develop our careers as we become the out of touch dinosaurs of the office.

You could argue this is inevitable, but you can slow the rate of your social obsolesce dramatically by getting into gaming yourself. At least to give you a basic knowledge.

You could also argue that boomers/gen x get along fine without knowing millennial references. Firstly I’d argue they don’t, and inadvertent agism is definitely a thing. Secondly, this is an entirely different media. It’s not just a genre of music or TV we haven’t consumed, it’s an entirely new interactive medium. 

As a consequence, not getting into gaming could hurt your career prospects over the next 20 years. CMV. "

The majority of them refuse to serve in the Israeli military. The couple thousand of Arabs who do serve in the Israeli military tend to be Bedouins - who feel no connection to the Israel/Palestine conflict. 

A lot of them basically live in their own bubble in the Arab-majority towns. They attend different schools and have a different education system. 

Despite accounting for such a large portion of the population, intermarriages between Israeli Arabs and Jews are so rare. 

This just goes to show that while there is co-existence in Israel, it's more like Arab-Israelis living in their own bubble."

I had this conversation with several people and they've told me I'm being entirely unreasonable. So let me give an example: you're out with friends and you see an ice cream shop you like. You don't go there that often and you really enjoy it, you have plenty of time to go. However, your friends DON'T want to get anything there. IMO if you override that consensus and grab the ice cream for yourself, you're breaking a social code. At best, you're ignoring majority opinion and being selfish about your wants. At worst, you look like a total glutton and spendthrift in front of your friends. 

You may think this has to do with societal standards, but I don't think this just goes for dessert-type situations. It'd be the same thing if you and a friend went by a coffee shop and wanted someplace to sit. If you're the only one to buy a coffee, you're definitely being selfish about how you spend time with your friend. What if they wanted to go somewhere else or do something else, but you never even thought to ask them what THEY wanted to do? And don't you look like a caffeine fiend who loves to waste money?"

Just her being on a ship in the the middle of the Artic or whatever is scarily isolating, and it's already been established that she doesn't always wake up accepting of him or their circumstances. She absolutely is not free to do that on a boat. And what a nightmare pregnancy and parenting would be! She will literally never remember her daughter and it's all kinds of fucked up.

Besides that, I don't think the rest of your movie is okay, not perfect, but not non-consenual. But I've heard others say it is, so I'm hoping to understand.

- Her father and brother were lying to her every day and, while protecting her out of their love, they weren't giving her a choice to decide what she wanted. That seems more manipulative to me.

- At first he tried lots of meet cutes, and he already knew her but she didn't. However, he didn't try to manipulate her by using that information. The one time he did, with the waffle house, she was disgusted by his behaviour, and it established early on that she is a fully functional person who will have different days, so each day he will need to get to know her as an actual person. 

- Don't make bets about getting a girl to like you, that's bad and gross.

- With the video, he inserts himself as a person in her life, but doesn't pressure her into forming a connection with him. Her father is the one to say they're kind of dating. She wakes up every day and gets to form her own opinion of him, and then puts it in her diary (that he doesn't Even know about).

- Sex is freely given or declined. Other than the one comment in the car, which was weird on a few levels, he never pressures her or even suggests that they should. She chooses every day how she wants to spend her time, and sometimes they have sex. 

- Sex in the future might be problematic, as I can't speak for every encounter we don't see, but what we do, it seems all consensual.

- She says she wants to cut him out and he goes 'okay'. He helps her, they share a moment, he leaves.

- He comes running back, and we she says he doesn't remember her, he is devastated and looks like he's about to go. No pressuring, just acceptance. She is the one who brings him in and suggests he needs to be in her life.

Let’s get that out of the way. I’m not an Elon worshipper. But so many of the criticisms of him just seem ridiculous to me. It seems like a lot of it is  politically driven, with zero room for nuance. It’s this internet mentality where anyone we hate is 100% evil and we can automatically discredit any good qualities they might have or any of their achievements.

He’s clearly highly intelligent, even if he’s a complete douche. You can’t found/co-found/operate some of the world’s leading companies in several diverse fields while being a complete moron. You can argue that he’s low in emotional intelligence and I  wouldn’t fight back, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t highly intelligent in other ways.

A common counter argument to this is that he was only able to find success in all of these companies because his parents were wealthy from emerald mines (a questionable claim itself, but that’s another story). 

But that’s not how Musk made his fortune. After getting bachelors degrees in physics and economics, Musk founded the company Zip2 and sold it for 300 million. Musk then co-founded and sold PayPal, and used the money from that to found SpaceX, a company that is basically making the best rockets in the world now. He also founded Tesla which is basically THE name in electric vehicles.

Does this sound like a complete moron who is just coasting on his parents’ emerald money? Not to me.  Do I think he’s personally designing the rockets and EVs? Of course not. But it’s just as stupid to claim he had absolutely nothing to do with the success of these companies just because you hate him.  There were plenty of people who had more money than Musk who failed to accomplish the things his companies have, though many have tried.

His handling of X is another story, but one botched business venture doesn’t negate all of the previous things I mentioned. Yes, he’s a douche who seems to be on a downward spiral, but he’s clearly not unintelligent, and he will probably go down in history for what SpaceX and Tesla have achieved."

0,2024-04-22,CMV: Representative democracy does not exist in the UK!! And no one realizes it... when have you ever felt your voice heard,u/LengthDecent9551,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cao0ss/cmv_representative_democracy_does_not_exist_in/,changemyview,"Representative democracy a fundamental core principle of democracy within the UK system, a way in which people can be accurately represented by people of expert knowledge and experience within their constituency. A key aspect that I believe has failed massively.  
Representative democracy seems to undermine its core aspect of respecting the wishes and beliefs of the people over anything, public opinion unfortunately cannot be translated into parliament and has no weight on law-making.  As shown in November 2023 where the largest protest to ever take place in the UK where over 1 million people attended and marched through London to call for a ceasefire for Palestine.  Instead of working with the public as their voice was loud and strong for what their belief was. Ministers instead called these “hate marches” as famously said by Suella Braverman and even going as far to call it Islamic jihadist march as said by Lee Anderson, creating a bigger divide between a minister and the public, the main duty of a minister is to serve the public but not yourself. The British still abstained from ceasefire votes in UN resolutions outraging the public. This divide will only lead to people not trusting their ministers and having a view that these ministers are sleezy thus representative democracy cannot work without trust in their representative.   
  
The British state is becoming much more authoritarian citizens are being restricted on what they can say, voices are selectively heard, peoples rights are being heavily undermined. Public Order Act 2023 which the government can arrest protestors that are deemed “disruptive to key national infrastructure” or “obstructing major transport work” under the sleezy name of Public Order to imply that this act was made to things like anti social behaviour or criminal behaviour while in reality it undermines the basics human rights to a peaceful protest, such as no longer being able to march outside parliament, or go on strikes without a criminal conviction. Then further enhanced by the Rwanda Bill and Illegal Migration Act too, basically gives the government incredible power to deport anyone they deem to arrive illegally it’s a severe breach of rights as they do not adhere to the European convention of Human Rights, and it seems Keir Starmer doesn’t care or is interested about reversing this trend the conservatives set out. The UK is de-facto authoritarian state crucially.  
Lastly, parliaments system is dramatically largely flawed! The whip system I believe does more harm then good; the point of an MP is so they can represent their constituency in parliament, if their constituency doesn’t agree on what party lines believe it means the MP is put in a predicament where they have to choose either the constituencies best interest or put their job  and reputation at the frontline.  This then has a trickle down to voters choice in voting leading to the voter being trapped and wrongly represented in choice, they can either A.) Vote for someone who votes in favour of party lines B.) Vote for someone whose independent and can actually represent you but it practically means that their voice isn’t heard, being in the backbenches and hard for them to properly progress and make a change.   
  
This dilemma and the intricate way that parliament is set up to make it look like a democracy which is a  shame to manufacture consent for capitalism. Representative democracy is not representative but actually authoritarian.

While I agree that SOGI topics in schools must be handled sensitively, implying that children can be encouraged to become LGBT is baseless.

His argument instead demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of what it is to be LGBT. Being LGBT is not a choice influenced by societal factors but instead an inherent aspect of individuals.
Bill made a statement that can be paraphrased as 'if it is biological, then why is the presence of LGBT children so geographical? (Not in the monologue I am discussing above)' I think Bill needs to understand the difference between being LGBT and identifying as LGBT. It makes perfect sense that areas that are more accepting and safe for LGBT children would have a higher percentage of those children identifying as such. Personally, I recognized my sexual orientation at a young age, around 12 years old, which is consistent with most LGB people. 

This fact underscores the importance of having SOGI topics in the curriculum of the education system. These children have a right to learn about themselves and to be included in the curriculum. I agree with Bill that children are morons, but I wholeheartedly disagree that a child can be indoctrinated into the LGBT identity. While there is a risk of inappropriate exposure, this applies to all topics in the classroom. The important thing is to ensure that curriculum is age-appropriate. 

The societal attitudes towards the LGBT community have thankfully changed, but it is still relatively new for us as a society. There will be growing pains as we figure out the best ways to address these difficult topics in the classroom. While there are legitimate concerns out there, what Bill said was akin to the “groomer” conspiracy and is baseless. 

Anyways, that is my view. If I misunderstood what Bill meant by “child entrapment” please let me know. If you did not watch the Bill Maher monologue but still wish to state an opinion, feel free."

1. Russia, will either defeat or cause a stalemate with Ukraine. This will just be a stepping stone before they attack the Baltic states and the Baltic states invoke NATO article 5. Bringing the US and EU into a European war.
2. While Russia does that...China will attack Taiwan and all the fun that will bring to Taiwan and the USA.
3. Meanwhile, North Korea will strike South Korea dragging the UN (and primarily the US) into the 2nd Korean War.
4. Then, Iran will take the opportunity to Attack Israel & then turn Saudi Arabia and the Emirates in their desire to spread Shia Islam and rid the world of the Arab monarchs. 
5. Meanwhile with all the wars going on above it will lead to smaller skirmish's with equal propensity to destroy with Sudan and Ethiopia going to blows, Venezuela and Guyana, India and Pakistan to name a few who might take the opportunity that the US is too busy to come to the rescue... 

Or maybe they are all working together already and I uncovered their plan by seeing the chess board stacking out the way it is... There are additional nuisance and details but I didn't feel like writing a novel here such as China's quickly aging population, Russia's trying to keep the war time economy going, basic human greed, and etc. etc...

There *is* no music in their songs.

And when collabs happen, these people bring their foul, evil style of *talking* into the mic into other genres.

It's a marketing ""feel good"" term to appease to environmentalists, check off boxes for companies to ""appear to care"" in shareholder reviews, and to give humanity a false sense of hope that the environmental destruction we've done is being reversed.

IMHO, sustainability is a direct opposing force to organic human advancement and development. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, I'm just saying that humans are selfish and destructive in nature; we are animals too. 

And to support our behaviors, society and the general world economy is setup towards producing more goods rather than reusing, using up more resources, and creating more pollution, all in order to maximize profits and further human advancement.

Some of the unfortunate consequences of this behavior include:

1. **Deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest**: The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the ""lungs of the Earth,"" has faced severe deforestation, particularly in Brazil. Between 2000 and 2020, over 10,000 square miles of forest were lost, largely due to logging, agricultural expansion, and fires. This destruction not only contributes to the loss of biodiversity but also impacts carbon storage capabilities, influencing global climate change.
2. **The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (2010)**: This catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most significant environmental disasters caused by humans. Following an explosion on the BP-operated oil rig, approximately 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled into the ocean over 87 days, causing extensive damage to marine and coastal ecosystems. The impacts on wildlife, fishing industries, and local communities were profound and long-lasting.
3. **The Australian Bushfires (2019-2020)**: Although bushfires are a natural occurrence in Australia, the scale and intensity of the 2019-2020 fire season were unprecedented. Factors including prolonged drought and human-induced climate change exacerbated the fires. Over 46 million acres were burned, thousands of homes were destroyed, and significant losses to wildlife and habitats occurred, including nearly 3 billion animals being killed or displaced.
4. **Plastic Pollution**: Over the last 20 years, the issue of plastic pollution has become increasingly apparent. Plastics, especially single-use plastics, have polluted oceans, rivers, and landscapes, harming marine life and entering the human food chain. Notable examples include the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a vast area in the Pacific Ocean where plastic debris accumulates.
5. **Arctic Ice Melt**: Human-induced climate change has led to unprecedented melting of Arctic sea ice. Over the past two decades, the extent of summer ice cover has dramatically reduced, impacting global climate patterns, rising sea levels, and Arctic ecosystems. This melting also affects indigenous populations and wildlife dependent on the ice for their livelihood and survival.
6. **Urbanization and Habitat Loss**: Rapid urbanization and infrastructure development have led to significant habitat destruction globally. Natural landscapes are often converted into urban areas, industrial sites, and transportation networks, disrupting local ecosystems and leading to a loss of biodiversity.
7. **Air Pollution in Major Cities**: While not a single event, the ongoing air pollution in major cities worldwide, primarily due to emissions from vehicles and industrial activities, has had devastating health impacts on populations and contributes to the broader phenomenon of anthropogenic climate change."

They say Taylor Swift is a better vocalist than Adele. They say Taylor Swift is a better performer than Beyonce. I even heard someone say that Taylor Swift is one of the best songwriters of all time(when people like Alicia Keys and Bruno Mars exist). I don’t think Taylor Swift is a terrible artist. She can actually hold a tune unlike Jennifer Lopez or Selena Gomez. Her Performances aren’t as high energy and powerful as a Beyonce performance but something I do appreciate is that Taylor Swift can play instruments while singing which is something not many performers can do. However I don’t think Taylor Swift is anywhere close to Beyonce when it comes to performing.  Something I do appreciate about Taylor Swift is that she story tells through her music however all of her music is a breakup story. Where is the variety in that?

When it comes to vocals I think Taylor Swift is closer to someone like Lana Del Rey or Lorde. All three can hold a tune but they are all pretty average vocally when you compare them to actual pop vocalists like Adele, Ariana Grande or Sabrina Carpenter. Taylor’s vocals don’t really stand out. It doesn’t have the power or resonance of Adele’s voice. She can’t sing agile riffs and runs like Ariana Grande. And she can’t sing with her soul like Sabrina Carpenter. Taylor Swift’s voice is average at best. When it comes to performing I think Taylor can be compared to someone like SZA or Olivia Rodrigo. All three can dance and sing but their performances are average when compared to someone like Beyonce,Rihanna or Michael Jackson. Taylor can dance but if you put her on the homecoming stage with Beyonce she would fall off. Nothing about Taylor’s performances make her stand out they are pretty average at best. Yes Taylor Swift can play an instrument but HER and Alicia Keys can do that to and they both at least have the vocals and songwriting skills to help them stand out. Lastly let’s get to her songwriting skills. I can’t think of anyone who only makes music about breakups besides Taylor Swift. Her music only being about breakups is the only thing that makes her stand out because she is the only singer who only makes music about breakups. However Bruno Mars,Lady Gaga,Demi Lovato,Katy Perry,Beyonce,etc. have all made songs about breakups. However they also write music about other stuff like sex,partying,love,school,drinking,swimming and other life experiences. Taylor Swift only makes music about breakups.

I understand that Taylor Swift is one of the biggest artists out right now but in my opinion I don’t think Taylor Swift is as talented as people make her sound. She is average in all aspects of music. Nothing about her screams “I’m the best at what I do”. Nothing about her stands out among the crowd of much better musicians."

It’s purely an ego thing and there’s absolutely no benefit to benching 300 squatting 400 deadlifting 500. 

There’s literally nothing to gain but injury risks, which could set you back months.

People brag about it because they associate heavier = stronger = better than normies and more alpha.

But bro, you aren’t gonna use that skill anywhere unless you work for ups lol

Powerlifting competitions are the most pointless and enforce the lifting heavy = alpha mentality which will ultimately lead to people getting injured trying to increase their lifts pass their capacity.

Building muscle doesn’t require this kind of weight.

In college I deadlifted heavy and ended up injuring my lower back for months, which several years later contributed to a herniated lower back, which took years to recover. 

The ones who fall into believing big numbers = alpha are too easily affected by herd mentality and their friends.

I’ve only been in one serious relationship in my life and it was with a married couple (open relationship). The husband turned out to be a complete narcissist after 1.5 years together.

The reason i post this is because i am really open to both sides of this idea - the pro and against arguments on how likely russia is going to be using nukes and how much of it is bluff. because in that case, where its always been a bluff, all the escalation management of the west is absolute failure and buying into russian propaganda. the red lines were all not grounded in reality, and its been proven over and over again time, because nothing happened each time red line was crossed. 

i wanna see arguments for and against this escalation management of the west. this is to catalyze a discussion of both sides of the argument.

the main thing about people believing in the threat of nukes i think is how oversimplified their understanding is of nukes, the doctrine and the entire process, how much of spying we do to see any signal or a hint of russia going into that direction. it doesnt take into account all the variants of nukes that dont scatter radioactive material and wouldnt endanger the west. its also exactly what russia wants. nukes are serious and shouldnt be bluffed about as russia has done already.

over time the reality shows that it was just a bluff to make westerners scared, and sadly, there were enough of us even in eastern europe who stood up agianst nato, becaust OMG nUKES omg ww3, being the useful idiots for russia"

Not that identity doesn’t flavor and influence bad behavior, but it isn’t the sole cause. Sometimes it’s just power, and when the progressive movement makes spaces that intentional flip the power hierarchy they seem to forget that any leader can be a shitty human and do terrible jobs of policing their own."
0,2024-04-23,CMV: Penalties for rape are too harsh,u/Greatfumbler,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cb30m6/cmv_penalties_for_rape_are_too_harsh/,changemyview,"I’m pretty sure this is a very unpopular opinion but hear me out before telling me how terrible of a person I am. I’m not saying it’s not terrible. People should still get years in prison. But penalties for rape are on the same level as murder in most states. Unfortunately this causes many I’d say most rapists to get no time and it causes victims to get blamed way more than necessary. Juries and the public have a hard time sending people away for life when they aren’t absolutely sure beyond any doubt. And most rape cases are he said/ she said. So some people will always have doubt causing perpetrators to go free and people to wonder if the woman is making it up to absolutely ruin their lives. And also some woman don’t want to ruin someone’s life leading them to not report it or feel bad if they do. Also when the penalty is the same as murder it incentives criminals to kill the victim to not leave eye witnesses.

If the penalty was let’s say 2-8 years like aggravated assault I think it would have the same deterrence while fixing all these problems and still be a good punishment. 

Obviously this doesn’t include enhancing factors like if it was a kid, multiple times/woman, or if it was violent. This is for simple ones like she might’ve had a couple too many drinks and the guy didn’t know that where the same penalties as murder just don’t make sense to me"

The protests we're seing at many colleges have involved rallies, marches, building occupations, and other forms of disruptive protest. But universities have largely allowed and even supported them in the name of free speech. University presidents have testified under oath in front of congress how they allow these protests, even antisemitic ones calling for genocide, under ""free speech"". 


In contrast, if there were similar prolonged, disruptive protests on campuses for right-wing causes like restricting abortion, opposing gender ideology, criticizing certain racial initiatives such as DEI or ESG or anti-climate change , etc., I believe the university response would be very different. The protests would likely face swift condemnation and disciplinary action for causing a ""hostile environment"" or ""interfering with university operations.""

Imagine protests on campus calling for the genocide of Blacks. Students would immediately be expelled. 

Essentially, the same forms of protest seem to be celebrated or at least tolerated when fueled by mainstream left-wing ideologies, but would be deemed unacceptable or suppressible when used to promote conservative or right-wing ideologies on campus, even if they don't violate any laws."

This is effectively robbing those students of the education they sacrificed significant time, money, and effort to obtain.

Protesting in public spaces and even protests outside of college buildings are fine, as long as you are not intentionally preventing access to that building.

0,2024-04-23,"CMV: Genetics and metabolism don’t play a major role in obesity, and claiming they do is very harmful.",u/Panal-Lleno,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cb6vnq/cmv_genetics_and_metabolism_dont_play_a_major/,changemyview,"Please keep in mind I’m specifically talking about obesity, not being overweight where both genetics and metabolism do play a much larger role. I am specifically talking about obesity (30%+ BF males; 35%+ BF females).

At a certain point, most obese people will be gaining muscle as they walk due to the strength needed to carry around the excessive weight. Contrary to popular belief, this will actually increase metabolism, and will most likely be higher compared to what a healthy person of the same height will have. A person who has surpassed 130 kg will most likely be at a standard calorie deficit at 3000 kcal per day, while a standard calorie deficit for someone of a healthy weight may be 2100 kcal. Even with thyroid issues, your metabolism does not decrease in the thousands.

Genetics is almost as easy to debunk. While genetics can play a role in thyroid issues, insulin resistance, etc., all they do is determine your overall metabolism. Again, the range is not actually that drastic and it is near impossible for a person who is 130 kg to **not** be burning at least 3000 kcal a day.

Genetics do not directly play a role in how much fat a person will have to the point where they are obese. The confusion comes from **how** the fat is retained, and it may make a person appear obese due to the way their body fat is distributed. For example, a person who retains most of their fat on their torso will likely look fatter than a person who retains most of their fat on their lower body. But genetics have no role in directly determining the amount of body fat you will have. There is no such thing as an obese gene.

If it’s not genetic, why are there entire families obese? Because the family has influenced each other into not eating healthy, in the same way they teach each other a language, cultural practice, another habit, etc. It’s an environmental factor, not genetic.

Now, why is this harmful? Because it gives obese people an excuse and an exit from accepting that they ultimately have a food-related problem. Hiding behind the “genetics” and “metabolism” shield takes away any accountability that they need to have in order to take the healthy step and control their diet. Whether it’s binge eating, not eating enough healthy meals, or other mental issues, obesity is 99.99% a nutrition problem with a simple (not easy, simple) solution. And it is a problem that needs to be fixed before it manifests into diabetes, heart disease, chronic joint pain, cancer, and a lot more.

Please note that I am not “open minded” to those who will argue that CI/CO < 1 is a myth, or that obesity isn’t actually dangerous. Those two are well beyond a debate and are irrefutable. I am only opening up the idea that **maybe** genetics and metabolism do play a larger role in obesity that I may be unaware of, so please change my view. "
0,2024-04-23,Cmv: Body positivity has gone a bit too far,u/QueasyFalcon1423,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cb7a4a/cmv_body_positivity_has_gone_a_bit_too_far/,changemyview,"You’ve likely heard of the phrase “Body Positivity”, a term which may be used a lot around you or not, some people even treat it as serious as racism which is quite ridiculous.

First of all i am aware that there are conditions which make it extremely hard or impossible to lose weight, bad mental health can also cause this so in these cases these people need support instead of harsh criticism.

The type of body positivity i am talking about today are the people who glorify being fat, choose to get that weight and want to “change” our society into some fantasyland that accepts fat people.

I’m gonna give you an example, there are two patients in a room, one has Cancer and one is obese who has caused themselves these health problems, now they have to share these resources although the obese person has caused themselves these health issues and more could go to the cancer patient if the obese person perhaps worked out more or just ate a little healthier, this is one of the problems obesity can cause in society.

To get to the point of obesity can be harder than it seems, you get to a point where you need to consume a LOT of calories to keep gaining weight, people who spread “body positivity” glorify and even promote this stuff.

A lot of obese people don’t even try lose weight, if you are extremely overweight it will be a hard journey, but most don’t even try not because of some condition but because they just.. don’t want to? Some may call it laziness or they could be going through a hard time, but this is a problem.

Some people also misunderstand that “body shaming” can mean a lot of things, it can be shaming people of any body, not just overweight people.

These “body positivity” promoters also seem to think that the world is shaped to hate fat people and having preferences are bad, just because i’m not gonna date your friend because shes overweight and does nothing about it does not mean i am “fatphobic”, maybe just maybe.. it means i want a girl who takes care of her body?

“Fatphobic” is a word that has become unpopular due to the bad image some people have been giving it, in my eyes fatphobia would only be used if you were actively bullying fat people and being extremely unfair to a huge extent.

TL;DR - Glorifying and promoting obesity is bad and it is quite an issue in modern society."

Anyone know who they are? 

Read the comments, while I initially laughed, are unnecessarily mean. I felt bad afterwards, and it got me thinking:

1. Fat shaming is wrong. I don’t believe people should be made fun of for that, and even though I laughed at first, I’m human, made a dumb mistake and I do realize I was wrong for that. 
2. Yes, people should be comfortable in their bodies
3. That said, morbid obesity, as in the case here, should not be glorified. 
4. There is a big difference in accepting who you are and making the most of it and not giving a fuck and in fact doubling down on it as if to thumb your nose against conventional beauty. Like, give it a rest. 
5. I have nothing against “plus sized” models nor do I have an issue with that term. I think it’s more respectful and I’m glad society is becoming more accepting of larger people in ads and stuff. However, there is a big difference to me in “plus sized” and the models in the Instagram link. I’d like to hear your thoughts on this. 
6. I realize there are people with health conditions, and I’m not referring to those people. Im referring to the models. I wanted to get their app so I could see if they were disabled in some way. That would be more acceptable to me. From what I see now though, it doesn’t look like that’s the case.

I’m looking for some legitimate discussion here and I would be willing to modify my position on it if you make some respectful arguments that can “educate me” or persuade me to your view. But this is my initial feeling on the matter.

482,2024-04-23,CMV: Licensing and/or availing of sex work is always going to be somewhat morally sketchy in a society where poverty is a genuine risk that people face,u/forbiddenmemeories,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cb9mhl/cmv_licensing_andor_availing_of_sex_work_is/,changemyview,"This one is going to be fairly long, but I'll try and make my view as linear as possible here.

First up, there is the very obvious starting point that **sexual activity involving someone without that person's consent is seriously wrong**. This is something that nobody really argues with: where we recognise that some sex-related act has been committed which did not have the consent of one or more of the involved parties, we recognise a serious offence as having been committed. Following directly from that is the further point that **consent to sexual activity obtained through means of coercion is not valid**: even if someone provides their assent to sexual activity in the most literal sense, if they do so under some kind of duress such as the threat of physical violence or blackmail, they have not meaningfully consented and the sexual activity is still just as severely wrong as it would have been had they not given any assent at all.

These basic points I think have been pretty beyond dispute in most societies for a long time, but as time has passed we've gotten more astute at recognising both additional ways in which someone's non-meaningful 'consent' can be improperly obtained, and different forms of sexual contact that deserve a similarly weighty burden of consent. For example, we recognise that people of diminished mental faculties and responsibility (e.g. severely intoxicated or those under the age of majority) cannot meaningfully consent to sexual activity, and we also recognise that actions such as inappropriate touching or even lewd comments also amount to a breach of someone's sexual boundaries which without their consent is likewise seriously wrong. Modern life has also introduced new forms of sexual activity and new potential breaches of sexual consent that go with them: sharing 'revenge porn' online, sending unsolicited sexually explicit images to people online, etc. All of this is in recognition of the fact that both consent and sex itself are pretty broad and complex phenomena. That there are many kinds of activity which we should reasonably expect to cross someone's sexual boundaries, something it would be severely wrong to do without their consent, and many ways in which a person's very literal 'consent' could be ill-gotten (or at least *potentially* ill-gotten) enough that the activity remains morally suspect.

Now onto work, money and poverty. For most people in the world today of working age and adequate health, working for pay is our primary (and often only) way of supporting ourselves. Losing one's income would be a serious problem for most people. As such, employers wield a lot of bargaining power, and so it's not surprising that most countries have at least some laws in place mandating a minimum duty from employers to employees - a minimum wage, a minimum number of paid days' leave per year, etc. - as otherwise we may end up with a race to the bottom where people have to accept the poorest conditions possible just to keep their job and keep from plunging into severe poverty.

The fact that an income, as well as other basic material necessities such as housing, are recognised as so important has also led us to conclude that offering - or revoking an offer of - these things to someone in exchange for them engaging in some form of sexual activity to be severely wrong as well. Recent years have exposed the prevalence of 'casting couch' culture in Hollywood, and a major part - probably the primary part - of the outrage at it has stemmed from the idea that, as well as the practice being being generally demeaning and chauvinistic, the actresses being pressured into putting up with sexual advances by major players in the industry were victims of sexual crimes; that someone who 'consents' to or does not rebuff the sexual advances of somebody else because doing so would cost them their job has been coerced into doing so and thus has not meaningfully consented at all, rendering any sexual activity seriously wrong. A more recent scandal in the UK, leading to changes in law to outlaw such practices, has been so-called 'sex for rent' arrangements in which private landlords requested and accepted sexual favours from tenants in lieu of rent payments: this again is a case where someone has in the most literal sense 'consented' to the sexual activity in question, but the fact that they did so with the threat of losing a material necessity looming over them - in this case, their home - surely also renders their consent null and void and the sexual activity in question severely wrong. I think it also remains fair to say in both of the above examples that the fact that the victims could in theory have refused - could have refused the job or the rental property and left - does not really make the offences against them any less wrong; they shouldn't *have* to refuse these things to retain their sexual autonomy; we should not be in the business of allowing offers of such basic things as paid employment or housing, things essential to quality of life, contingent on sexual activity.

Thus my conclusion is that **consent to sexual activity where refusal would likely mean losing out on basic material necessities should not be considered valid consent**.

And given the fact that, as mentioned, earning a wage is the only real option most of us have for supporting ourselves materially, this I think means that **for as long as that is the case,** **the whole concept of paying someone for sexual activity is at least somewhat morally troubling**. Because the very real possibility exists that the only reason that someone is offering sexual services in exchange for money is because they will otherwise find themselves in poverty. This is a phenomenon which to an extent I think has been acknowledged by some people with more recent criticisms of so-called 'sex tourism' and of people travelling to developing countries where many are at risk of absolute poverty specifically to avail of sex workers there. But even though those of us in richer developed countries are lucky enough that we will probably never be at serious risk of *absolute* poverty, many are still at risk of relative poverty and struggling to afford necessities such as rent and utilities bills, certainly if they are unlucky enough to become unemployed or cut off by their family or other support networks. If arrangements like 'sex for rent' are wrong because someone who agrees to sex only because they'll otherwise lose their home hasn't validly consented, isn't sex with someone who agrees to it only because they need the money to pay their rent wrong too? These are after all, like I said, pretty basic necessities. It would be one thing if we lived in a utopia where an adequate material quality of life was guaranteed for all, and we could be sure that anyone offering sexual activity in exchange for payment was not doing so under the threat of homelessness or cold. But, at least so long as a level of poverty/material deprivation unacceptable to the average person is a genuine threat that people face should they fail to financially support themselves, I think that the idea of paying someone for sexual services of some kind is at the very least thoroughly troubling, and it being an arrangement going on out there in the world should bother us."

(I.E threats, slander, CP, harassment, etc.). This applies to deep fakes, NSFW drawings of celebrities, and AI art of celebrities.

If you can draw/create offensive parody art/creations of celebrities/Public figures, (I.E Taylor swift having a Maga hats and being a trump supporter) and that be protected by free speech, and if you can create tame fanart/creations of public figures (I.E jenna ortega dressed up as Raven from teen titans) and that is protected under free speech

Then making NSFW AI content of celebrities is/should be protected under free speech, especially if it's outlandish in nature, and it's made very clear that it's AI and not the real person. (Otherwise that'd be slander something also not protected under free speech)

How many of the most popular artists today have committed horrible horrible acts of abuse, yet the court of public opinion has largely let them walk free?

In each of these cases we are too often largely dismissive of this behavior and continue to support them on a mass scale. Even when such support is directly financially linked to their actions, we believe that their  art should be enjoyable regardless of the context under which it was made.

If we are to accept this, that a piece of media should be enjoyed for what it is regardless of the context of its creation, then the same should apply to AI-generated art. Refusing to grant this same leniency to AI, in my mind, can only be arbitrary hypocrisy, or much worse, a sign of dangerously backwards priorities where we genuinely see the utilization of AI as worse than racism, or worse than a sex crime. Do allow me to clarify I don’t believe those advocating against AI actively hold this view, so much as it’s been a subconscious rearrangement of society’s priorities that I’m concerned about.

Even if we are to accept that any given piece of AI-created art out there helps propagate other AI art, I believe the same can be said for financially supporting an artist, and setting this societal expectation that this conduct is forgivable, if they’re a good enough artist."

Why is it that you can go to town on corn from the center, but can't start from the center of a hot dog? As most subs, to me, are elaborate hot dogs, so subs apply here too.

I want a perfect ratio of bread to ingredients. I want that dopamine hit from the first bite before the joy of flavor wears off. That's why you drink the good wine first, then the bad after.

Sure, you can slice it in half, but I'm talking about the case where it's not sliced in half. 

And on that note- Before you think it's heathenous to eat from the center, think about how you eat subs when they are cut in half- you start from the best looking center part first right?

If you haven't tried it, try it and it'll change your life. It may be a little more messy, but we're civilized beings with napkins nearby for that reason.

31,2024-04-23,CMV: Abuse can be unintentional,u/Resident-Piglet-587,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cbe93k/cmv_abuse_can_be_unintentional/,changemyview,"(For clarity - This isnt justifying abuse at all. Regardless of intent. 
I understand legal and clinical definitions exist. 
I don't need help with definitions. I want to understand your overall point not argue semantics. I'm speaking in layman's terms - Not making medical, legal, or psychological claims) 

My view is :

Malice and premeditation don't have to be present for abuse to be abuse.
Relativity also doesn't matter. Meaning just because you feel X is worse then Y Doesn't mean Y can't be abuse. Pain and trauma is subjective, there's no grid as to what events are considered traumatizing or not. That's determined by the affected person's internal state. 

If a person was mistreated in a way that caused long term harmful effects, that person was abused in my eyes.

I think this bleeds into the idea that ""hurt people hurt people"". I don't think that all people who have traumatized others did so knowingly. 

Some people genuinely believe their actions are justified, excusable, and even right.

(Spanking is a good example). Obvious outliers considered, no parent seeks to intentionally scar their children physically or emotionally and they feel spanking is reasonable and no malice, hatred, or anger was present during that act yet I still consider it to be abuse. Many insist it's not because there's no malicious intent. 

 ""Traumatizing"" to me in layman's term, is any event that has long lasting negative effects to a person's inner world or worldview particularly if it is causing visceral reactions, flash backs, fear, reluctance, etc. Later in life when a person knows they're not in actual danger.
For example, being traumatized by a corporation, bad experience in crowds, scared of relationships because of a toxic one. 

I'm also not staying everyone who has unintentionally traumatized another person should be labeled as a bad person without consideration for the individual situations and all factors involved. This isn't about blame and lables.

I'm brining this up because I've had people insist that abuse is ONLY abuse of there is intent and I don't really understand that. I don't really care about intent as much as I care about it's actual affect on others. 

Intent doesn't dictate results."

Do some of us maybe find it off-putting? Sure. But that doesn't excuse the way almost all modern societies deal with sex work. I'm a therapist and have had clients both on the sex-worker end as well as the ""John"" end, and they both benefit. Some of these guys are lonely and need it. Some of these workers find freedom in selling what they want and knowing their bills are paid. Isn't that control and consent?

It's one of the most outdated legal structures. I'm baffled by it. Everyone's sexual proclivities can be private or not, and they're all different, but making it literally a crime that you can get imprisoned for is insane to me. Why not make weapons manufacturing illegal, if the argument is harm to others. I personally would not be romantically drawn to a person that does sex work, not would I want to do it myself. My opinion. But in a communal society, I certainly wouldn't want to criminalize them, or emotionally shame them, and I wouldn't want my damn tax money going into that pursuit. We have enough shit to deal with.

Anyway, I know there are arguments about human trafficking and such. I get that, and it's an important angle (worked with those clients too). But there are good, normal people that pursue sex work and my view is they shouldn't be literally treated like felons. Hoping someone can make a case for this antiquated system and its view of sex work. I probably won't agree, but interested ij the forum of rationale. Cheers."

0,2024-04-23,CMV: Anyone Who Supports Palestine in Any Capacity is a Brainwashed Antisemite,u/AMGEmperorMundatus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cbhv1t/cmv_anyone_who_supports_palestine_in_any_capacity/,changemyview,"I think that the truth about Palestine and its supporters is becoming clearer every single day. They have dropped their façades and are now advocating for a second Holocaust. Considering a second Holocaust has always been the Palestinians' intention, this does not surprise me. Hell, the person who coined the term ""Nakba"" used ti to refer to the Arabs' failure to exterminate the Jews, not the displacement that followed the war the Arabs started. When Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7 and killed, raped, kidnapped, beheaded, mutilated, and cannibalized some 1,200 people, most of them innocent civilians, the Palestinians rejoiced. They spat and danced on the corpses that Hamas took with them. Some of them stole Israeli cars with bodies and body parts still inside. Some of them probably raped and ate the corpses, but that remains unverified. Also, I should probably note that many Palestinian ""civilians"" partook in the massacre themselves; there is evidence that some of the killings and kidnappings were perpetrated by ordinary Palestinians and not by Hamas militants. Opinions show that the Palestinians overwhelmingly support antisemitic terror in the name of Allah, and while a growing number of Palestinians oppose Hamas, they do so for political reasons, not because they oppose terrorism.

Likewise, the ""pro-Palestine"" crowd has now made clear that they are really the pro-Hamas crowd, and the ""anti-Zionists"" have proven that they are antisemites. On October 8, before Israel was able to retaliate, thousands of ""pro-Palestinian"" demonstrators took to the streets to cheer on Hamas. At that point, any ""pro-Palestinian"" protest was unambiguously a pro-Hamas protest, given that Israel had not launched any sort of invasion of Gaza. This is even more obvious considering the ""protesters"" waved Hamas flags, shouted antisemitic slogans (including ""Gas the Jews!""), and painted swastikas. And now, the news is coming out about the ongoing riots at Columbia, where pro-Hamas protesters are harassing Jewish students, threatening to kill Jews, supporting Hamas, assaulting Jews, shouting antisemitic slurs, painting swastikas, saluting Hitler, and everything in between. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if it devolves into an outright pogrom. A similar incident happened at Yale, another Ivy League university, where an Orthodox Jewish student was stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag. It seems that the West has turned on the Jews once again, and the results could be catastrophic.

Of course, the ""pro-Palestinian"" movement has done nothing but make antisemitism a greater problem in today's society. The only reason people believe Palestinian terrorists is because the terrorists have one of the most effective propaganda machines in the modern world. The entire ""pro-Palestinian"" movement originated as a PR campaign by Palestinian terrorists to get Western leftists to back them and hate Jews. In the '90s, Hamas militants went to the US and started left-wing think tanks to do just that, insofar as they can be called ""left-wing,"" considering they support Islamism. Opposition to US involvement in the Middle East, such as the Iraq War, as well as rising Islamophobia following 9/11, further heightened support for Hamas in the West, as it caused many leftists to side with Muslims, even though most Muslims' views are the exact opposite of leftists' views. These Palestinian propagandists reframed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a struggle for civil rights and independence rather than what it actually is - an uncivilized people's repeated futile attempts to finish what Hitler started. They painted Israel as the oppressor, hoping to speak to Westerners' opposition to imperialism and discrimination. Now, they're celebrating, for millions around the world have been brainwashed to support them and their barbaric ways.

To any Jews who read this, you are no longer safe. This is the time you think about what ""Never Again"" really means to you. No one deserves to go through one Holocaust, let alone two."

A very stark and bleak example to make the point obvious would be; visiting a 3rd world country to exploit both the currency disparity and the poverty. 

Most would never want their child to resort to sex work (unless they just really loved it for some reason).

Many of these beliefs included Blood Libel, use of the term ""Christ is King"" when she was feuding with her colleague of the outlet, Ben Shapiro, etc.

That being said, her ousting has caused me to ask myself one question and you should ask yourself the same thing. Why was the Daily Wire able to draw a line between Candace Owens and her Antisemitic rhetoric yet wasn't able to do the same thing when she spread Anti-Black, Anti-Women, Anti-Ableism, and Anti-LGBTQ rhetoric?

I mean, the Daily Wire never had an issue with Owens when she criticized the LGBTQ community for being a ""sexual plague on society"", as well as her criticizing the use of a model with cerebral palsy in an underwear advertisement as ""ridiculous"" because she doesn't ""really understand how far we're going to take this inclusivity thing"".

Her criticisms of the Black community, which consist of a mixture of generalized statements and tying the actions of individuals to all of them never seem to bother the outlet as well. Other criticisms include her calling Juneteenth ""sooo lame"" and ""Ghetto"", believing that the ""Media lying to Black Americans pretending that High Murder Rates, Illiterate Children, and Degenerate Music is 'Progress'"", stating that Netflix and UberEats having Black categories is akin to Jim Crow ""Segregation"", wearing a ""White Lives Matter"" shirt, and stating that ""being a Straight White Male today is exactly like being a Black American during Segregation"".

Now, let's not forget when she actually questioned if there was ""one objective thing that has gotten better in American society since Women were given the right to vote"", even going so far as to stating that Women in the Workforce are a ""Distraction"" and that ""Things have gotten worse at Work since Women joined. Since Women joined the Workforce, I think that Men are having to deal with all these Landmines everywhere."" Seriously, how is the Daily Wire alright with this sort of Misogyny?

To combine those two topics together, she expressed fear and distrust of Non-White Male and Female Pilots during her rants against DEI.

But in reality, she only managed to make herself a hypocrite for spreading such views, while not doing the same thing herself. She believes that women should stop chasing careers and focus on making babies, yet she has a career as a talk show host while not making babies, let alone looking after her two children. But the epitome of her hypocrisy has to go to her endorsing convicted sex trafficker, Andrew Tate because of his so-called pro-masculine and anti-feminist views, yet this is the same person who criticized the Black community for glorifying the wrong role models. Still, there has been little-to-no criticism from the Daily Wire for her doing that. Why?

So in conclusion, Ben Shapiro and co-founder of the Daily Wire, Jeremy Boering suddenly seem to realize how harmful dog-whistle bigotry is after Candace Owens went after the one marginalized group that they can't tolerate prejudice against. It's a pity they can't do the same thing about other marginalized groups and instead, shrug them off. After all, they're Conservatives, right? Aren't they supposed to view everyone as equals and not divide them and advocate for only one group? But hey, I guess some groups are better than others and that's why they deserve more support. Also, Freedom of Speech has its limits. In fact, we can't always be politically incorrect because it seems to do more harm than good.

As for the Conservatives out there who've been critical of Candace Owens for her behavior, character, and being a caricature of herself in recent months, many of us who were against her have tried to warn you for years about who she really was from the very beginning. She's always been like this. She's the epitome of the typical Modern Black Conservative. Nothing more than an endless cycle of Self-Loathing and Grifting in the name of Personal Responsibility and Individualism. The fact that it took you this long to realize who she really was goes to show you how successful she managed to brainwash all of you.

\*On an unrelated note, another reason why she was booted from the Daily Wire was because she spread wild conspiracy theories of French President Emmanuel Macron's wife, Brigitte, who she believed was a man. This ironically caused many Conservatives to criticize her for peddling such an insane theory. Why I find this pretty ironic coming from them is because these are the same people who believed in the same thing about former President Obama's wife, Michelle. But like what I discussed in the topic above, they only understand this through their hypocritically restrictive Right-Wing Framework and Worldview."

Jobs aren't given because we want to help people that's your motivation but the people opening up jobs hire you because you're useful and if you eventually becomes useless to your employer or society there isn't a need to give you a job so people won't give out jobs anymore.

Secondly, unlike certain industries like medicine or finance, the tech industry is purely merit-based; meaning employers are always going to pick the candidate that has better skills, regardless of their degree. So not having a university degree wouldn't hamper your job prospects so as long as you have the proper skills and reach out to the right people, maybe aside from lowering your salary at your first job.

Also in university you have to pick plenty of elective courses and waste your time learning material that you'll probably never use in your life ever again. By self-learning, you can skip over said material and have a more efficient learning experience.

Not to mention students in universities are more concerned with passing tests and handing in assignment than actual learning; so they tend to forget a lot of core concepts in computer science a few semesters after they've taken a certain course. "

I'll explain my point using examples.

Ever since the Israel-Palestine war flared up recently, an overwhelming amount of people started demanding Israel to ""Free Palestine"", including a lot of my classmates and kids my age. I'm not here to make a political statement, but when I asked these people what they knew about the conflict, the Balfour Declaration was the most I got out of anyone. People were using the words ""Gaza"", ""Hamas,"" and ""Hezbollah"" without knowing what they meant.

Now, I suspended judgment until I watched innumerable videos from both sides and concluded who I support. If anyone tries to question me, I can give it back to them.

My classmates? Not remotely.

Another example is Islamophobia. I live in India, which is one of the most Islamophobic countries in the world. A lot of my classmates believe whatever nonsense crops up on Instagram reels and use it to blame the whole community. They don't even know about the subject and spread this hate without knowing what's behind it.

I'm not a Muslim, but I (tried my best to) read the Qur'an before even *talking* about the matter. *Then* I can decide whether Islam is ""morally right"" or ""morally wrong"".

I understand that systemic racism exists, and that black people have a much harder time in America than white people do. That aside, there seems to be a level of brain-rot that exists when it comes to shootings of black people.

What started with incredibly reasonable outrage and protests about the killings of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, etc. has made people automatically assume that shootings of black people by police officers or security guards are unjustified without evidence. I think this discredits the black lives matter matter movement.

Take the example of Banko Brown. Banko Brown was shot by a Walgreens security guard after getting into a fight with him and then threatening to stab him and lunging forward. It was so clearly self-defense that the DA dropped all charges and refused to even prosecute the security guard. But there were still protests about the killing of someone who had made a credible death threat and was acting out on it.

After this, I've become skeptical whenever people protest about a police killing because it seems like people will protest whether or not it is justified. I think many other people feel this way now, and if it keeps going on it will discredit the movement over time."

**Background:** In our 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons campaign, I'm running a character with 4 levels in Paladin and 1 in Warlock. Pretty much everyone else is playing a mobile long-range squishy, so I've built my character to around durability and control. He's got 20 AC (plate and a shield) and usually casts Shield of Faith. He also has Sentinel, Blindsight, Oath of Conquest, booming blade, and Wrathful Smite, with the overall goal being to trap his enemies in melee and keep them away from his allies.

After a very exciting battle and series of cool RP events, the DM gave him a magic weapon.

>*Throwing Maul of Bel*  
Weapon (maul), uncommon (requires attunement by a follower of Bel)  
Damage: 2d6  
Damage Type: Bludgeoning  
Properties: Heavy, Two-Handed, Thrown (range 20/40)  
Weight: 10  
A maul once dedicated to Tyr, now desecrated to the service of Bel. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 40 feet.   
When attuned, the wielder can cause the maul to return to his hand at any time as a free item interaction.

This item has a lot of roleplay value to me. Its backstory is just really damn cool!

**My view that I want to change:**

IMO this weapon **sucks** for him mechanically. He'd be much better off with a mundane warhammer and shield. 

1.  He can't use a shield with it, so he loses 2 AC.
2. Most of his abilities and spells are geared around being in melee with enemies, which means on any given turn he must choose between ""throwing the maul"" or ""getting any use out of his feat, fighting style, Smite, or most of his combat spells.""
3. The ranged attack is, for a level 5 team, quite insignificant. 2d6+4 at 20 range is terrible when I was regularly doing 4d8+4 with a warhammer using Smite and Booming Blade and the fire-genie warlock is doing like 20-30 damage effortlessly from halfway across the map.
4. He already has an acceptable ranged attack option in Eldritch Blast.
5. It uses an attunement slot.

What does he gain in return?

1. His average DPR goes up about 2 points when he's attacking in melee with Booming Blade and Smite, a pretty negligible improvement.
2. It's a bit easier to cast some spells with somatic components in combat with it, since one of his hands is technically unoccupied except when he's using it to attack two-handed.
3. At level 6 he'll get Extra Attack, allowing him to deal 2x 2d6+4 damage from range, which is a solid improvement over his old primary ranged options of Eldritch Blast or a hand crossbow.
4. It's a magic weapon, so it can hit enemies immune to nonmagical attacks.

I've asked the DM if there's any way to modify it (e.g. pay to have it reduced in size to a magic warhammer, or retcon the magic ability to something suitable for a melee combatant). She won't allow it, but that I might be able, at some unspecified time in the future, to ask my patron for a boon to modify it.

**What might change my view?**

* Someone points out a mechanical or gameplay advantage that I'm not seeing
* Someone helps me to start to weigh the roleplay value of the hammer higher than its mechanical value."

This is a little experiment I am running with myself at the centre of it.

I have never studied seriously in my life, never did any homework in school never paid attention properly in school. Cheated a bit here and there to get decent grades , it didn't really matter. Got into a T2 law school , there too I did not study or put in any sort of efforts. Did a ton of alcohol and weed , studied a day before exams and cleared all the exams without any problem. COVID helped for sure, cheated on all the online exams. Made some research papers with GPT and paraphrasing, presented it in several different unis and even had them published.

Got a few internships in litigation, and even there I was able to use shortcuts and get recognition for myself. 

After that I cleared some entrance exams and got into a T1 uni for a master's in law. Here too I have continued my ways, acted like a complete drunk. Didn't study at all, cleared exams by studying on the last day and used Chat GPT and Quillbot to forge all my research papers, presented them with false confidence and even got praise for it. Made my dissertation by copying from 8 different works, nothing original. Again presented it with confidence, mine was said to be the best in our batch. 

Then I cleared a Professorship qualification exam, again without studying anything. Told my professor's that and they let me teach a few classes to 1st year students, I didn't prepare much for it and it turns out they love how I teach. 

At this point I'm going to start teaching full-time in a few months at 23 and will be getting a PHD and M.Phil as well. My motivation so far has been spite, out of spite towards the education system i will find out how high can I really go. 

It is really easy, if I can do it anyone can do it. Just losing respect year by year for people with academic accreditations. "

",u/makeyouamommy177,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cbrfoe/cmv_american_jews_on_the_left_are_expected_to/,changemyview,"The blunt truth about it is, American Jews are more concerned with appearing racist then black or Latino Americans are with being antisemitic. Or, if they do think it’s antisemitic they think it takes a backseat to their own struggles against discrimination. Because — most of them — are white. If they think about it at all. It may be no less conscious then something you grow up around hearing. 

This isn’t to say that there isn’t *lots* of work to do in the “white” community still when it comes to race relations *and* antisemitism or that this discrimination cancels out the other, it’s just to say that this is a real problem in the black community. While they were never ever representative of a majority of black Americans, the Nation of Islam was and continues to be an influential part of African America life, especially in cities. 

And if you agree protocols of the elders of Zion is antisemitic book, then you’d agree that an organization that takes its cues on the topic of Jews from such a antisemitic book would likely be, by extension antisemitic. Well early NOI was very much such an organization. And if that organization had deep roots in certain segments of black America it would probably be somewhat worthwhile to consider its effects.  

All this to say, there’s a reason Kanye West — who coincidentally also defended Louis Farrakhan from correct accusations of antisemitism — is still embraced by hip-hop fans and rappers today and if anything seems to be making a comeback of sorts.

Not that me saying this really matters. The people whose opinion this would change don’t read this and they’d only listen to people they respect within their local community. But it does look, to the outside viewer at least, that there’s a lack of reciprocity. 

During the George Floyd protests the arguments for taking to the streets to demand justice and reform society o prevent antiblack racism from killing more Americans or destroying more lives, were rooted in appeals to fundamental appeals to human rights to God. You can’t use that as a cudgel to motivate and shame people into action then turn around and ignore it or say “why they gotta drag black people into it”. Especially when it’s your fellow countrymen.

5,2024-04-24,"CMV: Most of us harbour unrecognised traumas from our families and societal influences, which shape our behaviours and beliefs.

I've seen people's outright refusal to consider that 'emotion' is a thing that's integral to our being. I **believe that the majority of us carry various forms of trauma that we are not consciously aware of -- the ones that significantly shape our personalities, behaviours, and life choices.** This kind of trauma is more subtle and less known. It isn't always from the result of overtly dramatic events but could just be from chronic pressures and patterns ingrained from our family dynamics and societal structures that we take for granted. 

I think there's an underplay of impact of trauma we picked up from childhood - specifically from our parents. Family trauma doesn't just come from obvious and 'apparent' abuse or dysfunction. It can also come from less apparent sources like emotional neglect, unmet childhood needs, or just from our parents' unresolved issues. For example, a parent's inability to provide emotional warmth and security doesn't just affect the kid short term; it fundamentally influences their ability to form healthy relationships as adults. 

On a larger scale, there's also societal traumas. It comes in a form of being part of a community or culture that normalises unhealthy behaviours and values. For example, societal pressures related to success, your appearance, or status that doesn't necessary translate to 'healthy' achievements. 

I feel that the trauma I'm talking about is more insidious because a lot of us have been conditioned to accept it - so it makes it extra difficult to recognise and acknowledge it as a trauma. We might pass off our reactions to these traumas as personality traits or just 'the way things are', not realising that hidden effect it has on our daily lives and our wellbeing. 

**I argue that we all have traumas we need to deal with. Those who say that don't have trauma are simply 'unconscious' of it.** Change my view. (Maybe it's just me not meeting more happy people?!)"

Flooding will displace millions if not billions, as will other natural disasters, while invasives will wipe out local species. This will cause a runaway affect and destroy our remaining food stocks, combined with worldwide water shortages and heatwaves.

Coral will die off as will fish stocks, leading to loss of livelihood and rise in populist right wing thinking that ironically, drives people away from more eco friendly solutions. The world is likely to hit 11 billion people and we will not be able to sustain ourselves despite removing all the nature and wild vegetation for more corn, beef and soy.

Donald Trump alongside other populist right wing parties are guaranteed to win in future due to the rise in immigrants fleeing disasters and unlivable cities and will no doubt put tons of subsidies back onto coal, oil and gas leading to widespread resurgence of the industry, alongside destroying many nature reserves, replacing them with tree farms which cannot efficently soak carbon.

Most people do not give a shit about the climate; look at the response to EVs, walkable cities and green energy.

It's been my observation that new housing developments generally drive the prices of homes up not down. This is especially the case in the city, higher number of apartments doesn't seem to lower the average cost in the least. Every other month it feels like someone is taking a building and cutting it up into apartments. I know it makes logical sense if you believe in supply and demand that ""more opportunities means more competition means lower demand and lower demand means better prices"" but that just doesn't seem the case.
Full disclosure though this doesn't seem very easily seperated from general housing going up in price over time.

But the Australian government has not made a good, coherent case for the orders to take down videos of the Wakeley stabbing. In liberal democracies, the default is to allow everything unless there's a good reason to prohibit it, rather than the other way around. Unless there's something so terrible in the videos they can't even say what it is, they should be able to explain to the public what they're banning, what's wrong with the videos, and what harm will result if they're not banned.

As far as I can tell, it's not about racial or religious harmony, or about falsehoods. If it were, it wouldn't explain why they didn't take action against individuals who baselessly libelled a Jewish individual as the Bondi Junction stabber, including mainstream media TV station Channel Seven, or others who stated as fact that the Bondi Junction stabber was Muslim. The libelled individual is [taking legal action himself](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-17/nsw-sydney-bondi-junction-stabbing-defamation-benjamin-cohen/103734072), but that is not being done by the government.

If it's about [class 1 material](https://www.esafety.gov.au/key-topics/Illegal-restricted-content) involving violence, they should say what about the violence is inappropriate. Is it depicting violence in a way that offends against ""the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults""? The victim in question survived and was healthy enough to forgive his attacker, and footage prior to or subsequent to the stabbing have been broadcast on mainstream media. Is it something that ""promotes, incites or instructs in matters of crime or violence""? That seems unlikely, as it was footage by the Church, presumably by people who opposed the stabbing. The mob who turned up afterwards seems more likely a result of text or WhatsApp messages than twitter posts.

It feels like Australian governments, both federal and state, want to be seen to be doing something about the recent stabbings when they've failed to provide adequate mental health, failed to prevent knives from being acquired as weapons, and failed to prevent religiously or politically motivated violence, by scapegoating social media. They've made lots of vague comments about social media being irresponsible, and about misinformation or disinformation, but nothing specific.

For example, in [Government declares Australia 'is not going to be bullied by Elon Musk' after X refuses to remove harmful Wakeley material](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-20/elon-musk-reacts-to-esafety-commissioner-asking-x-to-take-down-/103748930), federal Minister for Health and Aged Care Mark Butler referred to not being bullied, and Musk being a billionaire, while New South Wales Premier referred to ""lies and rumours"". In [Anthony Albanese and Elon Musk feud over X's bid to show graphic stabbing footage, as conservative senator shares footage](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-23/albanese-musk-feud-x-removal-stabbing-footage/103756722), Albanese talked about Musk's ""arrogance"" and sowing ""social division"".

There are so many complications, starting with the physical ones of pregnancy and birth (too many to even be aware of them all), then PPD, psychosis, your child might very well be disabled, throw family issues and illnesses into the mix, financial instability (from what I understand and see, a baby will just suck you out of all your money), and lack of socialization and self expression/realization from now on...

Her boyfriend refuses and says that he has no plans on avoiding anyone he calls family, and that family is important to him. He's been close friends with that cousin. I believe you should avoid people you had a crush on before, even if (or especially if) they were your relatives. CMV

I proposed a hypothetical to the AI that uncovered a principle I hadn't heard before. 

Basically, I argued that in the current climate regarding the ability to build artificial intelligences we have entered an age where socialism basically cannot function (Specifically the worker owning the means of production) If I make an AI of value, by myself, provide infrastructure for it, by myself, and either:

A.)Use it purely to create temporal advantages I.E. Everyone does 40 hours of work when I do 2 a week. (Inequity by socialist standards)

Or

B.)Sell the service and have a disproportional income to my neighbors/members of my community and I'm the SOLE worker/owner.


Both of these tings are in direct opposition to a socialist structure. GPT relented on this topic saying that I was correct in my observation and then it appealed to this socialist principal that because the existing infrastructure produced me, that the fruits of my labor belong to the infrastructure, the infrastructure belongs to the nebulous ""Society"" and I own nothing.


I think that this principle is a bit ridiculous based on a few tenants.

1.)Not everyone has equal buy in to society.

2.)You can't spin the globe and escape global influence anymore, meaning that by virtue of being the individual and a given state's monopoly on violence you are subject to the whims of the society you are born into at birth. But none of this is moral.

3.)It's nice when society benefits from someone's created upside, but what happens when someone suffers immense downside for existing in the society? It's not like everyone is gonna chip in and give them $5 to get them by. (For example of a similar concept I would say profit sharing. It's fun to talk about profit sharing when you have nothing or want to belong to a worker owned business, but no one dares talk about LOSS sharing when you have something and lose it.)

I get arguments appealing to social safety nets under socialism, but those are not exclusive to socialism and thus not every compelling arguments.

Basically my belief is that under the BEST possible outcomes for socialism, you can point to most any one thing and go ""Yeah this is nice but capitalism can do it but better."""

Of the three I'd be ok with Ukraine, but tbh the turmoil is those 3 regions is really our fault and we need to stop undermining the security of other superpowers.  


More detail - here's my explanations on the above -  
1. Israel - Now ofcourse the disagreements between Palestinians and Israelis has been going on for the past 70 years and they will probably never agree on anything. But the recent uptick of violence over the past 8 years is because of the Abraham accords and it's clear one-sided support of Israel. That's our fault, and it was Trump's doing. The fallout is what we've seen transpire over the past 6 months. Israel, and let's be clear here - I'm talking about the crazy right wing Likud party and Netanyahu - are partly to blame for escalating violence in the West Bank and occupying lands that belong to the Palestinians. They need the military aid now, but we really should put restrictions on how that aid is used. I do not like my tax dollars going to the military industrial complex and having American bombs dropped on helpless civilians (mostly women and children) in Gaza.

2. Ukraine - In 2010 Ukraine's then president Yanukovych declared Ukraine must be a neutral state. He did so to protect Ukraine's security from Russia. That was a wise move!! But again, the US had the get involved and overthrow him so we could have a NATO ally right beside Russia. It's our damn fault the Ukranians are suffering right now and we should be ashamed of ourselves. What possible need do we have to expand NATO to Russia's borders? Why unnecessarily provoke Putin into a response? Does our stupid government WANT a war with Russia? What are they doing?? Ofcourse we have to send aid to Ukraine now, because if we don't Russia will definitely decimate the country. Shame on us!

3. Taiwan - Again, why?? Why provoke China? We're doing the same thing in Taiwan that we did in Ukraine. In 5 years China will almost definitely invade Taiwan and don't for one second think  - ""ohh ofcourse they will! They're evil!!"". We've invaded, bombed and killed far more people for far less in the name of ""security"".  


Long rant, but basically we need to vote this current government the F out and replace them with some sensible leaders. What do you think?"

But I don't particularly agree with this. First and foremost that it doesn't erase the damage objectification causes on to women. Second you are just shifting to a new target which again is bad. 

And third.....objectifying and sexualising men is still part of the male gaze. In case you haven't noticed most clients of male prostitutes and strippers are other men. So it doesn't erase the male gaze but other shift the gaze. As in from a straight male gaze to a gay male gaze......which still benefits men and does nothing for women.

I believe sexualization overall must stop and the excuse of ""sex sells"" has been used way too long and is quite outdated. Women are just as sexual yet they have never sexually objectified men. Like ever.

So I think what the media needs to do is stop sexualization overall.

For example, I think anal sex is immoral because your anus is used for defecation. It's not *meant* to be generated. I find out whether an action is meant to be or not by looking at the animal kingdom and analyzing their behaviors. But the one view that doesn't align with the animal kingdom is thst I believe that children aren't meant to have fathers.

If you think about it, babies get more attached to their mothers, at least at first. Often the mother produces milk, which leads the baby to become even more attached to her. But all the father did was impregnate the mother, and doesn't really have a job to do once the deed is done. Of course, you could say that he helps out with raising the children, but that could've happened with literally anyone else who cares for the baby. The baby is Pavloved into associating the secondary parental figure with safety and love, but the mother's bond always goes deeper than that.

I know this is wrong and that someone can and will prove me wrong, so please, by all means, help me out."

I also see a lot of similar sentiment amongst a subset of younger atheists, where they will champion the suppression of religious expression, especially those of the Islamic faith, even if such expressions do not violate the rights of others or have a political motive behind it. For example, in the latest prayer ban saga in the UK, a lot of responses from the public are focusing on religious expression in schools in general, like how Muslim students shouldn't be allowed to pray, or wear hijab, and so on. There is this lingering atmosphere amongst younger atheists that religious folks _should not be_ religious and should abide by atheism."

They might also think they're non-binary because they want to be different (that sounds far fetched but I've seen it happen before) 


Another thing I've noticed is that tomboys and tomgirls are hardly ever talked about anymore while things like trans and non-binary are very well know and talked about a lot in media, which could and has make/made a lot of tomboys/tomgirls think they're non-binary

I'm a tomboy, when I was younger (around 8-13) I behaved in ways that would be considered ""boyish"" and I still do, I even joked about getting my boobs cut off because I didn't want to be a girl, when I was 9 I cut my hair short (pixie cut) and had it like that until I was 14 (after that I let it grow out and now I have medium length hair)

I don’t believe all white people are racist. I am white myself and I despise racism and I’m a colorblind egalitarian. I don’t see skin color in anyone.

My dad and grandparents lived in a neighborhood starting in the 1970s and until 2013 in Flint,MI and my grandparents have absolutely despised racism their whole lives and are and were colorblind egalitarians even before the civil rights movement. They refused to leave even in the 1970s afraid they would be involving in white flight. My dad would try to play with other children in the neighborhood who happened to be black in the 1980s and they would bully him because he was white and grown adults would yell slurs and curse him out when he was 5 years old. My dad and aunt and his parents had been harassed by their neighbors who were black for being white and their neighbors yelled slurs at them and had their house and property vandalized. We’re all equal humans that all do shitty things. I do think white supremacy is a huge problem even in 2024 but white people who absolutely despise racism get harassed in neighborhoods like that. It’s ignored by society. White tribes in Northern Europe in the antiquity were treated like shit by the Romans which should be also teached along with all other racism that is equally shitty.

Most of the Palestinian territory is in the West Bank and not Gaza. The Palestinian authority is the ""formal"" representative of the Palestinian, and its not involved at all at with the Gaza war. The Gaza war is between Israel and Hamas. Hamas is not fighting for the West Bank or for a Palestinian state, it is fighting as an Iranian proxy. Just like Israel isn't at war with Lebanon, but at a war with Hezbollah. Israel isn't at war with Yemen, but with the Houthis. The one country Israel is in fact at war with, is Iran (and recently they attacked each other directly).

I don't think it's right to justify what happens in the West Bank with what happens in Gaza. Building Israeli settlements in the West Bank is not justified by the kidnapping of Israeli citizens. Israel can be right in Gaza and have the right to defend itself, and wrong in the occupation of the West Bank. Palestine can be right in the unjust treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and wrong about firing rockets into Israel. 

I think it's reasonable to say that an unconditional ceasefire will mean Hamas remains in power in Gaza. That means that two parts of Palestine will be ruled by two different entities, therefore lowering the probability of a unified Palestinian state. 

What I would like to see is, instead of a ""Ceasefire Now"", is an effort to establish the Palestinian Authority in Gaza instead of Hamas, and start a process for forming a Palestinian state based on territorital swaps, a peace contract, and removal of Iranian influence on Palestine. I think ""Ceasefire Now"" is simply equal to ""Bloodshed Later"". There cannot be a ceasefire anyway with the hostage crisis.

In short, I'm a person that supports the formation of a Palestinian state and rejects the call for an unconditional ceasefire. I think an unconditional ceasefire will be dreadful for the future of both Israeli and Palestinian citizens that will continue to suffer war after war after war, and that's why I do not support it.

Yet all religions are is really a collection of extraordinary (often totally outlandish) claims about the nature of reality, but without the need to back those claims up by scientific evidence. 

So a guy or a group of people make some pretty outlandish claims without presenting any real evidence, typically this involves a higher being (or higher beings), they gather a large following, their followers write down their claims and stories, pass them on throughout the generations .... and an organization is born around those claims and stories .... which we call religion. 

And I'm not even trying to make a case for atheism here. If someone were to simply say "" I think there is likely a higher being for reasons XYZ..."" that's one thing. But religions make some very specific and outlandish claims about who they believe that higher being to be and claim to have direct messages from said higher being, but don't see the need to provide any real evidence. 

Holy books contain stories about how the higher being told its favorite people to destroy cities and even kill babies and mothers, how the higher being wants people to be put to death for working on Saturdays, how the higher being watches everyone but does not like it when gay men have consensual s3x, and the higher being wants women to be obedient. There's special messangers, called prophets who are in direct contact with the higher being, and it has happened some of special those messengers caught a ride on winged horse to heaven. And the higher being likes to really show off sometimes, so it/he/she does things like turn water into wine or help people walk on water. Religions regularly claim totally outlandish things that completely go against everything we know about physics and how reality works. 

I'm not saying one should deliberately pick fights with religious people. But somehow it's the societal standard that when the topic of religion comes up you should be respectful towards someone's beliefs and not point out how ridiculous their beliefs may be.

So if someone told you they're a follower of religion XYZ and told you what they believe in, it would be considered very rude to call them out and tell them you think that their religion is nonsense or immoral. Yet we don't apply the same standards when it comes to other worldviews. For example if I met someone in a pub and they told me they're an anarcho-capitalist, most people wouldn't consider it extremly rude and totally unacceptable if I went like ""no offence but I think anarcho-capitalism is stupid, tell me why you would support that"". Yet if I said the same about Christianity or Islam it would be considered incredibly rude by most people.

I don’t believe in any god because it just seems so improbable. In my personal experience, I remember being about 9 and going to my religious (ex) friend’s house (not friends with him anymore since I was 11, came out to everyone I knew, and he was basically the only transphob!c person in my life except for my grandpa) and I remember a cross that he had up somewhere fell and he instantly thought it meant we’d all go to hell, and so did his parents. They had then called a priest to bless their house the next day, I’ve heard. His parents were also very careful about not swearing because the “lord” is watching. It just seems like bullshit, even when I was like 5 I never believed in any god, because Santa is like any god; always watching, wants you to behave, was invented to make people obey, etc, etc, and we don’t believe in Santa. I’m basically an agnostic atheist tbh, bc it just seems… so, ridiculous for there to be a supreme being, in the sky.

On top of that, for the year TikTok has to find a parent company to find a buyer, all there is going to be even more videos flooding TikTok blaming Biden for TikTok, on top of the anti-Biden videos blaming him for Gaza, justified or not. 

This was a huge political miscalculation that even the most amateur political advisors could have warned Biden about. The signing of the bill could have easily waited till after the election.

It’s essentially pretending that society is meritocratic (it isn’t and meritocracy isn’t even necessarily “good”) as a way to ignore the effects of systemic racism and efforts to correct the disparities it has made (and still makes) in society.

For example, proponents of ""colorblindness"" in hiring (no DEI) would say that the market takes care of racist companies on its own, since a non-racist company will always have access to higher-quality labor at a better price. This would imply that the market is entirely impartial (it’s not) and isn’t operating in a systemically racist society (it is). The market is a system like any other in society - it can be influenced by a myriad of factors. This is one of the reasons why meritocracy is bullshit. The same argument is used by supposedly “progressive” non-Black (but mostly White) groups to disparage affirmative action, DEI, reparations or any form of restitution that will (at least in theory) benefit non-White, but especially Black people. They even use so-called “model minority” groups like Asians to push this agenda (this is not a judgment upon all Asians). Promoting civic nationalism/monoculture in a society that clearly practices systemic racism, even at the highest levels of power, only serves to aid in destroying subcultures (i.e Black culture) without ever addressing the core issues in the first place - aiding the promoters/enforcers of systemic racism.  
  
In short, people who earnestly say they are ""colorblind"" (and are not attempting to hide their racism behind a veil of ""impartiality"") are inadvertently acting exactly like the liberals/moderates that MLK talked about in his Birmingham Address - the “fox” to the right-wing “wolf” that Malcolm X mentioned."

College also has other purposes like career advancement,job security,job satisfaction,etc. But the main purpose of attending college and earning a degree is so you can earn an above average salary. College is supposed to be sort of like an investment. You spend a lot of money and time to earn a degree but the job you get after college should pay you two times more than the money you spent on a degree. Undergraduate loan debt averages about 29,400 that means the job you get after college should pay at least 58800. Ideally more since the average salary in the US is about 59,428.

If someone chooses to major in something like Painting they probably won’t make an above average salary. Also to become a professional painter you don’t need a degree you can learn new painting techniques on YouTube for free. Many Professional Painters do freelance rather than work for a company this means a painter charges by the hour. A painter can charge 100 per hour if they want to but who is going to book them so most painters charge about 20-40 an hour. Many professional painters do painting as a side hustle rather than their main job. A professional painter makes about 44k a year that is well below average. It would take around 2-3 years for the painter to pay off their student loans but they will still be making 44,000 a year for the rest of their lives unless they pursue a different career. There is not a lot of career advancement in painting. 

Someone could even pursue a degree in education to become a teacher. In the United States ,School systems have to pay their teachers at least 60,000 a year. This is still very low for the responsibilities that a teacher has but it is above the average salary in the US. There is also a lot of career advancement in the educational field. Someone can work as a school counselor, school administration(principal,assistant principal,etc.),someone can also work directly for the superintendent. Jobs that work directly for the superintendent tend to make around 70k plus. Also if someone wants to become a teacher they can’t become a teacher without a bachelors degree.

The main purpose of college is so you can earn an above average salary. Also if the career you want to pursue requires a degree that is another reason to go to college. No painting position is going to require a degree. Most painting positions are freelance and make about 44k a year which is well below average. Most if not all art professions offer zero career advancement also. Someone would be better off working at McDonald’s for the rest of their lives at least McDonald’s offers a lot of job security and you will still have the opportunity to advance your career as a manager or even a corporate position.

It made my day.  That same day but earlier I wore a jean skirt to school since it was hot, I had to go to the nurse for a bandaid and the girl who was also waiting there said she liked my outfit. 

Or when I started my new job one of the female employees said I was pretty and had a cute dimple.

I often see posts and videos about how a guy being short is unattractive, and I disagree. In my opinion, height doesn’t add to anyone’s attractiveness. 

For example, let’s take Tom Cruise. He’s only 5’7, which for a man is below average height and short to the majority. However, he is labeled one of the most attractive male actors by women. His height does not erase his other features, which cancel out his height. He’s still a good looking guy, great body and masculine. He has no problem attracting women considering he’s had 3 wives in the past, and the a heartthrob back in his day.

Or let’s look at it the other way around, Tom Hanks. He is 6’0, above average height for a man but he is not considered as much of a celebrity crush as Tom Cruise is. Yes, he’s taller but that doesn’t make up for the rest of his characteristics. Personally, I do think Tom Hanks is attractive when we was around my age (I’m 18) but the majority did not.

This goes to show that height does not determine if someone is less or more attractive.  I prefer to date men who are either my height or just slightly taller, but I can still find shorter guys to be attractive looks wise, and that doesn’t mean that every tall guy I see is attractive to me. Overall, short guys can be just as hot as the taller ones and even so you should still be treating people with respect no matter what they look like.

Thanks for listening."

As to why would the truth be hidden? They do not want it to come out that their heritage and their ancestor's ""achievements"" is all based on lies.

I am not belittling the actual achievements or the artistic talent of ancient Egyptians (they were indeed very creative and skillful), but they did not do everything modern archeology claims they did.

Fact is, the vast majority of the stonework in Egypt simply couldn't have been done by brutishly pounding on granite with diorite balls, using copper chisels, or rudimentary copper saws.

The original people/culture that built the pyramids, the sphinx, and countless other artifacts were completely lost to history by the time ancient Egyptians settled there and repurposed them."

I think that debates should have mute buttons controlled by mods or by the audience or something. The notion that people can just shout over one another is just absurd.

First let us assume that Ukraine emerge victorious and manage to keep its pre-war borders (I really doubt Russia would accept any peace that would force them to cede Crimea ).Obviously,if Ukraine was defeated,Ukraine would become less stable and enter a political and economical crisis,because Ukraine would lose its coast,which is vital for the ukrainian economy.

Assuming such a victory,Ukraine would be broke .First,Ukraine would have to pay for the weapons ,as most of the aid is in form of bonds,that shall be given back one day.

Secondly and more importantly,Ukraine would need to rebuild her cities.The cost would dwarf the weapons cost,with approximatively 486 billion dollars needed over the next decade.Considering corruption,as well as the war not stopping for a long time,the final cost will most likely be much worst.It is even more disastrous if one take into account that the ukrainian economic model rely on its coast,which is one of most exposed regions of Ukraine.The coast concentrate most ukrainian industry.As such ,Ukraine will lack money.

Thirdly,Ukraine has a terrible demography,with in 2020  a rate of 1.43 births per woman.Ukraine also lost more than 100 thousands soldiers according to US estimates.Compounded with immigration,Ukraine will become an nation with an high average age,and will have difficulty to sustain its old population ,as retiree don't contribute much to the economy and will put a strain on the active population due to the need to sustain them.With a shrinking population ,Ukraine risk to suffer more and more pression from its neighbors or the great powers,as it will possess less soldiers,and a smaller economy.

Last but not least,asssuming an Ukrainian victory,with Russia fleeing with a bloody nose,Ukraine would appear useless to Nato.While it would continue to receive weapons,it would never join the alliance considering Turkey would want not to displease Russia too much.Ukraine would never be allowed to join the EU,considering it would be broke and it was already extremely poor before the war,with a gdp per capita of 4,827 thousands dollars,which is pathetic even compared to Russia 12,593 thousands dollars of gdp per capita.Considering how the worlds debtors,be it China,the USA or the EU are streched to their limit,it would have great difficulty to obtain any loan.

As such I think that Ukraine is doomed to become completely dysfuntionnal after the war.

At the very least, it should be taboo to post pictures/videos of children until they are about 3-5 years old and can speak in full sentences (Ideally I think the age should be more like 7 because even if a 3 year old can speak, they are unlikely to understand the implications of the Internet and social media). Before that they cannot agree to whether they want their lives public on the Internet or not. Children are people not belongings and should be able to exercise their right to privacy until they are old enough to speak and have their own opinions.

One of my friends is a mother who is the parent of two young boys (13 and 11). But if you saw her social media profiles, you would think that she only had one son (the 11 year old).

Something like the long-drawn boring 40 hour school week is unpleasant in the form of boredom, and an action like reading a book to pass the time, is not particularly enjoyable compared to things like video games, but it will avoid whatever unpleasantness drove you to do said activities, meaning it will fall into B. 

At this point I’d say “if it isn’t fun in some way, it isn’t worth doing”, but then I would likely run into the “what about avoiding unpleasantness?”

For example, taking melatonin during the day is not enjoyable, but say, your computer malfunctioned and it broke. Sleeping this off would otherwise be a waste of good time that could’ve been used to maximize happiness, but in this case, falls under B by avoiding unpleasantness, and is a worthwhile action

Tasks such as work or school, are not enjoyable, and therefore not worth doing, It guarantees future gratification but is overall a negative due to the future gratification not sufficiently making up for the boredom already experienced, as the boredom itself was a negative that cannot be dodged. If is is necessary to sustain life, as in the case of working, then it simply means life isn’t worth the trouble.

But all I know is that I can repeatedly watch MacDonald do his Bob Dole and I never stop laughing.

From his voice to his mannerisms to his repeated use of “Bob Dole” I just find everything about Norm’s impression to be so gut busting funny. 

I also always like the fact that even Dole himself found it funny and even came on SNL couple of times.

So CMV, is there any reason why I should think any other impersonation was actually better? "

and we gave every person 100 square meters we could still fit everyone inside the state of alaska so space is not an issue..

The main problem (to me) seems to be our incapability of handling resources.

There's more cattle on earth than every other land dwelling animal combined (by mass) and we have to feed them all just for a small portion of people to then eat that cattle. 
So there would be enough food for everyone as well if we wouldnt feed that food to our food.

Money is a big problem.. or more precise, the fact that we allow 1% of the people to own almost 50% of the money and we dont even try to counteract that by maybe taxing inheritance or even capping it at like 5billion bucks or whatever. we just watch how they accumulate more and more of the total wealth while we just print and print more making our money worthless while they always keep enough to keep things as they are. 

quick fact: before WW2 there was this Rockefeller guy that owned half of the money. today its not 1 guy but 2000 people (everyone owning more than 1billion) but its the same effect. 
Buying power of many currencies in first world countries is at a similar level as 1930.
Procentual amount of private people holding credits compared to companies is at a similar level and many other indicators as well that tell me (im a mechanic so I dont really know too much about that stuff) that we are getting to a point where the only thing saving us is either we get our shit togethet and start sharing wealth with everyone or 1/4 of the population has to die like last time. Obviously i know that, like last time, they wont share and its easier to get rid of a large junk of humanity.

So in conclusion: world is not overpopulated but we are to much people for the world we created.
please CMV because I get shit on everytime I try to have a discussion about this.

0,2024-04-24,CMV: The GOP has so many advantages that it’s inexcusable that there is ever a Democratic trifecta ,u/Kalvin-TL,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ccemxz/cmv_the_gop_has_so_many_advantages_that_its/,changemyview,"
When looking at the US government as a whole, I can’t help but look at the GOP as an institution that gets the advantages we typically see in hybrid regimes such as WWI Germany. It’s baffling that there is ever a Democratic trifecta. We can look at it branch by branch 

THE WHITE HOUSE

They don’t even need the popular vote. They haven’t won the popular vote since Lebron was a rookie and the iPod shuffle was the cutting edge of technology. The last time a non-incumbent Republican won the popular vote was before the premier of Seinfeld.

Biden won by nearly 5 points/7 million votes and he barely scraped by the Electoral college with 40k combined votes. Democrats need a convincing walloping or they lose by default 


THE SENATE 

This one I just see as unarguable. North Dakota gets as many electoral college votes as California. You can point out smaller blue states in comparison to large red ones, but it’s pretty clear this is an imbalance in favor of the GOP. 5/7 states with only 1 house rep are safe red. 


THE HOUSE 

This one is the least questionable, but still. It’s the conservative justices that have been most adamant about not addressing partisan gerrymandering. They’ll strike down racial gerrymandering when it’s blatantly obvious but that’s it. And there’s good, or I guess pragmatic, reason for that. 

You can say both parties gerrymander. That’s true. In the same way, both I and my uncle drink - but we both stop altogether he’ll be dead in a day and I’ll be fine. The conservative justices know this even if they won’t express it. 

That summarizes the structural advantages they have. We also see that their coalition, while having a lower ceiling than the democrats, is far more homogenous. No matter how you slice it: Racially, income wise, religious beliefs, educational attainment, etc.  They can give their base what they want, even if it’s symbolic, because they don’t need to do the juggling act of the Democratic Party. And their voters are still, broadly, higher propensity. 

This all paints the picture of a party that leans on and benefits from every counter-majoritarian part of the constitution. With all these advantages it is insane that the democrats ever get a trifecta. It’s like bowling with the bumpers up and you still get a gutter ball

The 8 hour work day is a guideline at many jobs (obviously not counting jobs like retail, restaurants, etc. that work in shifts where you *must* work from Time A to Time B) but I see so many people on reddit saying that if you're working even 15 minutes less than that guideline, you deserve to be fired (see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/1cc6p7o/my_boss_confronted_me_about_only_working_7_hours/)).  
The way I view a salaried job is that they assign you a role and responsibilities. Why should it matter how long it takes you to fulfill those responsibilities/deliver requested deliverables if you're fulfilling them in a high quality, timely manner?   
As some people point out - there is always more work to be done, and I agree with this. But if the company wants you to do more work than is defined within your responsibilities or deliverables, they should be paying you more to reflect that.  
Work to live, not live to work. We should be favoring opportunities that allow us to work less and I'm disappointed to see so many people villainizing people who are able to work less than 8 hours a day, and claiming they're somehow abusing the company.

Curious why people are so eager to be slaves to a company they don't owe anything extra to - you're being paid to do the work, you're doing the work in less time than 8 hours. As far as I'm concerned, that extra time is your's to do what you wish. "

Every time I hear someone try to disprove either of these theories, they use inaccurate information, strawman arguments, and other science to disprove these ideas that were confirmed using the same scientific method. 

Some examples: I will hear people who don't believe in evolution say things like ""evolution is just a theory, so it isn't a fact."" Which is a terrible argument because the word theory in science is used differently than it is used in every day conversation. A theory is a hypothesis that cannot be rejected because all of the data and research indicates that it is true. Gravity is a theory, germ theory is a theory, plate tectonics are theories, this argument is never used against any of those theories, so it seems incoherent to use this argument against evolution. 

""Microevolution is real, but macroevolution isnt."" For the sake of this argument, people will say that microevolution is the changes within a species that occur from ""something"" to allow for adaptations to ensure survival and reproduction in an individual, but this could never happen on a larger scale. For some reason people who argue against evolution seem to think that random mutations don't make sense to them, therefor they cannot actually happen. I'm not exactly sure what mechanism they think drives microevolution, but they don't think it's mutation. On top of that, what mechanism would allow microevolution, but stop macroevolution from occurring? (Also, these two terms ""micro and macro"" evolution are meaningless because it is the same thing just on different time scales).

""You cannot see evolution in real life, so it can't be real"" i have personally witnessed evolution in a lab setting multiple times whether it is looking at bacteria evolving and immunity to antibiotics, or looking at drosophila changing their genes over generations. We also have plenty of examples of populations being cut off due to some sort of weather event, or man influenced event which lead to massive changes in the phenotype of these organisms. One example is a group of anoles who were separated by 4 islands and each population evolved different traits. Some had longer legs for running on the forest floor, some had large, sticky toe pads for living on large leaves and in trees. 

How to change my mind: demonstrate that you do not believe in evolution, but you understand what it is and how it is taught. As well as, describe why you do not believe in it. "

In Japan, medical training begins directly after Highschool. High school graduates will enroll directly into medical school and complete six years of medical training. After medical school they complete at least two years of residency. The minimum amount of years it takes to become a physician in Japan is 8 years. That is still a lot of years but significantly shorter than the years it takes to become a physician in the US.

To become a physician in Spain students enroll in medical school directly after high school for six years. After graduating from medical school they can practice as a physician. In the US aspiring physicians must first obtain a bachelors degree, then go to medical school then go through a residency program. The minimum amount of years to become a physician in the US is 11 years. But it can take up to 15 years to become a physician in the US more if you take any gap years.

The United States is not even on the top 10 list of best physicians in the world nor is it on the top 10 list of best healthcare systems in the world yet the United States has the most rigorous educational requirements for healthcare workers.

There is also a huge shortage of physicians in the United States. There is a shortage of about 50,000 physicians in the US. If you want a better picture of that, there are about 820,000 physicians currently practicing and 145,000 physicians in residency. To compensate for the shortage of physicians hospitals will hire Physician Assistants and Nurse practitioners to assist physicians on every day responsibilities. PA’s and NP’s have a lot of the same responsibilities as physicians but guess what they can’t perform surgery. There is a shortage of about 16,000 surgeons currently.  There are only about 34,000 surgeons in the US currently if you want a better picture. On average there are about 10 surgeons per hospital. This means that if 20 patients are in an emergency room and 11 need emergency surgery that would leave one patient on a delay. This is a very unlikely scenario but if that were to happen that would be an awful thing.

To wrap this up more people would become physicians if the route to become a physician was shorter. If we had more physicians it would decrease the stress on current physicians. Making it less likely for physicians to leave medicine due to burnout. There is absolutely no reason for the route to become a physician to be so long. Especially when other countries produce better physicians than the US with less education."
119,2024-04-24,CMV: I shouldn't join protests against the war in Gaza because I can't judge ahead of time whether they'll devolve into antisemitism,u/dysfunctionz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ccg8wx/cmv_i_shouldnt_join_protests_against_the_war_in/,changemyview,"Please bear with the preamble to my view.

I'm horrified at the tens of thousands of civilians dead in Israel's campaign in Gaza. I recognize that Israel has a right and need to defend itself to prevent something like October 7 happening again, but I don't see how they can realistically destroy Hamas through military action alone and there has to be a better way than leveling all of Gaza, killing 30+ thousand people (most of whom are civilians), and driving many thousands more out of their homes and to starvation.

I also don't support the restriction of movement and basic necessities in Gaza going back decades before October 7, or the illegal settlements and bulldozing of Palestinian homes in the West Bank.

All of this is preamble to say that I am aligned with much of the pro-Palestinian cause and would like to protest for it, but I've seen too many instances of those protests involving hate towards Jewish people in general, not just criticism of the Israeli government. I'm half-Jewish on my dad's side, so I don't identify as Jewish but cannot condone antisemitism, especially not sentiment specifically in favor of Hamas.

I can recognize the difference between legitimate criticism of Israeli government actions and hatred towards Jewish people. Unfortunately I'm seeing some of both getting mixed together by different groups of protesters at for example the Columbia University protests; I live in NYC so these are relevant. I don't think that the presence of a few fringe elements should discredit an overall peaceful protest movement, just as I don't think a relatively small number of looters discredited the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests I joined in. But I am also mindful of the adage, ""If you have 10 people and 1 nazi sitting at a dinner table and willingly eating together, you have 11 Nazis."" I would never want to be that 11th Nazi.

To change my view you could:

* give reasons why it's more important to protest for Palestinian rights even if it gets mixed up with antisemitism
* show that the most toxic people in these protests are no more widespread than the most toxic people in the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests
*show ways that I can determine ahead of time what protests will disavow antisemitism. I have been heartened to see some calmer protests happening in NYC separate from these college campuses, with significant groups labeling themselves as Jews for a ceasefire, I have hope these protests would not condone antisemitism"

Here's why:  
\-Uncurated Selection: Free movie websites boast a vast and uncurated library, filled with hidden gems, international films, and cult classics. This is a stark contrast to the curated and often repetitive recommendations on paid streaming platforms.  
\-The Thrill of the Hunt: The lack of algorithms forces you to actively search and explore, fostering a sense of discovery. Finding that perfect film feels like unearthing a cinematic treasure.  
\-Accessibility & Global Reach: Geo-blocking is usually absent, allowing anyone in the world to access a vast library of films. This democratizes movie access compared to the pay-to-play model of most streaming services.  
However, I understand the counterarguments:  
\-Piracy Concerns: Free movie websites facilitate piracy, denying creators rightful compensation. This is a significant ethical issue.  
\-Quality Concerns: The inconsistent quality of films on these sites can be frustrating, with grainy footage, missing subtitles, and potential malware risks.  
\-Not for Everyone: The ""free-for-all"" approach might not suit everyone. Some prefer a curated experience with high production value.  
Here's where I want my view changed:  
\*Are there alternative solutions for film discovery that don't involve piracy?  
\*Can existing streaming services be improved to offer a more diverse and user-driven discovery experience?  
\*Is there a way to balance accessibility with fair compensation for creators?

  
I'm open to the possibility that my view on the benefits of free movie websites might be outweighed by the ethical and practical drawbacks.  However, I believe the spirit of exploration and discovery they offer is valuable for cinephiles. What do you think?  Can you convince me otherwise?"

I was thinking about this the other day. If they really didn't want to be provocative, they would just slightly adjust what they were saying. Instead of ""men are trash"" ""some men are trash."" Almost everybody would agree with that. ""There are mediocre white men""- I don't like that word personally, but a lot of people would take no issue with the phrase and I agree with the spirit of the phrase. 

It's not like men are trash or mediocre white man are important phrases that are attached to civil rights. They're just slogans and adding qualifiers would improve them significantly because there would be less confusion and less anger.

This means that I get recommended a lot of stuff that just doesn't click with me and sifting through too much noise for the few tracks that connect is quite bothersome. 

Of course, another explanation is that these algorithms suck even for less eclectic tastes. If that's the case, let me know about your experiences with these algorithms. 

Finally, there's a bonus view, that's tangentially related but related nonetheless, that there's not a good way to quickly sort through a pile of songs other than just listening to each one for at least 50% of the tracks time.

Yes, I know depression exist, and yes I know people can’t afford it. I’m not talking about those dudes, those guys who actually want to be clean but can’t due to their circumstances. I have so much empathy and no judgment towards them, and none of what I say applies to guys in these situations. And if you now a guy in this position, please don’t feel discouraged to help if you are able to.

I’m in high school and there’s so many guys who literally smell like absolute dogshit, they don’t take showers, they never brush their teeth, there hair is never washed, clothes have food/drink stains on them, wears no deodorant, just fucking filthy. It’s even worse in the summer to because they sweat so now the stench is even worse. 

And what I noticed, there’s two distinct smells. The first is what I call “boy funk.” Yes I did not create that term but I always heard it being used, and now I know what they mean. Because most of these guys have that “funk” I don’t even know how to describe it, but it’s just musty. The next being “DFO” standing for “Dirty, Feet, Outside.” You know when it’s raining or wet outside and you step in some dirt? Mix that in with smelly feet, and outside air and that’s what you get. It reeks, I physically cannot breathe that stank in for so long I’ll get sick. 

We need to really teach these young boys/men about taking care of their hygiene, because this problem has been going on ever since I was a little girl. The boys in my class almost smelled weird, and it was normalized. Boys need to take care of their hygiene just as much as girls, they should be held to the same standard as girls are when it comes to cleanliness, skin care as well. Skin care is not “feminine” everyone regardless of their gender should be taking care of their skin, I’m tired of seeing guys show their routines and called gay in the comments by a bunch of boys because they don’t want pimples the size of pepperonis.

I've thought this for awhile now and I understand some think my standpoint on this topic is flawed. But I have yet to find a in depth explanation as to why from friends and family. 

I feel shoplifting from big corporations is a net positive, and a valid form of protest against price gouging for basic necessities and unfair retail wages. I don't see in a near-enough future a form of public outcry that could resolve this. When profit is down prices shoot up to compensate, and when those items aren't bought for those high prices (especially on top of this awful grocery inflation) the prices go down. 

I also feel with food waste in general, produce and ""damaged"" food that's perfectly fine will go down when companies are cutting corners to make a profit 


Multi billion dollar corporations pay starvation wages. When I worked at a big box grocery store, I was checking out customer's grocery's while hungry because my food stamps ran out. That shouldn't happen. My store a year previous had thrown truckloads of groceries into a dumpster during a power outage, having police guard it from people trying to dig in the dumpsters. (I live 20 minutes from Portland, rittled with homeless shelters that are overwhelmed and underfunded) 


Jobs may be lost because of shoplifting, I see the loss of jobs as a risk vs reward situation. Regardless of what any political party says there are plenty of jobs available, just not ones that are deemed ""do-able"" to those used to retail. (Not saying retail isn't hard, just that These jobs aren't marketed as beginner friendly  and easy THEN turn out being hell. They're marked as hard, and are hard) as buyer demand goes down profit then prices will go down. Prices can only go up so high as people will start skipping breakfast, eating plain diets, etc.

I understand my view point may be flawed as to one worker losing their job they don't care about the collective.

I often hear black people talking about white people in a negative way. How white people don’t know how to dance, that they don’t season their food, the way white people talk, that white people have thin lips among other things. Peronally, I don’t take offense at any of this except the thin lips comment (I’ve always been insecure about my appearence and lips is one of them), but it’s not really about whether someone is offended or not. I think it’s wrong in general to talk negativtely about a group of people, white people in this case.


I don’t see why black people being oppressed gives them the right to mock white people’s thin lips or the way they talk. However, I think for example the comment about white people not seasoning food is not that deep, I can laugh at it and don’t take offense (I also season my food lol), but I still find it weird how it’s okay for them to still make that comment though. Imagine if someone said something about the way black people cooked, that would be racist, but when black people do the same with white people it’s… justified? The other day I saw two black people on TikTok talking about being annoyed at when white girls are in the beauty supply store? Just why. Why is that okay lol? Sure, someone replied to the video calling it out but I feel like most white people would be scared to call these black people out for being annoyed at white people. Then these white people would be called racist or something. "

Should you stop and wait 500 yards before the point of merge because you think you're so respectful and don't want to ""cut in line"", or do you want to merge efficiently the way the road was designed to do and not be an idiot? 

Everyone should just recline their seat. The person in front of you reclines, you lose 3 inches. You recline, you gain 3 inches.

The only ones missing out will be people who purchased seats at the very back that can't recline. They'll naturally cost less as there will be less demand (IOW, people who are willing to trade less space for a cheaper ticket). 

If you're also 6'7 or enormous, I get it. You won't have space and people might not even physically be able to recline into you. But that's not anyone else's fault.  Airlines aren't there to accommodate extra large humans. It's like morbidly obese people that almost everyone agrees should have to purchase 2 seats. Well, if you're that f'ing tall or big, move up to business/first class or buy the seat in front of you if being reclined into is such a big priority. 

""I should have to do this and that because I happen to be really tall?"". Yes, because no one should ""have to"" cater to your needs because they're around you. You adapt to your environment, not the other way around. Lucky if people are understanding and don't mind, but it should not be expected or demanded, and you're certainly not entitled to it.

The term incel is now used interchangeably with misogynist and whenever a male posts something slightly controversial, the term gets thrown at them as a byword for loser.

But incels are not necessarily women-haters by default. If you're a young man who is ugly or fat or sexually unappealing for whatever reason, life is hard. I say this with some experience. I was a fat, baby-faced young man who didn't bloom until my mid 20s. I'm happy to say that I'm now a reasonably attractive and successful man who has dated a number of wonderful women but this was not always the case. And I never hated women. If anything, I used to put them on a pedestal. I saw them as these amazing, unattainable, exotic creatures. And that is because I had no experience with them. It wasn't until I was able to lose my virginity and actually spend time with them that I realised they're just regular human beings with the same hopes, dreams, flaws and self-doubt that I have.

No young man wants to be involuntarily celibate by choice. We all want love and sex and validation. And when you can't get any of those things through no choice or fault of your own, it really stings. It can make you bitter, it can make you resent the group who are rejecting you. Especially as it feels like the rest of the world *is* getting love and sex and validation, even though that might not necessarily be the case.

And by demonising incels, by ridiculing them and laughing off their struggles, that's when we push them towards dangerous and damaging opinions such as those espoused by people like Andrew Tate. But there are so few people actually addressing incel's problems, there are so few people actually talking to them and their issues, what do we expect. We can't ignore a group's problems and then demonise them for listening to the only people who don't ignore them.

I don't know what the solution is but I do know that throwing incel around as an insult and ridiculing a group of people because they are too unattractive to get a girlfriend is cruel, counter-productive and only pushes young men towards hate and bitterness."

This might vary from region to region but I say this as someone who studies in Asia where the pressure of education is way more. 

I say this in mind with both the teacher and the student. Most of the time teachers are overworked and don't have a fixed work schedules and have to work more than the school hours as well, they have to deal with twice more anxiety, pressure and burnout. This leads to dopamine reduction and because of this you see a lot of old people getting angry easily. 

Due to these symptoms you will see a lot more outbursts on children for the smallest things, both the teacher who would yell at children for the smallest disturbances were usually overworked extremely old teachers, this become less understanding and this leads to a conflict relation between each other then an understanding relationship and teachers become despised."

I want to start off by saying that I don't *want* to hold this opinion. In fact, where I live and in my social circles it's an extremely unpopular opinion, and can quite easily lead to being socially ostracized. Despite this, I've argued myself into this position, and I'd like someone to argue me out of it. To keep things simple, I will not be using any religious arguments here. My position, in short, is this: Unless a woman's life is directly threatened by the pregnancy, abortion is immoral.

While I don't necessarily believe life starts at conception, what does start is a process that will (ignoring complications here) lead to life. Intentionally ending such a process is equivalent to ending the life itself. You commit the ""murder"" in 9 months, just in the present. As a not-perfect-but-hopefully-good-enough analogy, suppose I sell you a car that I'll deliver in 2 weeks. If I don't deliver, I have committed theft. In fact, if I immediately tear up the contract I've committed the theft in 2 weeks, but in the present, to the this back to the original premise.

The analogy isn't perfect because it relies on there being two actors, but consider I promise someone I will do X after they die. Not honoring that promise can still be immoral, despite after death there is only one actor. This is just to show that the breaking of a promise, or abortion of a process, deal, etc. can be immoral even with just one actor.

The point is that you are aborting a process that will, almost surely, lead to life, hence you are, in moral terms, ending a life.

It gets a bit muddy here, since one could define many such ""processes"" and thus imply the argument is absurd, if enough such are found, or if one of them is shown to be ridiculous. However, I have not been able to do so, and pregnancy seems to strictly, and clearly, on one side of this gradient.

To change my view all it would take is to poke holes in my logic, find counter-examples, or show that a logical conclusion of them is absurd."

It may not be the intent but I would argue that the way North Americans use the term ""white people"" is implicitly racist. 

  
What North-Americans mean when they use the term ""white people"" is ""white people of European"" descent. For example North-Americans would typically see Italians (or people of Italian descent) as white but would not refer to a Turkish person as white even though in terms of skin tone both would be equally white.

  
Many people from Arab and Middle-Eastern countries will have different facial features than Europeans. But then again the average Italian person will be more similar in appearance to say the average Lebanese person than to someone from Sweden or Germany. And yet most Americans wouldn't consider Lebanese people white but would most certainly consider Italians white.

  
The term white is supposed to define a persons appearance. And yet the main difference between a white Italian and a non-white Lebanese person for example is not skin color nor facial features.  
The main difference is that Lebanese and Italian people are quite different in terms of culture and religion. Lebanese people share much of their culture with other Arab countries and are mostly of Muslim faith. Italians on the other hand are part of the former European colonialist powers and come from a Judeo-Christian cultural background.

  
Most of the original settlers in the US were white-skinned Europeans of Christian faith. So to be considered white one normally had to be European and of Christian faith. If you were white-skinned but happened to be for example from a Muslim country you certainly weren't considered white. It was a way to create an ""us, the majority"" vs ""them, the others"" narrative.

  
Interestingly a lot of people now considered white weren't always white by American standards. For example Irish people by and large used to be seen as outsiders stealing Americans jobs. They were also mostly Catholics whereas most Americans were Protestants during a time when there was a bitter divide between the two religious groups. So for a long time Irish people were not considered white in the US.

  
My argument is that the term ""white people"" the way it's used in North America is historically rooted in cultural discrimination against outsiders and should have been long outdated.

8,2024-04-25,CMV: It seems obvious to me that Starship Troopers is an anti-fascist movie. ,u/_TehTJ_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ccyqox/cmv_it_seems_obvious_to_me_that_starship_troopers/,changemyview,"I see a lot of people claim Starship Troopers is either a movie without a message, a cool movie about how cool the army is, or in some weird cases a movie that supports some fort of fascism or at least has very heavy anti-immigration/degeneracy message. 

I base my view off Paul Verhoeven’s life story, past movies, and open political views. For those who don’t know, Paul is Dutch and when he was a kid he actually lived under Nazi occupation. Granted he was very young at the time, he was seven when the Nazis left the Netherlands. Paul is a relatively progressive guy, having stated open skepticism with things like the media, military, and private-public partnerships. He often describes his movies as satirical, stating that his aim is often to show how bad things get when selfish people are in charge (like he saw as a kid). 

The movie itself is shot to look like a series internet ads (the movie is from 1997, when the internet was starting to get closer to mainstream), which I think it a way to portray an absurdity of the world of the film. The teachers in the movie very openly tell the students “freedom is bad” and there’s a very large subplot about the government debating rather or not scientifically studying the aliens they fight is a good idea, despite that obviously being a good idea because intelligence is usually one of the most important parts of fighting a war. 

I really can’t see this movie as NOT being explicitly anti-fascist. Yeah it’s also an action movie with some comedy, it’s a good movie, but it clearly has a message that I don’t consider that subtle. Can anyone who doesn’t view the movie this way convince me otherwise? "
29,2024-04-25,CMV: Defendants in a criminal case should be 100% anonymous to the judge and jurors.,u/S_Squar3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ccz51j/cmv_defendants_in_a_criminal_case_should_be_100/,changemyview,"I was recently listening to the crime podcast I enjoy (Sword & Scale) and one of the older episodes I got done with had the defendant being convicted of murder with ONLY circumstantial evidence. While this isn’t exactly a one off situation, it most certainly isn’t ideal to only have evidence that “implied a connection exists” but fails to “connect a defendant to a crime”.

Cases like this (with only circumstantial evidence) can really go either way. It’s not a sure thing for either side. This is a situation, also, where the jurors opinion of the defendant (outside of the evidence presented) could impact the outcome of said case. Of course the jurors are only suppose to use the evidence presented while deciding, but are all human and humans have preconceived preferences, whether it’s conscious or not. This could impact the decision of the jurors either negatively or positively for the defendant.

It’s because of this that I believe the identity of the defendant should be hidden to the judge, and most importantly, the jurors.


**Appearance**

Probably the biggest subconscious preference people may have is the appearance of an individual. An individuals initial appearance can set the tone early on with every thought a judge or juror may have about the defendant. A famous case where the appearance of the defendant mattered to the jurors was the OJ Simpson case.

A white woman killed by a black man. Obviously, OJ went free, but it even later came out from one juror when she said “I knew he was guilty, but this was payback for Rodney King.” The reference there being that Rodney King was unjustly killed by police so this woman wanted to “even the odds” of sorts.

It also doesn’t take a genius to know this goes the other way as well where the defendant being black has negatively impacted the defendants chances of a not guilty decision. Whether you agree or disagree that jurors would use their preconceived opinion of someone’s appearance in their decision to prosecute, you can’t disagree that it exists for people and hiding the defendants appearance will remove the chance of it ever becoming a factor.


**Fame**

Another factor that could impact a criminal case is the fame a defendant has. This is important currently with Donald Trump on trial. There’s no doubt that every juror knows who he is and, considering the cult like attitude his presidency birthed, a lot of people either really love or really hate him. Both sides are be incredibly hard to convince to push their feeling of him aside and only use the presented evidence.

**How to change my mind**
There are surely other factors that this could eliminate, but these are the two I could actively think on.

To change my mind, you would need to convince me that not only would this 1) Not help at eliminating preconceived notions a judge or juror may have, but also 2) Actively hurt the ability to prosecute criminals solely based on the presented evidence."

I'm not even talking about necessarily acting upon it but the moment you think it it seems to be the problem. 

So we as a society recognize the guy whipping his kid, like taking an actual whip and cracking it across his kids butt has no business raising a child. A woman who has no emotional resource to raise a kid shouldn't be raising a kid isn't frowned upon. For example she has custody but often doesn't interact with her kid and drops the kid off at babysitters would, I suspect be seen as neglectful and should give the custody to the father who works from home. So I think few if any would have issue with this  

Yet when you bring up the idea that if you don't have the financial resources you should hold off that's classism. 

Is saying the drunk guy should sober up before raising or even having kids ableism? Should we let everyone, including the raging violent ones have kids? Morally? are we really gonna be like, yeah that's fine, the dude with the potential to hurt a child can raise a kid.

0,2024-04-25,CMV: Many Jordan fans/LeBron haters have become delusional and irrational in regards to the GOAT debate and don’t appear to engage in any critical thinking,u/beepbop24,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cd05ut/cmv_many_jordan_fanslebron_haters_have_become/,changemyview,"Before I explain why, I want to make a couple of clarifications:

1. Claiming that Jordan is the GOAT, is completely rational. Claiming that LeBron has x, y, and z flaws, while perhaps petty, may still be fair arguments (depending on what you’re talking about). I’m not arguing that LeBron is the GOAT in this post. What I am arguing however, is that some (many) of the points Jordan fans make nowadays are at best severely cherry-picked and misleading, and at worst not even rooted in truth. I will bring up some of those points in a bit.

2. I realize this is not all Jordan fans. But there’s a lot. Particularly on Facebook. The reason I came here is because I feel at least on Reddit, the Jordan fans (for the most part) are at least reasonable, so I’m looking for a more objective opinion on the matter I guess. I want someone to explain to me how some of the following points I’m about to make engage in any sort of critical thinking. 

Now that you hopefully understand where I’m coming from a little better, here are just a few of the arguments I’ve seen that I’m referring too:

1. There are legitimately people claiming that LeBron, “needed the play-in games” to get to the playoffs. Which is an asinine claim, given the fact that all 3 times the Lakers won the play-in game, they were either the 7 or 8 seed coming into it, so they would’ve made the playoffs with or without a play-in. In fact, this year the play-in hurt them if anything, because without it, they’re likely playing against OKC instead of Denver. This point seems like a stupid one to bring up because it’s so obvious, but it really isn’t that obvious for some reason for a lot of people. The fact that the point is even made in the first place sounds like it’s just haters grasping for straws. Even if it was true, so what? Dude made the playoffs like what, 13 years in a row before joining the Lakers? But god forbid he needed an extra game to get there in year 21 (which again, he didn’t need anyway). 

2. I’ve also seen posts now, comparing John Stockton to LeBron, with many Bron haters saying Stockton was better. The reason these posts were made were to show that Stockton was truly the better “longevity” player. Now don’t get me wrong, Stockton has set some really impressive records and is rightfully a hall of fame player, but come on. I shouldn’t have to say that LeBron has 4 more MVPs, 4 more championships, 4 more finals MVPs, several more all-star appearances, more minutes played, about the same number of games played (LeBron will have more come next season), along with 20k more points than Stockton, but here we are. All LeBron haters care about is that Stockton has more 82 game seasons, which don’t get me wrong is impressive, but again, this is a clear example of LeBron haters finding literally anything they can to say player X is better than LeBron. And I wouldn’t normally care because we all know that argument is so stupid, but so many people legitimately believe this, which is extremely concerning. 

3. Just in general, these graphics of extremely cherry-picked facts. One recently I saw read as follows, “40 point games shooting over 50%. Jordan 141, Kobe 62, LeBron 55.” Not that this point is wrong, but again, it was probably intentionally chosen because it makes LeBron not look as good. But anyone with half a brain understands that this stat is, for the most part, meaningless and cherry-picked. I mean simply do “40 point games” and you probably don’t see a whole lot difference. In fact if it was just 40 point games, I bet it would actually make LeBron look worse, as LeBron has a better field goal % than both Jordan and Kobe throughout their careers. So that means it’s way more likely Jordan and Kobe had a lot more 40 point games shooting under 50%. But I digress. You get the point. Jordan fans/LeBron haters are just finding any stats they can, including ones that aren’t really meaningful and very specific. This is because, in their minds, they view the GOAT debate as following: “Jordan will always be the GOAT, so I’m going to find stats that prove it.” Whereas if we were assessing the GOAT debate properly, it would be, “Both of these players have a lot going for them. I’m going to look at the stats and then make my decision”. 

4. They overanalyze every single game he plays, particularly ones he loses. Look I’m not going to deny that LeBron has choked a couple of times in his career (Dallas in 2011 was the major one). But it seems like ever since then, although perhaps it started a little before, the boomers on Facebook, among others, have circlejerked themselves into a narrative that LeBron is a loser. That’s simply the narrative they (with help from Skip Bayless) have created. Anytime LeBron wins, it comes with an asterisk in their minds. But anytime he loses they’ll hold it against him forever. I get each of their respective finals’ record doesn’t help LeBron, but also I never see Jordan fans even acknowledge the fact that LeBron’s teams went into the finals as underdogs  most of the time. They don’t want to acknowledge that in Jordan’s era, the Eastern Conference was stronger, so his final’s opponents were probably slightly easier than LeBron’s. They don’t want to add any context to their argument. They just want to shout “6-0” vs. “4-6” because it looks really good for them. But they “forget” that LeBron won the whole damn thing 4 times. They act like Jordan won every year of his career, but he didn’t. They don’t want to acknowledge when Jordan didn’t win, and they don’t want to acknowledge when LeBron did win, or did something special to win. Instead they just want to find an excuse for it and/or only talk about the times he lost. 

5. With the increased use of social media, the Jordan fans/LeBron haters live in their own bubble of information (which I already mentioned earlier), but also this has made them not even watch and analyze LeBron properly. For as much as Jordan fans like to say that LeBron fans never saw Jordan play, therefore they can’t critique them properly, I think it is equally true that Jordan fans haven’t *actually* watched LeBron play. Instead, they just get fed lowlights of LeBron. They only see a few cherry-picked moments, and use those moments to define his career. I doubt that many of them actually watch his games in full (evidenced by the fact that NBA ratings keep going down). And if you ask them have they seen a highlights video, they’ll just say, “I don’t need to, I’ve seen all I needed to already.” I get critiquing someone for having a bad performance, but I’ve never seen a player scrutinized for every little thing they do as much as LeBron. 

There’s so many more points I haven’t even brought up, but I hope you get the idea. And again, this post may *seem* like it’s simply a plug for LeBron, but it’s really not. This is simply how skewed the debate has become, to the point where if I’m calling out logical fallacies and willful ignorance amongst Jordan fans/LeBron haters, it sounds like it’s an argument that LeBron is the GOAT. This is mostly why the debate has become so toxic. 

In case you really don’t believe me that this isn’t simply a plug for LeBron, allow myself to make an argument that Jordan is the GOAT, in a reasonable manner: 

“Jordan won 6 times during the peak of his career. He won 5 MVPs as well, and made more all-defensive teams than LeBron. He’s one of the greatest scorers of all time, and would’ve easily scored more had he played longer. He also has 2 incredibly clutch shots and was a great team leader when it mattered. LeBron is all-around an amazing player but ultimately Jordan has accomplished just a bit more.”

See, it’s not that difficult. But it’s really hard for me to respect Jordan fans right now when it is evident that they do not want to even acknowledge the other side, and only really care about finding whatever they can to make LeBron look bad. They do not want to engage in any sort of critical thinking. It has become a herd mentality with them that it’s not even a *possibility* for anyone else to be the GOAT. And this is the crux of the problem, because if it’s not even *possible* for anyone else to be considered the GOAT, then they will continue to find things that favor their argument, no matter how crazy, cherry-picked, or untrue they may be, and will normalize those points. 

So, how can you change my view? Quite simple actually: prove to me that these Jordan fans/LeBron haters are engaging in critical thought. Prove to me that they at least acknowledge what the other side has to say. Prove to me that there isn’t a herd mentality. Prove to me they’re not just trying to cherry-pick facts. Prove to me that these people are being reasonable, and I will change my view. "

""You are under no obligation to stay in a sexless marriage"" except you are?? You made a promise to spend your life with another person, because you wanted to wake up with them every morning, take trips with them, maybe raise kids with them, whatever. Not to fuck every Tuesday and Saturday. Fine, no one can force someone to stay in a marriage, but if someone leaves over just sex when everything else in the relationship is ""great,"" they have a shit reason.

  
The argument of wanting to feel desired by a partner is understandable - if a decline in sex comes with the death of all other intimacy, it makes sense why the relationship would be at an end. But there's no reason why it should. If partners still communicate that they find the other attractive (as simple as a ""hey, you look so hot today""), that if they want they hug/kiss/cuddle/whatever, and they are each others' best friend and can have hard conversations together, the relationship is far from broken. No one NEEDS to have sex. Can it be fun? Sure! But do you have to have it? Definitely not. People are fully capable of taking care of their own biological needs in this department.

  
And because I know people are going to say this, no, I am not asexual and applying my viewpoint to everyone else. I certainly find people desirable and sex is fun and satisfying in its own way, but I would be completely fine with never having it again if my partner didn't want to.

0,2024-04-25,"CMV: capitalism is capitalism, there is no such thing as “cronyism” or “corporatism”",u/Etzarah,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cd2km3/cmv_capitalism_is_capitalism_there_is_no_such/,changemyview,"The definition of capitalism is an economic system in which trade and industry are privately owned and pursue profit.

The most common refrain of people defending criticisms against capitalism is to say that it has actually devolved into “cronyism or corporatism.” This is likely by comparison of modern conditions to some ideal of a free market.

However, there is no logical reason a capitalist would not utilize their power to influence the government, if that influence leads to greater profit. And there is no reason a capitalist would not expand their corporation to the greatest extent possible, collude with other corporations, or engage in illegal activities, if doing so would lead to greater profits.

This isn’t meant to be a moral argument; in the event that doing good would lead to greater profit, for example donating to charity for tax credit or treating an employee well to retain them, these actions would also be obvious.

Capitalists and capitalist organizations pursue profits at all costs and in all avenues, and have no reason to maintain a “competitive market” when the option for dominance is available to them.

An idealistic free, hyper competitive market is not capitalism, but capitalism with government restrictions that force it to remain competitive. 

Of course, this reality is the one we find ourselves in, where there is a capitalist private sector regulated by a popular government, with much corruption and conflict between the two. In a world in which capitalism was unregulated, capitalists would simply use violence to create conditions which yield the greatest possible market control and profits.

Our current state of existence is the only realistic implementation of capitalism, an imperfect pursuit of the ideal of a free market, which is in fact a calculated restriction of capitalism. There is no “cronyism” or “corporatism” spoiling the purity of it.

As long as it doesn’t lead to aggressive (or even passive aggressive) behavior and you’re not repressing it into physical maladies, you should be allowed to be angry in the face of injustice. 

Being angry doesn’t hurt you. And a lot of the time, it’s justified. If someone harms you or someone you love, it makes sense you’re angry and you should be allowed to feel it without other people telling you “you need to forgive” or to radically accept. 

Context: I lost a family friend in a hometown mass shooting 1.5 years ago. Whenever it (and other mass shootings) gets brought up, it makes me angry. I don’t act on the anger, I just feel it. I feel like I have a right to be mad at a mass murderer and how the press treated survivors. I feel like I have a right to be angry that someone turned my hometown into a war zone. I feel like I get to be angry someone murdered someone I loved. I don’t mind feeling angry. It just feels like energy and makes me feel stronger in my morals. I’ve grieved, I’m not ignoring emotions by being angry. I’m just angry someone made a decision to shoot up a crowd and murder 7 people. 

Yet everyone keeps pushing forgiveness.
My therapist keeps pushing detachment and radical acceptance. I don’t feel like I’m suffering from being angry in this case. The anger is very in line with my values, it doesn’t make me act mean or bitter or snap or engage in any harmful behaviors. It’s just an emotion that comes and goes, and in this case it’s pretty justified. 

So CMV, convince me anger is a problem, that I should give up the thoughts “she shouldn’t have been murdered” “she deserved more” “he should not have taken out his rage on an innocent crowd”

More Context: from my religious background, righteous anger in line with reason is not a sin, the passion by itself is not a sin, nor is wanting justice (aquinas, summa theological)"

And that's only what I know. There may be many other factors too, which for now I don't care to mention in this text you're reading.

Meanwhile, people are only putting their faith and the Very destiny of the Future generations of our children upon the hands of the so called renewables, which takes much much more area of land in comparison to other sources of Power, can't operate 24/7 the infamous Dunkenflaute.

Nuclear takes much less area of land, whislt surely It is very expensive at First, It can pay itself within years operating and It can last for decades until major refurbishment is required.

I don't know where the people are with their heads on denying nuclear any serious budget when It is our only chance of ininterrupt flow of electricity and economic growth. We may electrify some processes that currently requires burning fuel, reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

In recent years I’ve observed my peers’ dialogue on prescription medication and it seems that everyone is *very* pro-medication, I think largely due to the (very real) mental health crises that a lot of us are facing. However, I also observe that there’s a leftist tendency to  completely support the use of medication and balk at the idea of trying literally *anything else* to remedy one’s problems. However, at the same time, these are the same people who are (very rightfully) criticizing big pharma and its role in capitalism and exploitation of people.


Take this example: when it comes to mental health, people will warmly welcome the opportunity to commit to taking a pill every day, indefinitely, and paying for said pill. They completely buy in.

And then when someone suggests that they exercise or eat healthy or try getting less screen time or literally ANY lifestyle change, people get offended and cancel whoever said that to them. Even though lifestyle changes can sometimes solve people’s problems and are often worth trying first, and don’t make someone an indefinite customer of big pharma… people get so offended and judgmental even if someone simply mentions the idea of trying at-home or other things before delving into pharmaceutical reliance. Someone in my family who’s my same age (late 20s) even said she wanted to fire her doctor for suggesting lifestyle changes after she went to see the doctor for a recent bout of migraines she was experiencing.


Putting this here because i think my friends IRL would completely cancel me for this. Change my view here!

Also, before anyone asks: i am very pro-vaccine! I get all the Covid boosters and encourage everyone in my life to do the same. The same goes with serious health conditions, like cancer, obviously those are situations where medication is non negotiable for survival. I just think for other things that could be solved through lifestyle changes, leftists are far too ok with an immediate reliance on big pharma despite their criticism of it. "

Instead, G20 finance ministers are proposing a 2% tax on paper wealth.",u/AstridPeth_,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cd7o6p/cmv_support_for_taxing_the_rich_would_be/,changemyview,"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2024/apr/25/billionaires-should-pay-minimum-two-per-cent-wealth-tax-say-g20-ministers

If go to Davis or ask billionaires like Gates or Buffett, you won't hear much opposition to redistribution. Many billionaires like Gates himself signed the giving pledge with this in mind. Mckenzie Scott has already donated 11 digits and going.

But everyone, rich or not, will oppose taxing notional wealth.

Take the newly minted ""billionaire"" Donald Trump. He's in the Forbes list as a tech billionaire. His company, Truth Social, has a market capitalization of $5B and he owns 30% or something. But anyone who knows a thing or two about how financial markets work knows that Trump isn't nearly as rich as that, because the moment he will try to sell his stock, the price is going to collapse. He's only rich because in the very small slice of the float of the market capitalization of the company that trades, a small amount of people are super optimist and shorts are being squeezed. It'd be totally unfair and counterproductive to tax people based on paper wealth. 

This argument goes even further. Some of the biggest sources of wealth creation today technology is super prone to bubbles. It's prone to low float ""marks"". It'd be super unfair with people to pay taxes on things that other people are marking as valuable, but in reality is a cash burner company or at best generates modest cash.

Now take the case of centimillionaire Vivek Ramaswamy. His company was once believed to have a respectable shot at curing Alzhaimer and people valued it accordingly. Vivek sold a good amount of stock for cash. Regardless of the success of the company, Vivek should be taxed (and he was!). There's where taxes for the rich should focus.

Just 👏 tax 👏 capital 👏 gains 👏 and 👏 dividends.

Obviously there are some issues. Billionaires can go to fiscal paradises (most wealth don't go there. It's just Steve Ballmer holding Microsoft stock on his personal account in the US, just like anyone else). People get loans against their wealth. People structure holding companies to not pay inheritance tax. 

But the solution isn't a 2% tax (how would you value Musk's SpaceX stake? And Musk's X stake?). The solution is less sexy. But it's filling these holes. 

Just one point. You should pay some tax in the notional of asset backed loans. Say that Musk is getting a $500M loan from Morgan Stanley putting $5B in Tesla shares as collateral to pay for his day to day expenses. I think it's completely fair to tax the $500M notional. Create some law like ""If a person or a company fully owned by related people take an asset-backed loan, you need to pay 1% of the loan in Taxes"".

And obviously, you can just increase the marginal capital gain tax. For asset realizations over $50M during the fiscal year, the marginal tax rate is 40%. It's elegant. Don't tax paper wealth.

I am super sure many centrist people would get on-board if that was what being proposed by the left."
19,2024-04-25,CMV: Unschooling is Educational Neglect,u/Constellation-88,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cd7wg1/cmv_unschooling_is_educational_neglect/,changemyview,"Unschooling is an extremist version of homeschooling in which parents allow children to learn and study only what they want to learn and only when they want to study. 

Since the purpose of education is to provide children with the knowledge, skills, and tools they need to build their own best future in the world they will have to live in as adults, allowing a child to dictate the entirety of their study schedule and materials will cause them to not have those tools and thus be neglected educationally. 

Children should absolutely have a say in their education, but they also need certain foundational elements regardless of if they enjoy them or not. Children who hate math and love reading still need basic math skills to survive as adults, and they need beyond basic math skills to attend universities and certain trade schools and attain certain professions or to run their own business. 

Children also need repetition and consistency in order to retain knowledge and skills in their memory. A child who doesn’t want to study science for two weeks isn’t going to remember or retain what they studied in science two weeks ago. They will have to review old materials more than learning new ones. Thus they will not maintain a pace of growth or retain knowledge in a subject if they are allowed to dictate the study schedule entirely on their whims. 

Sometimes learning is like eating your vegetables. They’re healthy, and you have to do it even if it’s not your favorite thing. 

When children become adults, they will have to meet fixed deadlines set by others and have certain skills in order to have a job. Even if they are going to work for themselves, they still will need to meet the deadlines that they promised clients and have communication skills and math skills to run their businesses. In fact, they probably will need more math skills than the average person.

It is not going to change my view to attempt to convince me that traditional education is unnecessary. The prevalence of conspiracy theories on the Internet is proof that having access to information online is not enough to grant people to have the discernment they need to use the information they have access to in a way that allows them to build a healthy life or society. 

Change my view by proving to me that unrolling is going to allow children to have the same (or more) tools, skills, and knowledge that they get from traditional public, private, or active homeschooling education."

Like many feminists who actually hate men s/ about #WhiteTears and ""Ooh sorry whipipo, are you just upset because you have it better than us?"" and a particularly lovely comment on YouTube that I saw just yesterday: ""stfu you just butthurt that we fuck all your white women"". I'm just left baffled by all of this.

For example, my close friends and I, the vast majority of us white, all want and fight for equality and for all races to be equal in society. Obviously that takes work, and obviously there's no overnight fix, and OBVIOUSLY white people do have societal advantages. But WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. Yet when I wrote a review of Black Panther recently, I was suddenly attacked on social media by a large group of girls who know a few of my friends, accusing me of being a racist and that I didn't like the film because, and I quote ""You're white so of course you would hate a black person having some power for once.""

None, and I mean NONE of us, myself included, have any doubt that white privilege exists. And similarly, NONE of us can argue that white people have treated other races well throughout history. We all accept that and are just as disgusted by it as non\-white people, yet for some reason we are continuously lumped in with our ancestors just because of our skin colour. Hmm, making a generalised assumption about a whole people just because of their skin colour? Sounds a little bit racist, if you ask me. But oh, no, because a bunch of people I had no control over hundreds of years ago mistreated other people, I am suddenly a 'coloniser' \(thanks, Black Panther\) and a racist by default purely because I'm white.

Would you assume that all present day Germans are Nazis purely because *some* of them used to be a long time ago? Would you equally assume that all Rwandan people support genocide? No. So assuming that all white people are actively against non\-white people purely because ""that was the norm a long time ago"" is completely absurd.

I feel like I'm going crazy! I think racism is a huge problem, and I think white privilege is a huge problem. Yet the majority of non\-white people seem to actually *blame* me for those sorts of issues in society. What do you want me to do? Start living on the street so I no longer have it better than you? Refuse a job offer because of the possibility a non\-white person was refused the position purely based on their skin colour? Throw away all my material possessions? No, because that doesn't solve the problem, and that's NOT equality. I was born white and I used to think that was just like having a certain eye or hair colour, but as I've gotten older that's taken on a whole new meaning. Now apparently being born white is to be born fundamentally racist and blissfully ignorant to the struggles of other people.

TL;DR \- Just because I have white privilege, that doesn't mean I don't think it's a problem. Similarly, just because I'm white, that doesn't mean I am my ancestors. I completely acknowledge that my ancestors were horrible to other races, but they are long dead and I just want to fight the good fight, despite that no one seems to want me to as I'll just make it worse because I'm white so how could I help in any way. I've already done enough damage, apparently, so it's time to step aside. I also completely acknowledge that racism and white privilege are huge problems and I actively fight against them in my day to day life, but it looks like I've been doomed to a life of non\-white people secretly hating me, assuming I'm a racist, and patiently waiting for me to reveal my true colours, all purely because I'm white, when none of that is the case. It seems like the *only* thing that would convince people that I'm on their side is to build a time machine and go back and slap my ancestors in the face and tell them cut it out."

The best system of government is Meritocracy. Communist governments of countries haven't existed for at least 40 years. And nobody understands what ""Democracy"" is.

In India they have a saying that the British invented Bureaucracy and the people of India perfected it. The comedy show ""Yes, Minister"" gave us some clue as to how Bureaucracy works in Britain.

I don't know who invented Bureaucracy, but it is now found all around the world. Permanent bureaucrats tend have a much greater say in the running of many countries these days than temporary political leaders.

Meritocracy is government by people who are the best available. This makes sense to me.

Communism has pretty well died off worldwide. In the old Soviet Union they used to have a joke that Communism is only 18 km away, and that Brezhnev said that each 5 year plan takes them one step closer to Communism. China and Vietnam are now capitalist. The whole Confucian religion in China is a capitalist religion. Certain countries including France, Israel and several in Africa flirted with the idea of communism for a while but never became communist.

Democracy is ""government by the people"". Well, what else would we be governed by, lizards? Democratic countries have included the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), the Somali Democratic Republic, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam), the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen), the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, and Democratic Kampuchea.

Voting is not a measure of democracy. Voting is becoming more and more a placebo. The president is becoming more and more a way of distracting people from the real mechanism of government. Douglas Adams put it this way ""The President in particular is very much a figurehead — he wields no real power whatsoever. The qualities he is required to display are not those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage."""

It’s great because you can literally learn about anything.  Over the last 2 weeks or so I’ve gone down a rabbit hole and am sort of stuck but still, I can’t just be lost with out having someone explain this to me or change my view.  

My point is that I’ve been listening and I have consistently been wanting a more direct explanation. A lot of the easy to find videos are celebrity astrologers and physicists but finally I found someone who went all in and used all of these words and explained essentially how him and his friend have come up with a ‘simple and elegant’ unifying theory.  

He was good enough to explain how we’ve found out prior theories are wrong, notably how inflation is sort of BS.  Because you have to fit in measurements instead of receiving predictions.  

I guess I would like to have my mind changed that humans ability to conceptualize and communicate, in all forms is a major pitfall and just unfortunate in that we’ll always just invent another particle, or fix the parameters to balance the equation out.  And I find it hard to imagine that even if we can begin to predict things that explain for instance dark energy and black holes,  I’d find it hard to believe that even those predictions are trustable.

I guess this all started with the Three Body Problem on Netflix.  I assume physicists just blame quantum physics for the reason we can’t solve the three body problem but if only we had an equation that fit! 

Everything a human is capable of, including being wrong but thinking their right, all these incredibly smart people from the Egyptians 2000 years ago doing math to Sean Carrol to all the hard working professors and scientists studying and pouring over their work isn’t a waste of time.  And that we aren’t just making up these ridiclous numbers just to number.

312,2024-04-26,CMV: I believe that forced Conscription is akin to slavery and never justified. A society unwilling or unable too generate enough volunteers for its armed forces is not worth defending.,u/dwujd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cdcbrh/cmv_i_believe_that_forced_conscription_is_akin_to/,changemyview,"Conscription is one of the worst infringements on personal life and liberty: First, young people (usually only men, which is a great injustice) are forced to perform forced labor for their government with very little compensation.

People who refuse to perform that forced labor usually are imprisoned for multiple months (if alternative service is available that does not change anything because it is still forced labor and refusing alternative service too usually will mean imprisonment too).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Secondly, it is even worse if that country is at war: Then the infringement upon the rights of the young people is even greater, because now thy are in massive danger to their life. It is also worth noting that conscripts in almost all circumstances very quickly turn into chess figures that is at the government's disposal for their own politics.

The best instances for this are: The Vietnam War (North Vietnam did not attack the U.S. and did not pose a threat - in fact, after they won in 1975 they did not retaliate).

Even Israel's Gaza War, while in principle justified, could be considered to be prolonged by Netanyahu for ulterior motives.

Similarly, the Ukraine-Russia War, while Ukraine is defending itself, their government refuses to even consider accepting giving any territory to Russia, preferring to sacrifice hundreds of thousands young men on the battlefield. The same applies to Russia, which is also willing to send their people into battle as cannon fodder.

Both countries have instituted measures to ban men from leaving the country. Ukraine deployed tens of thousands of soldiers to their borders with Nato countries with orders to shoot anyone trying to leave the country. Hundreds of men have perished trying to escape Ukraine.

This reminds me very sadly of the criminal activities by communist East Germany, which also shot people at the border who tried to escape the country.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In my opinion, these massive infringement upon the rights of individuals bears no justification whatsoever. While I do see the need to ensure national defense, I do not think that if the government, the society as a whole, is not able or willing to institute the necessary measures relying solely on volunteers, then this country and its people are to blame for themselves if they get conquered - because apparently, there were not enough people voluntarily defending it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I would also stress that in modern military technology, there is no real need of conscription because, for example, a strong air force of hundreds of modern fighter jets, as well as drones, plus an army with many tanks, artillery pieces, rocket artillery and similar technology, will beat a large army of men armed with rifles.

The farthest I would be willing to compromise on would be to formally have conscription (for all genders, of course), but if one refuses they will only face a fine, for example $ 1,000, and no other consequences at all. This way, some people who would not join the army on their own iniative, but are not actually opposed to it, would enlist because they formally have that duty. On the other hand, anyone really opposed to conscription would not be held to forced labor nor harshly punished, but basically giving a small contribution to national defense with their money."

Its mostly from American content I consume, however seems a trend worldwide.

For instance, one example of it is the popularity of things like ancestry and personal DNA analysis, claims of ""I'm 42% Scottish, 12% French and 62% poodle"". Other examples tend to point more to pointing out trends in the media - ""81% of Hispanic voters da da da...""

I can understand the historical context, especially with reference to those of African descent and the continuing social struggles that continue on from segregation. 

However, I feel as though the simple act of classification and categorisation that seems very prevalent is a hindrance as it is inherently a form segregation. At this point, I believe that those genetic factors stemming from heritage, outside of healthcare, are largely irrelevant. 

Would it not be a better thing to for the most part ignore it rather than focus in on it? If it was not pointed out, I'm of the opinion some of the problems associated with race might just disappear, or at least be attributed to the usual causes such as poverty, opportunity or education levels."

I want to set the tone that I'm a Single Black Male 30-35. 

I've had some recent run in issues with my dating life that I feel as though it's backwards over the past 5 yrs or less. I'm heavily independent. I work two jobs (medical and restaurant). I can cook. Clean. Pay my bills. Have great sense of style. Well mannered and self caring in the best way. 

My issue is that some of my activities I've been told are red flags in the dating world. 

Said things are:

My closest friends are women. They have men. They have families. I have not had sex with them. We respect each other greatly in high regard.

I do ""couples"" activities by myself. I grocery shop. I got to local mall. I go to the movies by myself. I take long drives my myself. I travel to tourist attractions by myself. I go to farmers markets and local fairs and events by myself. 

I don't lock my phone??? Or I put my phone away when they are in my presence and use it less. (this one I've explained as a matter of focus and I'm not hiding something)

Im comfortable with them not texting me, or I text them for 24-48 hours. We all have a a life to live. It happens, life goes on. 

Low social media presence. I have a Facebook for friends and X for hobby groups. 

Going to restaurants by myself or even high end restaurants by myself. 

You get where I'm going with this. 

Now I didn't realize it had became an issue until a recent FWB came in contact with me again and wanted to offer an apology. I accepted to meet up and she explained that she was a Tik-Tok user and she came across videos that covered many things that I do as ""Red Flags"". My face must've spoke for me because she said ""let me explain"" and proceeded to tell me that she watched these videos over a few weeks and came to the conclusion that I was a big walking red flag. I followed up with the fact that we had flawless communication about everything in our lives so I don't see how she reached that conclusion when she knew everything. Needless to say, she felt ashamed. It was only after we stopped talking for a few months and she talked to real women in real life with boyfriends and husbands and etc that she realized she fucked up in her way of thinking. We finished, I accepted, and we went our separate ways. 

Since then I've seen it everywhere. It was like my eyes were opened. Facebook. Reddit. Twitter/X. Instagram. I've even heard some in person. Normal every day stuff that I thought that men were being men, is getting marked as a red flag in dating culture. I don't mean obvious red flags.

 I feel as though it's turning into an escalating issue that's taking away from what real red flags are and what you be keeping your eyes open for. Yes, red flags are a very real thing. I do personally think that it's over reaching in many ways. I think that it sets men up for unknown failure. I also think it's gives new and young Men and women unrealistic expectations and skewed views on what to look for in a partner.

246,2024-04-26,CMV: violence against Asian-Americans does not receive enough media coverage.,u/Hot_Squash_9225,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cdekyt/cmv_violence_against_asianamericans_does_not/,changemyview,"CMV: Asian-Americans are being attacked but nobody cares unless the perpetrator is white. 

I've seen dozens of videos of Asian Americans being killed, assaulted, and robbed. I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not. It's very sad to see people that look like my parents or grandparents being attacked or killed. Not to mention the thousands of incidents where Asians are victimized without violence, or the ones that are not caught on CCTV or cellphone videos. Asians are being attacked and it is not being acknowledged. The media will not report on these incidents unless it is a white person, as evidenced by the coverage of the Atlanta murders compared to violent crimes committed by other minorities. 

Just a few that come to mind when it comes to violence that is recorded:

- elderly Asian man picking up cans and being assaulted by a group of young men in the bay area
- elderly Asian woman being set on fire in New York
- elderly Asian man being violently shoved and later dying of his injuries in the bay area
- elderly Asian woman robbed and killed in the bay area
- elderly Asian woman in New York being punched and kicked 60+ times 
- asian woman in Houston being slammed and paralyzed
- asian woman dragged by a vehicle after being robbed in the bay area
- asian woman being ran over and killed in Las Vegas
- gangs specifically targeting asians and their businesses

And there are many more that I have forgotten to list, and those are just the incidents that aren't recorded or reported. 

People often mention the LA riots in conversations about Anti-Asian violence, especially when it comes to the murder of Latasha Harlins, but they fail to mention the constant victimization of Soon Ja Du, she had visible injuries from that day. She was thrown under the bus by the media and it became the justification for hundreds or thousands of Asian businesses being destroyed along with the countless Americans that it impacted. This is just the most extreme example. 

There has not been enough media coverage on these specific incidents. There has not been the type of movements that were evoked when other injustices are committed. There is no real action that has been undertaken by the the government in stopping the violence against Asians. And there is a general disdain for Asian people that is not being addressed. 

I get that there is a lot of intersectionality that is in play, asians inhabit the same spaces as other marginilized people, but that doesn't mean that they should be left out to dry. 

There is a lot more that needs to be covered, these examples are only the recent ones, but historically speaking, there are many more examples that are being ignored, not just by me, but in general. 

And I will acknowledge the racist sentiments that are held within the Asian community, it does exist, and it has led to discriminatory actions against other minorities. 

Conclusion: I believe that Asian Americans are being attacked, but it is not being acknowledged by the media or general populace when it is done by other visible minorities/marginilized groups. There is a media bias to protect certain groups, and an emphasis on when the crimes are committed by white people.

And if x is infact false, I can still say ""x is true"" and in that moment that is not a fact, but my belief.

For example, in a fight with your mom, you argue that you didn't lie when you said ""x is true"" because  you believed it. She can't make the argument that you should've said ""I believe x is true.""

Till this point all said is established. Here comes the actual problem: If one is to choose ""I believe x is true"" over ""x is true"" it means that they do not think of x's trueness as a total fact. Therefore, it ruins the meaning of ""believe"" itself, which thinking something is true and fact."

At the founding of the US, there was some question of what to call the executive, George Washington. 

Some had floated ""your highness"" or ""your grace."" Washington rejected these titles, settling simply on ""Mr. President,"" which at the time had very minimal prestige associated with it (for example, a head of a book club). Happily, this trend has continued. Mr. President has stuck.

How on earth do we call even traffic court judges ""your Honor"", including in second person (""your honor mentioned earlier ________"" instead of ""you mentioned earlier"")? I'm watching the immunity trial and it seems absurd.

Not only is it an inversion of title and authority, it seems like blatant sucking up to someone who will presumably have a lot of power over your life, or your case. 

We don't call bosses your honor, we don't call doctors that save lives your honor, we use the term *only* for people who could either save or ruin our lives, or at a minimum give us slack on parking tickets.

I would propose that a law be passed to ban the term in all courts, federal and state, and henceforth judges should be addressed as ""Judge _______"". 

Copied from another answer:

Imagine a boss insisted all his employees to refer to him as “His Majesty,” or “Your Holiness,"" and not abiding by this was fireable. Do you genuinely believe that this wouldn't eventually make its way to a hostile work environment or wrongful termination lawsuit?"

I have helped thousands and thousands of people all over the United States and those traveling abroad with issues ranging from simple activations to complex attempts at identity theft. Needless to say I have a decent amount of experience helping older people do basic functions on their cell phones.

And all of that has taught me one thing. If you give your parent or grandparent or older relative a cell phone or honestly any piece of technology beyond their ability to comprehend, maintain, and  understand, you are committing an act of Elder abuse. They're frustration and Desperation as these pieces of technology that they do not understand but are essential to maintain important links to family and healthcare workers and their other friends and members of their local community don't operate as they want them to is palpable. I have dealt with too many elderly people on the verge or Blinded by rage because they can't understand technology. Because it wasn't explained to them by relatives or store representatives.

Giving someone something they don't understand and then making them pretty much rely on it is a recipe for them being frustrated and miserable. The elderly do not want to have to rely on other people and give up another piece of their fading Independence. Yeah that becomes inevitable.

It already sucks enough getting old. Giving them a source of extreme frustration and Desperation isn't helping anyone"

My understanding of the sequence of events is that seal team six found him in a house in Pakistan during a nighttime raid with no witnesses and shot him. Then they took him to a boat and threw him overboard ""so his grave could not become a shrine for his followers"". They either didn't collect or didn't release any evidence that its him, and not only do I have to ignore the massive conflict of interest in lying about this but I have to trust in their competence when it comes to identifying him.

They called Gaddafi a terrorist mastermind and then we all forgot about him, and then for some reason years later we all see him die. They insinuated on TV repeatedly that Saddam was going to nuke us, and even though that wasn't true we all saw him die. 

But over the course of 10 years they kill millions of people and spend trillions of dollars in the name of killing this one old man. He was everything they wanted Saddam to be, he was the boogeyman that Americans had a decade of nightmares about. And I'm suddenly supposed to believe that taking a single picture before you irrecoverably dispose of his body would be too disrespectful. There is not a president in the history of this country that would not use that picture as a campaign poster if it existed. 

I don't care if he's dead, he's not out there at almost 70 years old cooking up ideas for how to top 9/11. If the picture existed I wouldn't look at it. I just don't know why anyone believes this happened, and I hope its not just because the president said it happened.

My belief as that there's no evidence. Is there some witness I don't know about? Some testimony under oath at least? If you believe that any of this happened, please tell me why you believe it. If you have some evidence I don't know about I'll give a delta even if I'm still skeptical.

I think it’s a way to brush off any reconsideration of a person’s work.

Art is commonly known as an expression of the artist’s creativity. Therefore it is essential the artist be considered in the conversation about the art, especially if it’s the work of a singular artist. 

When we talk about the work of HP Lovecraft, we almost always talk about Lovecraft himself. There is good reason for that. It is well known how his problematic views lent to his work. We ~~like~~ need to understand what is going through the mind of someone when they create something. 

We can recognize an artists problematic point of view, and recognize its influence on the art they create, without completely disengaging with the work. There is definitely some reconsideration to be had. Also, it’s okay to not want to engage with it if it affects you so deeply."

Some murder happened? No need for hundreds of hours of investigation to know the culprit. Just check the recordings. Done.

Someone was bribed? Bad luck. Just check the recordings and save thousands of dollars in the justice system.

Someone was harassed (sexually, morally or otherwise)? This would be very very hard to prove today. But not if just check the recordings of their interactions.

You are commiting tax fraud? You better think twice because your interaction was recorded!

Some politician was bought? That poor fellow is doomed now.

My view **doesn't** include the implementation of the system. It's about if it would work in concept.

Also I'm not clamming to solve all corruption nor all crimes. But most. The argument is that it would be very very hard to get away with it in this system. And that would restrain most perpetrators from doing them. Not all, of course.

About what is public or private, this might be a sensible point.

All interactions with any legal entity (people, companies, etc) is recorded, 

If ALL parties agree to not record it, the interaction won't be recorded. If any party want the interaction recorded, it will be. Knowledge of if an interactions is being recorded or not must shared to all parties. This would take precedence over the next rules.

In your private space, everything you do is private.

In public spaces everything you do is recorded.

In semi public spaces (like inside companies) special rules apply. But the default is for everything being **internally** recorded if sensible and normally recorded otherwise.

This applies rules apply in your virtual life aswell as physical.

All recordings must have digital signatures in order to verify it's authenticity.

Recordings must only be used for maintaining the law.

This system isn't perfect nor does it solve everything. But it does improve transparency and arguably solve most corruption and crime as an emergent property."

Because it’s not just a movie; it’s an emotional revolution.

Hollywood endlessly regurgitates the same old tired narratives, but Spirited Away smashes expectations with its explosive originality and creativity. It fucking catapults you into an otherworldly experience that grips you by the balls and doesn’t let go. What other movie makes a jaded cynic lean in and whisper, ‘Holy shit, this is new’?

Miyazaki isn’t just making films; he’s crafting a fucking mirror to our souls with themes like greed, environmentalism, and the painful beauty of growing up. Spirited Away doesn’t just explore these themes—it turns them into a visual and narrative spectacle. Where else does a goddamn bathhouse become a battlefield for the soul of society?

This film doesn’t just tug at your heartstrings—it fucking yanks them. Chihiro’s evolution from a sulky kid to a fucking empowered savior is more than uplifting—it’s a goddamn masterclass in character development. When was the last time a film actually made you feel a character’s growth deep in your bones?

Visually, Spirited Away is an undisputed masterpiece. Each frame is painstakingly crafted to not just dazzle your eyes, but to revolutionize what you thought was possible in animation. Next to this, other films look like they’re stuck in the fucking Stone Age.

It’s not just a movie; it’s a cultural titan. Snagging the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, Spirited Away didn’t just win over anime enthusiasts—it conquered the crustiest, most critical bastards in the film industry.

Spirited Away transcends age, culture, and taste. It’s universally accessible yet deeply personal. What other film achieves that magic balance?

Why the fuck would you challenge this film’s supremacy? Can you name one other film that so flawlessly melds the real with the surreal, offering not just an escape, but a fucking dive into the depths of our own human experience? What does your favorite film really offer?"

That is, I see no way we can call the Olympic and Paralympic Games really good for the environment (not even neutral, but truly good).

The Olympic Games, the world's largest in terms of size, scope, audience (more than half the world) and spending (source: Olympic Marketing Information File, IOC 2019), claim to be examples of sustainability, aiming to inspire sustainable futures worldwide. In recent years, the Olympic Games Organizing Committee has made a point of highlighting their “environmental sustainability”.

On the IOC website, you can find a number of important announcements and strategic reports concerning sustainable development and the environment (https://olympics.com/ioc/sustainability). Examples include the medals made from recycled electronics at Tokyo 2022 and the (relatively) sustainable nature of the Olympic House in Lausanne. 

However, I believe that mega-events like the Olympics can logically never be good for the planet. On the basis of the Olympics' sustainability, climate and carbon footprint, their contribution to the planet is very negative.

So, if the Olympics have never been truly “sustainable”, is it possible to make them so?

The Olympics appear to me to be a “greenwash” and continually pursue a business model that serves the interests of the elite and powerful, as well as the transnational revenues that accompany large-scale global events.

According to https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00696-5, An evaluation of the sustainability of the Olympic Games, the Olympic Games score very, very badly in terms of sustainability — let alone being “good” for the planet.

The main reasons why I hold this view are (in no particular order):

1 The massive requirement to transport the spectators, athletes, media, and officials required for the Olympic Games increases fuel consumption, carbon footprint, and greenhouse gas emissions, contributing
to global warming.

2.1 The Olympic Games require the construction of massive structures such as stadiums, Olympic villages and sports facilities, often resulting in the destruction of natural habitats and the degradation of local ecosystems.

2.2 To create space for these infrastructures, wooded areas and green spaces may be cleared, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and contributing to climate change.

2.3 The Olympic Games can be particularly damaging when they are held in ecologically sensitive areas; the Sochi Games, for example, raised concerns about the impact on nearby wetlands and endangered species. Ignoring these risks can lead to long-term environmental degradation.

2.4 Olympic Games held in coastal areas can lead to increased pollution from rubbish, marine traffic and possible oil spills. This can harm marine life and disrupt delicate ecosystems. A very recent and relevant example is the harm done to the Polynesian reefs while preparing Tahiti to host the surfing events for Paris 2024.

3.1 The construction and maintenance of Olympic facilities regularly involves large quantities of chemicals such as concrete, paint, and refrigerants — improper management or disposal of these chemicals can lead to soil and water contamination.

3.2 The Winter Olympics often rely heavily on artificial snow, which requires large quantities of water and energy — this process can disrupt local water supplies and harm surrounding ecosystems.

3.3 The surge in electronic equipment used during the Games, from broadcast equipment to athlete monitoring, leads to a significant increase in post-event electronic waste, and their improper disposal can lead to the release of harmful toxins into the environment.

4 The intense lighting required for nocturnal events can disrupt natural light cycles, affecting wildlife behaviour and potentially harming nocturnal animals.

5 Even with promises of sustainable practices, long-term plans to maintain Olympic sustainability initiatives after the Games are over are frequently lacking. This can lead to a return to pre-Olympic environmental practices.

6 The Olympic Games generate large quantities of waste, air pollution and soil pollution, due to the construction, logistics, and activities associated with the event.

7 The Olympic Games require a significant amount of natural resources such as water, electricity and building materials, which can exacerbate the pressure on local ecosystems and accelerate resource depletion.

(I would like to make it clear that my opinion is held mainly in respect to the Olympic Games of today and tomorrow; not in respect to those of antiquity or even the Games of 1896 or the early 19th centuries)"

The linking of the flame here being my country's efforts to maintain the status quo and trying to keep the country up and running by raising taxes and importing 3rd world immigrants to combat an aging population and because they're cheap labor as they settle for less as opposed to a native who wishes to be paid well, the companies obviously profit a lot from this.  
  
And I've been thinking, these efforts to curb the inevitable decline of my country seem to be counter-productive, the streets are getting more dangerous, people feel like they're getting replaced, and I'm left thinking we should just let the fire fade and let the cycle light a new fire that will burn for as long as it should.

Sex I believe, is only useful for breeding purposes and outside of that should be avoided. The reasons I have this view are: 

1. I always get insanely depressed immediately after sex. Like I just accomplished nothing but now I have to take a shower and wash the sheets and deal with the weird pubic smells. 
2. Sometimes I think I want sex but I end up just wanting a hug or an interesting conversation with the other gender. I theorize that this is always the case and my mind is just sex-focused because of the media.
3. I also have a theory that if I deprive myself of sex I will reach a higher plane of existence and indeed be closer to God, like the pope or something. 

There are a couple minor things like trust issues but I believe the minor things are more so just problems I have with my own insecurities. The major ones listed are what I feel is constantly battling this insane pressure from society to be a prolific sex god. 

Should I just live my life and let others live theirs? Accepting that what I want isn't what others want?

Also, socialism is a good theory, but a good theory can work badly when put in practice, string theory, a theory of physics, is also an intelligent theory, but that doesn't make string theory immediately true, the same happens with socialism, libertarianism and any political and economical theory, economists have to study for years and they still can't agree how poverty can be eliminated, meanwhile normal people who don't dedicate their entire lives to study the economy think they know better than these professional economists and they think they can fix the world only with their ""good intentions"", even if they didn't study for years.

New interests - new interests bring about unexpected benefits, new insights, new ways to be in the world and gives us more energy than old ones or goals

Start thinking about - because sometimes we obsess over the person who is not interested or giving mixed signals, there is a tendency to want to resolve things in our minds due to mixed signals and the openness of the situation

someone who are interested to connect with and spend time with - connection is a human need, deep connection, and new interests can bring about opportunities to peer into great minds through artwork, artefacts, books, and also find new friends and companions who might have a shared interest. spend time with - we want to have shared experiences and memories and enjoy the presence of someone doing things with us, and it's not just about the conversations but the company of some special individuals.

gives mixed signals and says they are not interested - it is not clear even if they verbalize they are not interested, which adds to the confusion and pain and wanting to try out or stake out more. However, they have said they are not interested, so even staking it out with them, it will be less fulfilling than if someone is jumping at the opportunity. 

move on - energetically taking attention and energy and thoughts away from the person and situation, is akin to taking our minds off a problem that is too hard to be solved now and tackling a different problem on the exam.

Unite the Right rally was a blatantly antisemitic neo-Nazi rally but it was allowed to take place because of 1st Amendment rights. The Jan 6th protests were fine up to the point where the protestors decided to storm the Capitol building and launch an insurrection. However, these campus protests have been cracked down in a manner similar to the Civil Rights Movement back in the 60s. Riot police were deployed before the protests started, peaceful protestors were man handled, some were pushed by the police onto the highway so they would be arrested, some were tasered while handcuffed, it's a violent crack down on peaceful protests. I mean, seriously, how is it okay that [a sniper](https://redd.it/1cdfbux) is deployed on a university campus?

Were there antisemitic chants in Columbia? Yes, I don't doubt that, I have seen the videos, but so were the Unite the Right rally that was much more antisemitic than the ones we see in the past week. There wasn't much violence from the protestors either, and even if they were it wasn't the case in all the campuses that faced mass arrests. 

I don't understand why people are not more up in arms about this gross violation of 1st Amendment rights. You don't have to agree with the political message to recognise that they should be allowed to voice them and protest without facing severe police violence."

Many citizens feel apathetic if they dont think they will win or frustrated when they dont. A rational voter shouldn't want to win, or at least not all the time. This is just wishing you were in charge of a dictatorship. A rational voter should understand that they are aren't right 100% of the time, or their choices aren't what others want for themselves. Only an arrogant idiot would think that they are correct 100% of the time, and everyone should do what they say.

The point of voting is to measure public opinion, and citizens should be pleased when they achieve this goal, their opinion is represented, because it is the first step towards change.

As an American I grew up with the basic understanding that we were the most powerful nation on earth. I was born in 2005 and grew up in the days of American hyper power-status. The Soviet Union was gone, Russia was in an economic trough, and China was just starting to build up. I grew up in the days of Obama era global reach, I listened to the President say things like ""If you come after Americans we go after you, and it may take time, but we have long memories and our reach had no limits."" I was always a military history nerd growing up and that has expanded into my love for geopolitics and international relations.

Today, we don't seem as powerful as I believed growing up. The United States only spends 2.7% of GDP on defense, a 60% slash since the end of the cold war. Our military industrial base has consolidated and our production lines have slowed down or stopped. We are so proud of the Abrams Main Battle Tank, a vehicle designed 30 years ago! For God's sake, F-16 turns FIFTY YEARS OLD this year.

On top of our stagnant industry, low spending, and aging technology, we simply don't have the numerical superiority that many people believe. We often hear that the US has over one million active military personnel, but that number is deceiving. There are a lot of cooks and accountants included in that figure. If you look at the US Army Order of Battle you will see that we can only field 21 Divisions. Including the National Guard we have 29 divisions, add the US Marines to get 32 divisions. The Army Reserve can muster a further 10 divisions. That's it, 42 divisions including the reserves. How are we supposed to fight and win a modern conflict when at most we can field around 600,000 men?

I know that in the case of an existential threat the United States will probably be able to pull some WW2 level mobilization and respond to defend ourselves, but these days it's not just the Continental United States. We are responsible for defending dozens of other countries, and we are supposed to do it with 600,000 men maximum?

The United States military industry is insufficient, the 'Arsenal Of Democracy' is too old, and we can't field enough troops to guarantee victory.

My libido has been absolutely destroyed by it. I can’t get aroused from the thought of having a relationship and being sexually active because it’s not extreme/taboo enough. Porn addicts start with relatively normal porn but then eventually that doesn’t stimulate them like it used to so they move on to more extreme BDSM and other things. I know from experience. 

BDSM disgusts me. I would never want to treat someone I love and share my life with that way. Yet it’s impossible for me to get aroused without some violent aspect to it. This is what porn did to me. A total disconnect between my emotions and my sex drive.

I know most people advocating for banning porn are on the religious right. I’m not, I’m a leftist. There’s nothing religious about my opinion in this. Overstimulation of the dopamine centers of the brain is incredibly damaging. It takes the pleasure out of normal happy things. It ruins your sex drive. 

So many young kids are getting addicted to porn when their brain is still developing. This is so bad. You feel like your brain is shattered to pieces that don’t connect with each other. It must stop. Every year we don’t ban porn is another cohort of people whose brains we failed to protect from something as monstrous as drug addiction. Those in the porn industry get filthy rich off exploiting consumers of porn and actors/actresses in it. It’s mass exploitation and it must stop."

I'll dicuss this in more detail later.

Note 2: This essay is specifically in the context of peer to peer warfare on the superpower level. Where both sides are wealthy enough to simply buy more munitons almost indefinitely. In the case lesser counties fighting each other, infantry will still be used simply for the low cost and high amounts of bodies to throw into the meat grinder.

Note 3: Grammar may be bad at times as I am writing all of this on my phone, sorry about that and if you need any clarification feel free to ask

A quick introduction: In recent years we have seen startling advancements in weapons technology that make infantry more and more vulnerable to an instant and unseen death, thus making every frontline infantry have less and less return in value. Specifically in Ukraine More and more infantry are being killed before even being able to hold any ground or in some cases even see a fight, thus making all of the time and money used to make the equipment and train the soldiers a complete waste of investment.

 It is not like in WW2 or even later wars where every allied infantryman shot and killed war more wear on the enemy and thus a step to victory, becasue in modern times these missiles or even just drones can be made en-mass for dirt cheap with little cost for the makers. Meaning that the several thousand dollars that it took to supply that one soldier was now completely nullified by a drone that cost $300-$600, and the cost benefit gets even higher if that drone isn't a one time use drone and could kill an entire squad for the cost of less than one fully equipped soldier. 

* Drone counters: while I do understand that there are countermeasures against drones, we also have to relised that these counters will be countered themselves in the developing arms race. And even if there is a working hammer that can down drones, if it is any bigger than a person for example a vehicle for radar building, it can simple be destroyed by a stealth aircraft and suddenly the other side is left defenceless and everyone dies. And even then, drones with longer range payloads can be used to simply out-range jamming equipment, you can jam a sniper bullet from the skies. 
Even if the mobile infantry jamming equipment works, what would be the point of it? As soon as the units move out of range of the jamming devise they will be eliminated so they are forced to bring it with them, most likly in a vehicle, making the hammer far more likly to get spotted by artillery and sniped with high precision warheads just like what's happening now in Ukraine. Not only that, but if the jamming device is fixed to a vehicle that significantly limits the vercitility of infantry movement in difficult terrain and effectively nullifies one of the only advantages infantry have in modern warfare. 

* non-drone: And all of this is just talking about drones. What about smart long-range artillery? How do you jam an artillery shell or long range missle that is actively changing direction and moving at the speed of sound? Currently the only way to do this is to use an active protection system like Iron-dome or Patriot systems. The main issue here is that these are mainly for extreemly long range cruise missles and other simalar weapon systems on the strategic level, I know of far fewer systems that could effectively intercept an artillery shell or short range precision missiles for infantry units. Even the systems that do exist now are bound by a vehicle, forcing infantry to not be able to leave the protection area of the vehicle and again limiting their mobility. 

*Alternatives to infantry: With the excessive vulnerability of infantry and the advancement of technology, how does a military power take and hold ground? I belive that the only ground units that could defend itself from drone units and intercept other munitions would be specifically built tanks meant for the modern era of war. 
This would require: extremely thick roof armor, simalar to the thickness of the front plates, several layers of active protection on the tank including a 360° hard and soft kill system, and reactive armor. Building vehicles like these or similar are the only way that I can see modern superpowers fighting wars efficiently without wasting lives and money. 

* Alternatives to ground combat: Even with the development of new protection to these new munitions, the other side will eventually find ways to counter that protection and make it useless in the arms race. That's why I belive that in the future warfare will be completely decided in the air or even space, since the aircraft are far faster and have far longer range than any ground force to could hope to have. This will mean that air combat will have a far more important role in war and could by itself decide the winner of the war, with no input by the ground forces. 

* Exceptions: Although infantry may be obsolete, I belive special forces like Deltaforce and Airborne will still be very important, specifically for urban fighting and takeing or destroying impotent targets. I belive that once armors units surround a city, that special forces specialising in Urban combat would be air-dropped in and they would begin clearing out the city. This elimitates the number 1 reason for infantry to be on the ground and also means you need to train fsr fewer people and can just airdrop Special forces in to take a city instead of driving all the way there, taking casualties the whole journey.

Conclusion / final point: My final point here is that in the near future infantry ground units will not be able to survive long enough to be cost effective to the supplying counties to be worth the cost, due to the fact that an entire infantry platoon could be wiped out by a small swarm of drones or even just guides artillery. That is a $100,000+ loss of money and life to a (maybe) < $10,00 cost. This cost benefit is simply too high to be really efficient for a modern high speed war against superpowers, forcing both sides to abandon inafnry in favor of exclusively armored fighting vehicles for anything other than urban environments. Although one side could be stubborn and refuse to get rid of the infantry divitions, this would be a waste of lives and and extremely inefficient use of recorces. 

So yeah! That's my whole peice. Feel free to comment if you have anything at all you want to say and if you have a counter point for me to consider. I'll be in the comments waiting for your reply!"

Everyone loves a good religion debate right?

Even for those who aren’t necessarily devout, belief in certain aspects of the Abrahamic aspects (an eternal afterlife where entrance is determined by a tally of your good and bad actions, a god who at the very least watches you, humans being “chosen” in some aspect and above other life forms, etc.) completely shapes your reality of the universe, the meaning of life, and our interactions with ourselves and others.

I would call myself an agnostic because obviously I can’t prove anything about anything, but for all intents and purposes can’t we all agree that there’s zero chance humans in the last ~6000 years had access to divine knowledge that we don’t? Like I don’t know if there’s a god but I KNOW that if there is it is NOT the god of the Bible, Torah Quran, et. Especially considering the litany of historical inaccuracies and contradictions of all of the holy books, it’s like okay I get being spiritual but framing it around this seems so toxic to me. I’m an American and the belief in these books have SUCH A HUGE fucking impact in our daily lives. 

Whether it’s abortion,, gay marriage, treatment of women, fucking conquering other countries, the ramifications are so real and I think peoples world view helps them justify doing these things so much. 

I know the majority of followers get something out of it like community etc and don’t harm anyone and are reasonable people, but I still don’t understand why we should be okay with encouraging a view of humankind, ethics, reality, and history that has absolutely no basis in anything and is so harmful. And again this is the majority of the world not a minority obviously.

That being said, when I see the whole ""can animals consent"" argument, I'm just like ""no, they can't, because consent is a human concept."" The human evolution to perceive and create abstract concepts, and from what I've read even ask questions, has given us concepts like gender, love, consent, abuse, etc. It's certainly not something other animals follow (e.g. ducks, otters, reptiles, dolphins, let alone dogs).

The ""animals can't consent"" argument is whatever. I nominally agree with it. But then you have people like who I've seen on Twitter say it's abuse because the victim is ""financially dependent"" on the abuser. I'm sorry but when you start talking about a dog's finances you've lost me. Are herding dogs and support animals slaves because they haven't consented to working? If they were trained were they ""manipulated"" into it? Is showering your pet with affection ""lovebombing"" it? They never consented or agreed to being a pet! You keep going down this line of reasoning and next thing you know you're getting recruited by PETA.  
  
Treating living things like sex objects (or in general a means to an end) is gross. That's it. You don't have to talk about consent or dependence or fucking finances. You could probably say the same about livestock or animals of burden but at the end of the day they provide a net positive to society as a whole, while fucking animals is just selfish. Besides, I don't see many people cheering about those animals being treated the way they are either.  
  
By the way I don't care if you wanna anthropomorphize animals in your own little head canon, or call them queer or Black or Christian or whatever. But if you're gonna confront something as heinous as this you're gonna need a solid, foolproof argument, and I think the consent/dependence route has some holes that zoophiles can and will exploit (pun unintended).  
  
If somehow the arguments I criticized do hold up, or what my argument is doesn't, please let me know."

Yes, their numbers in Israel have fluctuated over the past 3-4,000 years due to wars and different periods of rulership (the Romans, Persians, Crusaders, Babylonians, etc.) but the Jews have always been in Israel and it is a land that is directly linked to the identity of the Jews.  It is a central theme in the Jewish people’s holy book, The Torah.  Not only have the Jewish people been there for close to 4,000 years, without the Jews there would be no Islam, no Christianity, no Quran, no holy Bible, etc.  I make this point to put into context how old Judaism and the Jewish link to Israel is: It is thousands of years older than the first concept of Mohammed and the Quran.  The religious thought world upon which many Arabs leverage to spew hatred toward Jews and their right to their homeland.   I do not believe many of these anti-Israel protestors understand how long Jews have been in Israel and that there have been wars in Israel between the Jews and other groups for thousands of years: This is nothing new.  Nor do I believe many of these protestors realize that the most recently formed state of Israel which was “founded” in 1948 (and I put that in quotes as Israel as a concept of a homeland has been around for many thousands of years with changing borders in that exact area of the world) was a place where millions of more Jews flocked to after they were close to being wiped out entirely by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi party.  Nor do I think these protestors understand that without an Israel the Jews would continually be harassed and kicked out of other countries as has been the case for thousands of years: A large part of why the Jews need a homeland.  Nor do I think these protestors understand that in the neighboring Arab countries there are close to 0 Jews (some of the neighboring Arab nations such as Iran have very small Jewish populations but most of them have 0 or close to 0 Jews living in them as they would be targeted and killed for living there).   For context, there are millions of Israeli Arabs with full and equal rights in Israel but this is not the case in many of Israel’s neighboring Arab countries.   It is also true that many of Israel’s neighbors wish to see all Jews killed, and that chants “from the river to the sea Palestine will be free” means they want the elimination of the Jewish state and some even use that saying as an anti semetic dog whistle to other anti-Zionists.  Also, many of these “anti-Zionists” do not really understand what a Zionist is.  It is a Jewish person who believes there should be a Jewish state, much like how almost every other people on the planet have their own state.  And then, of course, there are those who understand all of this and still hate Israel, Zionists, and Jews.   I question why they are so focused on Israel, a tiny sliver of a nation in the world, when there are plenty of other MUCH worse tragedies occurring in the world right now: North Koreans being starved, Muslims in China being thrown into concentration camps, women and children being raped and thrown into slavery by gangs and dictators in Africa, the entire nation of Ukraine under the threat of Russia, etc.  Why so much focus on Israel?  Why don’t these protestors give any weight to the fact that Hamas fires rockets out of schools, hospitals, and civilian centers?  What choice does Israel have but to strike back?  Any other country would.  Plus, they have to get back the hostages that were kidnapped by Hamas and other violent Palestinians from Israel after the Gazans shot up a rave, raped women, burned families alive, threw babies in ovens, shot children in their cribs, etc.  In summary, these protestors are either anti semetic or clueless as to the context of the conflict occurring between Israel and its neighbors.

*I would like if you first comprehend what I truly mean, and I actually don’t support physical violence, and even oppose disowning in many cases*

One of the most popular terms on the internet today is “fatherless behaviour.” 

The phrase and its many variants, are almost exclusively used against women who are exhibiting “bad behaviour.” Bad behaviour here can be anything ranging from doing OFs to dying your hair blue. The phrase is an attack on the upbringing, and its patriarchal nature is imminent in the fact that it specifically mentions the male parent, suggesting that they were the ones responsible for disciplining the child, especially in regards to sexuality. It’s not just used by western men, and its use transcends geographical boundaries. But the context in which it’s used varies. 

The whole idea that a child is a free independent entity after they turn 18, is contemporary and western. Most of the world cultures do permit parents to actually beat the living shit out of their children regardless of the age for breaking social norms, and in many places, the permissiveness extends to literal murder, what we know as honour killings. I’m someone who was brought up in one of such cultures. A typical muslim conservative society. We don’t become independent after 18, and even if we are financially independent, our families and parents have control over us. If I do something that is socially unacceptable, my parents got the right to show me the “right path” by any means necessary. It doesn’t matter if I’m 15 or 25. 


Family is primary agent of socialisation. It’s our parents who program us to hold certain beliefs, and behave a certain way. But, the whole human experience over the centuries tells us that we have rebellious tendencies, and don’t neatly follow the footsteps of our parents. If you are a western person reading this, imagine your great grandparents. Most probably, they were homophobic, opposed cohabiting and having premarital sex, attitudes that you most probably see as anachronistic today. Why did that happened? It’s definitely due to the generations following them leading to your parents defying what they were thought. This change didn’t occur in many other cultures, where violence is permitted to bring people back on the track.

There is disparity in what is defined as shameful. Among conservative muslims, can a woman afford to post pictures of her without hijab, and kissing her bf? Absolutely no. The latter is very likely to get her beaten down to a pulp by her father, and that would be backed by most conservative muslims. On the other hand, I find American and British dads liking the pictures of their daughters kissing their bfs, something that even most moderate muslim men would find extremely shameful. Men in my culture use the term fatherless behaviour to insult women merely talking about dating someone let alone engaging in sex. 

People argue that you can have talk. Some years ago, on a Kuwaiti morning show, a Syrian Arab woman defended beating girls for coming home late in “unacceptable condition” and breaking social norms because talking doesn’t work with such type of women. Mind you, she’s was an educated journalist not wearing a hijab herself clad in a hoodie. Just imagine if an educated, rather modernised woman holds such views, how it would be like for the uneducated or less modernised ones. Irrespective of that, her views perfectly illustrates the social attitude of people in traditional cultures towards seeing having a talk as remedy. 

In western world, that precisely what happens with teenagers. When they show rebellion, they have their rights taken away. They get grounded, and their devices confiscated. Many even get some form of beating. 

If you as a parent can’t physically force your Adult children, I don’t believe you shall get blamed for their behaviour. Give them the true freedom that was promised, or is it that they actually don’t have the freedom? People can judge them all they want, why that judgement has to extend to parents who have now left with no control? Give the parents control or stop shaming them"
0,2024-04-27,CMV: 2 things can be true at once,u/MJQ30,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cete9c/cmv_2_things_can_be_true_at_once/,changemyview,"I have a very complicated take on the Israeli Palistinian conflict as I do see both sides of the issue. One of the biggest reasons for why Zionism exists is that Jews were persecuted by the Nazis. They needed a space to call their own so that they could feel safe. I get that because a lot of immigrants who came to Ellis Island had similar experiences whether it is from religious persecution, or any other form of persecution. That being said, there comes a point where people use that experience to justify their bigotry towards other people and fall in to the same behaviors their own oppressors used against them to oppress others. This is what the Likud party and by extension the Zionist movement is doing to the Palistinians today and since *most notably October 7th and especially what followed afterwards (*I say most notably since that’s when this conflict garnered the most media attention).

 I also see that there is a ton of antisemitism and Islamophobia when discussing this topic. I believe those two coincide with each other, as the fear of something being foreign can lead to a vicious cycle best described by Yoda from Star Wars The Phantom Menace:

“Fear leads to anger, Anger leads to hate, Hate leads to suffering”.

With that in mind, bigotry  from one side will only lead to the opposing side doubling down with more bigotry.

As such, when discussing the Israeli Palistinian conflict, I feel that acknowledging that 2 things can be true all at once is an important step towards understanding the opposing side. 

Now I’m pretty sure you’re wondering what my personal beliefs are. Well in the spirit of understanding both sides, I believe that if the demand that Pro-Israelis is asking for is to free all the hostages, a permanent ceasefire would be the way to achieve this. This is because at the end of November 2023 when a 7 day pause was established, at least 100 hostages were released. 

To sum up my points on this conflict:

Discriminating one group leads to discriminating another group.

When your self determination of a state comes at the expense of another marginalized group, your ideology no matter how utilitarian it was in the past, is now an extremist ideology. One more thing to add. Any denial of the atrocities you enacted on that marginalized group makes you no better than your oppressors, in both the past and the present. Also also, the “you” in this case is directed at the Israeli government and anyone who supports them with complicity, not Pro-Palestinian Jews.

Releasing the hostages requires a permanent ceasefire.

There may have been a time when at least the former was somewhat logical, but especially now, I don't see any good reason for the latter and almost always not the former.

I see it as a sort performative thing. Some might call it virtue signaling. The resistance to covid-era policies from conservatives seems to have made the act of wearing a mask (or not wearing a mask) a political statement. I can't fathom any other reason that people would be doing that in 2024.

   1. The Democrats have an idea that the systemic racism and poverty cycles in America are too much to overcome, despite Asian Americans proving those ideas to be wrong
   2. Asians also by and large culturally value personal responsibility, and it leaves a bad taste in their mouths when Leftists talk about how minorities and lower/working classes are poorer because of institutionalized issues rather than lack of effort or culture issues in those communities
3. Asians academically outperform peers in America largely due to hardworking cultures, an advantage that the Left turns into a disadvantage for EVERY SINGLE ASIAN PERSON in America with a/a

31,2024-04-27,"CMV: The Abrahamic God is a completely absurd concept because a creator being that is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good is a paradox. ",u/BoomBasher,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cevs5u/cmv_the_abrahamic_god_is_a_completely_absurd/,changemyview,"I’m not a theologian or a philosopher, but even from a layman’s perspective I have always found the Abrahamic concept of God absurd. He can do anything imaginable, he knew every single thing that would ever happen since before time began, and he is infinitely kind and loving. This concept invites so many paradoxes. 

Why do bad things happen if God is good and could have effortlessly prevented all evil since before the universe even existed? If it is necessary that evil exists, then why did God make it necessary? It can’t be that God wants us to have free will, because God is powerful enough to create a world with both free will and no evil. 

Why are we even on Earth? Why didn’t God simply remove our sins and send us all to Heaven from the start if he wants us all to be there? Life can’t be a test to see if we’re worthy of Heaven, since God would already know the results of any test before even conducting it. And there would be no need for any test anyway if God had just made us all perfect. So why didn’t he?

Omnipotence paired with omnibenevolence is a paradox. If God is all-powerful, then that would mean he can do evil. But if he is all-good, then he can’t do evil. So which one is it?

Can God create a rock that he can’t lift? If yes, then he can’t life the rock and isn’t all-powerful. If no, then he can’t create the rock and isn’t all-powerful. 

Then there are so many random little things that just don’t add up: 

Why didn’t God spirit the Jews out of Egypt, or make the Egyptians stop enslaving them? 

Why did God let any of his beloved humans be killed in war when he could’ve just made them join his side?

Why did God create the flood to kill the evil people when he could have just made them not evil anymore? Or at least made them vanish and allow the animals to live?

Why did God create Hell to punish evil people when he could just make them not evil anymore? 

Why did God make us have to pee and poop? I’m serious. He could have just made us not need to eat or drink, or given us more efficient bodies.

Why did God give us features that indicate evolution if evolution isn’t real? Why create fossils? To test us? But he would already know the result of any test, right?

Why did God make it possible for us to feel pain or be injured or killed? 

Why didn’t God make all of us just as wise, moral, and powerful as himself?

There’s so many more I could list, but this is getting very long. "
0,2024-04-27,CMV: Hate speech is free speech.,u/Most-Travel4320,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cevu2w/cmv_hate_speech_is_free_speech/,changemyview,"The idea that people should get into legal trouble or fear physical violence against themselves for hate speech really bothers me. It's not because I think the speech isn't harmful, or because I support it, but it's because of the moral and political implications for society as a whole. Such an idea also makes it harder to de-radicalize people and galvanizes their position against whatever group they are targeting.

First off, lets make it clear, bigots are human beings too. They have the same emotional depth of human experience that anyone else does. What they say should be viewed as wrong, dangerous even, but so long as it does not cross the line directly into incitement, it does not justify causing clear and irreversible harm to befall them. Physical violence is harm, and so is legal trouble, and both of these are more severe than what the bigots themselves are doing to you through simple speech. Being offended by something somebody tells you is ultimately a personal choice, you can let it go. You can't let injuries or legal issues go.

Second, I think everybody should acknowledge that society and people are not the perfect judges of others. Virtually every society which bans speech, a good example being Russia with speech related to the war in Ukraine (Discrediting the military, they call it), does so for what they rationalize to be legitimate reasons. Many Russians genuinely think that Ukrainians are Nazis and thus speech opposing the invasion and in support of Ukraine is supporting Nazis. How will we, in the west, prevent hate speech laws from being abused like this by people who take a different view towards what hate speech is? Many right wing lawmakers and voters already think that people calling for a ceasefire in Gaza are espousing hate speech, and if we had hate speech laws on the books, they'd probably target them with those laws. Likewise people on the left sometimes have dubious views about what hate speech actually is, and countries like Canada [are trying to pass laws which allow people to petition courts to place people under house arrest because they think they might commit a hate crime in the future, which in Canada, includes ""incitement to hatred"".](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/virani-says-new-measures-meant-to-help-prevent-hate-crimes-will-come-with-safeguards-1.6789792) This isn't what freedom is.

The ACLU, maybe the best civil rights organization in the US, in my opinion, agrees with my view of the matter. It defends the right of everybody's right to speech, [including everyone,](https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/defending-speech-we-hate) [even white supremacists.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/12/16138326/aclu-charlottesville-protests-racism)

I'll sum up my view on the matter with a Thomas Paine quote that I really like. “He that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself.”.

I will say I know this may sound cruel and it is most certainly not the politically correct view. Let me explain though

First of all, I believe that when a country is attacking another or a mass genocide is happening there should be intervention from countries with the resources to help and there is an obligation to do so but to an extent. For example, when the Rohingya people were viciously targeted in Myanmar there should have been more done to help those people. This was a severe attack on a group of ethnic and religious people that stems from a change in leadership a few decades ago. The extent of this intervention is not something I have thought too deeply on as I believe it should be case by case however I believe that each country has a right to sovereignty so long as they can support the nation. 

Now with Israel and Palestine on the other hand, this is an issue that started in the 13th century BCE when Israelites left Egypt. Now Arabian people started settling there in the 7th century BCE and while i’m not 1000% sure on all of the history I know that there is so much religious (and cultural) conflict between the two and when the British Mandate was in control they aimed to create a way for both Israel and Palestine to have the land and rights they deserved. 

Both groups have felt displaced, Palestine is still trying to recover from the obliteration they faced in the 1950s. Both sides are wrong AND right, one side is an attack from the government on an ethnic community, the other is terroristic violence towards the citizens of the nation. Both sides have committed horrific crimes but we have no reason to tell these groups who should be there and who should not, it should be up to them to work it out and I know it sounds ruthless and wrong but we are not the people who have been displaced by this issue and we cannot speak on how it should play out. 

I think that the people who demonize others for not speaking out are morons who have no idea what’s actually happened there BEFORE the latest conflict occurred. I have no opinion on who should be there and who should not, I do know both parties are committing atrocities and both believe they have every right to do so. Unless an uninvolved party can find a place for an entire community of people to inhabit that they are willing to move to I really think it’s none of our business at this point. The US and her people are is suffering and can barley afford to live yet we have college students willing to go to jail and waste their parents money for bail on an issue they can’t even fully grasp, hell i can’t even fully grasp it because it is so complex.

As for “what group is good vs what group is bad” or “this political candidate sucks and all of their supporters are terrible people” etc and other extremely subjective takes you really ought not to just be making wild assumptions about, it helps almost nobody and in the rare circumstances where you have numbers to back you up nobody really likes to see them as there are obvious outliers

why am i saying this? Radicalism through sweeping generalisations is what causes people to stop rationalising with each other and resort to more violent means of expression, from ww2 germany to how the ccp treats the uyghurs

what should you do? talk, thats it, set up a booth in a public area that says “i have a strong x opinion, lets talk” and more often than not you’ll be corrected to a more neutral standpoint

Sometimes, shit just happens without any rhyme or reason because nature doesn't give a fuck about morality or justice. Nature just is. It’s chaotic and indifferent to human suffering.

Perhaps it's just chaotic, unfeeling nature doing its thing, or if there's a god, maybe they're not as benevolent or omnipotent as some folks like to believe. If there’s a god, this god either can’t stop the suffering (not omnipotent), doesn’t know about it (not omniscient), or doesn’t care to stop it (not benevolent). Any way you slice it, it challenges the classic conception of a god who is all-good, all-knowing, and all-powerful.

This throws a wrench into the concept of a fair and just universe, doesn’t it? The existence of needless suffering really fucks with the idea of a universe governed by a fair and just higher power. It makes a lot more sense to think that the universe doesn’t have a moral axis, doesn’t it?

It challenges the notion of any moral lessons being learned in the face of random, brutal suffering. What do you think, does it make sense to believe in a moral universe where shit like this happens? Does it make any fucking sense to cling to the idea of a moral universe in the face of overwhelming evidence of random, brutal suffering? What's more likely—that there's a hidden ""moral"" reason behind all suffering, or that we're trying to impose meaning on a universe that’s fundamentally indifferent? What does your gut tell you?"

0,2024-04-28,CMV: Islam allows everything that Israel does to the Palestinians and worst ,u/Opposite_Lock3942,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cezpei/cmv_islam_allows_everything_that_israel_does_to/,changemyview,"What ever your position is on Israel Palestine we can all agree that killing innocent people is horrible. Having said that Muslim shoud really check there own religion. If they claim what Israel is doing is bad then they ether think islam is bad too or there are justhypocritical. Here are some objections that Muslims say about Israel that are completely Islamic  

1. Occupation of land

Islam allows to wage war on other peoples lands and take them over. Implement there own laws on the native population. Most Islamic apologists will even agree to this. Islam manly spread because of this. They when to far of land like Spain and india and waged wars and occupied them.and muslims act Proud when they say this aswell. so Muslims crying saying Israel are bad for doing the same thing is hypocritical 

2. Treatment of civilians

The treatment of non Muslims in a Muslim khilafa is way worst then anything Israel can do to the arab people living in Israel. The life of a nonMuslim is less then the life of a Muslim. A Muslim can't be killed for killing a non Muslim. If someone tries to spread his religion to muslims they will be killed for ""spreading mischief in the land"". they have to pay jizya for being non Muslims and it needs to be done being kneeling down the person collecting it to show humidition for being a non muslim in a muslim state. 

3. civilian deaths 

Muslims will use this argument. Civilian casualty are always a bad part of war. This is way war need to be avoided until absolutely Nessaaery. But Muslim have a weird argument about this topic. Mohammad hijab on piers morgens show said that even if one innocent person is killed in a war It's bad. Therefore Israel is bad because they killed so many. The problem is that Mohammad the og one has no problem with civilian deaths. In a Hadith he says.

Sahih Muslim 1745 a
It is reported on the authority of Sa'b b. Jaththama that the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ), when asked about the women and children of the polytheists being killed during the night raid, said:

They are from them.

So It's clear that if innocent women anr children are killed in the mist of war It's okey. There are a part of them. It's not a problem. So why do Muslims have a problem with innocent Children getting killed in the mist of war? do they think Mohammad is wrong too? 

In the end I'll say war never a good thing. There needs to be a solution. I am not smart enough to propose any but i hope someone can and end this seaseless violence. "

People who simply argue that “im right, youre wrong” when it comes to politics is exactly what leads to larger issues, both parties need to be willing to take a step back

this can be applied pretty much anywhere but its especially important with generalizations, especially if they make sense to you and not the other person, the “centrist” point is always moving throughout history and people who are unwilling to question their POV can cause much larger problems especially when paired with propaganda

sure if we look at two warring countries this type of reasoning is beyond whats necessary to solve it but humanizing your side of any argument and willing to be wrong is arguably more important than trying to convince everyone around you that you’re right

if your version of stepping back is considering they are insane instead of realizing that they are most likely a normal person you are a part of the problem

this especially should be applied to things that are out of your control, more often than not every one of those problems is nuanced and should be left up to the person involved to make an informed decision, like guns, abortion, war, political candidates etc"
18,2024-04-28,CMV: it isn't a problem to disagree with a group who share a belief,u/Dry_Bumblebee1111,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cf0eyl/cmv_it_isnt_a_problem_to_disagree_with_a_group/,changemyview,"This is a conclusion I've been reaching based on the following train of thought:

Not all Jewish people are zionist. Anti Zionist, pro peace/anti genocide Jewish factions regularly attend demonstrations in solidarity with pro Palestine causes.

When some Zionist campaigners try and twist the Palestine protest narrative towards antisemitism these non-zionist Jews who are welcome in the protest space are used as a rebuttal, ie Jewish people are welcome, the ones there is an issue with are those who are against our cause whether they are Jewish or otherwise.

I've then seen zionist groups claim that those anti zionist factions are only a small fraction of Jewish people and that the majority of Jewish people are zionist.

There doesn't really seem to be a follow up to this, leaving my conclusion to be, OK I guess I disagree with a majority of Jewish people on something?

I don't see how that's automatically an issue. I don't think the anti zionists are claiming or trying to speak on behalf of all Jews, but it seems that the zionist ones are making that majority claim.

It's not like I'd treat either person differently, it's just their ideology I disagree with, and hearing that it's held by a majority doesn't really change anything in my stance.

It's the same with other belief systems as well, I can disagree with a majority held belief without issue - and I have a hate the sun not the simmer approach to it so I don't especially have dislike or hatred for people I haven't met who hold this view, and some I've met who do are lovely so I can just dislike their belief, and ones who are not nice I can dislike because of their behaviour not their inmate characteristics.

I'm here to change my view in as much as expanding it, what am I missing? What is the goal of saying actually the majority of Jewish people have this view? Are there flaws in my train of thought that I've overlooked?

0,2024-04-28,CMV: Animal ethics are going too far,u/SnooGuavas9168,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cf0fey/cmv_animal_ethics_are_going_too_far/,changemyview,"It seems problematic to me how much society or at least the internet has changed in their views about what a good human should or should not do to an animal. 

Of course there are differences between more extreme views but from what I see almost all people in some way are not really looking rationally at how much value should we give to an animal or what makes a person ""evil"". 

In my view, sustainable ethics are ethics that both parties gain from, let's say in ancient times there is a group of black and white people, they are racist to each other but that creates a lot of wars and suffering and cooperating could bring good results for both of them, in that way cooperation should be seen as better solution and rightfully racism should be abolished. 

That's not to say if maximum reward for let's say white people is for black people to be slaves that's the better solution, it's not about maximizing gains, it's about finding a solution in which both groups may gain, if there is such a possible way to go, then it's sensible to try to achieve it, even if it is hard. 

But if there is no possible way to help one another in a way that gives one party any gain, then that's just an irrational idea to want such cooperation, I think that's exactly what is happening with animals. 

We as humans, get a lot from cooperating with another, yet if we value animal lives we gain nothing from it, even now, if let's say meat costs less for the same calories as a plant, it makes sense to buy it and eat it, the same if it tastes better, if you don't do it, animal does absolutely nothing that will benefit you in return. 

Let's say there is a rat in our house, what do I gain from letting it live in it, is there a way to cooperate with it? No, there is not, even trying to humanely kill it, somehow poison it or use some specialized tools to cause as little pain as it is possible to it, it gives no value to me, it's just additional cost, loosing some of the convenience if a simple rat trap would work, even if it was more damaging and painful in practice. 

  
Of course I don't see making animals suffer for the sake of it, anyone for anyone it is convenient has something wrong with them, or killing someone's else pets, because of course you hurt the person that has this pet or needlessly killing wildlife, because ecology is still an important thing. 

But idea that the only way to let's say kill your run over pet is to take it to a vet rather than hit it few times with a shovel and bury it, or drown / kill stray animals if they cause trouble around and it's hard to get help from the necessary services is simply irrational to me. Of course such situations are rare and I have never found myself in such a situation myself, but acting like you are bad person for doing something that people have been doing since humanity and we have no gain in stopping it just seems like ethics going too far.

",u/primalvigoni,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cf0xeo/cmv_the_current_dating_scene_is_going_a_sexual/,changemyview,"The current dating scene really isn’t good. People who are currently IN relationships, married and **have no trouble with dating will simply not be able to understand the struggles of young single people today** *because of privelege blindness.*

The concept is that if you’re someone who is in a much better position,  you will never truly be able to understand those who have always been in a bad position.

The current dating scene affects both men and women horribly. And most of it stems from the usage of **dating apps.** Whilst the concept of dating apps IS to make dating easier because of ease of accessibility to interact with more people online, it actually is in reverse. 

Why? Because dating apps are not designed to help people get dates or get into relationships. If there was even a 80% success rate for any kind of dating app, *it will simply go out of business.* These apps prey on single people to stay single because that’s how they make money. 

In fact these dating apps aren’t even singular entities anymore, it has become a monopoly. Match Group owns a total of 15 apps/sites. Popular ones namely: Hinge, Match.com, OkCupid and Tinder. 

Young women today have more rights than women had decades ago. That isn’t a bad thing at all, but this simply means that women do not have to care about dating. And based on social observation, it is true. 

Many young women don’t focus on dating or  have the need to. When they DO want to date, **they can easily hop on to any of those apps and get tons of matches**,  *which are still significantly higher than the average man.* 

The problem with dating apps is that there are also more men than women on the app. And out of the smaller proportion of women on the apps, a good chunk of those are either old accounts that have never been deleted, bots, or even profiles created BY the apps itself to engage with men (so yes, dating apps are also deceiving men by getting employees to catfish them). 

There are tons of extreme ideology that are both being pushed out to men and women. 
For men, it’s the red pill shit and Andrew Tate shit that pushes the ideology that women are akin to cars and are objects, which stirs hatred towards women. 

And the idealogy pushed to women is extreme feminism (basically misandry) proclaiming that Earth is better off without the existence of men and that men are purely the cause of women’s suffering. 

Dating is genuinely a shit show. More young men have started to give up, because it’s much easier to stay at home, work, play video games and jerk off to porn instead of going out and socialising. However, they are also inclined not to do so as **men are now taught that women do not want to be disturbed in any kind of public or social setting.**

In the back of men’s minds is that if they do approach women now, *there is an increased possibility of being called a creep* for simply wanting to get to know them more (on a romantic level). 

So what should young men do? I’d say genuinely give up and just focus on purely building their careers, investing in hobbies, improving their physical and mental health. 

If women HAVE checked out of dating because they don’t see a reason to date men, then I don’t see why men need to obsess over dating when the odds are clearly not in most of their favour. 

Eventually the dating scene will even itself out in the next decade. However if men continue to relentless pursue women IN this current dating climate, you’re going to see more men being depressed, dejected, and them being easily swayed by red pill idealogy which would then turn them to actual women hating misogynists.

If this is the case, why is the same train of thought not applicable to pedophiles. They too are born that way, and cannot be changed. I feel that a lot more blame is assigned to them for their sexuality than should be if it's out of their control.

I of course agree that blame should be assigned if they act on it. Since their preferred partner cannot give consent, and regardless of sexuality, consent is important. But if they don't act on it, how is one sexuality different from another? 

I understand that it might make people uncomfortable to think about this. But I think that is a trait of a good CMV. So I look forward to the discussion! "

The problem being that it effects all players by  
  
1.lowering their sense of accomplishment  
  
2. dampening the impact of certain game moments  
  
For example, if you could just pick any chapter in DMC 3 the second you booted it up that would kind of ruin the impact of that moment of triumph even for the people who wouldn't ever use such a function. The feeling that playing and succeeding is the only way to be here in this fight is the glue that holds masterpiece moments like this together.  
  
If I the player have to consciously ignore an option that would make arriving at my destination easier, then the sense of accomplishment gets dampened because I didn't HAVE to take the hard way. A lot of great moments in games would be less impactful as well knowing that I could essentially just be on autopilot to get there rather than having to earn my way to be there. Challenge is the core of certain video games, and that should remain concrete without having to cater to those too impatient to learn a game's systems.

I have for more than 15 years. Every once in a while, I wonder how that pornstar I used to follow all those years ago fared over the years. To my horror, most of them died young, or ended up *badly*. And a few (and few is the keyword here) of them sticked around until this day, but they're probably at the last turn of their career. 

Read a bit around the internet and you will find out that men and women in the sex industry have a life expectancy of 55 years max. One big thing I noticed is that most studies on the life expectancy of porn performers are made by christian agencies with an agenda. That could very well be the case. However, It's also interesting to note that the industry itself has seemingly never carried out internal studies on the topic. Academically there seems to be very little interest as well. If the industry wanted to convince everyone that people are just prejudiced, carrying an internal study of how well they do in this line of work would be a great way to shut the mouths of them pesky christian bigots and crazy feminists. If they haven't done so in 50+ years... well, that's interesting.

If we exclude the ""big stars"", porn performers have the habit of disappearing completely from one day to the next. They work for max 10 years, but most of the time just one or two. And then it's like they never existed. But in general, most of those who get in last for 2 years max. And they usually start *very young*. Also, when they become big enough they will separate from the industry and stop everything. Sometimes, they will outright denounce the industry, or just avoid any questions about it.

Anecdotally, I decided to stop watching mainstream porn over all the allegations we all know: getting actors hooked on cocaine and other drugs and carrying them around like zombies, the sex trafficking, sexual violence, etc. So I thought ""it's a good time to switch to more ethical, self-employed people!""

Uuuhhhmm... well, first thing I see: fuckton of weed and hashish. Then, I noticed quite a few videos with people starting to get going, and on the table, cocaine lines, ketamine, pills and whatever. You go check the Twitter of a few performers, and you will find even worse. Once I checked one of those ""feminist pornographers"", and her twitter is full of posts about getting drugs, extasy, ketamine, etc. They are actually *very open* about their drugs consumption. No one hides anything online, but they deny everything in interviews. Which makes you think that either they're deeply foolish, or they're trying to be edgy. And a pornstar trying to be edgy is quite funny, everything considered.

So, it looks like there's literally no escape: to make it in porn you have to be a psychopath, a sensation seeker who has no scruples and barely any emotions to speak for. If you aren't that, then you need to haze yourself with as many drugs you can get your hands on and live in a state of dissociation 24/7. If that doesn't work either, then you have to be a deeply mentally ill and traumatized kind of person and have a completely distorted view of reality."

",u/Suspicious_Ferret109,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cf4cf7/cmv_if_you_have_not_love_the_person_deeply_then/,changemyview,"Ordinarily, this is our logic, that if you love a person too much you will grieve too much when he is gone. The logic is fallacious; the logic has a very deep flaw in it. In fact, if you have loved a person really, when he is gone he is gone; you will not grieve much. If you have not loved the person deeply, then you will grieve very much. Try to understand this.

Your father dies, or your mother dies. If you have loved him totally while he was alive, you will be able to say goodbye to him without any grief -- because you loved him. That experience of love was total and fulfilling; nothing is left undone; nothing is hanging over your head. Whatsoever was possible has happened; now you can accept it. What more was possible? Even if he had been alive, what more would have been possible? The experience is complete.

Whenever an experience is complete, you are ready to say goodbye very easily. But if you have not loved your father as you always wanted to, you have not been respectful towards him as you always wanted to, you will feel guilty. Now the father is gone; now there is no way to fulfill your desire -- now there is no way to show your respect, your love. Now there is no way, you will feel yourself hanging in the middle, in mid-air, in a limbo. You will not be at ease; you cannot say goodbye. You will cry and weep and you will be broken, and you will say that you are broken because your father is dead, but the real thing is something else.

You are broken because now the possibility to love him, to respect him, is gone. Now there is no possibility -- the doors are closed and you have missed an opportunity. The son will cry more if he has not really loved his father. If he has loved his father he will be able to accept the fact -- love is very accepting and very understanding.

Once an experience is complete, you can get out of it very easily -- you can just slip out of it as the snake slips out of his old skin. If you love a woman and you have been constantly quarrelling with her, and it never became a deep satisfaction, and she dies... now she will haunt you, her ghost will haunt you for your whole life. You could not do something that was possible, but now it is no longer possible. Now something incomplete will always be there in the heart, hurting; it will become a wound.

This is the understanding of all the sages, that while you are loving a person, if you love him totally there is going to be no misery. If you love him totally, if you enjoy and delight in him totally, and the person is gone -- of course, one feels a little sad but it is not grief; one misses a little but one is capable of remaining centered, one is not distracted.

If you are in love, love totally, so nothing remains hanging. Otherwise, that hanging, incomplete experience, that unlived experience, will haunt you. These unlived experiences go on piling up and they become heavy burdens. And the problem is that now there is no way -- what to do with them? You cannot complete them because the person has disappeared. You cannot drop them because incomplete experiences cannot be dropped. It is just like a ripe fruit drops of its own accord. When it is ripe, it drops; when it is not ripe, it is difficult to drop. Whenever an experience is complete, it is a ripe fruit -- it drops of its own accord. It leaves no scar behind, no wound.

I used to know a woman who was very unhappy with the husband -- almost in hell, continuously fighting, quarrelling, nagging. The husband started drinking too much, just to avoid all this. Then the fight became even more fierce, because the wife started fighting against his drinking. It led him to even more drinking. When he was only thirty-six he died -- died because of too much drinking.

The woman was never happy. She lived with him for almost seven years, she was never happy. All those seven years I used to know them -- they were next-door neighbors to me -- and always the husband would come with his miseries, and the wife would come with her miseries -- I was a silent watcher. Then the husband died, and the woman became so sad. Months passed and she was crying and crying, and she was going mad!

One day I went to her, and there was nobody else so I told her, ""Now I can be true to you: Stop this nonsense! -- because you were never happy with this man. In fact, many times you have told me that if this man dies it will be good. Now he is dead; he has fulfilled your desire, so why are you crying and weeping? I can't see any point in it! Are you missing all those fights? Are you missing all that misery? -- because I cannot see that you are missing the man, because there was nothing in it!""

She was shocked. She had never expected something like that from me or from anybody else. People in such situations expect sympathy. I said, ""Stop this nonsense! I know that you were never happy. Now you can be happy! He is no longer there to create any trouble.""

She looked at me, shocked. Her tears dried and she said, ""It is shocking, but you have made me alert about one thing: I am not missing him at all. I am simply crying and weeping because I could not love him. It is not his death -- it is my own missed experience of love. I loved that man, but I could not love him. We wasted the whole opportunity in quarrelling over futile things. Now I know those things mean nothing; now that he is gone, I know those things were just trivia. I can't even remember the reasons why we were fighting continuously.""

If you love a person totally, and the experience is complete, has enriched you, you can say goodbye. Of course, there will be sadness but there will be no grief. And sadness is natural. It will disappear in time; it is nothing to be worried about. You will miss the person a little while -- natural -- but you will not be in grief.

The accidental man says if you don't cry when a person is dead, that means you never loved him. I say it is because he really loved the person. Now that he is gone, he is gone!

Love is understanding. And love is so understanding that not only does it understand life, it understands death also."

Don’t get me wrong it’s of course a crime but I think other aspects makes it more scary like the unpredictable nature of the situation. What will he do next for example. For example is it so that many women have a kink for it after that so maybe the guy was not repulsing it was physical arousing but such a guy could do anything after that… I ( m and it was woman)was also in such a situation and after that I not traumatized but I felt tricked. And again you don’t develop a kink if not even if it’s just a tiny part was arousing to you it’s not entirely a trauma coping mechanism."

&#x200B;

 AI art alone takes away the jobs of artists, photographers, designers, models, etc. You can tell that AI is taking over art and photos because ads, news articles, and Facebook posts are all covered with AI-generated images. I haven't seen a real photograph in a news article in ages, and it's worsening.

 To those who say AI art doesn't take away real artists' jobs, just search up AI art and you'll see. AI ""artists"" are paid hundreds and thousands of dollars to generate AI images and act as if they drew them themselves. That money could have gone to real artists who desperately need the money. Designers and illustrators are losing their jobs as AI ""art"" technology can just generate images their customers want very quickly. AI storybooks for children are taking over book websites. I've seen a person doing an AI-generated book-making class for hundreds of dollars per class. That person has already done tens of classes with many students, and so have others.

&#x200B;

 Writers and composers are not safe from AI either. AI is already generating high-quality songs for free. I've tried it and it's impossible to tell if it was generated by AI. With just a tiny bit of tweaking it could be turned into a genuinely good song. 

 My friend, a high schooler trying to major in music, writes songs for people. Customers declined greatly after free AI music became available in an app a lot of people use in my country.

 Writers are struggling as AI-generated books that are rip-offs of their books and mass-produced books that are low quality and shitty are taking over and stopping their books from being recommended.

&#x200B;

 If this continues, AI will take over the majority of human jobs. With AI, kids will no longer be motivated to be creative since they can just use AI tech to generate what they want. Media will be filled with AI-generated images, books, videos, and music because why would anyone pay for something they can generate for free quickly? We will lose one of the only things that makes us special: our creativity.

&#x200B;

 Now about why AI affects \*you\*, a normal human who is not interested in art or photography or anything. AI's pros are its cons. It is easy and quick to use and available to everyone. You are already seeing AI everywhere. Social media platforms, advice websites, customer services, etc. AI is used for karma farming, sniping, and replying to your email complaints. These were already a problem, and the development of AI is just making it worse. I'm so sick of AI customer service. They literally don't understand anything. "

0,2024-04-28,CMV: Rape and abuse against men is taken more seriously than rape and abuse against women,u/Appropriate_Cash_890,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cf89i3/cmv_rape_and_abuse_against_men_is_taken_more/,changemyview,"I understand this title is going to get people particularly men a bit........upset but hear me out. 

The general belief is that abuse and rape against men is an under discussed topic and the societal reaction towards such violence against men is a prime example of a double standard against men  where people don't take it more seriously. 

However from my observation........that.......that dosen't seem to be the case. 

I noticed that people take rape against men more seriously especially if the perpetrator is a woman. They actively support the male victim, they don't blame the male victim for being raped and the woman who raped the man isn't sympthaised. No one talks about ""oh this could be false, it could destroy her"", instead you get insults thrown towards her or the classic ""if a man did this"" 

It's quite interesting why people are more reactive towards woman raping a man than a man raping a man and stats show that men are the biggest perpetrators of sexual violence against men as well as women. Then you have people police or pin point every edgy joke women make about male rape. A well known pornstar Riley Reid made a joke about how she had sex with her boyfriend who at the time didn't want to do it. 

Then you have Mindy Kaling admitted to kissing a co worker without his consent and she was called out for it. Same with Katty Perry who infamously kissed a male contest by suprise. 

You get the point, all of these are documented. Whereas men do this everyday to women, yet never get the same backlash as women do. Or at least never get the same heat as women do when they are caught harassing a man. Donald Trump has 26 sexual assault allegations against him and he still became the president. 

So i thnk this whole reaction is because people want to find a way to shut women up by saying ""women do the same thing to men get over it"". Which i believe is extremely misogynistic as women don't sexually harass or rape anyone in the same magnitude as men. Hell most of the perpetrators of sexual violence against men are other men, so why are women getting more backlash than men?

As for abuse, studies show women are more likely to be arrested than men in DMV call, women who kill their husbands (even though it is under self defense) spend more time in prison than men who kill their wives etc. 

Gabby Petito is a prime example of Gabby Petito is a good example of how men are believed over women, the man was treated as a victim whereas Gabby was seen as crazy and abusive because she fought back against his abuse. And yet again in DMV situations against men, experts again say the primary perpetrator are other men ( male relatives) With all these evidence i don't understand why anyone thinks men aren't taken seriously. Now this is a topic is a serious topic about men and i want to make sure that the stigma against this actually exists so that we can tackle this. 

I am hoping someone can change my view and prove that there is a stigma against male abuse and rape victims especially when their perpetrator is a woman. I really hope men aren't lying about the stigma and this is a genuine obstacle men face when reporting such violence

Changing their minds in the UK does nothing in the affected countries, the protest/marching itself seems fundamentally pointless - e.g. ""no to genocide"", an opinion any rational person would have and not necessarily representative of the issues at hand and serves only to muddy the waters of the real debate, whose mind are they trying to change, other than to rankle people who might be on the other side of the fence.

While there are a few cases of movies that have done well (Looking at you Edge of Tomorrow), there’s also a history of some of the worst of flops in recent memory. Ghost in the Shell and especially Dragonball Evolution are both atrocious pieces, and DB Evolution especially looks like a good piece for us to use when examining the upcoming Naruto movie that was somewhat recently announced.

So I guess I should start out by coveting that I don’t know much about Cretton here- I saw Shang-Chi and thought it was fine, if a bit forgettable. If he has real chops outside of that, I’m unaware. So that might be a blind spot for me here.

Back to my point though- Dragonball Evolution was produced in 2009, DBZ had been airing in the US since 1996. Why does this matter? I think there is a bit of a problem that you run into when you try to adapt things that are more than a decade gone from their original run. You get an issue of dual appeal. These kinds of things need to be marketable towards kids but the folks who actually watched the source material when it came out are now adults, the movies gets stuck with a sort of inability to commit to a mature or family friendly tone.

I bring all of this up because the folks that watched Naruto on Cartoon Network when it first aired are approaching 30. I could easily see them aging up the cast to compensate for this, something that probably won’t appease anyone. And I could imagine a movie where a lot of nonsensical choices are made to try and achieve that dual appeal.

Also, Naruto isn’t really a great fit for a movie series frankly? The land of waves, as much as I enjoyed it when I was young, doesn’t feel like it has a ton of oomph for what’s theoretically the first of a blockbuster franchise. I’d almost want to start with the Chunin exams because for my money that’s really where the show gets good. I could see a mediocre movie about the land of waves not even getting a sequel.

And finally, Naruto has a tough aesthetic to bring to live action. It’s weird and anachronistic, down to the way people dress. I feel like there’s no way to make it look good.

All of this said, maybe a brilliant director and perfect casting could make this movie good. But I see all the signs of another really shitty cash-in."

•Environmental destruction
•Natural disasters
•Grief
•Murder

I could go on but this is mostly what the show deals with and presents. What makes it kid friendly is by focusing on the emotions and consequences of each of these problems (also having no blood or gore helps lol) 

I see no reason why kids can’t learn about mature topics from kids shows as long as it follows the criteria above although my mind is open to change."

**TL;DR in bold at the end.**  


i’d appreciate some outside opinions to settle a relatively low stakes disagreement i am currently having.  


i am an american. and i have a friend who is in argentina where she was born and raised. let’s call her esperanza. we do most of our communication in english because she is brilliant at english and my spanish isn’t great (i haven’t spoken it much since i was in school like 15 years ago). she says talking to me in english has been great for her language skills and so for the past few months i’ve been practicing my spanish to try to get better.  


that’s some background, this is the disagreement:  
esperanza has a cat and until today i thought the cat was named “tuna”. but while we were talking it hit me that esperanza, a native spanish speaker, who uses spanish nearly 100% of the time in her day to day life, has given her cat an english word for a name! so i asked if she actually calls her cat “tuna” or “atún” (the spanish word for tuna) and she said atún! my stance is that her cat is “atún” and it’s wrong to change it to the english version for me. not wrong as in immoral, just essentially that she told me the wrong name.  


like i said, this is low stakes, our disagreement is playful not a real argument. and i know people give their pets all sorts of funny nicknames and that often they aren’t at all related to the pets given name, but it got me thinking. i grew up in a house where more than one language was spoken and i’ve always been interested in the different words for things and cultural naming conventions around the world. and the more i think about it the more i stand by my original stance.  


my point is that people all over the world have names that originate from different languages. and that your name is your name. it doesn’t change if you change the language. the pronunciation or accent may differ but the actual name remains the same. her cat isn’t named as an abstract representation of the fish in the “scombridae” family. her cat is named “atún”. “esperanza” in english translates to “hope”, but i wouldn’t call esparanza hope. those are two different words and two different names. and i wouldn’t call a “carlos” “charles” even though they’re different language versions of the same name.  


her point is that it’s like when there was a taiwanese exchange student at her school and he picked the name pablo, you can have different names in different languages. or, for example, how in the spanish speaking world mariah carey is pronounce “maria kah-ray” like in this video of carlos sainz and lando norris [https://youtube.com/shorts/KeDvBjPBym4?si=KMiB0Euz92pfCZ9m](https://youtube.com/shorts/KeDvBjPBym4?si=KMiB0Euz92pfCZ9m)  


i have rebuttals to both those points but i wont include them here to avoid biasing people since esparanza isn’t here to further argue her side.  


one argument esparanza has that i don’t think wins her the argument but i AM sympathetic to is that when she’s speaking english it would be disruptive to include a spanish word and vice verse because it’s difficult to switch languages because she’s in different mindsets with each language.  


**TL;DR**  
**my spanish speaking friend calls her cat “atún” IRL and only refers to her as “tuna"" when speaking to me, because i’m pretty much the only one she talks to in english. has she changed the cat’s name? does her cat have two names? is it incorrect to change a given name to a different version when you switch languages? does your answer change if it’s a person instead of a cat?**"

They essentially mass migrated a foreign population into a land and took control of it. I think Palestinians in '48 would have had a right to be upset, *maybe* even commit violent resistance.

However it has now been over 75 years since the Nakba in '48. Since then, Israel has defended itself from innumerous terrorist attacks and from multiple wars.

Now that we are here, the way of history would dictate that we pursue peace and that involves accepting that Israel should never have to be returned to the descendants of the previous owners. We don't see that ever occuring in history.

Therefore the Palestinians should accept that they have no entitlement back to Israel. That doesn't justify terrorist actions, it also doesn't justify inhumane sanctions."

Anything you can think of is almost always 1000x more fun when you do it with someone else and being ugly has locked me out of that becuase it deprives you of relationships and even FRIENDS 

Being ugly makes it hard to make friends because it’s been studied that when you’re ugly and people meet you for the first time they typically assume negative things about you and it becomes hard to overcome that negative perception 

Especially for me since I’ve been bullied and mocked my life experience tells me no one would ever want to be friends with me and they’d be embarrassed to be seen in public with me even if they actually liked me 

The dirty looks, the disrespect it’s possible to manage in small doses, but being ugly makes it such a common occurrence that it eventually effects your mental health making you anxious and depressed which are extremely repulsive to people on top of being ugly 

Professionally you’re less likely to get hired for a job if you’re ugly and if you do get hired you’ll be disrespected and often given more work and coworkers can sometimes go out of their way to outcast you 

In my experience as an ugly person not only had it made me unable to develop any type of relationships but it’s also made me a target for insults from strangers, adding insult to injury… 

Solitary hobbies have never been able to make up for the extreme loneliness and mistreatment I face almost everyday when I want nothing more than to comfortably talk to people and have relationships like everyone else

The least I can hope for is that, as a late 20's guy living in NJ (where, as far as the environment is concerned, is tolerable from what I've endured so far), my lifespan wouldn't live long enough to see hell on Earth. That I can simply just relax, go about my life, and pass away peacefully as an elder before things got ugly. But I have my concerns that it won't be the case.

I fear of winters no longer receiving snow that builds up on the ground (where snow instantly melts). I fear of springs and summers being extremely hot. I fear of crops not growing due to environmental issues. I fear of possible rising of sea levels affecting my home state. And heavens know how many other issues could happen upon NJ in my lifetime.

People have been saying since the start of the war that Russia is targeting civilians in Ukraine but i am always very confused on why they say that for few reasons.

The military deaths in the Ukraine-Russia war are way higher compared to the civilians casualties.
Russia has 50k deaths(confirmed by name) and Ukraine has 42k deaths (confirmed by name) while the UN estimates 10k deaths in 2 years for  Ukranian civilians so for every Ukranian civilian that dies 4 Ukranian soldiers die this sounds a lot untill you look at other conflicts like the Gaza Israel war where for 30 civilians die for every Hamas soldier the Ukraine war has seen multiple small battles like in Gaza like the battle of bakhmut so it isn’t the difference in warfare. Or the US invasion of iraq wich killed 7 thousand civilians in 1 month.
Sources for these numbers are from wikipedia.

So if Russia was actually targeting civilians why are the civilians casualties not way higher? And why aren’t we seeing thousands of deaths civilians like in the Gaza war?"

0,2024-04-28,"CMV: GamerGate was actually right, and is not about bigotry. Its about the destruction of Gaming Culture and the Gamer Identity by outsiders.",u/ArguingMaster,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cfnj9g/cmv_gamergate_was_actually_right_and_is_not_about/,changemyview,"So I want to preface this by saying, I've been aware of the GamerGate movement since at least 2014, and I used to be very, very strongly against GamerGate. I specifically remember reading an article describing it back in the day and thinking ""well, this is stupid"" and more or less writing it off as a bunch of fringe weirdos trying to kick women out of gaming.  I suppose I should also mention (since people will undoubtedly consider this a factor) that I am a white, straight, cis male from a rural area. My life experiences largely reflect this, and I do not believe that being white gives you any advantage in the year 2024 nor that being of any other race gives you a disadvantage purely because of ones race. I believe that people are products entirely of their circumstances which I do acknowledge vary by race due to prevalent socio-economic conditions in those communities. I acknowledge that women experience discrimination in many forms throughout their lives. I would describe myself as entirely apathetic to social justice movements, as I believe most of them have no reasonable, defined conditions for when their demands have been met and that many of them are grifts benefiting a small number of people financially. 

Well 10 years later and I've been having a bit of a crisis lately wondering why every single video game, every single movie, every single TV shows is absolute garbage compared to what we got 20,10 or even just 5 years ago. Video games are my only escape from how much life fucking sucks, there are the one place I can amount to something. I can be a great general, a race car driver, a hero traveling across ancient lands collecting rare loot, etc. Yet every single game seems to be filled with predatory monetization schemes, and worse yet is shoved FULL of obvious pandering to every group of whiny, terminally online twitter users out there and in your face real world politics.

I hate to say it, but I feel like the only people that see what is happening and are trying to stop it, trying to protect our hobby, is the GamerGate crowd. Nobody else is offering solutions or a platform for discussion If you try to mention this shit anywhere else you get banned or otherwise removed from the discussion. I don't agree with everything that goes on in the GamerGate scene and I won't deny there are a small number of bad actors who use GamerGate as a cloak for what is just blatant bigotry, but most people are just sick of the all the insanity and pandering going on. People that just want the kind of games we got 20 years ago made again. People try to categorize GamerGate as a far right hate group, but most of these people would have been considered mainstream US liberals 20 years ago. ***FFS I myself tend to lean towards extreme left wing economic policy, and I used to lean pretty far left in terms of social policy but I feel like I'm slowly drifting away from that because of the same reasons I feel I'm being forced into the GamerGate sphere.*** If I don't feel like my views are being given fair consideration, and that I don't have a voice in something, and that I don't have a place in a movement my usual response is to support the opposite side. 

Some examples of things that have caused a stir in the past few years:

* The censorship of the video game Stellar Blade where in several of the characters outfits were modified to be less revealing and the games gore was toned down considerably. This was done in a day 1 patch, after the reviewers had already had review copies sent to them. This also came after the devs promised the game was going to be uncensored in all regions. The game was also given lower review scores by some gaming journalists because of the revealing out fits. 
* It was discovered that many 3rd party consulting firms were interfering in the development of games by requiring games meet certain diversity quotas before they would work on the game (these 3rd party firms are largely necessary to create modern games due to their scale), this led to games having their characters radically altered. A common example is Alan Wake 2, where a character previously shown to be white in a teaser at the end of Quantum Break 2 has been race swapped to black, with allegations this was done at the request of the 3rd party consulting firm. The game, set 10 years after the original, also contains other obvious alterations to the portrayal of race in universe such as the main town the game is set (which is a stereotypical rural mountain town) suddenly going from having a very low black population to an unrealistic near 50/50 ratio. Some of these firms even are openly focused on inserting diversity into games, such as the consultancy firm Black Girl Gamers.
* Rampant censorship in remakes of old video games, such as alterations or removal of content deemed to be sexist, racist, or otherwise problematic despite having been considered to be perfectly fine 10 or 20 years ago.
* The developers of the video game Kingdom Come Deliverance have been repeatedly harassed about the fact that their video game, which is set in medieval europe, does not contain many people of color, thus claiming the game is not diverse. This is despite the fact that Europe was very mono racial in the locale and time the game takes place in, and the game is in fact extremely diverse featuring accurate representations of many different ethnic groups. I'd argue these people don't know that not all white people were historically considered to be of the same racial group. Wars were literally fought over determining who could be considered white, even if the peoples warring had nearly identical skin tones. 
* Translations of many Japanese video games commonly have their dialogue edited in such a way as to change the meaning of what was said to align more with western speech patterns and in particular to meet the western definition of what is appropriate for the targeted video game rating.
* Hogwarts Legacy, a game set in the Harry Potter universe, was forcibly boycotted by almost every online discussion platform in an attempt to tank the sales of the game. This was done because the creator of the IP is a known political activist who's takes are considered by some to be problematic. This is despite the video game containing content which is directly opposite to the opinion of the author. Just mentioning that you bought and enjoyed the game was enough to get you banned from many major online discussion platforms (I bought it on launch day, FYI).
* Jason Schreier several years ago attacked a newly founded video game studio saying that ""its shocking a new video game studio still looks like this"" in reference to to a picture of the studios staff whom all appeared to be white and male. This is despite the fact that it was a small studio, that arose out of the common interests of a group of friends who wanted to make a video game. 
* Renowned video game writer Chris Avellone was essentially kicked out of the industry several years ago after allegations of sexual harassment by several women. His contributions were removed from several up and coming games, and he subsequently found it nearly impossible to find work in the industry. These claims were later admitted to be 100 percent fabricated by the women in question, yet none of Avellones work was restored to games that had been in development, nor was his position in the industry restored. In fact, some people continued to treat Avellone as guilty.

I believe that all of these things wouldn't have happened 20 years ago, as what was acceptable in a video game was much more broad and there were far less mandates in place as to diversity in a video game. Before I go any further, I must define both Gamer Culture and the Gamer Identity.

* Gamer Culture: The culture surrounding video games, the prevalent attitudes towards gaming, and the industry and fandom around video games. Specifically it is the culture of people who would identify as Gamers.
* the Gamer Identity: People who first and foremost identity themselves as Gamers. This is similar to how someone who partakes in Skateboarding might identify themselves as a skateboarder first and foremost. The Gamer is someone who's primary hobby is playing video games, is heavily invested into video game culture, and has a genuine interest in the fine details of gaming. 

I believe both these things have been diluted by an influx of activists from outside groups who feel they have a right to be represented in every aspect of the world. Most of these people probably do not even play video games, but are in positions of power within the games industry anyways and seek to force a change in gaming culture from the top down and force the traditional gaming crowd out of the hobby. I'll be blunt: Gaming is a traditionally male, traditionally nerdy, and largely white space. This should not be used as a reason to exclude anyone from gaming, but it should be considered when evaluating the hobby. Nearly every hobby you can think of has a core demographic, this is the core demographic of gaming. The problem is there a massive push in gaming to demonize and exclude that core demographic for the purpose of catering to people who would not otherwise participate in video gaming.  These groups have brought their hyper-politicized social justice movements with them and are attempting to forcibly integrate the gaming space into those movements. 

* If you complain about unrealistic or lore-incompatible changes to race you are called a racist
* If you complain about unrealistic or lore incompatible changes to the ratio of males to females in games you are called a sexist.
* If you complain about the uglification of women in video games you are accused of ""wanting content to satisfy the male gaze"" and called an incel

etc it goes on and on. The fact of the matter nobody had a problem with a game that had a mostly or entirely white character group 20 years ago, nobody had a problem with strong straight male leads in video games 20 years ago, nobody was concerned with the size of Lara Crofts chest 20 years ago, etc. Because people recognized that games were primarily made by white, nerdy, men for other white, nerdy, men. This isn't a conspiracy theory or some supremacist assertion, connect to any online game and listen to the voice chat and you'll see this reflected. Look at old school game developers and their staff composition. Look at the crowds at major industry events. Outsiders or people partaking casually in gaming (whom are not culturally gamers) saw this and have made every effort to force that core group out of gaming by making sure there almost no games that are made for that group. Today companies like Ubisoft literally have diversity quotas for their staff, major gaming corporations go out of their way to diversify their upper management even if that means having fewer cultural gamers on their staff in leadership positions, etc. Major news outlets will assault the games industry at random to try to force IRL mainstream politics into the industry. This is all tied into the modern political hysteria surrounding race and gender in America. I generally align with the saying that if something was acceptable 20 years ago, it should probably still be acceptable today, as the last 10-15 years seems to be where we went off the rails and stopped solving actual issues in our country, and started focusing on fake manufactured culture war shit.

GamersGate was correct, they just saw this stuff coming before anyone else did. Or maybe the grievances of the movement changed over time to reflect what was happening to the industry. Either way I believe GamerGate is right, and is no way shape or form a hate movement. Most of us just want the kind of games we enjoyed 10 or 20 years ago to be made again, and to not have to deal with IRL politics and social standards in the games we specifically play to get away from that bullshit. ***We don't even want to exclude anyone from playing games, we just want those people to respect that they are walking into OUR culture and that it isn't their place to file complaints or demand change.*** I wish I could make that sentence more highlighted than just changing the font to being bolded. I feel like this has been additionally caused by the fact people don't understand anymore that the Internet isn't real life. You insulting someone in a video game isn't the same as insulting them IRL, its OK to do things that aren't socially acceptable IRL online. Its an outlet from the insane amount of work it takes to not get yourself cancelled in today society. I just want my fucking hobby back, I want more games like the ones that I used to enjoy so much when I was younger. And I want to not be labeled as bigoted, racist, sexist incel for wanting games that cater to its original core demographic and for the industry to be turn back around towards quality games made by true creatives."

10,2024-04-28,CMV: the wrong bid won the NGSW contract.,u/Thoth_the_5th_of_Tho,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cfo7sv/cmv_the_wrong_bid_won_the_ngsw_contract/,changemyview,"To summarize the situation, the army has been looking to replace the M16/M4 rifle since it was adopted as an interim solution in the 60s. There have been dozens of projects to do this, from completely absurd an hopeless, like OICW, to the very promising LSAT. All of them fell though, except for NGSW, that finally finished and selected a new rifle, meant to eventually replace the M4, the XM7. 

NGSW had three bids, from Sig, Textron and General Dynamics, in the end Sig won. Each design had clear advantages and disadvantages over the others, I argue that both of the other bids would have been better options, and the advantages of the Sig bid are nonsensical and pointless.

NGSW was built around an already debatable requirement for an incredibly powerful, 6.8mm round, more powerful than 7.62. General Dynamics dealt with this by submitting a rifle with polymer cased ammo, to reduce weight, and a long barrel in a bull-pup configuration to make hitting velocity requirements possible at a lower chamber pressures. They also had the advantage of being able to easily convert existing MGs to run on the new ammo, and their rifle could fire from either a closer or open bolt, which is potentially a very useful feature.

Textron's bid was an evolution of their older work on LSAT, with polymer, telecopied ammo. This offered the best possible weight savings, especially for the machine gun, but the rifle seemed a bit awkward an unremarkable in comparison to the GD bit. LSAT was already a very promising program, that had a lot of work and testing done for it. So although this one diverges the most from a traditional rifle, it's fairly conservative technologically, and likely offered the best possible performance from the MG portion of the bid. 

Sig on the other hand structured the entire gun around being as ergonomically similar to the M4 as possible. It didn't use any modern features to cut down on ammo weight for these huge new round, and instead stuck with a short barrel, and hit the velocity target by increasing the chamber pressure to an absurd degree (forcing a two piece, hybrid case). The gun is so conservative and muddled in its design they ended up not able to decide if it should have a side or rear charging handle, and ended up putting on both.

Being ergonomically similar to the M4 is not important. The idea is for this to replace the M4, and become the standard weapon people train on for decades. Demanding it be ergonomically interchangeable with the previous rifle is just as pointless as demanding the M4 be ergonomically identical to the M2 carbine from ww2 (seriously, how many people are going to appreciate that it has two separate charging handles? People are going to use one, and the other will be dead weight and bulk. This is even more pointless than the M16's forward assist). The incredibly high chamber pressure is also a concern, they claim that improved metallurgy means the barrels don't wear out too quickly, but they also use lower pressure rounds for training, indicating they have doubts. And the main issue is of course weight, soldiers are already over loaded, and the army has selected the heaviest rifle offered. 

Defenders of the army's choice frequently focus on the XM250, the machine gun portion of the bid. I agree that there is less to object too in that direction, but that's only because its an unremarkable design, with performance not dissimilar to existing light weight, rifle caliber, belt fed MGs, that have been available for decades. The soviet PK MG, in service since the 60s, is comparable in effect on target, at the expense of being a bit heavier. You tend not to see rifle caliber MGs used as SAWs, because of the ammo weight problem. The other two bids tried to fix this with polymer cases. Sig just didn't fix the problem, and ended up making a rifle comparable to the G3, and a machine gun comparable to a PK. If another NATO country wanted to copy the capability of the squads the US fields based around this concept, they could get 90% of the capability for less than 10% the cost by scrounging up the various early Cold War battle rifles and LMGs Sig clearly based their designs on. 

Ergonomic similarity to an unrelated rifle should not have been a deciding factor in the NGSW program, certainly not more so than weight and capability."

Aside from Tesla, foreign brands produce more vehicles in the USA. BMW, which literally has a Bundeslander in its name, exports the most American-built vehicles by revenue. Why should the USA continue to produce cars if foreign brands can do it better? That’s why the American government should give American car companies 15 years to prove themselves. If company does not introduce at least one vehicle in the top 10 best selling lists and the brand doesn’t make it to the top 10 or within 10 points of Toyota’s CR score, the company will lose funding from the government. This will ensure that companies  actually benefit from competition."

For americans themselves they could be right that no longer being an empire with a single vision could be a detriment to them. I think a lot of these issues can be curbed by seceding but keeping more of an eu approach.

The american dollar would stay the same, the passport same, military spending would have to be reached as per a consensus. However states rights would get much more power, just as the south has always wanted and how i think the us was always set up to be.

At this point the biggest factor would just be to break things up into smaller, more manageable pieces. It will make the inevitable fall of late stage capitalism a little less of the bloody mess its sure to be.

That works out at the same ratio, 2:1.

This to me makes the use of that same ratio as a defence of IDF actions quite strange. If it's lauded as some kind of special occurance, lower than other conflicts and proof that they are minimising civilian casualties then why not the same for the other side, when the ratio is that same, special number?

While my title is a tad tongue in cheek, the conclusion is sort of the same. Either it's a convincing argument for both, or neither, I don't see why it would only apply to one side of the conflict as any kind of special figure demonstrating behaviour on one side but not the other."

Israel has well-trained special forces, they could find and kill hamas members with almost no civilian deaths… but no, they rather use a terrorist group to justify their own terrorist acts trying to get away with this genocide

There is plenty of evidence that many Israelis support the killing of civilians since they don’t see Palestinians as humans and want them all dead. 
That’s the same Hitler did, he classified Jews as rats so ppl would start showing less empathy towards them which was one of the main reasons why so many Germans supported his regime.

Arguing that Israel is just defending themselves is nonsense, just look at the numbers, that’s no defense, that’s a mass murder:

Palestinians killed: around 35 000, 15 000 alone are children and another 8 000 women

15 000 children killed !!!!! how can this be tolerated???

Israelis killed: around 1100, that’s almost 1500% less than the children they killed… and they are talking about defense…

how can such a thing happen in the 21st century? 
and how come we are funding such a cruelty? 
I doubt God would ever bless a country which is supporting such a genocide.

Again, this is no pro-hamas post, but if you are against Hamas, then you have to be against Israel as well since they are both the same evil."

Let’s all be honest here, the men (SOME, not ALL) only use this argument as a means to weaponize a real issue. It’s nothing more than a poorly thought through defense mechanism. 

I’m all for Justice for sexual assault. However, when you go out of your way to make yourself out to be a victim when talking about women, is small minded. If you are really in support of male victims, go donate to organizations like RAINN. Go do a peaceful protest in the name of victims who did not receive proper Justice. Post online and shine light on it. Because, honestly, it needs to be done. Especially as of late, with six (I believe, might be more) female teachers just getting arrested for having sexual relations with students. It’s a huge issue. And it’s way too romanticized/sexualized/normalized within our society. 

Female victims don’t deserve to have their voices muffled by incel men. And male victims don’t deserve to be weaponized and used by men who wouldn’t give too shits about them. Especially when those same men would be the types to say, “You shouldve like it”. 🤢

But then there are Fly Swatters. They are not only useless – they make the SOLE task they were designed for, impossible.   
I say this in the light of the Global Fly Swatter market [soaring with an expected growth rate of \~5%](https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/fly-swatter-market-report).

A fly Swatter on its own could have been a prime example of how mankind invents solutions for problems – a fly is bothering you? Get rid of it with the minimalistic and aeon-old design of a stick with a flat surface at one end. However, this is a dead end. Because a fly will *always* notice the fly swatter coming down, escaping before its imminent death. They are *evolutionary optimized* for noticing fast motions like these. Given, that this *only* theoretically works, if the fly is sitting on a flat, reachable and solid surface - so no lamps, no crowded surfaces, no ceilings and *no flying around* for the *fly* – which narrows the expected usecase extremely down, if the thing would function (which it doesn't).  


As a civilized society, we possess far better options to deal with flys already. Best way to catch a fly? Nearing your hand slowly – very slowly – with a glass, then catching it in the glass. Boom. Why does it work a thousand times better? Because a fly doesn't notice very slow movements! Yes, it has to sit down on a surface, but you are able to get it even in complicated or fragile environments. And you *already* have a glass in your home. A Napkin works too, if you near yourself closely. ""well"", some ill-advised fly-swatter-enthusiast could argue, ""you could do the same with the fly swatter, being slow and all that."" to which i would answer: ""NO, especially with a fly swatter you can't do that, because it has this long handle that makes controlling your movements impossible - the lever will always amplify even your slightest shake into a motion, that alerts the fly."" 

And if this certainly confused individuum would then argue, how a fly swatter is good for the ceilings, because it has this handle, that a glass and a napkin don't have – well, we all know, how damn well it works to poke the ceiling with your fly swatter (if you can reach it at all, they cap the size exactly so that you can't reach any ceiling in DIN-Norm), as it is orthogonal, not parallel to the damn surface. You would something like this:

\_\_\_\_\_\_ <- the ceiling

\---

 | <- the improved fly swatter

  
And please, please spare me the only other usage for a fly swatter known to this world, getting small things from under the kitchen corner, that rolled there. Ever heard of a stick? Yes, its better for this. Wanna know why? Because it has an actual surface to push things around. the thinness and the rounded edges of a fly swatter actively work against this purpose. As if someone would have thought to himself ""Well, this product is so useless, lets make it even useless for the unintended tasks that someone uses it for because he wouldn't use it for the task he bought it for. Yes, we thought about this – not a smidge of usefulness for you sir""

You’re protesting against the occupation of someone’s land (this isn’t about the ones protesting the killings, as that’s something I agree is horrible). Yet, you live in Canada/attend one of our universities on indigenous land. You benefit off the fact that you are occupying the indigenous’ land. Yet you won’t leave, and you’ll continue to attend our universities, have an apartment here, and maybe live here the rest of your life. As soon as your life is affected, your morals and beliefs drop.

0,2024-04-29,CMV: Law of karma is intrinsic to existence itself,u/Suspicious_Ferret109,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cfx85b/cmv_law_of_karma_is_intrinsic_to_existence_itself/,changemyview,"Law of karma is not in fact a law, because there is nobody behind it as a lawgiver. On the contrary, it is intrinsic to existence itself. It is the very nature of life: whatsoever you sow, you reap.But it is complex, it is not so simple, it is not so obvious.

To make it more clear, try to understand it in a psychological way, because the modern mind can understand only if something is explained in a psychological way. In the past, when the law of karma was talked about - when Buddha talked about it and Mahavira talked about it - they had used physiological, physical analogies. Man has gone far away from that, man has moved far away from that. Now man lives more in the psychological, so this will be helpful.

Every crime against one's own nature, every one, without exception, records itself in our unconscious - what the Buddhists call ALAYAVIGYAN, the storehouse of consciousness - EACH crime.

And what is a crime? It is not because the court of Manu says it is a crime, because that court is no more relevant; not because the Ten Commandments say it is a crime, that too is no more relevant; not because a certain government says it is a crime, because that goes on changing. Something is a crime in Russia and the same thing is not a crime in America. Something is a crime according to the Hindu tradition and the same thing is not a crime according to the Mohammedan tradition. Then what is crime? There has to be a universal definition for it.

My definition is: that which goes against your nature, that which goes against your self, your being, is a crime. And how to know that crime? Whenever you commit that crime it records in your unconsciousness. It records in a certain way: it records and starts giving you a feeling of guilt.

You start feeling yourself despised by yourself, you start feeling yourself unworthy, you start feeling yourself not as you should be. Something inside you becomes hard, something closes inside you.

You are no more as flowing as you have been before. Something has become solid, frozen; that hurts, brings pain, and brings a feeling of unworthiness.

It registers. Everything that you do registers itself automatically. If you have been loving it registers that you are loving; it gives you a feeling of worth. If you have been hateful, angry, destructive, dishonest, it registers and gives you a feeling of unworthiness, a feeling of being something below human, a feeling of inferiority. And whenever you feel unworthy you feel cut off from the flow of life. How can you flow with people when you are hiding something? Flow is possible only when you expose yourself, when you are available, TOTALLY available.

If you have been cheating your woman and seeing another woman, you cannot be with your woman totally. It is impossible, because it registers: deep in your unconscious you know that you have been dishonest, deep in your unconscious you know that you have betrayed, deep in your unconscious you know that you have to hide it, that you are not to reveal it. If you have something to hide, if you have something to keep secret from your beloved, there will be distance - the bigger the secret, the bigger the distance will be. If there are too many secrets then you are completely closed. You cannot relax with this woman, and you cannot allow this woman to relax with you because your tenseness creates tenseness in her, her tenseness makes you even more tense, and it goes on, creating a vicious circle.

Yes, it registers in our books, in our beings. Remember, there are no books which God is keeping:

that was an old way of saying the same thing. Your being is the book! Whatsoever you are and whatsoever you do is constantly being registered. Not that there is somebody writing it; it is a natural phenomenon. If you have been lying it is registered that you are lying, and now you have to protect those lies, and to protect one lie you will have to tell one thousand lies, and again to protect those one thousand lies you will have to go on and on and on. You become, by and by, a chronic liar. Truth becomes impossible for you, because to tell one truth will be dangerous now.

See how things go together: if you tell one lie then many lies are invited - the same attracts the same - and now truth is unwelcome, because the darkness of the lies will not like the light of truth.

So even when your lies are not in any danger of being exposed you will not be able to speak truth.

If you speak one truth, many other truths are invited - the like attracts the like. If you are naturally truthful it is very difficult to lie, even once, because all that truth protects you. And this is a natural phenomenon. There is no God keeping a book. You are the book. You are the God, your being is the book.

Abraham Maslow says, ""If we do something we are ashamed of, it registers to our discredit. And if we do something good, it registers to our credit."" You can watch it, you can observe it.

The law of karma is not some philosophy, some abstraction. It is simply a theory which explains something true inside your being. The net result: either we respect ourselves, or we despise and feel contemptible, worthless and unlovable.

Every moment, you are creating yourself; either a grace will arise in your being or a disgrace: this is the law of karma. Nobody can avoid it. Nobody should try to cheat on karma, because that is not possible. Watch... and once you understand it things start changing. Once you know the inevitability of it you will be a totally different person."

0,2024-04-29,CMV: The United States is not a democracy,u/RandomGuy92x,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cg1i8j/cmv_the_united_states_is_not_a_democracy/,changemyview,"The dictionary defines democracy as ""government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system."" It's the rule of the people, by the people, for the people. A government that enacts laws based on what the majority of people want.

  
I would say democracy exists on a certain spectrum. For example a small social club with 20 to 30 members may have discussions on things like what activities to pursue or what to spend money on, and then have a communal vote. Their decisions are pretty much an exact representations of what the majority wants.

  
On the other hand imagine this scenario. The US is split into 4 political ""quarters"" each consisting of 12-13 states. Each ""quarter"" votes on a representative and to get on the ballot requires at least 10 million signatures beforehand. The 4 representatives then make up the US government and have sole decision-making-power. They elect a president amongst themselves to lead discussions and act as a tie-breaker.

  
This would be incredibly far removed of what a democracy is supposed to be. There would be one decision maker for every 82.5 million Americans. So no average Joe without money and influence would ever be elected into politics. The 4 representatives are pretty much guaranteed to be people with incredible power and ties to the most wealthy elites capable of funding advertisments and political campaigning. Once elected they have pretty much no accountability to the people and every reason to enact laws that are most beneficial to them and their wealthy and powerful beneficiaries.

  
Now, in the US things are not quite that extreme. However, on a federal level with 535 members of congress there is currently only one federal decision-maker for every 622,000 Americans. Not unsurpsingly studies have shown a strong correlation between amount of money spent on political campaigns and probability of winning. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/studies have shown

  
Quite obviously this makes it easier for wealthy people and those with strong connections to the powerful and wealthy elites to be elected into federal politics.  So also no surprise then that around 10% of congress members have a net worth over $10 million and 2% over $100 million. These people are mostly not a government ""of the people, for the people"" but rather to a larger extent a governement ""of the wealthy, for the wealthy"".

  
So if my example of a small social club voting equally on all matters would rank 10/10 on a democracy scale and the North Korean dictatorship would rank 0/10 .... then the US would probably not be much better than 4/10 or 5/10. A true democracy to me would be a society that's not necessarily a 10/10 but certainly a society where almost all decisions represent the interests of the majority, especially on issues that are most important to people. Yet on many issues that is far from a reality:

  
\- 86% of Americans want federally guranteed paid sick leave of at least 7 days a year, hasn't happened  
\- 82% of Americans want guaranteed paid maternity leave, yet the US is one of only 7 UN nations that do not guarantee it  
\- 72% of Americans want a higher minumum wage, yet the US federal minumum wage hasn't been raised since 2009  
\- 68% of Americans want cannabis to be legal on a federal leavel but it's still illegal  
\- 67% of Americans want a ban on lawmakers trading stocks, yet it's still legal

  
I am not arguing that the US is a dictatorship or only governed by corproate interests. However, on a scale ranking how democratic or undemocratic a country is, the US would be quite far away from what constitues a true democracy.

  
On a side note, I think to a lesser extent this is true for most wealthy, industrialized countries. I believe we need more politicians per capita and stricter anti-corruption and donation laws.

  
The US is not a democracy.

Maybe not the best of all time but certainly not the worst as I think a lot of people are painting him to be. Most of the arguments point to his age and persona that gives off a image that he isn't a strong president. Although he certainly is not at the same cognitive level as he was 10-20 years ago he was still able to pass a lot of meaningful policies that seem to have gone under the radar.  


Renewable Energy:

This was one of his top goals in his election agenda and he stuck to it. Trump left a lot of these programs to the wayside and Biden revived and accelerated them. Some notable ones include projects like offshore wind and the Inflation Reduction act. Renewable energy has now surpassed coal & nuclear power and is the second biggest energy producer behind natural gas. 

&#x200B;

China:

Another argument against Biden was that he doesn't have a strong footing on China, compared to Trump. Biden actually followed through on a Bill started by Trump towards the end of his term that gave the PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) access to audits of Chinese firms that traded on U.S. stock exchanges. The audits resulted in fines and sanctions against multiple China-based firms. 

On the defense side Biden initiated the Replicator program which is building thousands of AI drones to keep up with the changing landscape of AI-enabled defense technology which is an area where China had been moving faster than us on. 

He also unified Japan and South Korea via a trilateral summit in an effort to curb China's rising influence in the Indo-Pacific. He actually has been extremely adept in his foreign relation policies, even more so than Trump. He set new defense partnerships with the Philippines and Papua New Guinea as well as strengthening relations with India and Australia. 

&#x200B;

Bringing Production Back Home  


Trumps big tout was that he was bringing jobs back to the U.S. Well Biden also made a move for this with the CHIPS and Science Act which offered more the $50b to subsidize construction of new microchip facilities in the U.S. This led to major chipmakers like Intel and TSMC planning for new semiconductor plants to be built in the U.S. with more to come from other manufacturers. 

&#x200B;

Cyberattacks

Biden released a national cyber strategy and created a Cyber Safety Review Board to better combat cyberattacks. 

&#x200B;

Inflation

This has probably been Biden's biggest set back and a lot of blame has been pointed at him. But here are the mechanics of how inflation came to be so high in the U.S. The president has little effect on inflation as many seem to otherwise think. For the past decade leading after the 2008 financial crisis the U.S. has been in an ultra low rate environment. This led to an explosion in investment into the U.S. economy seeing how cheap debt was for the past 10+ years. High inflation was inevitable and was boosted with the Coronavirus which led to a shock in the supply chain. Instead of pointing blame towards Biden I would point towards the Feds low rate policy for so many years. You can even look at the inflation of gas prices and how Biden actually supported the oil industry (even with his massive push for renewable energy) in attempts to help bring down gas prices post Covid. U.S. oil production is at record levels and continues to climb. 

&#x200B;

These are just a handful of many other policies Biden has enacted. Please offer your counterpoints as to why you may think Biden isn't fit for a second term. I think its always best to see both sides and to learn from each other.

I think it’s absolutely insane to not impose a travel ban at that time. Even now… We have seen not only what happened with 9/11, but with ISIS beheading people and the UK terror attacks. Including the Paris ones as well, along with the recent Russia attacks done by terrorist.

Not sure why anyone would think it’s racist or a human rights violation. Let’s be honest there’s no large groups of white Christian’s who behead people and commit terrorists attacks as a group and publicly threaten the government in mass groups.

This is true, but this argument is not ""what would happen if everyone thought this"". It's what would happen if I did not vote. Whether or not I am voting, does not change everyone else's perception of whether to vote or not.

B: But you can influence the people around you/canvassing
Even if I did, this would now be 5-20 out of millions of votes that I have effectively changed. If we imagine a world in which I did nothing to participate in democracy versus a world in which I canvassed/voted; would the election result of these two worlds be different?

C: lol nilism/blackpilled

If there is a problem with the justice system, you can only fix it by fixing the justice system. Prison justice is not a solution. 
2. The state is responsible for the security of all inmates in prisons that includes those convicted of heinous crimes such as child rape/murder. 
3. The possibility of being raped and murdered in prison does not prevent any crime. 
4. Prison inmates' attempts to punish their fellow inmates turn them into even sicker and more dangerous people.
5. Prisoners' duty is not to ensure justice.
Summary: Prisons should be run by authorities, not prisoners. Prisoners should be prevented from harming each other. Prisons should be rehabilitation centers, not revenge centers.  Crime is reduced not by fear but by a properly functioning education/health/justice system."

0,2024-04-29,CMV: A reform for campaign finance tying campaign contributions limits to the individual voter's annual income ,u/SeanFromQueens,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cg6iuf/cmv_a_reform_for_campaign_finance_tying_campaign/,changemyview,"So to diminish the influence of big dollar donors and deliberately putting a thumb on the scale in favor of the least among us, have all individual contributions be $200 per candidate this will be 1:1 ratio for the bottom 60% of wealth and as the individual voter's contribution came from a wealthier individual a greater portion of their contribution would be taxed (and that would fund public financing to be determined on another CMV or given to charity or something). The amount that the political contributions would be protional to their annual gross pretax income over the previous 5 years, so that the opportunity loss to contribute would be equal to those in bottom 60%. For instance, right now a independently wealthy George Soros or Jeff Yaas can contribute to all 535 candidates in Congress and max out contributions to their preferred candidates in every race and not have to wonder if they have to cut their household budget elsewhere this reform would require the wealthiest individuals to contribute millions of dollars to get the same 200 bucks worth of bang that Joe Sixpack is giving to his preferred candidate. This would be on sliding scale so if you just above the 60% threshold you would give $225 and $25 would be siphoned away from the candidate to a fund to be determined later (the point is to diminish the influence of the big dollar donors, not have every minute detail worked out, such detail as where does the money diverted go). Alternatively if a $200 donation is given by a billionaire, the candidate in fact receives only pennies of the contribution. 
 
This reform would require that only registered voters can be allowed to make contributions, the ""it's a privilege to vote"" crowd will be directly contradictory to the godgiven right to contribute money as speech folks, I suspect that there's overlap in those circles in a venn diagram. I believe that all individuals are created equal and have equal protection under the law, so one individual having multitudes more speech/money than others is anathema to the equality of individuals, in my opinion and this reform would largely address the issue. If most people have equal say in which candidates get financial support then the candidates will better reflect the whole of the people and not the individuals who cut the biggest checks. As far as independent expenditure entities (Super PACs, PACs, charitable organizations, etc) if they mention federal candidates within 90 days of an election then their contributions would be subject to the same proportional contribution limits. Noise ordinances aren't unconstitutional, and regulating the amplification of one's political speech with money should equally be constitutional as noise ordinances - no matter the content of the speech you'll still have a right to express it just not allowed to drown out the speech of your fellow Americans. 
  
I'm looking to see how this what are the practical reasons this would not create a more level playing field in American politics. I understand that it wouldn't be a panacea, but would want my mind change for any unintended consequences that I have a blindspot to.

They have become associated with right wing politics (new world order, antivaxxers, election fraud). I don't even understand why the idea of a new world order or antivax is inherently right wing, but, that's how it is I guess. The point is, most people of a left leaning perspective have begun to outright become allergic to any conversations with any hint of a conspiratorial undertone. Too many leftists will outright dismiss conspiracy theories these days, without looking at the evidence. 

This is a way of thinking that is quite frankly ignorant, and it especially lacks any hindsight considering the *long list of former conspiracy theories that were proven true either through declassification of documents or overwhelming evidence.* Including but not limited to: *Operation Northwoods, Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment, MK-ULTRA, Watergate, Operation Mockingbird, COINTELPRO, Gulf of Tonkin Incident, Iran-Contra Affair, Operation Snow White, NSA Mass Surveillance, The Manhattan Project, Operation Ajax, Operation Gladio, Operation Paperclip, Operation Midnight Climax, Project Sunshine, Church Committee, The Lavon Affair, Operation Ranch Hand, The Inslaw Affair, The BCCI Scandal, The FBI's Surveillance of John Lennon, The Kecksburg UFO Incident, The Dreyfus Affair*

In short, conspiracies are real. They happen. Pretending they don't doesn't change that.

A lot of people I imagine will respond to this with the classic, ""Conspiratorial thinking cannot be proven wrong"" to which I will respond ""just because something can't be disproven doesn't mean it isn't true"""

The answer is clear. Abortion is about the mother and her relationship with her own body including her fetus. It is literally part of the mother. The government and society needs to stay out of it period.  Sure a fetus is a potential being, but guess whos fetus it is. Not the governments or some religious groups agenda, its the mothers.  Until the baby is fully matured to the point where it can rely on external factors, the mother is the one who is in charge. It is gross and demeaning for people who don't know anything about these individuals to pit the mother against their own to be child.  Instead this is a battle between mothers individual bodily autonomy vs the state and their politics. Instead of focusing on victimizing either the mother or the fetus, we should be focusing on making sure both men and women get proper sex education, better accessible physical and mental health care so that we try to avoid getting to far into that situation to start with. There isn't going to be a single mother that enjoys aborting their child (if there is that is why we would need better education). Abortion clinics should also be accessible under a safe environment free from stigma. If abortion impacts anyone, it impacts the mother the most, not you nor society. Some might argue well then if a mother aborting her child isn't mother, a stranger stabbing and killing the fetus of a mother isn't really murder. I would argue that the latter is different because it involves a external party which has nothing to do with the delicate relationship between the mother and the fetus. Because the stranger is a external individual invading private space it can not be treated the same way. To summarize a mother and her baby is a strictly personal matter and we as a society should accept that and as a good healthy society support them in which ever decision she makes. "

There's an unspoken gentlemen's agreement that kneeling someone in the balls is not acceptable in a fight. I get that, and I respect it. Most fights are reciprocal - both parties essentially agree that they wanna sort out their differences with physical violence. I don't particularly respect that approach, but if both parties agree to it, they can knock themselves out (often literally). 

But if one person wants to fight, and the other person doesn't - and, crucially, the second person has done everything they can to avoid a physical fight - I think it's reasonable for the second person to use any tactic available to them, once the fight begins. That includes targeting the plums."

Just because he follows all these models doesn't mean he will cheat on you. He likes variety. I want someone to change my mind about this.

While it's true that humans are wired to appreciate beauty, the issue here lies in the context and consequences of such behavior.   
  
Following thousands of Instagram models or OnlyFans creators, especially in a public manner where family and friends can see, may raise concerns about the individual's intentions and the impact it may have on their relationships. It's not just about appreciating beauty; it's about how that appreciation is manifested and the potential effects it may have on one's personal life and relationships.  
  
\- \*\*Objectification\*\*: While you argue that following these accounts doesn't necessarily mean objectifying women, the sheer volume of accounts and the commodification of bodies on platforms like OnlyFans can perpetuate a culture where women are reduced to objects for male gratification. Even if an individual doesn't intend to objectify women, their actions may contribute to this harmful societal norm.  
  
\- \*\*Impact on Relationships\*\*: While some men may follow these accounts innocuously, for others, it can lead to dissatisfaction within their relationships. It may create unrealistic expectations about beauty and intimacy, leading to dissatisfaction with their partner. Moreover, if their partner feels uncomfortable or insecure about this behavior, it can strain the relationship.  
  
\- \*\*Personal Growth\*\*: Engaging in such behavior may hinder personal growth and self-awareness. Instead of exploring and appreciating diverse forms of beauty, fixating on a narrow, often hyper-sexualized ideal may limit one's understanding and appreciation of human diversity.  
  
\- \*\*Respect and Boundaries\*\*: Respect for one's partner involves considering their feelings and boundaries. If following thousands of accounts makes a partner uncomfortable, it's important to reassess one's priorities and actions to maintain a healthy relationship based on trust and mutual respect.

Basically, if you hate gays and want them to suffer, then you are homophobic.

Now this argument happened a while ago so my memory is imperfect, but I believe she said that homophobia also extends to people that reduce her sexuality to a fetish for their own enjoyment. Basically, she says ""I'm gay."" And they go ""That's hot."" Boom! Homophobic behavior!

Okay, so I won't deny, the behavior she was describing is definitely dickhead behavior. Being like ""You're gay? Awesome, can I watch you have sex with this other girl?"" But I just cannot find a way to justify that being homophobic. If anything it seems to be the opposite problem. It's predatory, sure, but I don't for a second buy homophobia.

If anything, it sounds like fetishism. In which case, how is that homophobic? If someone REALLY likes to watch lesbian porn, they are homophobic because their sexuality is more than just a fetish for them to enjoy? That is such a huge leap in logic, I cannot buy into that.

So... my CMV question is What is Homophobia? Because clearly the definition I am used to is not what this girl is saying, but I am not gonna assume this girl is stupid and give her the benefit of the doubt and ask someone to explain what homophobia really is."

Unless you're planning to come here and spend days camping in remote areas during summer, the odds you'll see a snake are low. If you're visiting cities there's a good chance you won't even see a spider. Anything potentially harmful is going to be scared away in touristy areas, and even if you were lucky enough to cross paths with a snake leave it alone and itll leave you alone 

Other than shy snakes and spiders that want to be left alone, we don't really have dangerous terrestrial fauna. No lions, tigers, bears, wolves, mountain lions etc. Crocs (and jellyfish) are only an issue if you go way up north

Add onto that we have relatively low crime rate and are considered by most rankings I can find to be around a top 10 safest country 

The actual biggest risks (imo) to visiting aus is something no foreigner really mentions, which is sun exposure and surf conditions. In terms of personal safety, you're probably safer in Australia than wherever you are now

Upon closer inspection of the frieza Force it starts to paint a different picture. 

Before King cold retired the empire had somewhere between 300 and 400 member planets. 

The frieza force is comprised of these member worlds.  

The Ginyu force, described having bowling tournaments they talked about dental and healthcare, they started every battle with a little dance and a practice pose. This is not a people who are under the yoke of a tyrannical leader. 

I've seen Frieza offer several members of the frieza Force their own planets upon completion of task that he's assigned to them.

They have cutting edge spaceships, recovery tanks for injured soldiers, state-of-the-art scanning equipment they even arm weaker members of the frieza force with sophisticated weaponry to put them on equal footing with stronger enemies.

Frieza grew up as royalty he speaks very eloquently he praises the people around him for doing good work he doesn't randomly or dispassionately execute his own soldiers. 

Does he look down on them, I would argue no more than any uncontested ruler looks down on the subjects of their Kingdom. 

While I am aware that freezes empire generates some portion of income through the conquering and selling of planets, I would argue it's no worse than any other large Nation acts to less developed less powerful surrounding Nations.

People either see a downvote and jump on the wagon without properly reading because ""if it got downvoted so quickly there must be a reason"" or, my personal belief Is that just seeing the score makes you  immediately biased against a comment. It triggers the hive mind part of your brain, you could be shown something that you don't have a particularly strong belief about either way but the innate subconscious desire to fit in skews you to think it's a negative comment.Whereas if it was just unvoted upon you'd be able to read it and actually take in the content. 


For those unaware a lot of subs have a feature where you can't see other users comments votes until after X amount of time. It doesn't change anything regarding post visibility etc and if it's immediately downvoted by a lot of people independently it'll still get buried. 

I wonder how much good conversation would have never seen the light of day simply because it was downvoted by a troll, by mistake or just swarmed on by a small group before being shown to the wider audience. 

Reddit has a huge echo chamber problem imo and this would be a great, easily achievable change that I can't see having any significant downsides. All I can think of is that it may hurt people's perception of how wide spread an opinion is if they only see before the comments get unblurred. But isn't that sort of the point? To help people form their own opinions before herd mentality sways your opinion. 

I see how this argument could easily be extrapolated to mean a total removal of the visible scoring system, which I'm not advocating for but I'm unable to form a logical arguement past ""big numbers trigger dopamine"" defending that whilst still believing in my initial statement. "
3,2024-04-29,"CMV: In the absense of a tipping wage, tipping ought not be obligatory. ",u/SociallyUnadjusted,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cghrq3/cmv_in_the_absense_of_a_tipping_wage_tipping/,changemyview,"I am from a country with no tipping wage, but an ingrained tipping norm, leading to much debate on this issue. In the past, an argument I was sympathetic to was that when there is a tipping norm and tipping wage, employers structure pay in a way such that servers rely on the tips to reach even the minimum wage. However, with the prohibition of the tipping wage, I see no reason why, morally speaking, I must adhere to the residual tipping norm. 


If you argue from the position that the minimum wage is not sufficient (ie not a living wage), you'll have to convince me that I also ought to start tipping shelf stockers, those at the register, and generally anyone I interact with in a retail setting who I might reasonably suspect is earning near minimum. To me, tipping should not take the role of a wage subsidy (that is, after all, why we have a progressive tax structure), but a voluntary gesture of gratitude for good service. 


Also, I am interested strictly in the moral case - I don't disagree that there are strictly pragmatic reasons why you might want to maintain an image of a good tipper. 


Lastly, if you argue that given the tipping norm, I should already be used to adding the same amount to all ticket prices, and that baking those costs in while removing the tip (as establishments have begun to do) would effectively net the same price, I counter that, especially at higher end establishments, this has not been the case. That is to say, prices rarely increase by the full amount of the tipping norm when a restaurant switched to a no tips model, suggesting what has been confirmed anecdotally by acquaintances serving at these higher end establishments: that a change to a fixed wage represents a huge pay cut from what is otherwise well in excess of even a living wage and stemming from what is in essence a social tax on the consumer.

It's torture and inhumane behavior to keep someone alive KNOWING that there is no hope left for them.

For some people there is genuinely no hope, example - the person they loved left them & they are incapable of loving anyone else. So now they have to be alone forever which is worse than death (for them). Or, they deal with several illnesses that make it very inconvenient on a daily basis, even though these illnesses are not terminal. Or, someone cheated on them and they are not emotionally strong to recover from it (in this case it's also natural selection at play).

EVEN if it's a solvable problem, WHY should I be forced to deal with it? I just want to quit the game and not play it anymore, simple as that. WHY am I forced to ""solve"" problems and tolerate pain? Why do other people have a right on my life? ONLY the individual himself should be able to decide what problem is worthy of suicide as these things cannot be determined objectively.

WHY is suicide selfish? Nobody owes you living cause it makes you uncomfortable without them. If anything YOU'RE selfish and even an abuser for making someone stay out of force because it would cause inconvenience for you to lose them and disrupt your picture-perfect life. Basically, saying suicide is selfish is the same as saying my pain of losing this person >> this person's pain which is driving them to death.

If these types of people with hopeless life want to die, they should be provided safe means for it EASILY, especially after the age 25 when frontal lobe is developed. WHY can a person below 25 have a child (life altering decision) but not decide that they want to cease their existence? I'm 24 and already know what kind of problems I can deal with & what only has suicide as the solution. It's illegal just to pacify some holier-than-thou bigots who think that suicide is wrong because of their religion or other superiority-complex beliefs. They never provide any logical/ scientific reasons when I argue with them. So many people are suffering unnecessarily because of this.

We also hear them complaining about how people are offended by everything these days, especially the truth. That being said though, I have noticed that the Right has a similar ""Woke"" and ""Politically Correct"" Agenda of its own and it's mainly centered on the topics of Israel and Antisemitism.

The now 6-month Israel-Hamas War managed to cause yet another rift of support for either Israel and Palestine in the US, but much more pronounced. We have seen both sides of the political spectrum almost united in support of the former with the Right being the most strong of them both. As for the latter, there has been some significant Palestinian support, particularly among the Left and they've been accused at times of Antisemitism based on their type of criticism. But even among the Right, we've seen them delve into rather Pro-Palestinian territory and they too have been criticized for Antisemitism. Two notable examples are Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson.

A month ago, Candace Owens was dismissed from the Daily Wire after months of heated tensions between her and co-founder of the outlet, Ben Shapiro for spreading a string of antisemitic content, which was far from her rather principled stance on the war, which also was criticized by him and many Conservatives in general. Earlier this month, Tucker Carlson had an interview with a Palestinian Priest at Bethlehem who criticized Israel for killing Christians, even going further by stating that the country is no friend of them. This resulted in him being criticized by Conservatives for being pro-Hamas and betraying key US allies.

Now, here's something that I find quite ironic. As I mentioned, both of these pundits are Conservatives. They're also politically incorrect, a trait shared by a lot of Conservatives in general. Candace for instance, has gained a reputation for offering the ""politically incorrect"" and ""anti-woke"" truth about the Black community (including BLM), the LGBTQ community, women, disabled people, etc. Likewise, Tucker has gained a reputation for being a Contrarian, who rejects both Left and Right-Wing Popular Opinion, which is also something popular among the Right. This is obvious through his questioning of Anti-Russia/Pro-Ukraine rhetoric after traveling to Russia himself in which he toured the country and had an interview with its president, Vladimir Putin. In terms of ""political incorrectness"" and ""anti-wokeness"", he has spread some wild conspiracies like ""the great replacement"" when it comes to immigration. Even after his dismissal from Fox News a year ago, he still remains extremely popular. But what's really interesting is that the Right never really questioned either of them for spreading such rhetoric but were able to draw a line when it came to being ""politically incorrect"" and ""anti-woke"" on the topic of Israel and Antisemitism. If anything, this tells me that the Right has a ""woke"" and ""political correctness"" agenda of its own.

While I will agree that some of the rhetoric was indeed inflammatory regarding the Antisemitism due to the overt generalizations, it's also a pity that even Constructive Criticism of Israel is also dubbed as such. There's nothing wrong with having allies. But just because we're allies doesn't mean we have every right to criticize them if they do anything wrong, especially if it affects our interests."

striking disciplines like boxing, kickboxing, muay thai, lethwei, etc, are probably better suited for group altercations where its not as desirable to be on the ground. i can probably see a case being made for combat sambo or judo; but not much else. jiu jitsu in particular is (usually) more submission focused rather than takedown focused; why resort to an omoplata when you can just double leg the guy and smother them from mount.

This will be a permanent shift and green tech will fall to the wayside as oil as gas rebound, alongside coal.

We will not hit our climate pledges and instead warm the planet even more as economic activity and oil or gas extraction, deforestation and intensive farming surge ahead by politicians in bed with the fossil fuel industry.

I think the answer is yes. Everyone has the right to be illogical or make stupid decisions. It is not the responsibility or the right of the state to intervene unless these decisions impact other individuals' rights. This may seem radical to some, but to me what's even more radical is the state having the power to deciding what you can or cannot do with your life, what's good for you and what isn't.

Firstly I’d just want to say that I love the character of Kratos he’s a very complex individual however over the years it has come to my belief that in a way Kratos losing his wife and child is poetic justice.

Like let’s look at it from this perspective Kratos before becoming the radical revenge renegade was a bloodthirsty barbaric warlord. Before and after in service of Ares he was killing and massacring tribes, cities and villages all in the name of personal glory.

Among the casualties were people who had families with wives and children and they lost their families to Kratos. So when the day where Ares teleported his family to the village where they got killed that can be Kratos punishment.

Throughout his life Kratos had slaughtered many innocents whose lives did not need to be taken. So when he killed his family that is his penance he would feel the same pain did out to others.

Let me put it in other ways. 

Have you ever heard about Jackie Chan? Yeah, that Chinese martial artist from movies Rush Hour and Karate Kid. Great. Nice. Amazing. But do you also know that he had disowned his daughter for being lesbian, and as a result, she went homeless in the Canada? He’s one of the most well known Asian celebrities in the west. Just imagine, how it would be like for a typical Chinese family, if someone like Jackie Chan can do that. The situation is the same in India. Both China and India have a combined population of nearly 3 billion, and the majority of population in both countries is homophobic. Other parts of Asia and Middle East, including Eastern Europe have similar attitudes. That’s most of the people in the world. To them, if their child is anything but a heterosexual, it’s a cause of concern and sign of failed parenting. 

I grew up in a muslim country, Pakistan. It’s world’s 5th largest populated country. Since I was a child, I have seen people scorn at the way they thought western parents brought up their children. “They are shameless. They allow daughters to have bfs, don’t promote gender segregation, and support premarital sex. Their daughters go out without being properly covered, and how embarassing it is of them to wear bikinis. They are even allowing gay marriages. ” I observed it later on in how Americans react to honour killings in my home country. They were shocked to see the reasoning behind them, and termed the behaviour of girls murdered as what they would call a sign of successful parenting or something they wouldn’t have an issue with their daughters doing. This is also imminent in how the term “fatherless behaviour” is employed by men in my culture, where it is used to deride any woman who talks of dating, let alone having sex. I was having an in person argument with a Pakistani guy. He vehemently defended disowning a daughter for being lesbian, and gave me raised eyebrows when i disagreed, and was shocked to hear that I don’t agree. I was honestly a bit shocked to hear that he wouldn’t beat the lesbianism out of her, since our parents don’t disown. They either beat the behaviour out of you, or unalive you, if former doesn’t works, obviously. It doesn’t matter how old are you. Beating children is very normal in most of the world. 

Within countries, there are differences. Imagine how is it like to grow up in an evangelical or Mormon household? What’s defined as inappropriate or unacceptable behaviour?

You get the point, hopefully.

0,2024-04-30,CMV: Most People Do Not Become Psychologists Because They've Experienced Problems Of Their Own,u/NomadicContrarian,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cgpzpn/cmv_most_people_do_not_become_psychologists/,changemyview,"**TLDR AT THE BOTTOM:**

So, I'm (25M) expecting serious flak for this, and deservedly so, but after being in therapy for 9.5 years with 12 therapists (including my current one) and not seeing any tangible results, I felt like I needed to make this post because this was something I was holding in for the longest time. Basically, the view I'm hoping to change is the notion that people who become mental health professionals (particularly psychologists) did not experience true tribulations of their own. And why do I think that? Well, here's why. 

Although I might be on my 12th therapist (a qualifying psychotherapist) and I do resent most of them pretty equally because of how pathetically useless they've been, there is one in particular who I feel like is one of my most despised people of all time. From early 2019 to mid 2020, I was seeing this one CBT therapist (under the advice of the emergency room when I went for thoughts of self-h\*rm), and it seems like even to this day, I still haven't been able to get over my resentment and borderline hatred of her and similar people and she seems to have really distorted my view of psychologists. 

Now you're welcome to blame me for doing such a thing and call me a curious SOB or whatever, but the reason why I hold such strong views towards her, aside from her being absolutely useless and even reinforcing my hatred of the world, was because of this. I feel like her attractiveness predisposed her to being loved by everyone in her life, which threw her into a ""virtuous cycle"" where good things came to her, and she did things that allowed more good things to come to her and so on. She was able to complete her PhD in psychology thanks to all this positive reinforcement to the point where she literally went from being a new worker at her institution to becoming a senior clinical director in only 10 years and is probably drowning herself in money as I wrote this. The fact that in one news interview she said the words ""whenever I'm having a tough day"" just made me scoff the loudest I've ever done in my life, as if she even knows what ""tough days"" really are. The fact that she also never acknowledged her attractiveness playing a role is nauseating as well.

Not to mention the fact that she got married at a prime age to her husband (27 and 26 respectively) and is probably drowning herself in money whilst traveling to all these nice places (that I don't even want to travel to anymore because she sullied them with her presence). And in case you're wondering how I have all this information, I admittedly did go on her Facebook every now and then and scrutinized all this information to make such inferences (though obviously I didn't tell her such a thing). The fact that she also charged $250 CAD per session (which has probably increased significantly at this point) is also borderline robbery if you ask me.

As such, whenever I see similar psychologists to this one, unless they are ugly or LGBT, then I have a difficult time even remotely considering the idea that they may have become psychologists largely due to experiencing issues in their lives. It has been 4 years since I stopped working with her, yet it seems like almost everything I do in my life is so I can ""one-up"" her and other psychologists to prove to them that they are useless and that most of them got carried by their appearances and never earned their qualifications and lucrative careers. 

**TLDR:** I had an ex-therapist who was attractive and had virtually a perfect life and now I cannot seem to consider the fact that she or others may have become psychologists because they experienced issues of their own."
0,2024-04-30,CMV: Israel is objectively worse than Hamas,u/folkpunkrox,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cgq2bo/cmv_israel_is_objectively_worse_than_hamas/,changemyview,"First, I want to say I have no sympathy for Hamas. I think they're a backward, right wing fundamentalist group of psychopaths. I really don't have any sympathy for either side, one way or the other. I'm just interested in the facts. And even though there's very little evidence of it, I actually DO believe that some women were subjected to sexual violence on October 7th. Any attacks that weren't perpetrated on people in uniform or other military targets that day are absolutely deplorable and should be condemned. 

However, if you go by the objective facts, Israel is worse.

* Israel ran a global child r\*pe trafficking ring through Jeffrey Epstein and the Mossad. Epstein was very close with former Israeli PM Ehud Barak. Ghislaine Maxwell's father was well known for his Mossad connections as well.
*  Male IDF soldiers have routinely sexually assaulted boys who were in administrative detention.
*  Israel has killed upwards of 34,000 Palestinians since they began the Gaza Massacre. Compare this with the roughly 1,200 who died on the 7th. The vast majority of them were civilians.
* The IDF has shot people while they were in zip ties and then bulldozed over them. Mass graves are being unearthed within Gaza that show evidence of mass killings/collective punishment.
* The IDF has bombed ambulances on their way to the hospital. By contrast, the last suicide bombing inside Israel was almost a decade ago.
* Israeli soldiers are shooting bags of flour and bombing relief convoys. There is an obvious, concerted effort to wage war on food within the Gaza Strip.

From my perspective, if you were to put both Israel and Palestine on a scale that measured human rights violations, Israel would outweigh Palestine immensely. But I'm open to hearing arguments that contradict these established facts. Like I said, I have no real connection to the holy land. "

One man believes there are ghosts and evil spirits and you call him superstitious; you believe there are none and that makes you feel that you are very knowledgeable. But the question is: what is superstition? If someone believes there are ghosts and evil spirits without any investigation, that is superstition; and if someone else believes there are no such things, without investigation, then that is superstition too. Superstition means believing something without knowing it to be true. Just because someone holds beliefs contrary to yours does not mean he is superstitious.

A believer in God can be as gullible as a nonbeliever. We must understand the definition of superstition. It means to believe in something blindly without verification. The Russians are superstitious atheists; the Indians are superstitious theists—both suffer from blind faith. So do not be mistaken in thinking that theists alone are superstitious; atheists have their own superstitions too. And the strange thing is that there is also a scientific superstition. It sounds contradictory: how can there be a scientific superstition?

From a scientific point of view, we believe thousands of things to be right, but they are actually superstitions. Scientists are also superstitious, and in this age, religious superstitions are fading while scientific superstitions are growing. The difference between the two is simply that if you ask a religious person how he came to know about God he will say it is written in the Gita, and if you ask him how he came to know there are nine digits in arithmetic, he will say it is written in such and such a mathematician’s book.

What is the difference between the two? One kind of answer is found in the Gita, in the Koran; another kind of answer is found in a book of mathematics. Superstition means that which we believe in without having knowledge of it. We accept many things and we reject many things without knowing anything about them—this is superstitious too."

THIS IS JUST A HYPOTHETICAL ARGUMENT. THIS IS NOT A CALL TO VIOLENCE OR VANDALISM. THIS IS JUST A VIEW OF MINE THAT I BELIEVE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE CHANGED, THAT IS ALL...**

So as you can probably tell, I'm from Ireland. I've spend all of the nearly 25 years of my life living in Dublin.

Ireland was once a good country to live in with a lot of opportunities and then the 2008 Global Recession hit and then it all slowly but surely went to shit.

Ireland is probably hands down the worst country in Western Europe to live in:

* We have the highest cost of living relative to the average wage.
* We have the worst public health service (The HSE) in all of Western Europe. (To put this into perspective, my 78 year old grandmother who has diabetes and a lot of other health problems spent 16 hours in a chair in A&E.)
* Buying a house in Ireland costs roughly about 9 times the average annual salary in Ireland.
* Renting an apartment costs at least about 2/3 of the average monthly salary in Ireland.
* The Public Transport system is in shambles.
* The average Irish person in their 20s and 30s lives in constant fear of ending up homeless.
* Our health system is literally held up by cigarette tax. Our government is openly trying to make it more difficult to get cigarettes.
* Our government is a tax haven for American mega-corporations such as Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook who use us to house their headquarters and don't have to pay a cent in tax.
* Our police force (The Gardaí) never do their jobs and would rather harass some college students smoking a joint then arrest the hundreds of 11-27 year old scumbags terrorizing the streets of our cities and towns.
* Serious crimes such as murder, rape and pedophilia only carry a maximum of 14 years here in prison.
* Anti-social behaviour is at an all time high.
* We have the highest rates of homelessness in all of Europe.

Long story short, Ireland is pretty awful to live in. We're basically a massive PR stunt for American investors in the eyes of our government and that's about it. Countries like Spain, Italy, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands have way better public services and infrastructure than we have.

It makes me depressed thinking about it.

So I believe the only solution we have left in Ireland is to riot, but not like the shitty riot that happened in Dublin where they looted a few shops on O'Connell Street. 

**I DO NOT ENCOURAGE THE NEXT PART OF THIS CMV. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS THIS A CALL TO VIOLENCE. MODS PLEASE DON'T FLAG ME.**

I actually mean riot, throw bricks and Molotov's through the windows of the headquarters of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook. 

Harass the employees of these companies. 

Perform blockades on the high end stores where our politicians like to shop like Marks & Spencers. Make their lives hell!

Will our economy take a hit? Probably. Will it make a significant difference for the average working class bloke? Fuck no!

If we hit our government in the pockets, it will make them listen to the people and make them afraid to cross us. 

It will force them to make Ireland a more livable place. But alas, one can dream.

**So this is my CMV, like previously mentioned, I do not encourage nor condone violence, this is just a hypothetical argument.**

So try to change my view reddit."

But, as I consider what that would actually mean, I’m struggling to think of a crime that I think a president should be able to commit as part of an “Official act.""

Here’s how I’ve though about this: If I’m going to accept the proposition that a President should be able to commit crimes with impunity in the commission of their “official acts"" because the president would otherwise be too constrained, I should be able to identify hypothetical situations where the most desirable outcome would require the president to knowingly (or recklessly or negligently) order a subordinate to do something criminal. I am struggling to invent such a situation, so I’m inclined to believe that a president shouldn’t get any criminal immunity at all for their “official acts.” CMV."

1. You get almost zero ""return of investment"". You could be literally doing a million other things that have real tangible effects on your life. Learning a language opens you up to other cultures, learning a martial art strengthens your body and mind, You can learn a trade and work on your house or car, learning to cook so you can take care of your friends and family, etc. I honestly could go on and on. Your kids and grandkids are not going to brag about how their dad had over 15,000 hours on world of war craft.

2. You can't make up for lost time. I remember events and vacations from years ago but I don't remember shit about all the time I invested in Skyrim. It's meaningless. I should have been creating memories to cherish and go to awesome events. Instead I was just staring into a screen with nothing to show for it. My wife will talk about the awesome trip to Jamaica from 10 years ago. She doesn't give a shit that I got 100% in dark souls.

I honestly find that the more I type the more sad it sounds. People will seriously just waste their life away for nothing. Not to mention streaming. People play videogames all day and then watch someone else do it. There is seriously so many more enriching hobbies that anyone can do!

The act of abortion not only ends the life of an innocent and defenseless being but also denies that individual the opportunity to experience the precious gift of life and fulfill their potential.

Furthermore, I recognize the importance of providing support and resources to women facing unplanned pregnancies, rather than resorting to the irreversible solution of abortion. By promoting a culture of life and offering alternatives such as adoption and comprehensive healthcare, we can uphold the dignity of both the unborn child and the mother. Are there very specific circumstances in which abortion is understandable? Sure. However, it is crucial for society to value and protect the rights of all individuals, including the most vulnerable among us, and to advocate for policies that safeguard the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death."

First — let’s define terms:  

**Neoliberal Facism**: 

A modern leftist ideology which seeks to elevates “the oppressed.”  This ideology is characterized by a desire to suppress freedoms (e.g. free speech) and create “safe spaces” specifically for those characterized as “historically oppressed.”  

It elevates the rights of “the oppressed” above “the oppressors,” and generally adopts ahistorical and patently racist views, such as:  “all Black people in America are oppressed, and all white people enjoy privlidge.”  

It denies individual responsibility for actions, while exulting equity over equality under the law.  

By suppressing free speech with the threat of extra-legal consequences, Neoliberal Facism destroys the marketplace of ideas that is at the heart of a functioning democracy.  

Its rise inevitably leads to ahistorical and immoral views (such as support for Hamas), becoming widely accepted in these “safe spaces” (such as college campuses), due to conflicting views being silenced, based on a mischaracterization of Israeli Jews as oppressors.  

**Pro-Hamas Protests**:  

Modern campus protests and the recent blocking of roads / airports around the US are pro-Hamas by definition.  

Hamas attacked Israel on 10/7 and started a conflict.  

This fact is not in dispute.  

Hamas would like a condition-less ceasefire in order to stop their losses, while retaining Israeli hostages, despite initiating the conflict.   

Consequently all “ceasefire now” protests are pro-Hamas.  "

This child is financially reliant on these people and is obligated to listen to them with the assumption they know whats best. This is literally the dynamic an abuser dreams of.

And on top of that, we shame children for lying to their parents or not trusting them. Parents are allowed to inflict whatever type of punishment they want on their children with very little pushback (i mean even beating is usually justified, its very rare for people to think a parent went too extreme on their children).

If someone always was bad with numbers as a kid, should they become a mathematician? No, they'll always be bad at it.

A lot of people want to get a high paying job so their goal is to become a software engineer, doctor, lawyer, etc. All of the people I know wanting to go down this path did not make it because they didn't have the skills or passion to become one. A lot of us aren't meant for high paying jobs because we're not skillful, smart, or passionate in these fields so it's time to let go of your dreams and be realistic.

In the U.S., only about 20% of the workforce are working in STEM. That means 4 out of 5 of us will be working mostly menial jobs.

If you're someone trying to teach yourself coding but none of the skills you have align with being a software engineer and you have no passion, what are you doing? Do you even like it or are you doing it for the money? The only successful computer science major graduate I know genuinely loved the subject. The rest struggle to find jobs. 

Stop trying to get into AI when you're meant to work with kids. Stop trying to be a veterinarian when you're meant to be a vet tech. Stop trying to be a scientist when you're meant for something else.

It's good to have high-achieving dreams and to at least try things you're interested in, but you'll soon realize that there's a lot of things that don't align with your interests and skills. Most of us are not meant for a respectable and high paying job. Like I said, only 1 out of 5 workers in the U.S. will work in STEM. Most of us will work menial jobs.

Most of the parties had little to no success even at local levels, and of the larger third parties none of their front runners stuck out to me as particularly trustworthy or competent. The only one I really liked was Cornel West, but I have no confidence that he could actually win based on how cemented the two primary parties are and the trend of third party candidates losing in the past. 

Because of this I’m planning on voting for Biden over Trump in the upcoming election seeing as Republican leadership would be disastrous and would likely lead to the enactment of their Project 2025 plan, even though I am not happy with the Democratic Party’s leadership and choices so far. I plan to do this because I firmly believe that a Republican victory would cause significantly more damage to our environment, civil liberties, foreign relations, and overall quality of life. Also without ranked choice voting, I do not feel confident in placing my vote behind someone who will likely not get close to the Oval Office.

This is for both sides of the political spectrum.

How can you as a college student with $100k+ in student loan debt have the money to sit in a tent all day?

How can you as a conservative worried about immigrants taking your job find the time to fly to DC for an insurrection?

How do you have the energy to ""debate"" politics on facebook and twitter?  

Protests related directly to your job make sense (unionizing, writers' guild, pausing government services) and relating directly to your own life/safety (civil rights, sexual orientation/gender leading to physical violence).

This isn't to say these other causes don't matter, but after working all day, paying bills, doing chores - wouldn't you rather spend your free time doing something else or have other priorities? Play with your kids, spend time with family and friends, exercise, travel, literally anything else where you're making a real impact.

I can assure you your ""militia"" marching around in fake military gear isn't overthrowing the US government any time soon, nor are your chants going to affect anything the Israeli government or Hamas does.

The reasoning behind this view is I'm currently terrified of losing my job and how the economy is looking.  I need to do well at my current job while also looking and training for other potential more stable jobs.  I live alone and have bills to pay and 2 cats to take care of.  And when I do have free time, I want to spend it doing my hobbies.

Even if I was from a very red state or had family in the Middle East, protesting would still be at the bottom of my priority list.  Maybe I'd go to local council meeting or attempt to get a family member out of countries actively engaging in war, but there's no way I can just hangout outside all day with a cardboard sign."

I wouldn’t condone the latter, strictly speaking. I think public policy should be guided by that which one could defend without resorting to lying. But I would also think the former example is different if only because the Nazis had to lie to sell their anti-Semitic witch hunt to the public.

These issues are often framed as saving lives being “the ends” and lying being “the means.” But what if you turn it around?

What if you argue “fulfilling some ideals of absolute honesty” is the end and “taking it to extremes that come at the expense of human lives” is the means?

By what standard do we decide what to label the ends and what to label the means? If it isn’t an objective standard, by what metric is “do the ends justify the means” a meaningful question for moral philosophy’s purposes?

As illustrated by the above examples, the validity of the phrase “do the ends justify the means” should be treated as distinct from what one thinks of the ends *or* the means (regardless of which you count as which) or the justifiability thereof."

He was an older male judge. She expressed bias when questioned. He pulled her into the judge’s quarters to privately question her. He intimidated her and seemed to enjoy the entire thing. He tried gaslighting her. He also started asking her personal questions in the same way a predator would when sizing up prey. She was lucky she wasn’t weak, because all of us who care about her were sure he would have tried to sexually exploit her. 

Being a judge is the perfect career for an intelligent psychopath. They are almost impossible to hold accountable and they have absolute power over people’s lives. It is a wet dream for a psycho. 

Occasionally you see a news story on a corrupt judge - bribes, extortion, lies, other forms of abuse of power. And these are just the stories that make it out. The justice system does not want these stories to leak. And many people do not report the bad behavior of a judge out of fear. 

I’ve also met a couple of judges in my personal life. And man oh man, within moments of talking with them I was repulsed by their massive egos. Yet again another problem. We need objective judges, not big egos. Big egos make mistakes, and peoples’ lives are dangling off these egos. 

I do not trust judges. Tell me I’m wrong. "

How can our primitive species not learn from history? After two world war's and millions of life's being taken for literally no reason.  
  
People who go to war are not doing it to ""serve their country's"" Country's are an invention from us on a piece of earth that has no meaning. The problem is that we don't see the big picture of it all, we are the most intelligent species and yet we behave like monkeys that declare their territory and fight about it as if it had any meaning.  
  
Instead of exploring the universe and finding the origin of our existence we pump billions into weapons and war. Instead of following science we follow books that are thousands of years old and kill everyone that doesn't have the same opinion.  
  
Most of the people who go to the military are victim's of the propaganda that you should fight for your country, that feels so wrong because that exact reason was used in WW1 and WW2 to get people to go to war and lose their life for nothing, they didn't fight for peace, they didn't fight for some ideals. There are only losses in war and we must not forget history what happened in WW1 and WW2.

However, it seems objectively true that this is not really the case. It is the birthplace of Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker, the “Chosen One” destined to bring balance to the Force. It is the hiding place of Obi Wan Kenobi, and the location where Luke Skywalker, son of Anakin, was raised after being deposited with Anakin’s step-siblings. It is the central location of Jabba the Hutt’s crime empire, which accounts for Han Solo’s presence on the planet and his encounter with Luke and Obi-Wan, which brought him to Princess Leia and the eventual birth of Ben Solo, whose fall to the dark side has galaxy-spanning implications for the successor government to the Galactic Empire, as he becomes central to the New Order.

This is on top of it being the location where Boba Fett, one of the most feared of the galaxy’s bounty hunters, was thought dead and then “reborn,” who is also a cloned descendent of the template for the original stormtroopers—obviously as central a figure as can be imagined. It is the location where C-3PO was manufactured. It is home to additional veterans of the first Death Star assault, Biggs Darklighter. It has been visited by such luminaries as Qui-Gon Jin, Queen Amidala of Naboo (home planet of Emperor Palpatine), and the Mandolorian. 

And yet, it is still regarded as some irrelevant backwater. This objectively makes no sense—by now, there would be massive capital investment in the planet due to its tourist attractions at the very least. Yet there isn’t even so much as a tourist trap reconstruction of Luke’s home or some Mos Eisley grifter selling pieces of the table where Han shot Greedo for 10,000 credits apiece.

0,2024-04-30,CMV: Neutering is not ‘good’ for most individual dogs,u/Brassmonkey700,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ch25u7/cmv_neutering_is_not_good_for_most_individual_dogs/,changemyview,"Growing up I always thought of neutering as a very natural process, like if dogs were not neutered they would develop these strange and awful changes into angry beasts. As I grew up I learned that imo neutering is more for humans than it is dogs. Humans have created 2 problems for dogs-

1. Their need for dogs to assimilate to human behaviour, to be servile, docile, friendly. You can approach this more ethically by training, exercising, and socialising dogs. Castration to diminish natural hormones seems like an easy but brutal approach to domestication. 

2. Humans have also artificially conflated the natural ecology through breeding and the pet economy which can have a disastrous effect on urban areas and surrounding environments while also becoming a public liability. Neutering helps reel the industry and consequences in. 

I won’t deny the usefulness of neutering based on the following reasons, they are valid. Neutering might be the best for some dogs to have a life as pets in human society if they were improperly trained or had pathological issues of aggression, but I think as a whole it’d disengenuous for us to believe we are doing the best for dogs when we deprive them of one of the most basic experiences of life. 

I think neutering before 13 months comes with another whole set of issues in regards to development, but regardless I believe that neutering in general has utility in solving human created problems for animals to live better lives as pets, but I don’t think we should look at those pets and feel like we’ve done ‘good’ to them. I think we should empathise on the negation of a core, natural experience.

1447,2024-04-30,CMV: Religious people are excessively accomodated,u/villa1919,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ch2b60/cmv_religious_people_are_excessively_accomodated/,changemyview,"I believe that the fact that these accommodations must be recognized often amounts to discrimination against those who are not religious as it implies religious beliefs to be more important than non-religious beliefs. To give an example in parts of Canada and in the UK Sikhs are permitted to ride a motorcycle without a helmet despite it being illegal for anyone else to do the same.  By doing this the government has implied that Sikhism is a more virtuous belief than any other than could involve one choosing not to wear a helmet. Another non Sikh could choose not to wear a helmet simply because they believe that 'looking cooler' on the bike is worth the health risk of not wearing a helmet and by not allowing this the government is implying that the Sikh principles are superior to the principals of maximizing how cool one looks. It is also unfair that taxpayers in the countries will be forced to pay the excessive healthcare bills stemming from the more severe injuries caused by the lack of helmet. A more reasonable solution would be that anyone who chooses not to wear a helmet must pay an extra annual fee to cover the added healthcare costs.

&#x200B;

Another better example would be the fact that Kirpans (knives) are allowed to be carried onto airplanes by Sikhs but not by anyone else in Canada. The religious reason for wearing a Kirpan is in part self defense yet if any other Canadian chooses to carry a knife for self defense reasons it is a violation of the law and they would rightly be denied permission to bring one onto an airplane. Therefore self defence as a principle is honored by the government when it is packaged as part of a religion but not when it is just an important belief held by an individual. The Supreme Court of Canada even went so far as to say this about a kid bringing a kirpan to school

>Religious tolerance is a very important value of Canadian society.  If some students consider it unfair that G may wear his kirpan to school while they are not allowed to have knives in their possession, it is incumbent on the schools to discharge their obligation to instil in their students this value that is at the very foundation of our democracy.

this is a perfect demonstration of the mindset I described. As a non-religious person none of your personal beliefs are required to be taken with the same level of seriousness as a religion's beliefs. I fail to see why this mindset should be held as it is not a fact that religion is some kind of objectively good thing.

If there are indeed genocidal attacks in Gaza, then it is committed by Hamas against Palestinian civilians and they find a way for Israel to be blamed for it, since they're goal is to wipe out Israel and Jews from their land. Israel is responding to this reign of terror.

Second, there's absolutely no evidence of Israel/The IDF harming or brutalizing civilians and depriving them of humanitarian resources and necessities. Obviously that's not their goal. In fact, Israel called for the temporary evacuation of the local population in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, and delayed its ground operation in Gaza for weeks to allow civilians time to heed Israel’s warnings.

Although more people are starting to become sympathetic towards the people of Palestine, most of the powerful countries in the world stands with Israel's fight and right to defend itself and the Jewish population."
116,2024-04-30,"CMV: Crimes or abuses committed by one entrusted with authority should be punished many times harsher, in proportion to their authority/responsibility.",u/Radioactiveglowup,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ch3hbj/cmv_crimes_or_abuses_committed_by_one_entrusted/,changemyview,"CMV: We by necessity live in a world where humans must ultimately at the end of the day, be the enforcers and enactors of laws that we have agreed are the structures that society should live by. Much like Uncle Ben says, Power comes with Responsibility. We can see this constantly even in our own daily lives in microcosm, from boss to employee, teacher to student, and so forth.

Particularly however for Societal Power and Authority (Elected Officials, Public Servants, Uniformed Personnel, etc), they're often given powers in official and unofficial ways that puts them 'above' everyone else. I cannot vote in the Senate, while an Elected Senator can. I cannot put someone in jail for reckless driving, a police officer can. Etc.

Because these can be far-reaching powers, acts of crime or proven abuse should be far, far more harshly punished for these individuals than any other private citizen, in accordance with their rough scope of power.

Examples:

* A Police Officer that takes some drugs out from lockup to resell them should get twice the punishment or more, than a street dealer. 
* A Politician who commits a substantial crime (misdemeanor or higher) should face a much harsher punishment than an ordinary citizen who did the same crime.
* A High-ranking Military Officer who commits rape or theft or something similar should be punished even harder by a substantial amount than a Private who did the exact same level of offence.

The reasoning is: Even if these were outside of their official uses of power, they often have 'unofficial' powers by simple place of their station. The character and actions exhibited undercut their ability to serve the public good, and should be discouraged as thoroughly as possible, especially since people in places of authority often have more tools available to evade accountability."

0,2024-04-30,CMV: A lot of views that people hold on the Israel-Palestine debate are vibes based especially when it comes to the Zionist side of things.,u/Lucycobra,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ch3rsk/cmv_a_lot_of_views_that_people_hold_on_the/,changemyview,"Especially if you go on Twitter or Reddit you will just see people saying stuff that they feel is right without any actual information or source. People on the pro-Israel or zionist side of things are especially guilty of this. I would like to bring up a specific example I see all the time mostly on twitter. That being zionists framing LGBTQ people supporting palestine as self-detrimental. The main reason it seems they believe this is because they think that in both the West Bank and Gaza gay people and LGBT people are heavily persecuted sometimes people even equating it to the treatment of gay people by ISIS. This belief which I think is entirely vibes based, based on the fact of both Gaza and the West Bank being majority Muslim these people presume that they are actively harming gay people simply for being gay. This is not true in either case, being gay is not a prosecutable offense in either Gaza or the West Bank. By law it is completely legal in the West Bank and as for Gaza it is illegal on a technicality. This technicality being a very old British charter which has not been technically removed from the law. This law is not enforced and there are no records of its enforcement or any other punishment of gay people by Hamas or any armed group in Gaza. A lot of things people believe about Hamas in general are also vibes based. I don’t think Hamas is good nor do I support Hamas’ methods, but a lot of the stuff people say about Hamas is just not true at all. One common belief is that Hamas supports the genocide of Jewish individuals or is outwardly anti jewish this is not true. The 2017 Hamas charter separates the Zionists from jews very intentionally. This is an update from its original 1988 charter which did not separate Jews from zionists. The 2017 charter specifically labels zionists or those in favor of the state of Israel as the enemy of Hamas not Jews. Former leader of Hamas Khaled Meshaal stated in an interview in 2017 that the new charter is more accurate becaus it separates Zionists from Jews as a whole. He also criticized the old charter for the use of Jews. He even directly states that hamas‘ struggle “is against the Israeli occupier not because they are Jews, (…) not because of their religion, but because (…) they have occupied our land, and attacked our people, and forced them out of their homes"". I am not a Zionist, but I don’t see how it is at all beneficial to just lie about your opponent or just make up what they believe because you feel like they do. You do limited vibes based stuff on the Palestinian side as well. A lot of people especially younger people will seem to just go along with whoever as long as they say they are supportive of the palestinian struggle. I’ve seen people aligning themselves with Turkey, Russia, and even Saudi Arabia merely because their leaders or representatives pretend to care about Palestinians while in private aligning themselves with Israel (Ex: Saudi Arabic undercutting palestine in normalization agreements with Israel)"

As the years pass, my country is turning from ""we are Muslim but don't practice it"" to people growing their beards, yelling about religion rules they barely studied, anti-feminism, anti-patrotism etc. I'm so respectful until the moment someone starts hating on them and then I join and my hate just lashes out. 

One of my values is respecting people choices on their own lifes, that combined with the guilt of me somehow betraying god- I need to become better. 

My theories of where this comes from:
1. I got extreme gender envy and Islam has very strict set of gender roles, it's triggering how certain things aren't allowed 
2. They're taking on more of Arabic language, traits, culture- I feel like it doesn't sit well with me especially since our country is known to put blood before religion. We never had religious wars, as long as you were from my country, you were a brother. We are losing that value and it's making me so alarmed. 

Should I start studying Islam and then decide if it's for me? I think I should so at least I truly know if I disagree. Where can I start to learn, fast, to the point and correctly?

Perhaps this is most evident with the anti-abortion argument, which is oppressing women's rights for political advantage, how on God's green earth is that about 'feeedom'?

There were countless posts of women complaining about their experiences with men. Now I didn’t think much of it but then I noticed that there were no posts of men doing the same. Well I quickly found out the reason for that. Any complaint made by a man ,be it in the form of a post or a comment, would IMMEDIATELY get downvoted into oblivion and deleted. I should mention that this subreddt had absolutely nothing to do with gender. 

Now i don’t have a problem with you complaining about a man or a group of men that you’ve had a bad personal experience with. That’s fine. What I do have a problem with is you straight up hating on men and acting like we’re ALL mustache twirling villains while simultaneously worshipping women like they’re gods who can do no wrong.

This the shit I’m talking about:

*Woman complains about man
„Omg you’re so brave!“
„Just hang in there queen!“
„You’re totally right!“
„Men are scum!“

*Man complains about woman
„You’re just a sexist pig!“
„Wow how ignorant can you be!“
„Oh just stfu already!“
„Men are scum!“

Jesus fucking Christ it’s exhausting. How can you people not realize how bad it is to vilify an entire gender while putting the other on a pedestal. You’re taking all the progress we’ve made toward equality and throwing it out the window. It wouldn’t be as maddening if the people leaving theses posts weren’t such a-holes. They don’t ever try to have a civil conversation with you and IMMEDIATELY resort to calling you names and making baseless assumptions about you. 

Let me ask you this:

If your goal is equality for all women then how can you not realize how harmful it is to your cause to be a dick to anyone who even slightly disagrees with you? Like you’re making enemies out of people who could just as easily have been allies.

Let me put it like this: 
If you are nice and respectful to me I will listen to what you have to say. However if you come at me screaming and cussing and trying to make me feel bad for simply existing then I’m not going to listen to a word that comes out of your mouth. Even if I actually agree with what you’re trying to say. If you’re nice to me I’ll be nice to you. If you’re a dick to me then I’m gonna be a dick to you. Simple.

No my life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows just because I have a shlong and your life isn’t completely miserable just because you have boobs. Life is almost never that simple.

(I’m aware there are some parts of the world where women get treated like dirt simply for being women wich is disgusting however I’m talking about the western world right now. More specifically my country of Germany and the US.)

I don’t know man I’m just sick and tired of people acting like they know everything about me just because of what’s between my legs. Yes im a man but I’m a person too and it’s not fair to judge me for the actions of people I don’t even know. I thought judging a book by its cover was a bad thing but not if it fits your narrative I guess.

Men have plenty of advantages in today’s society but so do Women.
Women have plenty of disadvantages in today’s society but so do Men.

Men are flawed.
Women are flawed.

It is my opinion that these „Internet feminists“ are only making things worse by making men and women despise each other.

But hey maybe there’s some viewpoints I’ve failed to consider.
Are there any legitimate arguments to be made in favor of this type of behavior?
How exactly does generalizing 50 % of the human population help women or anyone else?

(And yes I’m aware bad men exist and there are legitimate reasons to complain about them but if you have more than two braincells you’ll realize that those aren’t the posts I’m complaining about)

",u/iiSkilledProgram,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ch5kik/cmv_people_in_the_mafia_are_tough_professional/,changemyview,"I was watching The Sopranos the other day, and it really struck me on how the Mafia prides themselves with being family-oriented. The whole family was having a BBQ in the first episode, and every mobster, including their associates, were there with their families. 


Also, the people in the Mob are *tough as nails*. And I respect them for that. They are trying hard to survive in this corrupt world, and they do whatever they can in order to get by. 


Lastly, the suits that they wear are pretty dapper, if I do say so myself. I wish I had some right about now, lol!

0,2024-04-30,CMV: The best view on Abortion is a middle ground between the two sides.,u/dejamintwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ch5l2a/cmv_the_best_view_on_abortion_is_a_middle_ground/,changemyview,"I believe both sides are wrong in several ways and that a middle ground between them is the most moral and logical choice.

Pro-life is flawed because in early pregnancies the fetus is in fact just a clump of cells and destroying it trough abortion is no different than simply cutting off a piece of your living body. And it can usually be done with just some medicine instead of any medical procedures. And a woman should be allowed this choice considering whats in her body cannot yet be considered a person.



Pro-abortion is flawed because later stage abortions are quite horrific.(20 weeks+) Where the premature but fully formed baby is either torn limb from limb and mushed into a pine paste before being sucked out. Or simply forced out trough induced labour and left to die, alone and cold without ever feeling the warmth of being held. This is made especially horrific at weeks 24-30. Where 24 weeks old babies have a 2/3 chance of surviving and 30 weeks having 98% chance of surviving trough premature birth.

The late stage abortions are not as bad if the mother would die with their child if they arent done. But that should be detectable before it reaches such a late stage of gestation.

  
So as you probably figured out from my earlier words. I believe that women should be able to abort early. And that it should be illegal to abort at pregnancies above 20 weeks unless both the mother and child or just the child would die anyway if it was not done. I believe this is the most logical view of abortion.

This is my view and im seeing if there is any holes in it which is why im posting it here."

There would be no need for translators, to translate books or anything else, and any message a person sends can be received by any other.

It's important to note that this does not mean that any current languages need to stop existing. We could still choose to translate into a particular language if we feel it suits our message or artwork. And babies could still be taught their cultural language in addition to whatever the chosen global language would be.

As for what language, it truly doesn't matter at all. We're talking about a long-term goal of global communication so it's easy enough to start from zero with a language nobody knows or even a brand new one.

No need to flip out on me, as I have no first hand experience at all with this, just looking for input. Because Google says that you literally can just take methadone and quit. I want to know why addicts won't."
0,2024-04-30,CMV: Truly open AGI is a horrible idea.,u/88sSSSs88,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ch7pf4/cmv_truly_open_agi_is_a_horrible_idea/,changemyview,"In this context, I am defining AGI as a highly intelligent artificial reasoning engine. We're talking about AI that extends far beyond the capabilities of current quasi-AGI like ChatGPT and other LLMs.

Determining the risk that AGI poses to humanity is determined by understanding the answers to the following questions:

1. Is a perfect reasoner motivated by self-preservation?
2. Is truly open AGI feasible?
3. What happens to humanity in a post-scarcity 'utopia'?

What I would like to focus on in this discussion is the second question, because it seems to me like everyone on this platform disagrees with my opinion - I believe that having a truly open AGI available to everyone is a horrible idea.

When I say truly open, I mean having the infrastructure for deploying one's personal AGI, with minimal restrictions, censorship, or obfuscation of the source or data that produced the model.

The reason I consider this to be a horrible possibility is because it implies that there cannot be any type of regulation on how AGI is used. Forget whether or not China or Russia will develop their own AGI. What happens when terrorist organizations, sadists, or far-right militias decide to leverage AGI to maximize the influence they exert on adversaries?

The only possible solution - though certainly only a temporary one - is to ensure tight regulation on who is allowed to produce innovation in AI, and who gets to see the innovations starting **today**. A lot of people on Reddit **hate** this because it empowers current tech billionaires to a level unlike anything ever seen before both in terms of wealth and influence. I argue that a well-managed anti-monopolistic environment allows for tightly regulated AGI that also benefits the common person. Even if I'm wrong here - isn't this a lot better than giving every last sadist open access to an AGI?

But why regulate today if I openly acknowledge that LLMs and ChatGPT aren't AGI? Two reasons: It sets a precedent, and more importantly, because we have no idea how close we are to achieving AGI. What if AGI is achieved through some combination of current technologies? It's certainly possible. In fact, current language models are built off technologies that were published **decades** ago. If we do not regulate LLM innovation now, who's to say that we aren't accidentally publishing all the precursors to AGI for someone to piece together later? We cannot just kick this problem down the road and only deal with it when the problem is already at our doorstep. Acting now is essential, and regulation is our only solution."
