That makes upto 3000 times for a movie that's around 2.5 hours long. So, you have your eyes closed for about 15-60 minutes of the movie

Yeah so you miss looking at that part of the movie! 

Your eyes take 0.1 to 0.4 seconds to blink; they're closed for that period of time.


Given how many times the average person blinks per minute, this makes up about 10 percent of the time you're awake."

For instance, despite the mountain of evidence that suggests we should cease burning fossil fuels immediately, we have not done enough to force governments to re-organise the economy in such a way that we halt the impending catastrophe. Our ability to, ironically, burn the remains of mostly extinct species to destroy ourselves, emanates from our intelligence and the accompanying urge to expand, then, naturally, kill. "

I saw totality in 2017, and it was even cooler. But to be honest, to me any given sunset or clear night with a sky full of stars is far more spectacular. I don't want to rain on anyone's parade, but I was having trouble understanding why everyone was losing their minds over the eclipse. And then I thought about how I never had a moment of cold feet when deciding to get married and knowing I would never be with another man again, and how I usually prefer staycations to vacations and listening to music I've loved forever. I think I value novelty a lot less than the average person. I think this might make me a little boring? But I'm also happy that I continue to be filled with gratitude for all these everyday joys in my life every time I experience them, and wonder if others are missing out on that. I don't know. I would love to hear from others--if you are someone who was extremely moved by the eclipse, are you generally someone who places a high value on novelty? Do you also find yourself noticing and appreciating the pleasures of everyday life? Tell me what I'm missing!"

What possible use can this have? It actually interferes with your sense of smell & hearing at a time of your life when you're generally getting weaker.

Then I realised: it culls the herd. A herd member who can't run as fast will slow down the entire group. An old hunter will lead, but their weaker eyes will miss things a younger hunter will spot.

Now you don't want people who die too soon, they need to be at least fit enough to mostly pull their own weight. If you suddenly go completely deaf or your spleen explodes at 40, the tribe will be weakened & poorer. But functioning at, say, 95% of capacity and being more likely to not hear or smell that predator in the dark corner of the cave means you're more likely to die a useful death before you get too old & decrepit. 

So that's alright then. 


Before you object: I know about nostril & ear thing because I am very, very old."

Only under this condition total energy is kept low enough to prevent ignition.

It also explains the mess in public urinals."

My digital library on steam, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo switch, Vudu, Amazon movies, YouTube movies, etc.... is easily in the thousands. 

I would hate for all of those games and movies/shows to go to waste, and I have a nephew that loves to play video games. I have made drafts of my living will and it includes telling my nephew how to discover my passwords and how to change them to put his email as ownership. 

I'm curious if this is an odd thing to think about in terms of things I would like to pass down when I die.

So if you have a beautiful trans woman in her twenties she will be looking hotter for a longer time.

6,2024-04-20,The Cost of Unclear Roles,u/warezak_,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/1c94kmj/the_cost_of_unclear_roles/,Showerthoughts,"My theory is that we all assume roles, much like actors in a play, but instead of a theater, we perform these roles at work. 

Our performance ‚Äîgood or bad‚Äî depends on the script (expectations based on what they perceive is expected of them) we are given.

In this context, having better expertise equates to having a clearer role description (you know what to do and when).  


The cost of unclear roles is significant. If a company fails to clearly outline expectations, even highly skilled employees may struggle to perform effectively due to the ambiguity of their roles.

In the end people do what we expect from them?!"

It would be perceived by intelligent extraterrestrial life as being the flagship of humanity.

However, it is surrounded by nothing. It is close to nothing. 

In comparison, a submarine is very close to the mysterious unknown holding more answers relevant to human life.

For example, video game graphics evolved rapidly throughout the early 2000s. A game with good graphics from around the 2014 era can look better than some games today. Batman Arkham Knight was released in 2015, and people say that about that game a lot."
