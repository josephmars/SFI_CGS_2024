However, my past three jobs have been short term. The first position ended after one year because the company I was at completely restructured and eliminated my entire department. I was laid off from the next job I had after two years because of COVID (the company lost tons of money and closed several international offices, and laid off a lot of people). Following that position, I was lucky to get a contract job with a big boost in pay and job title. But it is a fixed term position where I was hired to complete a particular project. 

Since that contract will be ending in around the start of 2023, I've started reapplying for jobs. I've had a few interviews where the interviewer asked nothing about the length of my past positions. But I had an interview today where that was all the interviewer wanted to talk about. Now I'm feeling concerned that my short term positions will be an issue during this job search. 

I've thought about leaving the one-year job where there was a restructuring and layoff off of my resume since it was only one year. Would that make a difference? Or leave my resume as is since it seems to be getting past the initial screening and I'm getting interviews. Job searching stresses me out and I'd love to hear any advice about how I might avoid looking like a job hopper."

Well when the time came to pay me, the company sent me an account statement that listed all the jobs I did and my payment. However my name is NOT on this statement. Instead, they've just put my house address and my account number with the company. When you get recruited by the company, they assign you an ID number. And my paycheck only has this ID number and my house address.

What's more is that I don't have any legally binding document that links my real name to this ID number.

Issue is that I lovveee my current job and I love the people I work with as well as my boss. I have only been here less than 2 years and I also think that maybe there will be good opportunities for me if I stay and build my career for another few years. But of course no where near the salary I would be getting at the new role. Also there might be structural changes in the future that might dampen my responsibilities (bringing in more analysts). 


I‚Äôm not sure what to do. New job: more money and entrance into the data science and management route and more leave. Old job: brand name company plus good environment. Both jobs are of similar scope just that the new one might be more intense in terms of work load and less support (smaller team).

Basically, whenever I get assigned a creative project (designing flyers for example) from my boss (who isn't a designer), he doesn't provide much guidance on what the project requirements should be. When I ask him about it, he tells me to just use my creativity to do whatever I like. Well, it turns out that my doing whatever I like with the design never sits well with him. When I show him my drafts, which were created from scratch, he criticizes them saying they're dull and don't grab attention, but doesn't elaborate on the specifics that he wants. So then what I end up doing is using templates that I find on the web and, lo and behold, the boss loves the template designs. On one hand, I'm glad I can present something the boss is satisfied with, but on the other hand I feel unappreciated that my own hard efforts have gone to waste. As such, I'm scared to voluntarily take on additional design projects unless it's absolutely required of me to do so. Does anyone else work with bosses or clients who are like this? Is this where  the need for detaching oneself from their own design work come into play?"

At every company I've ever worked for, beyond the initial interview I have never had any further contact with either. So to have somebody interview you, that is however far removed from the department you're applying for, makes little to no sense.

It's weird because upper management trusts middle management enought to supervise people, but not enough to have the final say who gets hired. Even though middle management will be the ones directly interacting with new hires.

I only bring this up as each interview I've had, it's always upper management or HR that are the ones who come off as assholes.

Let me just interview with whomever the immediate supervisor is, and be done with it. I have no interest in meeting HR, upper management, etc."

I'm going to bypass a lot of bullshit but basically I'm a hard worker I'm a yes person I like to help if I'm able. I've given up off days and holidays because I saw the company struggling. I took on learning a new system similar to excel and coding for the whole company when the only person who knew how to run it was pushed out of the company. As of today I'm on my 18th day in a row of working with no off days. On my team two people were out because of major unexpected life events. 

I ended up having to take on a lot of work two peoples workloads. Then I had to be on call the past two weekends. So you would think being a team player, being an asset, and never saying no would aide me in getting the salary request I submitted. WRONG

My manager came to see me today picked me up for lunch wasted no time in telling me how much she appreciates me and I have nothing but great marks on the pointless piece of paper that says evaluation.  So to my raise lol I submitted a formal salary request almost two months prior to this meeting. She had to meet with the CEO to get approval and I submitted data I researched and why I deserved the bump in pay. 

................This woman casually told me I would be getting a $0.86 raise in pay. Slap in the face people.

She told me her side and how the CEO is and she was telling me how she's been suffering in the company. She was like my base pay is higher here but my  bonus is $30,000 down here. She said they gave me a $10,000 bump in base pay though.

 I was like you just told an hourly person who you just gave a .86 cents raise to about your poor -30,000 decrease in bonus pay. She told me she understands if I quit tomorrow or end up finding another job. She told me if I got another offer the CEO would probably pay me what I wanted. She told me she'd give me an great recommendation somewhere if I decided to leave because I'm a great asset and I would be anywhere.

I‚Äôm also learning to write on cakes which at my DQ is something that shift managers do.

1,2022-09-01,I decided to f it,u/AltruisticWish3002,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x2xx6w/i_decided_to_f_it/,jobs,"A small business in nc I was hired at was bought out by a big corporation out in Cali. I am normally very positive and happy. My love language is gift giving and try to help ppl out.
A manager there was rumored to be sleeping with the last owner. Got 16 ppl fired. She‚Äôs verbally abusive. She reminds subordinates that she is a manager and can do what she likes. Even makes her employees drive two hours (round trip) off the clock to escort her to work, that‚Äôs if she comes at all. Some of us can work remotely.
I been there for four months, and I try to stay friendly and positive. I have a horrible temper. I go 0- death row, there‚Äôs no in between. My biological father actually murdered someone. So I became a passive person bc I was afraid of becoming him, unless someone I cared about is in a conflict.
I have been going to therapy to become more assertive and setting boundaries so I can have a happy medium, no passive to death row. So I been avoiding conflict with her. 

She is a terrible human. She says she has gone through trauma, so fuck everyone. My mentality is I been raped and conceived a child, has a rib broken by my father, and molested by his son (half brother), my mom can‚Äôt love me bc I was also conceived out of rape and I look too much like him. So my outlook is I don‚Äôt want anyone to feel the pain that I do so I over compensate with kindness that usually gets taken advantage of. 

Last Friday was the last straw. I sat down in her office and asked her to not cut me off when I‚Äôm talking to her, not to talk down to me and show me respect. She pointed at me and goes ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the last time you‚Äôll be assertive to me.‚Äù And tells my boss if I talk to her like that again she‚Äôll fire me on the spot. I‚Äôm not even in her department. 

I called HR and formally filed a hostile work environment claim, have an employment lawyer on call, wrote a 5 pg claim with everything she‚Äôs done and what I‚Äôve witnessed, cutting their handbook, and medical journals about health effects, and pdf of the EEOC Gov. highlighted.  Everyone in the office except her team are on board to give their testimonies on how she‚Äôs been abusive to them. Her and her team doesn‚Äôt even know that tomorrow HR is coming in to investigate and interview everyone. Everyone is excited, calling me the messiah, although I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll get fired. 
When I talked to HR on the phone, they were flabbergasted that she said she would fire me on the spot. They said my own supervisor couldn‚Äôt even do that (which my supervisor wrote a statement saying that she said that to back me up and emailed it to them). 
I asked for them to review her records from before the buy out but there‚Äôs probably nothing there bc it kept getting swept under the rug. 
HR and the VP had to come out last month for conflict resolution btw her and another manager. 
I‚Äôm tired of being nice. I‚Äôm tired of being kind and taken advantage of. I was scared bc I know her and her team will be bitches to me, but I forgot who I am. I‚Äôm a survivor, I hold multiple degrees. I got my mba in four months (humble brag), fuck her. What is she going to do that I haven‚Äôt experienced. I remembered I fear no bitch."

I am 27 and I am trying to complete my bachelors and i want to complete some certifications to hopefully get a job that pays at least 50k or more. I do not want to waste my life in low paying jobs that have nothing to do with the fields I want to purse.

My biggest fear is not being able to find better than what i have because sadly this is the best job I have ever had. I know I need to take risk but I feel like I am being too ungrateful and need to take my classes and go to work instead of choosing one.

I have been slacking off at my job and my managers have noticed, I also have been asking for PTO last minute because I have so many assignments due and I just feel so stressed right now. I honestly underestimated the workload. The last class I took was calculus 2 about 4 years ago.

Would it be ok to quit now and focus on school and progressing my career or should I suck it up? I currently have 16k in savings and I live at home.

I have a query and was wondering if I can rely on any experts in HR and Management.

Just weighing up my options, but how averse are companies to you working two jobs with some shift ""cross-over"" time?

I want to work 4am-12pm in one job and 8am-4pm in another office job with the mornings being remote for both. I will have two laptops on. Most of the work in the 4am start job is done by 8, so I am just ""on call"" until 12 to answer a couple emails if required.

The new job company is fine with it already, it's just the 9-5 current one I am concerned with when I present my case. This one I have worked at for 3.5 years to date and I am at good standing. I am absolutely certain I can manage the workload. I can also work overtime (until 7pm or later) end of shift to easily stay on top of things as and when required, but this likely won't be necessary.

Wonder if you guys have any advice on this. I know every company is different, but any opinions or thoughts would be most appreciated.

Thanks, Scone"

She would always ask me once a week if any of my friends got COVID (When I first started, she would ask what I did over the weekends and I would say that I ate with my friends). She always asks me these snarky questions when I am in a good mood and unprepared. Last month, her mom and husband got covid, so she had to double mask at work. 

Last week, she asked me for the 9th time if my friends got COVID because she was worried about me. I responded with a smile that they did not and most of them are young medical doctors. I then asked her if her friends got COVID because I am concerned that death rate for elders who contracted COVID is much higher. She yelled, ""WHAT?"". I told her that I was just concerned and excused myself since I told her I had to leave. 

She went to tell my boss, and I had a talk with him. My boss is around her age and asked why I made that comment.

Would really appreciate some advice. The area I work in has been made redundant. Most people have resigned due to the toxic work culture and relationship issues. I tried my best to manage it all but was out of my depth. I am the manager and have been offered the opportunity to move into Front end, with training ect. On paper it looks like a great experience and family and friends keep saying how silly I'd be to move jobs. 

However, I feel really depressed after everything that has happened, losing the team, and all the drama.  I've been applying to other jobs just to see whats out there and have been rejected at second and third stage, more times than I can count. Two opportunities had me creating two bespoke presentations for second stage interviews. Was rejected from both. My confidence is at an all time low, and with only 18 months experience of management experience , I sometime wonder whether I'll ever be able to find something else. 

I feel so stuck, and I'm under pressure to make a decision on whether i'm making the move internally otherwise they will start redundancy procedure and I'll be terminated.

I‚Äôm mainly looking for a role in customer service or retail as this is where my strengths lie, although I also have a interest in acting, working from home, office jobs, apprenticeship and traineeship, digital marketing and web designing and apply for them too. After managing to get a lot of interviews the other month, my luck completely ran out after applying for 20 or more jobs in one day a few weeks back. I was so upset but my boyfriend (25m) just said I don‚Äôt need to worry about getting a job and just to try my best (he is the breadwinner who earns enough to sustain us both)

The thing is while he works from home, I‚Äôm bored out of my brain while playing on my tablet or watching TV. I know I can‚Äôt keep doing this everyday. I need a job. I get no income at all cos I‚Äôm not entitled to any benefits (not even PIP for my anxiety and ADHD- got rejected last week) and I need to be doing more so I can lose weight. I keep getting worried if I don‚Äôt get a job soon I‚Äôm gonna be depressed. It doesn‚Äôt have to be full time, that‚Äôs what my boyfriend does so I could do part time if I wanted

Anyway for the first time ever I‚Äôve been offered a work trial instead of a interview. The employer has said that I have a 3 hour work trial for this Saturday if I want it for Front of House Team Member at a restaurant in my town

At first I thought yeah I want it! A chance to show what I can do without worrying about a interview? Brilliant! I jumped at the chance. But then I did a bit of digging and realised work trials usually last a week and are paid. This one is literally voluntary work for just 3 hours. I definitely don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough time for me to prove my skills and show I‚Äôm a good fit even though I‚Äôm capable of this role. Not just that, but this restaurant has really bad working reviews when we‚Äôve looked. Apparently there is bullying there and staff are rude. As a naturally friendly and bubbly person I really don‚Äôt want to be working with rude people. I also don‚Äôt like the thought of the pressure I would be under as they basically said I will be watched constantly. So if I fuck up somehow and it‚Äôs not even my fault, that will go against me and straight away they will reject me. They want me working in a toxic workplace without pay for just 3 hours with no break probably cos I‚Äôm always watched, when there‚Äôs no guarantee I will even get the job. I think it‚Äôs just too much pressure for a anxiety sufferer like me and anyway, the boss might be nasty too, maybe they only employ rude people? I quit McDonalds after 3 shifts due to bullying, I‚Äôm not going through that again

I feel guilty for not wanting to do it anymore, and almost ungrateful, but there‚Äôs just too many red flags for me. What would you do? Go for it, turn it down? Thanks in advance :)"

I feel pretty down about how the job market is currently. I keep kicking myself because, to me, I feel that I didn't choose the ""right"" path during my time in college.  


I'm currently working a retail job right now... they're cutting the hours pretty heavily. I'm looking for a job that will have better hourly compensation, plus secure/or at least consistent hours.   


Is there anything I can do with my journalism degree that can lead to entering a field with good hourly compensation and opportunities for advancement?"

The thing is, I am still in probation period in the current company, although very close to the end (a few days away).

I want to give the current company a 2 weeks notice as a courtesy, but my concern is:

\- I tell the **new** company that I need two weeks before starting

\- I give the current company the two weeks notice

\- The current company lets me go at the spot, as I am in probation still

In that scenario, I would be without pay for 2 weeks, as I don't think it's trivial to go to the new company and say ""hey, actually I can start tomorrow"".

FWIW, this is in Canada.

I tell this at every interview I‚Äôve been in and communicate that I can‚Äôt stay any later then this.

So I ask, hey I can‚Äôt really do this normally since it‚Äôs pass my availability. And they said they‚Äôll have to let me go if I can‚Äôt do these training hours, so I just accepted them since they said it was just for training. A few days later I again, placed my availability from 9am-4pm for a few days so I can focus on school. And yesterday I had a talk with the schedule manger again and THIS time they said I have to close the store 2 days out the week and that‚Äôs required. It was the first thing I‚Äôve heard and they claimed they told me at the start which wasn‚Äôt true. And I said I literally can not do that. So another manager who looked over it (helped me set up employee acc and etc) just told me to submit it, and the scheduling manger said they were gonna talk to see if it‚Äôs ok but I highly doubt it. I‚Äôm suppose to get an email today about if I can stay or not and they want me to go in tomorrow. But honestly, I might quit because now it feels like my time isn‚Äôt being respected."

We are not direct coworkers, he works in a different department but I see him in the break room during breaks and through passing each other.

I have done nothing to warrant this. He always touches me. He would touch my arm, my back, and my stomach. He would harass me in the the break room and invade my personal space and alone time and sit down next to me without asking. He has done this repeatedly, and he can't seem to understand the concept that I don't want to talk to him. I told him, ""I don't want you to sit next to me."" He would say, ""Why? Is someone else sitting here?"" Other times he would walk by my table and lean in close and whisper in my ear, ""Hello, would you like some of my food?"" I told him no. I don't want to eat his food. When he offered me his food, he just wants something in return and he wants to touch me. And if he sits at a different table, he would sit and stare at me the whole time.

He is living in fantasy land and is trying to gaslight me. He said things like, ""Why have you come to like me? I want to know why you are the one who likes me."" He introduced me to people as his girlfriend when I never even told him that I'm his girlfriend nor that I like him. He said, ""We should go to the hotel so that we can have sex."" ""When are we going to go on a date?"" ""I think we should kiss now."" He would ask me numerous times to kiss him. I've tried ignoring him, not saying anything when he speak to me. He would say, ""Why are you so mad at me?""

Doesn't he realize he is 40 years my senior? What should I do?"

Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been working for the past 2 years in the IT department of a company in the private sector (not disclosing the name jic ;). I work from home under a reasonable accomodation. My first tasks were pretty menial and boring; my boss, recognizing that I had potential gave some other things to do to explore other areas. I‚Äôve also earned a couple of IT certs (studying for another one). He has also given me positive reviews and recommended me for a promotion. Sadly that has not happened. 

A couple of months ago, my boss told me that my main tasks would be assigned to another employee (who is no longer with the company) since I had mentioned that I wanted a bigger challenge. Most of the tasks are sporadic; I have to continously ask for things to do and sometimes what I get are tasks that nobody wants to do and they dump them on me (data entry, etc).  Although I fill up my time studying and doing other things, it sucks. 

What should I do? Although I‚Äôve discussed with him this subject many times and he promises things will improve, nothing happens. I‚Äôm waiting to earn the cert I‚Äôm currently studying for to start looking for a new remote job but still I cannot lose this job in the meantime. I also wonder if I am being discriminated because of my accomodation. 

Sorry for the long rant! Any advice will be appreciated.  I‚Äôm taking to my boss again tomorrow regarding this matter."

I will begin as the controller of that new branch. I am 9 classes away until I receive my bachelors in accounting. 

I love this company but when I began working here it was part-time and I was able to make time for school. Since then the company has changed from a mom and pop shop to becoming an organized company. They‚Äôve been hiring more and more men, there are 4 women in the office with me being in the highest position.

Other employees do not get an option to join even if they have the desire to learn. I am paid well, I am treated well but I have not been able to shake the feeling of being unsatisfied.

I am considering getting more into real estate after the new TX branch turns a profit. I am looking to purchase property to make a vacation rental. Once I have my bachelors in ideally two years I would like to begin looking for jobs in real estate or property mgmt, whether it‚Äôs administrative or finance.

I wanted to give the new job a chance to see if I liked it. Turns out I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm not a good fit for the job. I accepted the offer from the other job and I start there on 9/12.

I haven‚Äôt told my current employer yet. I am only taking on minor tasks currently because I do not have all of the accesses I need, so It wont be a big loss for the company when I leave. But, since I am not of much value yet, I didn‚Äôt think they would let me work out a 2 week notice, and I couldn‚Äôt go 2 weeks without getting paid, hence why I haven‚Äôt told them yet.

My question is, how do I tell them? I want to leave on good terms. But I don‚Äôt necessarily want to tell them I am leaving for another job. I want to let them know I appreciate the opportunity, but I am not a good fit for the job. The truth is, I wasn‚Äôt experienced enough for this position, I told them that in the interview (I didn‚Äôt try to hide anything), and they still chose to hire me.

The experience on my resume is accurate in terms of job title, responsibilities, etc, but the dates aren‚Äôt 100% accurate. The reason is I took a job that ended up being a really bad situation and was only there for &lt;6mos. 

In effort to cover that up on my resume (in hopes of getting more interviews) I extended the timeline I was working at another job. 

Will this come up / be an issue with my new job? All the jobs I‚Äôve worked are the same types of jobs just different companies, and they‚Äôre in a different industry than what this new job is for.

One of the main appeals of the job offer was being able to work from home. Unfortunately, that is going to change too soon. 

In the interview I was told they had the plan in mind to go hybrid, but that it was not going to be implemented anytime soon. Now they have told us to start adjusting because we are going to be back in the office by the first week of October.

I am feeling somewhat discouraged because one it would 30-40 mins commute to go there. I would have to wake up several hours before actual work time. Plus, having to deal with the work culture which can be somewhat annoying and intimidating at times.

For further context, this is a call center position as representative. The hour wage is 16.50 and I initially wanted 18.00 dollars minimum. I accepted because of the fully Remote position. 

Lastly, I won't be able to move anywhere because they are going back to hybrid. So I would have to stay in the state if I wish to keep the job. I am just dont know how to feel about this because I recently started and do want to be job hopping again."

With all that said I was approached by another company to do what my boss does essentially. I wasn't that interested so I threw out my current comp plus 50% to make the move. Well they bit on the comp and I am awaiting an offer. 

I am planning to take the new role but want to show my appreciation to my boss for all that he has done for me. I don't know if it something such as a nice bottle of booze, or a letter of appreciation? Already planning to write a glowing letter to his boss (our CFO).

I began working as a UX/UI designer at a start-up company last year, and I was so enthusiastic, so passionate, and so na√Øve. I've been asking a lot of questions and making a lot of suggestions for improvements ever since I started working there. Since my boss, the CEO, didn't have much experience with UX/UI and didn't like how things were going at the company, he started pressuring me to do whatever he suggested, even if it was wrong, until he started bluntly telling me to copy entire screens from other applications, like literally 1:1 copy. So I kind of lost my craft while working there, and honestly, I was just there for the money. Until recently, I had to collect myself and leave that position. Basically, why I'm telling you this is that I feel like I've wasted so much time there and since I was working extra hours and the work itself was mentally exhausting, I couldn't learn anything during my free time.

  
Following my departure, I began browsing LinkedIn's job listings and quickly realized that the market's demands for UX designers far exceeded what I actually possessed. I have a question for you guys because I'm considering becoming a full-time UI designer only. I'm hoping that your responses will help me calm down.

  
1-The resume is important. I've looked up how to make a UI designer resume, but every response I've found has to do with UX design. Could you please explain how to make a UI design resume?

  
2. Is it sufficient to only demonstrate UI skills by showcasing your mock-ups and Hi-Fi prototypes, or does a UI design portfolio also need to include some UX process?

  
3-Is learning graphic design software like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop necessary for me to have a chance in the market?

  
Given my financial situation and the fact that I have only four months to find a job, I would greatly appreciate any assistance.

  
Tl;dr: I feel like I wasted my time working in a toxic environment, so now that I'm looking for a job, I need to know how to get a new position.

I‚Äôd love to get some insight from hiring managers (or anyone who‚Äôs been in this position before.)

I‚Äôm currently in a interview process and overall, the interview with the hiring manager went great. I had a couple questions thrown at me I wasn‚Äôt expecting, but I managed to answer them at the best of my ability. 

I asked a few questions at the end and the hiring manager answered them all in pretty great detail. I should mention this is a place I applied blind without any offer available and inmediately got scheduled an interview with the hiring manager.
So I feel like the whole interview went pretty good. Hiring manager said he liked our chemistry and went into great detail everything I should expect once I start and who will I meet, including the next steps in the hiring process which is a screening test I should expect to be sent. 
However they didn‚Äôt schedule anything, and after I sent a thank you e-mail they didn't reply and I haven't heard anything from them since, and it's been three days. 

I guess I‚Äôm curious - is it a bad sign? 

As mentioned previously, I‚Äôd love to hear some stories or insight from hiring managers. 

Thank you!"

I am constantly weighing the pros and cons. And because we don't know the future, the potential for a disastrous outcome is much higher.

What are your thought process when you wanna do something new? I get paralysed by the uncertainty.

If you are unemployed , you have nothing to lose by applying for various jobs. 

If you have a job but live on paycheck to paycheck , ,applying for another job suddenly leaves you on a shaking ground. Unless you have massive savings..

I‚Äôve applied to over 40 jobs in the last month, and I‚Äôve gotten three interviews so far while waiting for the rest, along with a few rejections. I‚Äôve been told by those who see my resume that I have a very strong background in the field, but I worry it‚Äôs not getting past the ATS gates.

I was told by a close family friend that in a situation where jobs are scarce and the only option you have is the job that pays less, you should take it rather than stay unemployed.

I've chalked it up to ""the expectations for this position were greater than the duties of this position required and we parted ways"" (Translation: I couldn't make volunteers do work if they didn't want to, and I couldn't make new volunteers appear out of thin air.)

Not one, but two related jobs at the state level have come up, one for each side. I applied at the good one, and mentioned the contacts I had made at the state level, so not too many worries there (please call me though!) but the second one, while I'm qualified, would probably require them to contact bad boss. I don't foresee her saying anything that would help me get the job.

Is there a way to mitigate this? Would it be better if I reached out before or after the application? Is it crazy to reach out to the first one I applied to?

I'm in a small town and both jobs are remote, and pay reasonably well. I'd prefer the position without the drama (it's a government job) but I don't know if I should contact them at all.

How can I, as a job seeker, tell if feedback is genuine or if it's just what they're being told to say by the legal department?

Today I had a finalist interview for a role I was contacted for about 3 weeks ago. The first interview went great. Last week I was asked to participate in a finalist interview. I have been preparing myself and even sent samples of my work since the final interview was via zoom. After my interview I was told that I would hear back by the end of the work day if they plan to move forward. This actually made me extremely anxious, but I was still hopeful. 

Well, got the rejection email, but it came directly from one of the chiefs who interviewed me. In the email she said ""I want you to know that both interview teams agree that you are a strong candidate for the position.¬† Having said that, we interviewed a candidate who is just a bit more aligned to our department needs at this moment, and we will be offering the position to that candidate first. If, for some reason, this candidate does not accept the Program Manager job, I will ask that Talent extend the next offer to you ‚Äì you would not have to interview again.¬† If this candidate DOES accept, I would like to keep in touch with you about future openings on our team."" She also said that she rarely sends emails like this, but needed to in order to communicate their sincerest interest of me being on their team. 

This was pretty much a dream role for me because it would be a stepping stone into an administrative or director role which is ultimately where I see my career going. Not even an hour after the email and I am finding myself fixating over whether I'll still get the job offer. I guess I'm just looking for some words of encouragement. I've had 2 other interviews this week, but this one I hyper focused on because of the growth opportunities. I currently have a job and my salary is decent, but I always want better for myself and starting to feel a little down about it."

I get a lot of good feedback on what I should do, but I also reckon some of the advice is bullshit (usually someone who gives me advice that contradicts what most people say).

One of the most confusing is that you do not need a resume when applying to a minimum wage job such as a supermarket or a fast food place. I don't think I have ever seen a job application in Australia that did not require a resume. Why do people say that you don't need one then? WTH?

Another one is that employers are screaming out for workers, which I'm convinced is just bullshit. I'm half convinced that people just flat out don't want me to work, with the amount of jobs that require experience or a skill that is obviously unnecessary. It makes no sense.

I know some people say ""there's no worker shortage, there's a shortage of people willing to work for very little"" but that isn't true either. Plenty of people who are willing to work for minimum wage and we can't get it.

Plenty of other feedback that makes little sense (""just move to a new area!"") but these are the big ones.

Have you been changing jobs usually and, if so, did you finally found a job where you see yourself staying for a long time? 


I stayed in my first 2 jobs 4 years each - I have to say that there was a lot of reasons to leave but I was junior and kind of lost. After that, I got into a job that was so toxic I got sick, I was lucky I found another job in less than 1 year. 

After that, I'm on a quest of finding a job where I would like to stay for some years... But so far I find reasons to leave in 1-2 years tops. 

Now again. It's almost 1 year and I have doubts. Some friends told me they could send my CV and I'd like to change but I feel guilty for leaving so soon and I have a lot of friends here (not only from work). And now I'm starting to understand how everything works... Shall I leave it after everything? 

But, honestly: there's absolutely no career projection, they hire managers from outside instead of promoting people, the manager hates me... Like if I go for lunch, I'm chatting and getting along with many people but he would not speak to me unless it's strictly necessary (I'm sure he keeps me because he needs it for the job and because project managers value me), I feel invisible... I keep having some achievements at work and when people come to ask for support, my manager says no and refers them to another coworker who is pretty junior and the tasks come back to me but in an invisible way, and now they changed my team and they moved us to an awful place where I have barely no space, that's not made for someone working 8h. 


I'm not the only one but people somehow don't quit. I imagine they have families and constraints... But I have nothing. Shall I leave again or finding a good place to work for several years in peace is a myth?"

However, my manager now wants a meeting with me to discuss my ""resignation"" and handing over my duties to a new employee. The question, ""Why are you leaving?"" will inevitably come up. I've had a good track record with past jobs, and I wouldn't be in this situation had my manager been different.

So, I'm really conflicted on whether or not i should take a new job with my co-worker. It pays the same, but I'd be making commission on top of that. 

My current job is okay. I don't like it too much but I've been there long enough to get benefits on a lot of things, and since my co-worker is leaving, I'd probably get a lead hand position that comes with a raise. 

This new job sounds good too, and I'd be a supervisor there. Get a new experience and possibly make something out of myself. 

The problem lies with the co-worker. Ive had issues with her in the past and so have my co-workers. Most if not all, have talked to the boss about her behavior. She was bossy, passive aggressive, mean, and just a pain to work with.

Up until a month ago, we started getting along again.(i say again because it's like a cycle) She's very nice and a joy to be around when she chooses to be. I even went to her house a few times for a couple drinks. 

She's the one who offered me this position. She will be management at this new place, in charge of running it, and basically my new boss. She even got my wage to what it is now since the starting wage at this new place was significantly lower than what i make now.

I felt pressured to take this job. At first i had a week to think about it, then 2 days, now just today. She printed out my resignation form before i even got a chance to give my answer. 

Another thing, I'd be really screwing over the job i have now. We are already short staffed as is, but with the both of us leaving, they'd have no one to run that place. I'd feel bad just leaving out of nowhere.

I'm just so conflicted. It sounds like a great opportunity and an upgrade from what I'm doing now, but I'm scared I'll do something to piss her off and it will be how it was just a month ago, but this time, she can just fire me, and i'd also feel like a jerk screwing over my current workplace.

Any advice is appreciated."

I've been working by myself for about a month after a month of training. It's not a difficult job, but the tasks and responsibilities are quite varied and multifaceted. That is, nothing is hard on its own, but staying on top of the plethora of things to do is quite stressful - especially at the stage that I'm currently in. The salary and benefits are respectable for someone with limited job experience, but I just worry that I'll inevitably underperform and that they'll have to sack me. I'm not sure if it's paranoia or that I'm genuinely inept and incapable of performing this type of job. I feel like I'm not getting direct feedback about my performance - surely if I were doing horribly, my supervisor would let me know, right?

I feel like it's a lot more difficult to gauge your work performance than it is to gauge your school performance because I have nothing to compare it to if that makes sense."

Not signed any form of contract to say my position was officially changing, and my job title still includes the word ""night"" - it's a 0 hour contract so I basically work whatever's available.

Yet they're now recruiting for someone else to go on to night shift - no idea if they're going to do my remaining night time hours so I'll be permanently on days, or if suddenly extra night hours have appeared and they don't want \*me\* doing them... Or even if they're hiring my replacement but not telling me until they've got someone (I'm still in my probationary period so although I haven't done anything that could be remotely considered even slightly as misconduct, it still means if they're not 100% happy with me they don't have to keep me)?

Would have thought in any of those examples, they'd at least have said *something* to me? Even if it was as simple as asking ""hey grockle90, would you prefer doing just the one shift type rather than being the waking dead at all hours of the day and night?""

Yet another reason why I want out ASAP, at any rate.

UPDATE: just got my rota through to take me up to 18th September... doing night shift on 5th, 2 days off, then 8 day shifts in a row 8th-15th... other than my manager being offsite at another hotel location for 2 days during that time I can't figure out why I'm suddenly doing this working pattern... can only assume I've unofficially been transferred to days permanently due to shortages there?"

Before I received my degree, I was working as a cashier for that casino. Unfortunately, COVID-19 hit and the casino was shut down. 

Lately, after receiving my degree, COVID has eased somewhat and I am now looking for work. I had a bookkeeper job for a solar company, but I was laid-off after I helped them pay all their back-taxes and set up a system so it didn't happen again. 

I've been trying to get a new job but, like I said, there are literally no other places hiring accountants. So I've been trying to get into the casino as anything. I've even had to stop taking medications that keep my brain functioning properly since they contain THC and I need to pass a drug test. I've been waiting 2 months now and they continue to tell me I'm still under consideration, so I can't risk taking my medication again in case they decide to hire me and I have to pass the drug test.

The only reason I can possibly think that they don't want to hire me is because I wasn't willing to put myself and my loved ones in danger for the casino, since otherwise there's absolutely no other reason they're leaving me hanging like this. I know there's an idea that they don't owe me anything, but I've made myself mentally unstable for them, so I feel like there has to be a reason I'm doing this. I've been trying to get any job they're offering, even if it's just a dishwasher job. I don't have any othet jobs available besides getting my sperm destroyed while doing hard labor for a nuclear plant.

So my original question comes back to this: Will a company blacklist me if I was unwilling to return to work in the middle of the COVID pandemic? And futuremore, is there any way for me to fix this or should I go ahead and start a new life somewhere else?"

1. Private equity backed 10 year old company planning to double in size in 24 months 

2. Safe stable job lower pay, less inspiring work, in a higher cost of living area

3. Roll the dice, 50% pay cut for 3-4 years but in 5-6 years I‚Äôd be in an ownership position making double and would be able to exit when I decide I want to exit (I‚Äôm super healthy, super high energy, hate being bored, hope to work 20-25 more years

Option 1: highly likely I‚Äôm back in the market looking for a job in 3-4 years when PE firm looks to cash out and sells it off and I‚Äôll be 56 (so I have all 3 strikes against me: old, white, male)

Option 2: relatively safe and stable and puts me on the PhD track to be a professor (problem is universities in the US don‚Äôt want old white guys‚Ä¶..unless I create a gay persona)

Option 3: I go way back to almost entry level pay for 3-5 years to take a shot at ownership (not a guarantee) and then exit when I damn well please (as opposed to being forced out because of my age)

Option 4: go to a coding boot camp (I have an accounting degree from 1995 and ZERO IT experience) to get a cyber security credential because of the massive number of unfilled jobs in that space projected over the next 10 years

What other options exist for someone my age without connections in powerful positions?

On August 17th I got an email about references and all my references had filled out their questionnaire by that evening. Hoping to get the ball rolling I reached out to the person i had been conversing with and asked for a timeline and she said ""we will reach out soon"" which I thought meant by the end of the week last week. So Friday rolled around and I sent her a follow up in the afternoon. She got back to me and said they'd likely have a decision this week. Since then I have heard nothing. I plan on reaching out again on Tuesday morning since Monday is a holiday but I have a sneaking suspicion that I didn't get it. Do you think that's a valid feeling or should I keep my hopes up? I have another interview next week to look forward to but I'm worried about that as well since I will be out of the country the two weeks following it which I think might hurt my chances there. 


Tldr: I had a job ask for references on August 17th, was told they'd reach out this week, haven't heard back."
0,2022-09-02,Did I miss out on my dream job?,u/lytener,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x3tloy/did_i_miss_out_on_my_dream_job/,jobs,"I'm in self-pity for someone who is doing fairly well and living comfortably. I'm not looking for anyone to feel sorry for me. I'll get over myself. I wanted to gauge what other people would have done differently if presented with the same situation.

I work in a corporate consulting job that has a very high profile clients. I've had a relationship with the one client for nearly 10 years and felt like I could have worked their in-house job very well. I'll refer to them as Dream Job Client.

Back in October 2021, Dream Job Client took me out to an expensive dinner and drinks to offer me an in-house position. They offered a minimum of $250k base salary to start, expense account, benefits, performance bonus 100% of salary, and discretionary bonuses from the immediate supervisor. Total comp would have been north of $500k in the starting year. Dream Job Client said they have a career track for me to move up and that people in their department would be retiring over the next couple years.  I let them know I was interested.

I was in a dilemma though because several other clients were facing a pretty severe crisis and I was the lead on managing that project. I had to weigh several things about jumping ship early:

* Professional integrity - if I jumped ship in the middle of the project, would anyone hire me again? 
* Current employer is instrumental to the client - if I jumped ship, would this cause an issue between my current employer and the client? Dream Job Client is highly reliant on my consulting firm and they admitted there is no competitor that can offer the same services.

I thought I was doing the right thing by asking Dream Job Client that I just needed about two months to close the project. Dream Job Client said they needed to fill the position ASAP, but that they the would consult their executive team. About a week later, I get heads up call from Dream Job Client that they are filling the role with someone else I know, a person I hired and coached in the industry several years ago. Dream Job Client tries to soften the blow by saying they would bring me in at another time to round out their team.

So months go by and I start work with their new people. I feel like that person is pretty smug by saying that ""this is what we work toward, right?"" when showing me his office. I don't know if he was acknowledging that we both idealized this job. Normally, I've rooted for this person on promotions and different assignments. But I keep feeling like this person wasn't ready for a position like this and the only reason they got it was because I couldn't leave right away. So I'm definitely harboring jealousy because I'm thinking that I was supposed to be there and then regretful because I thought I did the right thing. He didn't know I was offered the job first. I'm constantly working on myself to let this go, but his smugness combined with lack of competence shows in the work we do together is infuriating.  Luckily, I only have to interface every once and awhile. I still directly interface with my main contact at Dream Job Client.

I go out to lunch again with Dream Job Client's principal officer (the guy who offered me the job) and he let me know that a lot has changed. He hopes to get me over at his company at some point, but the CEO has changed their plans for the company and their department. He tries to assure me that I'm more valuable to them at my current company and hopes that they are treating me well. 

So now I'm feeling some regret that I didn't take the job immediately. On the other hand, my current employer has been really good to me. I'm well compensated, but not as much as I was offered. I keep feeling like there was an opportunity cost because they can't pay me as nearly as much as I would have made at Dream Job Client. 

In my current role, I have a lot of autonomy and flexibility with my schedule. I get to spend more time with my family, focus on my health by going to the gym regularly, and have overall stability. I think I could have kept up at Dream Job Client, but I definitely think they would have worked me to the bone. Moreover, I have a boss that respects me and is willing to let me pursue unconventional ideas for our industry.

Recently, I've been asked to interview at Dream Job Client's counterpart/competitor. They are the 2nd biggest in the region. They won't pay as much and don't carry the same prestige, but it seems like they offer more flexibility and are a family-owned business. 

Did I make the right call staying where I was? Do I need to reevaluate my definition of the dream job?"

I‚Äôm interviewing at a company and just passed the portfolio screening, initial interview and technical assessment stages.

Today they told me I passed my assessment and asked me to book a schedule for my technical interview with the hiring manager.

I booked a schedule for the same day and while waiting for the meeting link I was contacted by the HR and was asked to reschedule for Tuesday.

He told me it was because the hiring manager also wanted her 2 bosses to jump in on the interview. They said they will discuss my technical assessment and also talk to me about the responsibilities of the role.

During the call with HR, he was also trying to negotiate on salary a little bit. We discussed this previously but it seems like they want me to close in on a firm number.

Here‚Äôs the thing. It seems like they did not expect to find someone with my experience for the role. Because they previously hired someone with 4 years of experience for the same role in another department, while I have 8 years.

I have a feeling they‚Äôre trying to stall because I‚Äôve gone over their budget.

But nonetheless, is it a good sign if I‚Äôm suddenly going to talk to 3 managers when this wasn‚Äôt the plan initially? What should I expect? I‚Äôve never interviewed anywhere with more than 2 people before."

Writing this here as I'm kicking myself metaphorically into the corner about this.

At my University, we have a team of students who work as 'Student Assistants' at first-year student halls of residence. Helping run social events, drop in evenings and so on. Incredible job for what it is. Pretty good pay and often it doesn't feel like work. Fun job. Consistent hours each week.

I have been with the team since the scheme started in November 2019, and I have worked for every student village there is. I know for a fact I am the most experienced and long-serving member of staff that they have.

To work (and continue on in) this role you have to be a registered student for the coming academic year. At the time when the form was going around asking if you would be staying on or graduating (and thus, leaving the job) back around April time, I had no idea of three huge developments that only happened in the past 1-2 months:

1. That I would be coming back to do a second Masters degree (this one in International Relations). This was not even something I had considered or thought of, as my career plans at the start of the year are vastly different to how they are now. It's with an eye towards my ultimate ambition to work in the intelligence services/military intelligence.
2. That I would receive an unconditional offer from the Politics department at the University to do the MA
3. That my mentor and former internship manager would offer to pay *the entirety of the tuition fees* and provide some partial money to help pay for some of my rent and living expenses (all included in my accommodation)

In relation to No3, it is only possible as my mentor received and accepted an offer of someone else to pay him monthly for coaching and mentorship. 

As soon as I knew all of the above, I contacted both my immediate supervisor and the manager coordinating everything above him letting them know about this and all but begging for my old position back. They have, of course, filled the team with new hires where previous student workers (like me) left gaps. They have said that they've put me on a reserve list, but that's absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that a spot will be freed up - that will only happen if someone drops out. I'm annoyed that they can't take me back on considering how much experience I have at the job, but part of me thinks that's just my ego talking.

I don't know if there's anything else I can do here. I can't keep bugging my supervisor and overall manager with emails about this, I'll just p\*ss them off. I saw someone wearing the uniform hoodie of the job the other day who I didn't recognise, and I will admit, I got jealous and bitter seeing them in it knowing that I could have kept the job I had. But I couldn't have known...

Anyway, any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance folks.

I am an administrative assistant; currently my boss is the highest position in our region and everything must go through him (regardless of departments since there is no one higher in the region). 

We recently just acquired another company, they had a lot more office space than we did so we moved in to their building. My boss was responsible for all the seating arrangements, offices and cubes were assigned by pay grade. Naturally shit fits we‚Äôre thrown (on their end) but they were told too bad (not by my boss but by a few others who now report to my boss). 

My boss was on vacation this week and someone from another department in another region was visiting the building since he has people sitting there who report to him. It was recently discovered that someone in another department resigned and now his office was free. This guy decided that his team members ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt ask for permission, but should ask for forgiveness‚Äù so he moved one of his people into the office - not clearing it with anyone. He decided to move another one of his employees into an empty office that is reserved for someone who did not start yet. 

A few colleagues have been telling me I need to tell my boss what happened when he comes back. This a huge issue since it is based on pay grade and other people of the same grade can sue if they do not receive an office since the other 2 decided to claim offices. This also an issue with the space planning team as well because we have people sitting where they aren‚Äôt supposed to be. I have no problem telling but I am worried I will come across as gossiping rat. I have expressed concerns to him in the past, and he did have my back with things. Apparently the guy who took the office first was a problem in the past; he decided to claim an office before we moved in by dumping his stuff into one and then took forever to move out of the office when seats were assigned. Eventually the other admin there took his stuff and dumped in his cube.  Now this guy also pulled someone aside and said ‚Äúso, who has a problem with me sitting in this office‚Äù. The person on the receiving end played dumb (because it‚Äôs not her place to kick him out). That comment from him is what is making me so worried here. 

The other issue is that apparently these people just expect lunch to be ordered every single day on the company‚Äôs dime. My boss canceled that when we moved in and everyone through a shit fit and a half because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot fair‚Äù and ‚Äúthey were promised it‚Äù. The deal was we will stop lunch after Labor Day week; but now these people are expecting breakfast and lunch because once again they were ‚Äúpromised‚Äù both. The heads of a few other departments (from my side of the company) are fed up with this because it‚Äôs totally ridiculous. Me and another admin or 2 are expected to set everything up and clean everything up while a few of (their) people stand to the side watching and waiting. They spill food all the tables and chairs and don‚Äôt even think to clean up. They load their plates with 4 or 5 slices of pizza or sandwiches and sides. They also have the nerve to complain about what is getting ordered, and I can count on one hand how many thank you‚Äôs I have received (from my team) I really want to tell him how out of hand this is getting but I‚Äôm worried about looking like a complainer. I know the head of the other department will have my back on this one because he is fed up; he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that clean up always falls on me and another admin and no one offers to help. 

Any advice on all this when I tell my boss when he returns from vacation?"

So ever since the company acquisition had been confirmed, my bosses have seemingly lost all care with regards to the running of the business and inadvertedly sabotaging things.

Examples would include:
Dismissing customer queries
Openly telling customers they don't care
Not purchasing enough stock till the takeover
Trimming this to save money

The worst thing is they are holding a carrot to other employees, threatening them with bad recommendations to the incoming company unless they submit to their demands.

As the manager, I've been trying to shield them from as much interaction with the owners as possible but today, things got bad when the employees were rightfully addressing their grievances and in response,  the owners mentioned their own needs and put the blame on the employees by and I quote ""taking on more business, thus giving themselves more work"".

At this point, I told the owners that I disagree with everything they said and I fully side with the employees (these guys kill themselves) and in response, the owners (not so subtly) threatened everyone (who spoke up) with their livelihoods.

Since the meeting, there's been an ominous cloud within the company and I'm worried the owners are petty enough to give everybody who spoke up bad reviews.

Would there be anything I can do to help protect everyone from any potential backlash aside from documenting interactions and so forth?"

I put a lot of work into these projects but most of that work can't really be shown as it was spent learning/experimenting.

One company contacted me and things moved really fast. 1st round with HR on the phone for 10min, next round with the same HR officially for 30mins, next round with the hiring manager + Regional CFO, next round with the Global team.

After every round I sent emails thanking them for their time.
The day after the last meeting with the Global team, I got a call from HR asking me what my salary expectations were. In a spot, I mentioned a 20% increase, and my variable bonus was due to be paid in March and usually it's about 2 months bonus. 

The next day, she comes back with a proposal. It's a 23% increase above my current package including a 15% variable bonus the firm pays into consideration. The 3% is for the year end inflationary adjustment I would lose. She mentions if I join by 1 Oct I would get a pro-rated end of year bonus ~ 25% of a month's salary. They also give variable bonus paid out in the following March but I have to be an employee on 1 Sep which is impossible.

I hint to say I'm losing my variable bonus in March and HR replies that if I'm looking for a job now I should be prepared to lose my March variable bonus plus it's quite far away. I also try to hint for a 5% inflationary increase on my base then a 20% increase but HR tells me no, base is not negotiable but sign on bonus maybe.

Over the weekend I talk to a bunch of people and they say I can try to negotiate the sign on bonus but the base increase looks good. Considering this firm also hired recruiters, and recruiters usually charge 15% of annual package, I thought it would be reasonable.

The next day, I ask HR to help organize a meeting with the hiring manager or the regional CFO, saying I would like to get to know them since the previous interview was all about me. HR helps to arrange and on that day itself I speak about 1h to both of them. I hint to the hiring manager about the sign on bonus and she outright says she herself forfeit the sign on bonus in a previous job because she really wanted to leave. We end the call on a good note, I did ask how the working hours were like (yes taboo but its important to me) and she also shared that the team is small so she will ask her direct reports to do things out of their job scopes and force them to try at least. I also stress that this decision is important to me because I want to stay in the firm for 10 or 15 years.

The following day I call HR, express my excitement to work with the team etc and ask for a sign on bonus which is about the 2 months variable I would lose should I stay til March. This amount also takes into consideration the lower medical benefits I will get there because this firm doesn't cover spouse and dependents or dental. HR doesn't sound very pleased but asks for an email and I write one.

4 days later (which is very long considering they have been deciding things by the day), HR calls and says they can't offer the sign on bonus, and they're also pulling out the offer entirely. I ask if I don't take the sign on bonus if the offer is still there and she says no. Her reasoning is that the firm can't give me what I want so they think I won't be a good fit for the team.

Right after she calls me, the job posting is back on LI. Sigh.

Long story short, a bit sad I lost the offer. I wasn't super keen on the JD, it's also a smaller co than my current so maybe a dodged bullet. I guess lesson learnt is that if you really want the job don't negotiate just take it lol."

Should I just say ‚Äúscrew it, I‚Äôm done?‚Äù.",u/Glaxsys,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x47xnq/i_20f_turned_in_my_two_weeks_notice_and_im_not/,jobs,"I‚Äôm currently employed at a local grocery store and yesterday I handed in my two week notice. 

I‚Äôm a full time college student who applied to this job with the clear intentions of working part-time and around my school schedule. I‚Äôve only been there five weeks but since that time, I‚Äôve had to talk to the managers multiple times regarding my hours.

When I first got the job I told them that as of right now, before school starts, my schedule is very open. But I will be updating them on my availability as soon as I am able to. I then asked them sometime later for no more than 24 hours a week. I told them I can close some weekends, as I have study groups I need to attend.

However, they‚Äôve consistently scheduled me closing four days, 8 hr shifts through out Thursday-Sunday. I don‚Äôt normally mind closing, but this is way more often than I‚Äôd have liked, or can manage with my school. I even offered to do less hour shifts through out the week instead but we‚Äôre very understaffed and have a lot of minors working there, so I‚Äôm basically rendered a necessity to be there because the managers hate being called over for alcohol scans.

I had finally had enough and turned in my two weeks notice yesterday. I was told the schedule hasn‚Äôt been published that far out yet and they only have next weeks available (that wasn‚Äôt published for me to see yet). I told them I can work another week and help them out, but once the new schedule was published it was just more closing shifts again.

And that‚Äôs not even the worst part. The hiring manager/scheduling manager, the person in charge of training and posting the new schedule, has since dipped out and is on vacation. Basically I‚Äôm screwed and can‚Äôt negotiate my hours when it‚Äôs gotten to the point where it‚Äôs interfering with my school life.

I‚Äôve had serious urges to just ghost them after this whole headache. I feel like my worries are not being addressed properly there or taken seriously. I don‚Äôt want to screw them over because I at least want a good reference and to help them out. But I can‚Äôt keep working all these hours the way I am. Should I really try to tough it out these next week and get it over with? Or should I just not waste my time and leave now? 

I‚Äôm having a serious dilemma here where I keep getting sucked into not being able to say no to them and just want another opinion on the matter. Thanks I‚Äôm advance for any and all advice.

TLDR: I hate my retail job and they keep screwing me over with my hours. Even after giving my two weeks notice. Should I take a page from Half Baked or should I tough it out for the money?"

I am not considered a direct employee so I am not entitled to any benefits or insurance or anything. I'm considered a sole contractor and I have to deduct my own taxes.

All of which I'm fine with. But some time back they sent me an account statement that details all the jobs I did and my payment for it. And this account statement does not have my name. It only has my address and my account number with the company. The company assigned me an account number when I signed up with them. And I don't even have a document that links my name to that account number.

All this got me worried because what if someone in the future asks me to prove that I did all this work and that's how the money ended up in my bank account? I mean that's a pretty valid thing to be worried about right? If someone asks me to prove that, I can only show them the account statement (which has no links to my name)

I asked the company about all this and they told me not to worry about it. They told me they would send a letter during tax season if I ever needed anything.

I should also note that I don't have that much experience with working so I'm just trying to be careful. I don't want to get into any legal trouble in the future where I cannot prove how money ended up in my account.

But I feel like I've made a mistake with the company by pointing this out. I think I've made them paranoid. Because after I said this, they said my payment is being delayed and they haven't paid me.

So was this wrong on my part? Someone told me that companies don't like it when you ask a lot of questions. Especially temp work companies."

Gave in 2 weeks notice and left. The situation that led to me quitting was that my father had recently been hospitalized due to a second stroke and was due to be sent home and I was going to be his primary caretaker  That made traveling an hour to and back from work difficult and I had to find a new closer job. However I was too prideful to explain this and just gave in 2 weeks notice without explaining which they accepted and never asked. A week later during one of my father's tests they found something wrong with his heart and decided to keep him hospitalized for longer, around the same time the job offer for the other job was unexpectedly taken back. I then wanted to take my 2 weeks back and I explained it as personal family problems and that the second job had fallen through(which I know was a mistake now).

They spent 2/3 days of deliberating before telling me that they'd decided to move forward with my resignation and inviting me to apply for future job openings.

I spoke to my boss when I was leaving and she said that since I left on good terms the door was not closed to a return but was unlikely due to my performance over the past 3 months. She told me other people have left in worse circumstances and then eventually were re-hired so if I want to apply in October I could but she'd have to see the staffing situation at the time.

Here's the situation at hand:
I know that most people who worked my position, in fact I'd say all but 1 or 2 of them were college students, who will now have limited availability with schools opening and/or will be quitting soon. A problem I won't have since I have open availability. 

I know this place can get often get understaffed and have issues finding someone to work a shift, they don't like to run skeleton crews and often just ""need a body"" in there to do a job. 

This places recruitment is often mishandled. For example they might be understaffed, and only after being understaffed will they start hiring new people who won't start working for 2/3 weeks because of a lack of training. A problem I won't have. 

I know at the current moment, they are overstaffed because of the amount of people in my position/lack of shifts because of the lack of releases at the moment, but in October the shifts will increase(almost double) and there will be less people. 

I am likely the only former employee who could come back and work the position long term without training. Most other former employees would rather not do the job I do long term again or won't come back.

However on the other hand, I have questions.

Why would they let me go now, if they know theyre hiring again in October and know that people will quit/have limited availability soon? That shows me that they don't really want me around. Could it be related to the overstaffing? 

I have the email of the general manager who is heavily involved in firing/hiring, when I apply again would it be worth it to explain how I was not honest about my situation previously and what led to my initial resignation? Could that change their mind or would it just make me look worse for being dishonest."
2,2022-09-02,Is it better to stay where I am at?,u/_luminary,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x4bar9/is_it_better_to_stay_where_i_am_at/,jobs,"(Even though I'm dying slowly on the inside)

Hi there. I am 31F desperately trying to find a better paying job. I am not a college graduate but my family still bashes me sometimes for still not having a degree even though I was reeling from loss with the death of a partner (at the time I was 19) and a few years earlier death of a parent at 15.

I've been through some shit. Originally was wanting to work on my art career but commissions couldnt pay my  bills so I had to start customer service jobs straight after leaving 1st year of college because of the traumatic shit I've been through. Anyway, more on to the point of the post.

I have about 15 years experience with customer service jobs. Some sales experience as well. I have never been given an opportunity to be a supervisor/manager but I'm starting to think you only get hired on as a manager from ass kissing because anytime I ask I'm always rejected. 

Current job I have now is exhausting. The amount of work one has to do to get a pay check is obscene. I'm overworked. Roughly make 54,000/55,000 because of the mandatory OT (have to do 8 hrs of OT each week)  and it's basically making calls every single moment of every hour you work. You get PTO that adds up everytime your anniversary of hiring date comes around. I get paid 16.73 an hour and the OT is that plus another dollar or two for each hour of OT completed. There is training here for different tiers of accounts you work but you have to wait for it to be dolled out, I cant just ask and be trained and get paid more. 

The amount of work is exhausting, though. There are people dropping like flies as well because it's so exhausting. Working 12 hr days twice in a week is exhausting. 

My sister keeps harassing me to find something better. And I'm trying. I've updated my resume to make it sound more professional. My sister said to start looking for jobs that pay 60k + and I'm finding that difficult. Everything I've found for around that marker either is sales only walking from door to door or it required a degree (which I dont have even though I have loads of exp) 

It's extremely disheartening and discouraging. Recently applied to Wholefoods where the listed jobs say they start at 56k/73k and higher only come to find out that's bogus and my application was scrapped because I put down compensation for 20.00-25.00. How is that unrealistic? 

I'm so overworked at my current job even though it's secure. My dad said to not find another job because we have a recession going on that apparently will be getting worse. I'm at a loss, though. 

Im desperate for a better job. I am trying to work on my art to get something going there but this job's OT hours are making me exhausted to the point I cant even focus on anything else except getting proper rest (sometimes we have to do OT from 11pm-3am instead of morning hours) and I work from 2:30pm-10:30pm at this time. 

Am I just better off staying  in this job position where I'm at even though I'm beyond exhausted, sleep all the time because of hours worked with little pay, no life whatsoever because I'm working 10:30am/2:30pm-10:30pm every 5 days and not everyone of my friends have off on Wed/Thur, no work/life balance whatsoever?

I'm so exhausted that I'm starting to have health problems that were not there before, insomnia, depression, even asthma is getting aggravated because of the stress. 

Is it better to stay here in this shit hole? I kinda have to unless I find something better. 

I read an article about a guy who lied on his resume and went from a menial low paying job where he was always depressed, suicidal to now having a 65,000 job with supplemental pay. Is it better to lie on your resume to find a better job?

I'm just genuinely afraid of what may happen to me if I stay in this shithole that I'm currently in any longer. 

Please be kind. All I ask."

I am hoping to get advice. I joined a company about a month ago - they are in Health tech and on paper I thought I was getting my dream job. I had 9 interviews and asked all of the questions about work/life balance, culture, how they viewed my role etc. 

I was told all of the right answers to my questions before joining but am quite unhappy and don't feel like anyone I've met is really happy in their role/with the company. At 1 month in, I'm already getting 6-8 meetings a day, and even though it's supposed to be a 'start up' I think my boss is more corporate America than anything. I'm a Director level and a people manager and I think his expectations are totally unreasonable (expecting massive projects to be done when I'm not even onboarded/haven't even met all of the stakeholders) and the pacing + gauntlet of meetings already feel like a miserable red flag. The TC is great but that's about the only thing I've enjoyed. Has anyone stuck it out and been happy they did? Is it better to leave sooner vs later? Would love to hear thoughts. I'm not going to worry about putting this on a resume or anything and I have another (lower paying) offer I could go with, but would love to hear other experiences. 

I'm hopeful with time I could make this a more bearable experience by laying boundaries but often orgs with toxic expectations and too many meetings to accomplish anything have to be changed as a whole not just one person opting out and trying to create a better environment"

As you may know, inflation is rising all over the world. Some colleagues in other countries keep getting adjustments during the year, but I didn't get any (I'm fairly new to the company but my salary was fixed over a year ago). Now I want to negotiate a salary adjustment and keep it clear that this is not a raise in the sense that if it matches inflation, I'm not getting any extra salary, but recovering some purchase power.

I asked about this in local reddit and Facebook groups but it seems local people are abut naive and don't understand the impact of inflation. Some even justified that the company should compensate for this (like they didn't raise the cost of their services and products). Some just seem a bit passive and just seem not to be willing to negotiate salary adjustments. So I'm here to get advice on negotiating this from people with more experience.

Other than mentioning the current inflation index number (8.7%), any other suggestions."

Since I've been desperate to get a job again I interviewed for a local government job and I felt like I did pretty good. The position was for a data analyst but to my dismay I was rejected.

This was the company's feedback:

""Feedback from recruiting manager:¬†Had some good polished answers, needed more context in real life situations. We require data driven individuals and a lot of answers lacked referral back to live data. Interviewers felt that you were lacking insight of the services delivered by our company""

The information below outlines why I totally did not disagreed with them saying ""Interviewers felt that you were lacking insight of the services delivered by our company""

When they asked about live data my answer was ""personally I haven't worked with live data as most of my reports are based on static information however I do understand that in a constantly evolving world of data, data can be used in a dynamic format and updated automatically such as linking though cloud technologies""

The interviewer said ""great that seems you know about live data""

Now the i realised the problem started when it was my turn to ask the questions post interview. I've found that a great question to ask interviewers is ""what's your favourite thing about working at x company""

They replied ""I don't think that's an appropriate question as I should be asking you that as the recruiter"". First red flag.

Second thing. I had a week to prep and I researched the shit out of the company. Read their annual reports etc. One of their visions on their website was ""develop our teams through continuous support""

I asked what they can do to support me as a new member of the organisation, they said ""sorry that's old information, we have a new steering committee so we can't give you a proper answer"" to which I replied ""I apologise and I was only referring to the information on the website"". Second read flag

I then asked about what the company is doing to support the local residents in the area and asked about the current kpi, which on the website was stated at 73 percent satisfaction. They replied with ""sorry that's old information the current satisfaction rate is 43 percent"" to which I replied ""I apologise and was only referring to the information on the website"". Another red flag

The company is 1 star on glassdoor. List of their cons from glassdoor. 

""Cons

The company is all a mess at the moment with all good staff leaving due to being mistreated and being undervalued. Due to all longstanding staff and management leaving the company is in disarray.

Residents of the local area are mistreated so they target you, you‚Äôre advised to take your lanyard off when you go out of the office.

The company don‚Äôt care about staff at all and have a ‚Äúagile‚Äù working policy which completely defies the principle, staff are forced to come in but asked not to sit next to each other or meet in person. 

Cons

Bullying and gaslighting.
Incredibly high staff turnover.
Suspicious and illogical relations with contractors.
Buck-passing culture.
Did not trust our HR team to address concerns things with integrity.
Poor health and safety culture
Racially-tinged bullying.
Poor compensation package.
Blurred work / life balance.""

Recently, I had a change of heart after volunteering at a camp for children/adults with neuromuscular disorders. I want to move in that direction, as it is more fulfilling for to be with that community. Rather than me hating my life as my soul gets sucked away in my cubicle 24/7.

I feel tied to my job for the duration of the program. But at the same time, life is too short to waste years doing something that I hate.

Should I just suck it up, get some work experience, then switch over to the non-profit? Or I should I try to find something more fulfilling right now. I will appreciate any advice, thank you!"

I was able to get a few jobs during the summer, but none of them lasted very long. Now it seems most of the jobs in my area have completely dried up, well there‚Äôs job out there, but none that I‚Äôd be able to get. Most of them want experience(correction, pretty much all) or they want you to have a degree. I keep putting in applications, but I guess I‚Äôm not alone in this situation, since there‚Äôs usually like 50-100 applicants to one job posting. 

It‚Äôs a tough time for employment. Which is crazy because last year jobs were like a dime a dozen, now I put in an application, and usually have to wait almost 2-3 weeks just to get a rejection email. 

My family doesn‚Äôt understand the job market. My mom has been at the same workplace for over ten years, my brother has connections so he‚Äôs no worried. Then my extended family wants to chime in, they‚Äôre from a very very small community, and they don‚Äôt understand why I don‚Äôt have a job, they say it‚Äôs super easy to get hired. Well maybe for them it is in a small town, but even me living in a smallish town of 30k is having tough times. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because all I have is my diploma and have no experience, but not even the jobs that don‚Äôt require it I can‚Äôt hear back from. Applied to the fast food restaurants that mainly high school students work at, McDonald‚Äôs, Dairy Queen, Taco Bell, even Burger King; and it‚Äôs just radio silence, not even a rejection email, it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt even look at the applications. 

My family just says I‚Äôm lazy and don‚Äôt want to work, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt apply yourself‚Äù, is that some sort of pun? All I‚Äôve been doing is applying myself. They tell me I need to get out there and get some experience under my belt, like how? Even the entry level jobs require experience, how can you even get experience when your the job that people take to get experience? 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs on one of those job board websites or in person paper applications, I end up getting ghosted by the hiring managers, then get a rejection email from them if it‚Äôs online saying I don‚Äôt have the relevant experience or skills needed. Like, high school didn‚Äôt prepare me for this shit bud.

I was laid off in July. I had a vacation planned for October to visit my grandma in Los Angeles.

I‚Äôve been applying for jobs not really expecting to get an offer any time soon.

I had an in person interview that went well and I received a call from the recruiter and he said that he will set up a time for me to meet with the founder of the company next week.

Idk if they will put out an offer but just in case I have good luck, what should I tell the recruiter.


It‚Äôs my grandma‚Äôs 80th birthday. We will be surprising her. 


In the past I‚Äôve had employers says okay to me taking a week off and coming back. This day and age, anything can happen and I‚Äôve heard of offers being rescinded quickly or when people wait and delay their start date."

I recently got a call about a position I applied to, so great, but the location is an hour and a half away. I politely noted that I would prefer a phone interview due to the distance and my current overnight work schedule to talk about the initial details about the position since no details were listed in the description.The hiring manager ignores that and suggest 9am on a weekday for an in-person meeting. 

I want to be polite and not burn the bridge, but I'm also not risking getting into an accident driving for 2 hours after a night shift for a interview for a dead end lead.

1) We're a small team of 8 people in IT field (mostly web design and coding)

2) There is a coworker (f, 27), who constantly behaves way outside of working etiquette. Primarily, this shows in her cussing absolutely all the time in our meetings, saying edgy things about people from other teams in our company, talking super loud (probably a matter of attention seeking), fake-laughing all the time with ugly artificial laugh, asking people edgy questions, doing edgy assumptions and more.

3) Most of the team are females and from what I can tell, they tolerate her behaviour cause, quoting, ""she is such a person"". 

I could never understand how someone like that can coexist with the whole team of professionals with a very strong soft skills knowledge, but here we are. 

The boiling point was when she asked one of my working friends if she's not pregnant in front of everyone. As the matter of fact my friend was not and had no visible signs of pregnancy. That said, the question on its own is extremely rude and made me and my friend cringe and feel very uncomfortable. Not sure about others, but I would not be surprised if they just got used to this shitshow and don't care anymore. I also reckon, if it was a man in her shoes, he would be sitting in HR office already.

Tl;Dr I got fed up with my coworker who creates unhealthy work environment for so long and reported the incident to our direct manager. I decided to shut all the biases and mentioned only the situation with inappropriate question to a coworker. I also consulted to close friends from different big companies who work on managing roles and 100% of people I asked confirmed that it's extremely rude of her no matter how you approach the situation. 

What do you think, please share your thoughts. Any stories from experience are welcome. Thanks."

\- The lenght of the interviews is also inflating 30-40 minutes should be the maximum - yet I had interviews that went for over an hour.

\- Some of the questions are getting ridiculous as well. Like ""What is your favorite joke"" or ""If you were a fictional character who would you be"" - really? Did you read this in some seminar? These questions are just ridiculous and dont really tell anything about the person you are interviewing.

Worked at a mall like 9 miles from home and I was looking for growth opportunities within my company so I got it and I was willing to travel for it so I ended up at a location 30 miles away. It‚Äôs about 45mins-1hr drive each way. Usually an hour because there‚Äôs always traffic. The lure for me was they told me the manager of this location plans to retire in a few months and I would be ‚Äúnext in line‚Äù to quote the District manager. Sounds like a sweet deal.

I do an amazing job at my location. I have brought up the performance of the store. There‚Äôs data to prove it. Maybe too good because my manager has not liked me from day one. It‚Äôs like night and day. My previous manager loved me and was my biggest supporter. This manager actively tried to make me look bad. Even did some gaslighting techniques and told me I was doing something wrong when I wasn‚Äôt.

I gave her maNy chances to redeem herself. She hasn‚Äôt said one positive comment the entire time I‚Äôve been there since February! I‚Äôve been venting to my previous manager about all of the emotionally abusive things that have happened towards me. He told me to talk to the big manager. I did. She apologized to me for what I‚Äôve experienced.

She also ended up interviewing me for the position and she likes me. Long story short she hired another candidate with more retail experience. I find out that this person has worked w her in the paSt. At this point I‚Äôm livid because I‚Äôve been dealing w abuse for the hopes of the promotion and I Did not get it. All the district manager said was I hope you stay. I just said ‚Äúok‚Äù not yea or no. If you wanted me to stay you would pay for me to. Getting 16 an hour which is a joke in itself to be an assistant because min wage a few miles away is now 16. I‚Äôm applying to as many jobs as possible.

Alternatively would be a non business job that can do the same thing that I could work for a year or two while looking.  I can pay for my own plane ticket plus phone and a few other things and saving takes a lot of time with what's currently available to me here.

I know it's unlikely but maybe someone knows something(anything) I can do that will get me back in the US with something stable so I can at least begin looking for a career long term"

For context I got employed at a pharmaceutical company (PC), it‚Äôs an 8am-4pm Monday to Friday with 2 days at home &amp; 3 days (of my choosing) in office, they hired me for full time. I start next week. 

My friend recently referred me to a job at  a bank (BJ) that is completely remote with the exception of going into the office once a month, this job is open from 8am-8pm Monday to Saturday (they close at 4:30 on sat) and they also want me full time and the pay is 3$ more than the pharmaceutical company. I start in November (2 months from now so I‚Äôll be fully trained and settled in at the pharmaceutical company by then).

Both jobs have extremely good benefits, pay is really good for the work load and the companies are known for taking good care of their employees.

Now here‚Äôs my dilemma; would it be possible for me to somehow split the hours so that I can work full time for both? 
My plan is having the earliest starting shifts at PC, doing my 8 hours five days a week there (so 8-4pm M-F) and THEN doing my remote job at BJ, starting earlier there on the days I‚Äôm not in office at PC.

Both jobs are very flexible schedule wise and they‚Äôre similar as well, at PC I would mostly be writing emails &amp; taking a handful of calls and at BJ it would be mainly calls.

Why not just leave PC and go to BJ full time since the pay is better? Truthfully, there‚Äôs a lot of room for growth at PC and it‚Äôs a very well known company in Canada (the office building is stunning). Also, I was planning on getting myself a second job regardless, Im not in school and I want to use my free time building experience and grinding, Im fully able to work 80h weeks at my age, especially if it‚Äôs mainly remote. 

I don‚Äôt think asking PC to match BJ after 2 months of working there will come off well and I don‚Äôt want to quit either for BJ so both options are mostly not being considered.

Any advice would be appreciated:)"

Any advice will be a great help for me to move forward. :(

The last first week of August, I decided to resign from my first job to try and explore different opportunities and seek career growth. Then on my last day, my department gave me a very heartwarming farewell party (they had farewell messages and gifts). Afterward, I started my 2nd job which I did not expect to be worse like the office environment is worse, my workmates had this attitude and I don't feel myself in that company because it is 100% different from what I expected and talked about and different from my previous job. That first week at my new company caused me sleepless nights and anxiety. I cried every night and really regret my decision. Then before the week ends, I submit a resignation letter to my new job and explain to them why I quit... They accepted it wholeheartedly and move on with our life.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got home, I messaged my previous supervisor...

&amp;#x200B;

I was close to my previous supervisor in my previous job like we were like friends so I told him about what was really happening in my life at that moment, then as we speak, I find the time and gut to ask if I could go back (because technically my resignation is not yet effective and I'm just on terminal leave while on my new job). I'm so frightened to ask that question because I think it has 1% chance for them to accept me again... He told me that he will tell my upper bosses and will message me early in the morning with the bosses' decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Then morning came... I was really really anxious waking up.

&amp;#x200B;

I got a message from my previous supervisor...

&amp;#x200B;

He told me to go to the office as soon as possible so they can retract my resignation from HR and process it which means my supervisor and upper bosses wanted me back... again. :(

I went to the office, talked to my bosses about what happened then they gave me advice and everything. I processed my retraction to continue my work on them and they now put me in a different department because they still considered the reason why I quit in the first place. After all, I wanted different work in everyday life, so they gave me a new department to work on.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm back in my previous company with a different department this upcoming Monday. I'm so glad that they still reconsidered me.

It's just been a stressful month for me because it all happened this August :(

I don't know, some part of me tells that I should've not gone back but the other side tells me that  *""yes, you're lucky you still have a job and don't need to find a new one""*  and at some point, I felt that I shouldn't went back here because I'm just really felt embarrassed to show my face to them :(( What should I do? Or How can I work there without hesitations because of the gifts and Despedida my old department had before for me?

It's just been so stressful :( 

What advice you can give me to do my best for my previous company with a different dept?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much."

I got a job interview this week for a job in my field (1 interview out of 40 application in 2 months). I'm currently working in a supermarket in Canada near minimum wage and I'm trying to get out of here, not because I don't like it (I like people I work with), but I want to improve my quality of life with a higher salary.

Whatever, during the interview, the person said she is also happening a position for a part-time evening/weekend for almost the same position I applied to which was full time. I said I was also interested, just to not get out of the list.

Today I got the answer I was accepted for this part-time position with a lower salary than the full-time (but still higher than what I do right now). However, I'm in a dilemma of acceptation.

Pros:

* Can get experience in my field
* Work from home

Cons:

* Will need to have two jobs again (I did two times in the past and I'm so tired of it. It steal all my free time of working, working and working).
* Still not enough to get an apartment where I live, so still live with family
* Need to organize my life around working two jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

A part of me need this experience to get better opportunity later which require 5+ years, but having two jobs is exhausting AF.

What should I do?

Is it correct to accept and still look for other opportunities elsewhere or will they be pissed of me leaving so fast?

PS: They re-posted the full-time job position online."

For anyone unfamiliar with the law surrounding minors working, the minimum age to be employed without and special permits from the gov allowing me to work at those places is 15, I'm 15.

Now as you could probably gather, I have little to no clue what I'm doing, but its been a week and I thought a couple of places would have at least said something? Again I really have no clue what the average time of response is for this stuff.

Also for anyone familiar with the law here, would I be less likely to be chosen because the standard in most other provinces is 16 so the companies are just setup like that for here to?

I'm a relatively new teacher, and my co-teacher has been teaching for 25 years. Early last week, my boss told me I had to get rid of the behavior management system I had been using all summer when the school year began. I stood up for it and sent her an email with the reasons I thought we should keep it, but she put her foot down and said I had to get rid of it. It felt very micromanagey and did not sit well with me. It upset me enough that I dusted off my resume.

I applied to a company that I received an offer from back in May, but I chose my current job over them. I guess because I had interviewed with them a few months ago, they did not make me interview again and sent me an offer immediately. They offered me 18.00/hr, I make 17.50 currently. I asked if they could go any higher to give me more incentive to leave. They came back with a new offer of 20.00/hr. I did the math and I'd be taking home an extra hundred dollars per week at the new job. This job would also be lead Pre-K teacher, and it is only a few minutes further away than where I work currently. I have an interview with another center next week, but I'd be surprised if they were able to offer me that much money.

My mentor told me ""better the devil you know"" and that I should stay at my current job to learn from a ""master teacher"". But that was when they offer was still 18.00/hr, I'd have to see what she says now that it's so much higher.

My thought is to see if my current center can match their offer. I think if all other things were equal, I'd like to stay. My job has a posting for another Pre-K teacher (not to replace me, we need another Pre-K teacher as we're very short staffed), and the listed salary is 16-20/hr, so I know 20 is in their range. However, I have to be prepared that they might say no. But if they can't match it, I feel like I have to follow the money.

One last thing I'm concerned about is that I was at my previous two centers for six months each, and I'd be leaving this center after only three months. I'm concerned leaving another job so soon might look bad on my resume.

So what do you think? Is there any information not in this post you think I should gather before I make a decision? I'm planning the call the director of the center I have an offer from next week to ask her some questions. What do you think I should ask?"

I just update it with new info as needed. 

Recently a friend told me that their company was hiring and I decided to apply because they do some pretty interesting stuff there. I was going to submit the handcrafted one, but noticed that the Indeed one had results of all the little Indeed quizzes I‚Äôve done over the years. Some of them I‚Äôm pretty proud of because they required a fair amount of critical thinking for a little quiz and I did well on them. 

I don‚Äôt think I can copy paste that onto my handcrafted resume because it would look weird and there would be no way for them to know that the information is valid. 

The Indeed resume is kinda ugly and has no personality, but it has those quiz scores. 

I‚Äôm considering three options:

1. Don‚Äôt use the Indeed resume, use the handcrafted one, add a cover letter
2. Use the Indeed resume and leave out the handcrafted one, add a cover letter
3. Edit the Indeed resume to basically just have the quiz scores and upload the handcrafted resume along with the cover letter

my bio? here is just a understanding of what i am capable of:

In high school i got science rewards and did Chem II and Physics. I'm not good at simple math though (yes very ironic i know). I have a pretty good understanding of mechanics and have done some decently complicated things hardest being a timing belt change, and timing adjustment. I have been told by many people i am a great driver and have drove many hours in multiple states, and different conditions (on/off road, snow, sand, rock). Can drive a stick shift and would love to have someone give me CDL training and could easily drive trucks. I also have detailed since i was 15 and have lots of experience with cars and motorcycles. I have sold 5 vehicles and 2 motorcycles and have gained money on each one. I have also managed to do some electrical work. My dad has worked oil and gas his whole life and i have helped him out with that a lot too, so i have much better idea than the general public at the least. 

Sum of skills:

Mechanics, Driving, Sales, Science

&amp;#x200B;

Story first to get full grasp of what is happening. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I live in WV, there is not much here, I was working at a shit factory (only place hiring in my area) and got moved into a better position, well 2 weeks ago on my lunch i ended up falling asleep (while eating) cause i worked my ass off. I had gotten there at 5AM that day and weed eated (weed wacked what ever you want to call it) a whole hill till 12 (lunch) so i set down and started eating. Next thing i know im being woke up by a higher up nudging me. fired me on the spot and didn't even give me a chance to explain. and he threw the biggest red mark on my resume as he could. For the record i had not been in trouble once and the reason that i had been moved up was because i had worked hard and was recognized and they wanted me to be more productive outside the factory instead of watching plastic pipe all day as it spooled up on machinery, so they put me outside to keep the place clean and moving.

Since then nobody has listened to my applications and i have been shot down everywhere, Walmart, Lowes, Dominion energy, State road, everywhere has just never got back, cause i got fired and im just mad at this point. nobody even listens. Yes i dress nice, i have full set of teeth, I'm clean, got trimmed hair, I'm clean shaven, I swear i am as attentive and well mannered, as possible at interviews (as well as at work), i answer everything whole heartedly. and most are interested till they ask why i am not working, then tell them about my firing, and some have ended interview there. others just don't get back to me, it is a full on wall i have hit, that has ruined me. 

 The best part is, my parents don't know yet, I have been changing oil and doing basic repairs to people's cars to get just enough money to keep my bank at a solid 5000$, and i only have a 220$ car payment to do each month so not so hard really but stressful. If they find out they will probably kick me out cause they were wanting me gone but were willing to let me stay while i saved money for house. now that im not doing that and just scraping by im not sure what they will do honestly. 

So here i am, a 19-year-old guy in a town living with my parents, with no job within 40 miles of me other than Mc Donalds. And i now have a shit smear on my resume, what the hell am i going to do.

 I just need someone to offer me a job, I'd take Jane Lew or Weston/Buchannon, anywhere semi close to Gilmer County. I've got good transportation, and I'm willing to work and learn, i really need someone with some contacts in WV please. I don't know what else to do even if people here just have some contacts so someone who can get me in somewhere please I'm desperate at this point. 

I can move but it will be hard cause my friend has a kid coming and we had planned on me staying around to be able to help him if his girlfriend and him were going to be able to keep it, so what is one to do with that looming over them as well? im just trapped at this point and i hate the feeling that it is bringing, to the point of me to hop on reddit and ask for people on reddit for advice, cause that has always worked out so well for others."

I've just graduated with a Bachelor of Biomedical Science from Monash University. I have my graduation ceremony later this month.

It was a tough degree because I was initially doing a Biomed/Engineering double degree, my parents wouldn't let me drop engineering when I wanted to stop, and by the time I left home and dropped it, my grades were down a lot and it made my degree take 4.5 years. As such I've come out of uni after 4.5 years with a ~62 WAM (my engineering classes are counted in my WAM unfortunately - I did well in almost all my biomed subjects). I'm in Victoria, Australia.

I'm very open to different career paths at the moment. Am happy to continue in the bio/health related field, or diversify to somthing like business, accounting, marketing - basically anything that will get me a job.

I'm aware I most likely have to study another degree to land a decent ""career"" job. Just wondering if anyone knows of any good graduate programs or ideas for other degrees I could study to help me get a good job afterwards? Anything with lots of opportunities.

I'm aware that Dan Andrews made it free to study nursing/midwifery courses and other health-related courses in 2023. Would choosing a career in that direction be a good idea (in terms of job opportunities)? I'm very interested in the field, so I'd definitely love a career in it. Just want to make sure it has a good work/life balance though.

Would love any advice! Thanks heaps in advance:)"

I need some suggestions related to my dealing with my coordinator.  

8 Months ago I applied for a teaching job. I got that job.  For 2 days my coordinator was good with me. Slowly and steadily, I have seen her behavior change with me. Here I will mention, that she also receives the same degree which I have. Earlier, she used to teach the same subject but then she became a coordinator.  

Every time she said, students are not happy with me. I resigned from my job. After 1 day I received my Principal's call and we had a zoom meeting She was really good. She encouraged me a lot. Due to her motivation, I rejoined. Initially, the coordinator was showing good behavior but again she becomes furious while seeing me. She seems insecure. Yesterday, she introduced everyone to the function, when my name came she said all the faculty should introduce themselves. Secondly, I made a document and shared it with her. Instead of considering me, she appreciated another colleague. At one point during the function, Coincidently, I had eye contact with her, she was staring at me so violently. In her presence, my whole energy level drains. During meetings, she tries to mock me if I ask any questions. Even on Facebook, she tagged everyone except my group of people.  

Literally, I am confused. I am putting all my efforts but again I become hesitant while coming to my wworkplace  

Any suggestions would be appreciated.  

Thank you"

\- Applied to the few I've found across many different industries, but no interview offers.

My parents don't understand my position or how the job market is like right now. They think just because I have a college degree, I should be able to find a job. They'd be happy with me working *any* job at this point, even minimum wage jobs. They think I'm ""shooting too high"" - when I'm simply applying for jobs that require a bachelor's degree, $40k\~ positions... Nothing too high. I'm not applying to Big4, IB, or large corporations that are super competitive to get into! Just regular companies of varying sizes...

I'm near just about to apply to minimum-wage jobs, just so I can at least *have* a job until I can find a better one.... Two months into searching, and nothing.

Where are the companies that are willing to train new graduates? Do they all want years of experience? How can we get experience if no one is willing to hire us in the first place??

I am 28(soon to be 29),unemployed,living at home and claiming benefits. I have been put on a horticulture course i am not really into as part of a scheme but it gives me a bit of time to try to plan out my future. I am currently living in a small town in Ireland and feel like I have been living in a rut for years. The big 30 is looming and I feel a sense of dread imagining il be on benifits for the rest of my life.

I have worked a few jobs over the years such as a security guard, leisure attendent, shop assistant but none of them stuck. I am planning to go to get a uni degree in 2023 as a mature student, as I never really had the opportunity to do this before. Up until now i feel i have wasted my life playing videogames and sitting on my ass. I really do want to change.

So I have been looking into a few different careers and i have come up with two paths that interest me

1: ***Software Dev*** (Been doing a few online courses, but can start a degree next year)

2: ***Something to do with a trade or renewable energy*** (3 year apprentiship)

These are a few ideas I have had but really I am open to **anything**. I would like a career with good pay and good opportunites for advancement. I am also more then willing to leave Ireland if somewhere has better opportunites.

But I have rambled on enough. My question is, what would be a good career for a 30 year old to get into which would involve me having a degree?, or perhaps you know a good one that ***Does not*** need a degree?.

And also, please comment any career reccomendations,Your comment may the thing that starts off my journey.

Thanks in advance everybody."

But generally in my line of work, hours are flexible. At my previous job in the same work line of work, we used to put 9-5 as a template in our job postings but had people working when it fit their schedules within reason. 

I really wish I could ask if the hours are flexible before putting in the work to apply... But either I try, or just abandon the idea. It's a senior-enough position that I could see them being flexible with hours, but I have no way to tell if they actually are."

What should she do?,u/Burlington80,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x5ojc3/my_wife_got_demoted_what_should_she_do/,jobs,"My wife works in the human resources department at a university. Our family health insurance is through her job since I am self employed. About a month ago, her manager had to call her into his office since IT had noticed she had checked some co-workers‚Äô salaries using her computer which she was not authorized to do. Out of nervousness she initially denied it, but then the next day, thanks to the excellent advice of many people here in r/jobs, she came clean and got to keep her job. The manager thanked her for coming forward and for saving him the time of having to further investigate. That post is here- https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/wf3eje/can_my_wife_get_fired_for_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

Last week, however, a woman who my wife works with was promoted, and the manager told my wife that she now needs to take on all of the co-worker‚Äôs old duties and, in addition, that she needs to continue being responsible for the work that my wife has been doing up until now. 

In addition to that, he told my wife that she can no longer have two remote days per week, but can only have one. The other ten or so employees in her department all get two remote days, and this was one of the reasons my wife wanted the job in the first place. The ability to work remote that extra day is very helpful for her rest (since she can get up later because of not needing to drive to work) and her ability to be able to make sure my daughter gets to school. My daughter has ongoing medical treatment so changes in our lifestyle like this, which add stress, can potentially have a significant impact.

The third change her manager made was to require her to come to work a half hour earlier each day which also of-course affects her ability to get rest (her overall work hours are the same since she can leave a half hour earlier, but she‚Äôd prefer to come later). Finally, he moved her working space to a less desirable area in the corner.

Should she have a discussion with her manager about this? If so, how can she do it tactfully and what should she say? Could this be punishment for the checking other peoples‚Äô salaries incident? I don‚Äôt want her to sound ungrateful for being able to keep her job, but also don‚Äôt want her to be subjected to something she doesn‚Äôt have to be. Can she ask him, for example, if this is all temporary? Can she ask for a raise in light of this? Should she even agree to all this?

Thanks!"

2,2022-09-04,Tempted to give up‚Ä¶,u/PyroBob316,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x5r7uk/tempted_to_give_up/,jobs,"Last night I spent a solid five hours, again, searching for jobs to apply to. I earned a master‚Äôs degree in 2016, but I‚Äôve yet to find a job that even remotely puts it to use.

The main hurdle, among god knows what else, is that I‚Äôm disabled. I can read, write, walk, and talk, and my brain works just fine. I‚Äôve had multiple spinal operations and open-heart surgeries that prevent me from doing any kind of labor for a living.

I live in Kansas, and I‚Äôve grown so tired of rejection here that I started looking in other states (a dozen or so, so far). I‚Äôll read through hundreds of listings a night, but I end up applying for fewer than 5% of those I‚Äôm actually able to do, because nearly every one of them **requires** applicants who already have 3-5 years experience.

At this point I‚Äôd gladly take an accounting position in town for $15/hr, or relocate for twice that (stability is important and all), even though I hate accounting. The only call I‚Äôve had in three months turned out to be a door to door sales scheme.

My degrees are focused on business management, specifically in the manufacturing industry. Despite what we were all told going in, those companies apparently aren‚Äôt just hiring people with degrees; they want people who spend five years on the assembly line, then eventually 2-5 years doing exactly the job description they‚Äôve already listed. Being physically disabled and 35, I don‚Äôt have that ten years to toil away in a labor position while praying someone notices I‚Äôm qualified for more. 

I‚Äôm at my breaking point here. Maybe someone here can just drop some information about a professional who can rewrite my r√©sum√©, though I‚Äôve already revised the thing to match other ‚Äúexpert recommendations‚Äù several times. 

I‚Äôm frustrated. I‚Äôm at a loss. I‚Äôm close to believing that there‚Äôs just some kind of black list I‚Äôm on for reasons I‚Äôm not allowed to know.

From here, what do I do?"

I have been contracted out by a recruiting agency to work for the IT Support team at a local company. I am treated like an hourly employee expected to work 40 hours a week however I like. 

Now I am in sort of a tough situation. Every 2-3 years during usually July, my family goes overseas to visit extended family (grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc.) since we have no family in the USA and normally when  we go it is for about 4-5 week. Since our family is older they need help and it is always exhausting to not be surrounded by family and only get to see them every few years. 

With me being a contract worker I do not know how I can communicate  this to my manager since I assume the company I work for (the client) paid the recruiter (the company who owns my rights and pays me hourly) a commission. I just feel so stuck and not sure what to do. I wouldn‚Äôt get paid by the recruiter since I am hourly and don‚Äôt have PTO until I work for a year and that is ok with me. But could the client terminate me because of this. Maybe I can negotiate working longer hours to make up for lost time. I really don‚Äôt know. I am planning to ask around January 2023 before purchasing any tickets.

I just started this position in August and the trip wouldn‚Äôt be until July 2023 but that would technically be within the 1 year contract.

Any advice about recruitment contracting, time off, and abroad vacations would be appreciated. This position is contract to hire so I am trying my best and giving the best impressions I can up to this point."

I‚Äôm really done with it. I could stay in insurance but since most insurance jobs are customer-facing, I might need to get out of it entirely. I just don‚Äôt have the personality for customer service and I burn out quickly. I just started a new job 6 months ago and I‚Äôm already over it. 

I have a bachelor‚Äôs in psychology and a minor in biology. My employment history includes office admin, retail, and claims adjuster for short-term disability and currently for property claims. 

What I want: decent pay (currently making around $57k, so in this neighborhood is ideal), flexibility (such as ability to work alternative schedules like 4 10s), and a lack of being chained to a desk all day (I‚Äôm fine with desk jobs but I mean I don‚Äôt want someone breathing down my neck constantly). And of course not customer facing. 

What I like: solving problems, working with teams or independently, coming up with ideas and solutions, reading, writing, editing, research, investigating, and animals/the environment. 

What I don‚Äôt like or want: lots of heavy math (however, I was great with statistics in school), micromanagement, intense deadlines, fast-paced work, consistently high levels of stress, constantly having to be on the phone, long durations of intense schooling (ex. I don‚Äôt plan on getting a PhD in the future). 

Careers I have considered for one reason or another: pilot (I love planes and have taken lessons before), forest ranger, UI/UX design, software engineer, web design/development, editor, copywriter, photographer, and countless others but those are the main ones. 

I like the idea of freelance work, but I know it has it‚Äôs drawbacks. I‚Äôve tried learning coding, but didn‚Äôt enjoy it and could not wrap my mind around JavaScript. I am also considering staying in insurance but trying to get an underwriting position or something similar. 

I‚Äôm not expecting to find my passion. I simply want a job that doesn‚Äôt make me want to put my fist through a wall at the end of every day. Any suggestions?"

I‚Äôm a 19 yrs old international student in a decent uni in Sydney. I‚Äôm studying full time but also a part time cook in a nice restaurant. Due to the short staffed situation in Sydney, I‚Äôm needed for more hours, which leads to a bit burn out. And also, in a near future, my gf is moving to another city, I want to visit her every other weekend and it is kind of hard for me to have days off on weekends since I‚Äôm very much needed on those busy days. And by no mean this is a bad job, I really love it, the owners are really nice, they are very understanding about my study, they give me breakfast and dinner even on days I‚Äôm not working, and in return, I also feels the need to help them since they are 60+ and still working 365 days/year. The only reason I want to move on from this job is because if I stay, I will feels the need to put in more hours to help them and also it is not a contribution to my experience as a software engineer student.

I want to hear some advice from you guys on how I should progress my career?
I was looking for remote job that I could do while I‚Äôm traveling and I found mostly customer service, is it a good job?
I‚Äôm also wondering if there is any remote job or job with more flexibility hour that is related to the career path of software engineering? (I‚Äôm a second year student but I‚Äôve learned programming a while ago by myself, I know a little bit of Python, Java, Js, git, sql (in case any HR in here))

Financial considerations:
My family is doing pretty well financially so my tuition fee is taken care of. I also live on allowance of 1.5k/month include rent (I actually use around 1.3k if I don‚Äôt make any big purchases). So I spent 3 quarters of my paychecks on investing and the rest just savings for travel or buying some nice things. So I don‚Äôt really need a big paycheck however I do love to have savings to travel here and there

So I am fresher who graduated last year. I honestly dk what I was doing after graduating. Ive been so lost and depressed for so long now. I wanted to do something but kept failing. It felt like im working on it but i just kept working on it and never achieved anything  or learnt anything and nothing really worked out for me because I get so confused about what am I doing.

In 2020, I was in my second year and I was looking for remote internships. Everyone was doing it who was around my age and they woukd get selected. I would apply to many, most would reject me, some would reach out to me but still after all the hard work there was no outcome because I would give up at the end ykwim. Like they would give me tasks and stuff and some I would even complete but no response for them  and this had been going on since 3 yrs including my hunt for  jobs as well. 

So I just wasted my 4 yrs like this till today. I was so done w this shit and I was extremely desperate to get a job this time. I have been applying to multiple companies since June. Gave many interviews but got rejected. I always felt like I lack skills for my job profile but if i wont fake it I wouldn't make it and i kept faking it tbh.

My interviews were  sooo bad because I just dont know how converse properly with anyone except my mom dad and brother. I am an extremely introverted person but also super anxious socially. My body language is lame. 

So yea sorry I lost track of the conversation I gave an interview. The company is in a very big city of my country where I was not aiming to get a job at all cuz its hella expensive and life is fast paced and ppl are extremely talented and competitive but I was applying blindly to jobs cuz I was desperate. 

I was not expecting it but cuz the interview did not go well but i got a call that I am selected 3 hrs later of the interview.

I feel like earlier I was desperate now im anxious. I feel like what if my skills are not good enough and what if I fuck it up. They mentioned in offer letter that they can terminate me in a month if they did not like my work and i can do the same. I am so scared I feel like I lack skills and idk if ill be able to do it. I wanna be good sooo  bad and I want to get exposure in life cuz im from a very small town. I haven't experienced anything in life and my college was so bad.

But my question is how am i supposed to act in office. Idk how to talk with people and idk what am I supposed to do. Once i went to give an interview I was so awkward and clumsy I was not able to sit properly on a normal  chair cuz the HR was standing in front of my face.

For a month its a remote job but I am scared what If I mess it up in the first month cuz no one will be here to correct me but I am also happy I wont have to talk with ppl for a month.

My first day is tomorrow i am excited but nervous too. Pls I would really appreciate some advices and sorry for long post

Also they are paying me very low compensation for the city I am going to. I would be thankful if I will be able to pay my rent with that salary which seems a bit impossible. Ive been advised by my cousin to look for better opportunities while working for them or ask for increasing salary in 3 months. Even tho its entry level job some ppl telling its too low for it as well. I  am just grateful that they selected me tho. What should I do"

Actually, I never liked working in customer service but was forced due to my circumstances. 

I hate wearing a uniform, like I‚Äôm back in school, hate to wear a name badge just for everyone to see my god damn name. 
I don‚Äôt even address my customers as ‚ÄúSir‚Äù or ‚ÄúMam‚Äù, and hate the idea of ‚Äúserving‚Äù someone, it just hurts my self esteem. I‚Äôm really looking forward to an office or remote job one day where I can feel like an actual professional, or maybe even open my own business, and escape from this vicious trap. 

Does anyone else feel the same?"

Due to some burnout and wanting to take a break from fast food, I put in a two weeks notice a couple days ago after I got a job offer from Stater Bros (grocery store).

At my Stater Bros interview, I was hired on the spot and they are putting me in the meat department as they need the most help there. For my uniform, I asked for a large shirt (I am male) and I was given  a women's extra large shirt because that is all they had. They explained to me that Stater Bros is currently transitioning from blue polos to white polos and I have to wait until the new uniform transition happens to get my men's large shirt which could be a while (I guess I have to wear a women's shirt?).

The managers at Stater Bros have called me multiple times asking if I can come work a shift to help them out even after I explained that I'm still working at Chick-Fil-A and can't start working until my two weeks are up.

Hello all! 

This past Monday I had a 4th interview, on-site, with the team that I would be working with if I was to land this position. It was a 3.5 hr technical interview with a tour and panel like setup where I met one or more of the team members every 30 minutes or so. I believe that this interview went really well and was told that their are no questions regarding my technical expertise by the program director. The next day I send out my thank you emails and wait for a response. I contact the talent acquisition specialist from the company on Wednesday who informs me I was the first of a few candidates to be brought on-site for the final panel interviews - he told me that when he spoke to me it seemed that our conversations went well. I really want this job and have been checking the job portal everyday to see that I am still ‚Äúunder review‚Äù. Is this a good sign? The job posting was removed 2 days following my interview. 

FYI: there are 2 spots open on the team."

The bigger issue to me is: I found out that some of my coworkers had been complaining about my work for the past while. I had no idea that there was anything wrong. I had been messing up because I *thought* I knew how things were supposed to go, but I didn't (because I had missed some trainings). This whole time, I had been told that things were fine. 

I've gotten a bit anxious now. I don't know who doesn't like my work, because everyone has said that it's fine. So when someone says that my work is fine, I have no idea if they're being honest with me or not. I'm a neurotic person and really don't want to be dealing with that level of second guessing myself.

But there's still plenty that I *do* like about my job. And growing up, I was never allowed to quit anything (the only reason I got to stop playing soccer is because I broke my arm right at the start of the season). And so now I have a problem where I have a really hard time quitting/leaving something.

I'm also second-guessing myself a lot here, since that's just what I do. What if my next job is worse? Or what if I leave right when my job was going to get better?

Anyway, any words of wisdom or advice or solidarity would be much appreciated."

3,2022-09-04,Applied for Position A to be told that Position B is also a possibility,u/NOCM9T,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x6223c/applied_for_position_a_to_be_told_that_position_b/,jobs,"Anyone have any thoughts on how to interpret this?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

* &amp;#x200B;

1. You applied for Position A that is in alignment with your previous experience - basically you meet 80%-95% of the role requirements and qualifications.

&amp;#x200B;

* 2. You score 1st interview for Position A with hiring manager. Things seem to go well to where you are invited to a 2nd interview with the Director.

&amp;#x200B;

* 3. 2nd interview - with no prior knowledge of it, it is told to you by the Director, that this 2nd interview is for consideration for not only Position A, but also for Position B. Position B is in a different specialized function, higher level in terms of title and most likely salary, but your background is not as close of a match than the original position. You have transferrable skills and conceptual understanding of Position B, but most probably will be a fish out of water potentially.

&amp;#x200B;

* 4. No way to tell after this 2nd interview if you are still in the running for Position A because in essence you were told you were being considered for Position A and Position B.

&amp;#x200B;

* 5. After 2nd interview,  Director tells you to reach back out if you are interested in Position B so that they can set up a 3rd interview with VP, but states to  contact hiring manager if you are not interested so that they know and will make decisions on final candidates for that position A.

&amp;#x200B;

You personally think you are a better match for Position A, and that Position B would maybe be something to aspire to. Again, your skills and experience are more closely aligned with Position A. Position B is outside of your direct hands on experience, and appears to be a harder position to fill considering it has been posted and not filled much longer than Position A.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you interpret this scenario? Are you still in the running for Position A or not? Do you think perhaps they already selected someone else for Position A so they wanted to see if you are interested in Position B? What would you do?"

Is there anyone here who is really familiar with these kind of customer service assessments?

Is there a way you could earn higher in a short period of time, or is there any 2nd jobs you would recommend or business ventures to pursue? I am open to hear all suggestions. Except people that say stay broke for x years and after that you can live, me and you aren't trying to go to the same place so please dont comment that. Thank you."

I have worried about finding what I want to do for the rest of my life for quite a while since like maybe even the beginning of middle school. All I wanna know is how do I figure out what I want to do? And how I would do it and if I would even be able to do it? I've been told to work through my general education after high school and explore electives in college to find my major, but college is expensive even for community college and I don't want to spend a lot of money on something I might not even like. I currently am doing classes on an online program called Sophia, and I may plan on using them to then go to SNHU online, but I wanna be certain on what I want to do in my life and how I would even be able to do it like if the job is even available in my area. The only real goal I have in my life is to own a house and either by building a tiny house or just buying a tiny one pre-made, I want to be able to achieve it and live my life without having to stress about the future as much as I am now. I just wanna be able to put food on the table and have a roof over my head so I wanna plan ahead on getting a good education for a job that I want in my area. Apologies if this post is confusing I am very sleep deprived and this subject is a stressful one in general to think about so I don't want to spend too much time doing that."

I am hoping that those of you reading this might have some ideas/solutions I might not be thinking of when it comes to regaining some control over work/life balance. Thank you for your input.

My life has gotten to the point where I do almost nothing but work. It used to be better, but due to mismanagement our bosses are throwing bodies at the problem and that involves a lot of time away from home. I am being required to travel on a schedule that involves leaving Sunday night and coming back Friday night, maybe Saturday night. Then leaving again Sunday night. That means I usually have just Saturday to myself, which I spend sleeping and otherwise recuperating. Then right back to leaving for work. I occasionally get a week back in my hometown but they're not days off; I'm still going in to work just not traveling. When I'm back in town I have to deal with on-call. That's just the schedule; the work itself has turned into hell.

I answered ""true"" to 18 out of 20 questions in this article, which means my work/life balance is a  flaming dumpster fire:

[https://www.relationaladvantage.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-work-has-taken-over-your-life](https://www.relationaladvantage.com/blog/how-to-tell-if-work-has-taken-over-your-life)

I haven't just been sitting on my rear-end doing nothing about this problem; I have been looking for another job most of this year with no success. I've had a handful of interviews, with no job offers. It's now September and I'm having nightmares about work, I'm chronically fatigued, and I have almost no life outside of work.

I make fairly good money, roughly $48k-$50k/year depending on overtime. However, the demands of my job have gotten to the point where it just doesn't seem worth it anymore. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel, as I mentioned earlier I have not been able to find another job.

Here are some solutions I've thought about:

* Lower my target for another job, find something with lower pay like a part-time job
* Quit without another job (not a great idea, but I do have some savings)
* Go back to school
* Some combination of above

Thank you!

EDIT: Adding that I'm hourly, not salary and get paid for all time worked including travel time. "

I am Front Office and Business Manager of my company and many client companies.

My duties include running the office, recruiting, stocking, managing companies, etc.

Recently I have been studying human resources a lot, because I am interested in changing companies and looking for new opportunities.

But when I see opportunities, it's hard to put my hands on my head, there are almost none and they all accept face-to-face work and I'm looking for a remote opportunity. It's been complicated, I've been rejected a few times, other times the companies respond but I go to the glassdoor and it's just employees complaining, etc.

My question is: is it worth pursuing this career or will I try to do other things?

The problem with mine is that being in person I am with some people who leave the environment in the shit, apart from the salary, and I would like to move to one with similar values to mine.

Be honest, we are all here fighting for a better life."

1. Is not metric/number based (On how you're measured in performance).
2. Requires to be in-person mostly (potentially some at-home work).
3. Has elements of creativity.
4. Requires collaboration and teamwork.
5. Purpose/mission driven that actually helps people ( NGO, Social Activism, Mental Health etc).
6. Is not based in retail, banking or corporate.
7. Doesn't necessarily require a degree.

I'm someone who loves to work with people on something meaningful (which is subjective, I know). I've a background in design, but I don't know if I'd want a design job 9-5, but at least a job that I could lend the skillset to.

I know there's probably quite a lot of jobs that would fall under the above, but I feel burnt out trying to find a job that fits so hopefully a suggestion here might help.

2 weeks ago I got made an offer for a graduate 'scheme' (Company A), I really liked the place and team plus the company is really good and so I accepted the offer verbally and started doing the background checks with them (they also sent over the contract for me to get signed for this thursday).

By chance I had 2 other interviews with 2 other companies which I decided to do just in case anything went wrong with the hireright stuff for company A. The first interview (Company B) was decent and I got made an offer for an entry level job. Company B is also good and even though it's a lower salary than Company A, it's still good and offers a benefit that would really help my mum out financially which is where i'm struggling. My mum's made a lot of sacrifices for me so I feel like this would be a nice way of helping her out a bit.

Not that relevant but the other place I interviewed with (Company C) offered me a final interview on Thursday = same day i need to sign contract for Company A. It sounds really interesting and may potentially pay more than both jobs, and again is for a great company. That being said even though it sounds great I don't want to risk losing the offer from Company A/B if I continue to stall.

Long story short, would you pick the job with the higher salary or would you pick the job that offers benefits that would help out a family member??

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thanks everyone for your replies, read them all! My mum is someone who says I should do what's best for me and what would make me happy so I rejected the other jobs. I'm going to offer to help with bills or something else instead so I can help her out in some other way. Feeling a lot less stressed today which tells me that I made the right choice. :)"

I was shocked to hear how low it was and she didn‚Äôt even have a drop of negativity in her telling me. Every company is different, however, in my job search, I wasn‚Äôt even seeing junior engineer positions with salaries that low. I went and looked up her company on Glassdoor to get some info on some average salaries for her role, which just led to more disappointment. She wasn‚Äôt even making half the lowest reported salary and barely a third of the median. This is a 6-figure position (average range: $122k-$195k). I don‚Äôt think that she knows she‚Äôs being underpaid, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just making assumptions.

They are flexible and if the targets can't be reached, then the company will listen and adjust them accordingly.

I have a new colleague who - although they are great at writing - doesn't write too much in these descriptions. We were hired to optimise them for SEO purposes and make them longer than the one/two sentences and handful of bullet points that we have. This colleague though will write a similarly low amount, say 100 words, and doesn't meet the criteria and standards we have in place. I will write around 400-600 per product with bullet points and headings for more complicated products, which everyone over the past few years has been happy with. Whilst I am explaining the benefits of a product, my colleague lists the features in a way which is no different to what we already have.

However, beacuse of this, my colleague is meeting the ambitious targets and I am not. I am unsure whether to lower my standards of work to meet the targets, or stick to what I know is successful and the company is happy with regardless of the targets, and let the company know to adjust their expectations. I also don't know whether it's appropriate to flag the other colleague's work to the manager or whether I should mind my own business and just continue with what I'm doing. I am concerned about getting fired if they hit the targets and I don't which is why I have the urge to do something about it.

TLDR: colleague hitting targets with lower quality work. Do I reduce my quality despite my work getting the desired results, or continue with high quality work and risk getting fired for not meeting the new targets?"
58,2022-09-05,For anyone wondering what quiet quitting is,u/crua9,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x6mhz6/for_anyone_wondering_what_quiet_quitting_is/,jobs,"Please share this with whomever who is wondering what quiet quitting is or thinking it is quitting.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

So here is the thing. Quiet-quitting isn't quitting. It's actually thought that the word/s came from Jamie Dimon, the billionaire in charge of JPMorgan in an attack against remote workers coming back to the office and not ""hussle"" like they use to. (working 80+ hours for a hope of a promotion vs working 40 hours)

He has basically gone at an all out war against remote work for some reason and he used many negative names for people who want to work fully remote.

&amp;#x200B;

# Anyways, as I mention quiet quitting isn't quitting.

# It's doing what you are paid for, and nothing more. It's basically having a proper work life balance.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, if you get off at 5PM. Then you don't answer company emails, calls, text, etc. If your boss ask you to stay late to work. Then the answer is no (10x if you are salary and don't get a pay difference for staying later). If your boss wants you and your coworkers to go out drinking. The answer is no, unless you want to. You don't stick your hand up for extra projects or work.

Basically you show up for work, do your job, and go home. It has nothing to do with working while looking for a new job or quitting.

&amp;#x200B;

If it sounds like this is nothing new. Well... it isn't. Many people prior years call it having a proper work life balance. But again, we have billionaires pissed at people wanting remote work for this, and those coming back to the office don't want to work for free in hopes for a promotion or a chance they MIGHT keep their job during the next round of layoffs. Or to not get shamed for basically working to live.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Like it isn't even if you hate your job or whatever. Again, it is just having proper balance between work and general life. Like you aren't living to work, and sure as hell you shouldn't be working for free. And to be forced to work for free is slavery.

# Literally one of the definitions of slave is = A person who is forced against his/her will to perform, for another person or other persons, services on a regular or continuing basis.

And while people pull the ""well they can quit"". Slaves back in the day could also off themselves, so by that logic they must not been slaves.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, one of the interesting things with this movement is what is shown is the mentality of going above and beyond without extra pay. This is directly linked to most jobs went from 8 people doing it to 1 even without automation. And it helped make it where you have to be super over qualified to do a given job that years back a HS kid could do just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TLDR, when you hear quiet quitting. Note it isn't people doing below what they are paid to do. It is people doing exactly what they are paid to do and nothing more.

It is only called quiet quitting to insult and shame people. Similar to how the media calls  failure to launch to those who can't afford a house or rent, those disabled, or those saving money while living with family.

# Example:

* You go to 7-Eleven gas station and have a drink in hand.
* Person there says ""that will be $3""
* You say ""I will pay for that, but I want a pack of cigs and my gas for free""
* Person says ""you have to pay for those""
* You say ""7-Eleven is quite quitting""

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR of TLDR if I had to sum it up to 1 line.

#  It's an insult given to those who don't want to work for free."

(I will be requiring permanent walking aids and they are not allowed in the food/retail and I would be expected to stand/walk/carry/etc. for 9+ hours without them.) 

TL;DR Jobs for disabled people (legs) not call centre, can ideally be done remotely. High School diploma only. In ONTARIO, CANADA 


EXTRA INFO:

My only experience is 12 years of retail/food and a high school diploma. 

I've been browsing jobs on indeed while I'm off to get an idea of what I could do. Jobs would need to be remote as I won't be able to drive until I save up enough to modify my vehicle for my disability. (Which as I currently get paid 70% on disability and if/when it switches to long term I will only get 50%....there is no savings)

All the remote jobs I've seen require degrees and/or experience in the fields. (And call centres I have an auditory disability so I can't hear well enough on the phone)

I thought like electronic repair or something like that as I am mechanically inclined, but that requires commuting. Would it be stupid to take out a loan to modify my vehicle for the chance I can get a job like that? (No public transport in small town)

I don't want to ""freeload"" off of government assistance, and have a work ethic. I've been flipping things locally to make up the loss of my current pay and I used to do ubereats to supplement my income before being disabled. I'm not afraid of hardwork. 

Locally, employment office will only help disabled people find a job if they don't have one or lost it. As I currently have one, they won't help me until I don't."

I am an accountant, currently studying for the CPA, and have been doing this for over ten years now. While the beginning of my career showed growth and stability (average tenure around 2.5 years). My last three jobs have just been bad and I just don't know why I have ended up with such crappy jobs and options. 

I believe it is a two way street in this situation, I could have done things better at two of the jobs. Likewise, they could have been more helpful as well.

1. First job, the department I worked in changed just as I was hired on, supervisor left, no one replaced them, and left just me, the manager, and another staff accountant. Needless to say, it was a hard job to do as the people who left took the wealth of knowledge. I did the best with what I had but it was not enough and at the end of the year I was let go.

I used that to go back to school full time to get my degree in accounting so I could sit for the CPA.

2. Second job was GREAT. Great team and everyone was motivated. Unfortunately the pandemic destroyed the company and they laid off over half their employees within two weeks. Last hired, first fired. I was gone at six months.

Took me over a year to find a new job. The industry I work in (oil and gas) got DESTROYED by the pandemic.

3. Third job was in a different area of accounting I am used to. I took a pay cut and was ineligible for a bonus, payraise/cola, and title promotion for 3 years . Still, I was determined to make it worth. It became apparent during the training process they were not doing a good job. I raised concerns with supervisor/manager but they did not seem interested. So inevitably when I screwed up, my explanation did not seem to matter. I tried talking to my senior to see if they would sit with me in seeing where I was going wrong. They claimed they would but never did. I finally got put on PIP this past May, completed it, but then got put on it again at the end of July, and was let go this past August. Tbh, after the mean comments from my supervisor/manager, I would have rather been fired than stay another month. When they told me ""Best of luck"" I said ""You too"". I'm hoping that comment didn't burn any bridges. 

The funny thing is being let go from this job has put me in a better mood for the most part more so than losing the last one. I guess not being treated so bad anymore really helps.

Unfortunately, the past 3 situations forced me to move back in with my parents, and it's hard some days to not feel like a loser being almost in your mid's 30s in this situation. 

So, based on what I have told you. How screwed am I, career-wise? To me, there are things I am doing wrong that I need to correct (be more assertitive, believe in myself, etc.) but I just feel like 3 in a row is hard to deal with. 

TL;DR - got let go from 3 jobs in 5 years time. Two were half my fault/half theirs. Is my career salvagable, even if I get my CPA?"

I'm a 28f from Canada (Saskatchewan) and recently go let go from my job. 

I graduated with my Bachelor of Arts - Psychology in 2019. Right after school, job search was HARD. I mean I was applying for 1-3 jobs almost every day for a few months and only got a few call backs and interviews. Most interviews (mainly for support worker/case manager positions) were reluctant to give me a shot without any case mgmt experience. As such, I ended up working for an insurance company (in disability management) and was there for roughly 3 years. 

Let me tell you - that career is extremely challenging. Although I have no medical/kinesiology background (and they know that upon hiring me) I was still expected to make decisions on whether or not someone was disabled from doing their job based on a 3 page physician statement and a phone call with the plan member. While I was promised training for my position, I never recieved it. On top of that, half the procedures and policies were not written down. I learned via ""shadowing"" other case managers and unfortunately picked up some incorrect procedures along the way. 

Things were going okay for the 3 years I was there - while I was constantly stressed out with having to make such a big decision on someone's income with such little information/support, I still showed up every single day and did my job. I had my last performance review in May where I was ""achieving expectations"" and got a substantial raise. In the entire time I was there, I never recieved any negative performance reviews, no disciple and was never told that I wasn't doing satisfactory work. I admit I wasn't excelling, but I was definitely doing my job and my caseload + last performance review demonstrate that. 

On Aug 23, I was let go completely out of the blue. No warnings, no meetings, nothing. The reason was extremely brief and was something along the lines of ""you just weren't up to the level of case management we were expecting at this point"". Ouch. I did get severance + my 110 banked vacation hours, so I'm not hurting financially, just my pride. 

Now, I'm really confused on what to say to future employers. I was terminated without cause, so not technically ""fired"", but I feel that saying ""I was let go because they weren't impressed with my performance"" looks horrible. I have a good reference from them (from a previous Team Lead) who wouldnt say I was let go for negative reasons. It just seems so strange, and I'd rather not blatantly lie to someone. 

Any and all advice is much appreciated."

I'm considering calling but it'll be super awkward and tbh I'm shit scared as 1) I left on lukewarm terms and 2) I haven't really talked to them since leaving that job nearly 3 years ago.

P.S. it‚Äôs a tiny company so there is no HR or admin department. 

Please help!"

Last week I had an interview with a company that was supposed to be a final interview. Was pretty sure I was told in the previous interview with the hiring manager it would be and it was an in-person interview 3 hours away from where I live and with 3 different people back-to-back-to-back. However, the last person I spoke to was the boss of the hiring manager and he said something about a panel interview in a couple weeks as the next round so I am kind of confused on whether they are just adding steps to the process or he was just incorrect?

I‚Äôll be completely honest I‚Äôve been struggling to cope the last few weeks I‚Äôve had some things happen. I‚Äôve been spacing out at work and crying on my lunch break. I tried to make it till my notice period the end of this week but wasn‚Äôt able too. I‚Äôm just overwhelmed. I was told to come in when I called in sick a few weeks ago despite having a temperature and was only sent home when I vomited. 

My assistant manager insinuated I was faking it saying how she didn‚Äôt understand how having a sore throat and temperature correlated to throwing up. That the symptoms didn‚Äôt match up. I really didn‚Äôt appreciate her saying that as last year I was stuck in hospital for like 7hrs violently vomiting due to extreme anxiety and a IC flare up.I later confirmed with my GP via e-consult that I had tonsillitis.

I have interstitial cystitis (GP presumes), chronic post nasal drip (diagnosed) and generalised anxiety disorder (severe vomiting). My brother died at the end of last month and my dads in the hospital. He didn‚Äôt handle the news well and has preexisting conditions. I‚Äôm currently also in a legal dispute with my younger sister/ her dad and working with NFIB/ action fraud to build a case against her.

I‚Äôll be completely honest my mental health is in a bad place and unfortunately I recently came off my antidepressants a few weeks before things started hitting the fan in my life. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable going back on them despite them would have helping as the transition period can make me very depressed/borderline suicidal. 

I just feel if I was able to take my holiday or unpaid time off without being penalised or receiving strikes that could affect my employment things would be different. I was genuinely so terrified to tell management anything and the anxiety was making me feel worse. As it‚Äôs a new job I started 2 months ago I couldn‚Äôt take any holidays/time off and had a 3 strike policy for attendance before failing probation. 

I spoke to my manager today to let her know I‚Äôm not feeling mentally up-to finishing my notice period and I honestly just feel worse. We have compromised that I‚Äôll come in tomorrow to give her time to find cover. I originally gave my notice in last week Thursday as I was struggling to cope  working full-time and needed some time off to address my personal issues. 

I‚Äôve spoken to my GP and they are happy to write a letter for me to have some time of work which they previously offered a few weeks ago when I was having a flare up for an existing medical condition but I declined as I was scared if I took any time off I‚Äôd lose my job. It genuinely got bad to the point where I was nauseous, had abdominal paint and urinary incontinence at work. I felt humiliated and pretended I was fine. 

I know I‚Äôm being very unprofessional however I don‚Äôt feel like it was right on their end to insinuate I was faking being ill. I do feel terrible for leaving them in a bad position but what else could I have done?. I tried my best to keep my personal life private from work but just feel like I reached my tipping point. I just feel really terrible and like I‚Äôve let everyone down. However I feel like as someone with a history of depression and attempted suicide/ self harm prioritising my mental health is important.

I work in a nursery and I don‚Äôt want to put the children at risk if mentally I‚Äôm spacing out. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll lose it and just break down. I feel like I should be allowed time to grieve and focus on personal/family matters. I understand this is my problem but I don‚Äôt know what else work expect from me when I‚Äôm going through a lot rn and they weren‚Äôt willing to provide me with time off too sort things out.

I‚Äôm not sure if I should have another word with management or just forget it. How do I avoid this type of situation in the future to remain professional?"

Recently I applied for an administrative assistant position but they interviewed me for 2 jobs for aa as I mentioned and for social media cordinator ( i currently work as freelance for some clients)....anyways this company I applied has no HR, the administrative employee did the first interview, she read some questions and I had the second interview after a few days with their manager and CEO. The CEO asked me a couple of questions which were more like riddles and ""smart questions"" more were like out of context. Questions like do u write with right or left hand, if your friend got into an accident and killed a pedestrian would you be on her side or let her be in prison kind of bs. He asked me the ""sell me this"" method on me since i previously worked for a short time in sales. He told me that I am under qualified for administrative assistant job. He said why u apply for this job u already have a job. I told him I can manage both but smh he was mean towards me. I didn't answer their salary expectation question bcs I asked what they offer and he said 0‚Ç¨ . 
So many other things he did that made me feel bad and after I went home I cried.And after all that bs I went through I received a Whatsapp message from the employee that did my first interview. 

SHE LITERALLY SENT ME A PERSONALITY TEST FOR ME TO FILL . 

I didn't get an answer whether I landed the job or not but I have a bad feeling and I want to pass the whole thing."

The work is pretty boring, but it pays my bills. I graduated last year and have been looking for a job since then that utilises my degree, and my employer knows that I have been looking and have been somewhat supportive. Coming to the end of the year, the work has ramped up and is putting a lot of pressure on the full-time workers. Because of this the company has decided to stop employing casual workers, and instead only employ full-time workers, I have been offered full-time employment, and if I do not accept it I will no longer have a job. However, I am currently interviewing for a job that seems very promising, they haven't offered me anything, but so far it really does seem like it would be a better fit for me and my strengths. 

My question is, would it in your opinion be ethical to accept the full-time position, knowing that I may leave soon, leaving the other workers with a heavier load?

I really would like to do what's right here because my employer has been really good to me and my co-workers are really decent guys. I don't want to screw anybody over."

I'm an 18 year old trans man who's been working at CVS for about two weeks now. I haven't medically transitioned, but I've presented as male for a while now and I pass surprisingly well at work. A good 70% of my customers assume that I'm just a short cis guy and treat me accordingly, and all my coworkers refer to me by my chosen name and pronouns and correct themselves when they slip up. I suspect that my store manager Ryan (37 y/o) has had some conversations with my coworkers behind the scenes to make sure that my identity is respected, but that's entirely speculation.

Reese (40ish) is our store manager in training, and she hasn't used my correct pronouns a single time in the last few shifts I've worked with her. I'm a passive, conflict-avoidant person, and it was often just me and her in the store due to working closing shifts, so I didn't feel comfortable correcting her until today. She responded by insisting that she had only used she/her pronouns to refer to a customer, despite literally telling the customer ""she can help you right over there"" while pointing at me. She was weirdly defensive about it too. Most people apologize profusely and/or correct themselves and move on, but not Reese. It wouldn't be a big deal to me at all if she hadn't reacted the way she did.

I have a coworker, Cora, that I'm close to, who is also a manager. Cora is 19 and is also queer. The very first time I met her, she told me to let her know if anyone disrespected my identity or my pronouns so she could help take care of it. Cora came in right as I was leaving today, so I let her know what happened with Reese. Cora talked to Reese about it, and Reese completely denied it and again was very defensive. Cora texted me to confirm that what Reese told her was bullshit, and I did. 

I am going to give Ryan a heads up about this, and Cora probably will as well, just to make sure that he's aware of it well before the shit starts nearing the fan. Ryan's absolutely amazing, but I'm not sure how much he'll actually be able to do in this situation if it gets worse. 

This is only my third job, it's the first job I've held as an adult, and it's the first job I've ever been out at. Info from HR clearly states that sex/gender, gender identity, and gender expression are all protected by our non-discrimination policy, but I have no idea how far Reese's behavior has to go before it counts as discrimination, harassment, or a hostile work environment. I want to get a better idea of where that line is so that I am better able to judge if/when this issue becomes HR worthy and prepare accordingly. I also have no fucking clue what's normal for people to do when they're having issues with coworkers, because this is the first job I've ever worked that has a semi professional culture.

Some notes:
* Ryan has my back a thousand percent and I trust him to do everything he can to help me work this out whether it's formally or informally
* From today forward I will be writing down all incidents between me and Reese, just in case this gets escalated and I need a paper trail
* I couldn't care less if she misgenders me on accident, I just want her to make a good faith effort and correct herself if she slips up"

I really want a career in insurance as a claims adjuster. I recently applied to State Farm claims adjuster and I managed to land the online interview questionnaire every time (applied 3 times). They ended up going with someone else each time. I believe I do well in my interviews; I smiled and answered to the best of my abilities.

It will be a big help.

0,2022-09-05,I need advice: two job offers after accepting an underpaying job.,u/marbear1219,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x6zt5l/i_need_advice_two_job_offers_after_accepting_an/,jobs,"I started interviewing for a new job a few months back. When I was interviewing, I always asked about benefits, pay and location (remote, travel, hybrid, etc).

I interviewed with a big Fortune 500 company (Let‚Äôs call them company A) who is constantly listed as one of the top 5 best places to work in the USA for over 10 years now. But is rated super low on Glassdoor for pay, raises and bonuses. They were interested in me, but we‚Äôre re-orging by the time they were ready to give me an offer. Originally the role was supposed to be 175k-200k. I emailed the recruiter weekly about any updates. For whatever reason, every month I waited for the offer, the pay went down. 160, then 150, 140, and then 4 months later they finally offered me 135k. 

At my previous job, that I left due to toxic work culture and unchecked harassment that HR kept brushing off (I reported it multiple times), I was making 135,500. 

So taking this new gig at company A was $500 less than what I was making.

I should also note that I was already being underpaid at my last role. I hadn‚Äôt gotten a raise in over a year because of my toxic af boss. We also didn‚Äôt get an inflation bump. So I was hoping to at least make 150-160 at a new job so I‚Äôd be getting paid a fair market rate.

I accepted the job because I needed to get the hell out of my previous job. But I felt robbed and lied to. I‚Äôm not excited to start. I don‚Äôt think I would have applied for the position if I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be a pay bump. 

While waiting for 4 months for the offer from company A, I was still interviewing. I have since gotten two more offers. One for 160k. (Company B) The other for 150k. (Company C)

I start at the job I accepted (A) at tomorrow. 

I got the offers from B&amp;C in writing, to sign, last Friday. 

I was told that there would be at least two weeks of on boarding at company A. They (A) also made me sign a month long retention contract. So I cannot leave until I‚Äôve been there for a month. I have mentioned that I signed a retention contract with the other (B&amp;C) employers (without mentioning that the contract was with a new company.) They were both open to me starting in mid October.


I keep going back and forth on all these things. My initial plan was to go to this company (A) that I start at tomorrow and ask them if they will match the other offers (B&amp;C). However, I have no relationship with my new boss. I have yet to prove my value. Will this ruin my reputation at this new job? Put a bad taste in their mouth? Maybe they won‚Äôt promote me later on? Am I over thinking their reaction?

Should I wait until onboarding is over to ask if they will match it? Or ask this week?

This big company (A) has really great long term benefits. Great maternity and paternity. Unlimited time off. Money for personal health memberships, continuing education and, remote office supplies.

But again, 30k less. And the other company (B) said they would promote me to a higher position in my next 3-6 months. Where the other company did not. 

But there are some downsides with those as well. 

Company B has strict vacation policies. 3 weeks vacation. 2 weeks sick. 10 holidays. Nonnegotiable. They are also on an east coast schedule. I‚Äôm a night owl. I‚Äôd be starting work by 7am.

Company C is hybrid. Three days in the office. The office is an hour drive one way. The others are 100% remote. Company A has 25% travel. 

I have been going back and forth about this all weekend and I‚Äôm still not sure what to do. Please help."

So after I graduated, unable to find a job in my field, I got into retail and spend 5 years there. Until I quit because I had this overwhelming pressure that I need to redeem those 4 years and I just have to find a job related to my degree.

I spent an entire year being unemployed, applying only to those jobs I thought were suiting and finally I managed to land one. Unfortunately it's not great, there's tons of anxiety, no training and me having practically zero experience is making things difficult so stressful. I don't want to simply blame my employer but he hired me on the spot because he really wanted to get rid of the guy who I replaced. So he left, I came. Noone there to train me, other than the boss, who's just bad at it. I feel lost in a sea of information and absolutely discouraged.

So all that made me think, was an entire year not working to end up in this job worth it? I feel like I need to make use of my degree or all that money my parents spent was for nothing. But I wasn't planing on ending up miserable just to not feel guilty."

Hi all,

I am currently in the interview stage for a Business Development position for a robotics company that specializes in warehouse logistics and streamlining the whole process with their software. I had an interview with the hiring manager and afterwards was asked to create a company profile for Target Corp. via a format of my choice (Word, PP, etc.)

For the profile, they asked that I include things like Target's headquarters, industry, revenue, key decision makers, and other things that can easily be found. However, there are three things that I am not as confident in when it comes to finding an exact answer:  


1. **What are Target's business units?**  
I am unfamiliar with the concept and a Google search seems to vary on what exactly it entails. I have found multiple pieces of information:  
*A) Target Corporation is a general merchandise retailer comprised of three operating segments: Target, Mervyn's and Marshall Field's.*  
*B) Target operates as two reportable segments: Retail and Credit Card.*  
*C) Target has four subsidiaries: Target Brands, Inc., Target Capital Corporation, Target Enterprise, Inc., and Target General Merchandise, Inc.*  

2. **Areas of opportunity/challenges that \[Logistics Software/Robotics Company\] can be of assistance?**  
(I have a general idea, but open to ideas for anyone who may be more familiar with retail manufacturing companies)   

3. **What tech is Target using today?**  
(I have seen articles about them working with other robotics companies so I guess that's the answer but again, someone else may know more)"

The severance package was generous, I don‚Äôt have to worry about money for several months. If I get a job sooner, I can put all the extra money into savings or use it to travel to Europe next summer.

My supervisor is uneducated but worked at this place doing the same thing for 8 years so got promoted to supervisor.

I recently asked work that I needed to go down to 4 days. I gave them a vague reason that I‚Äôll need it to schedule doctor‚Äôs appointments so it won‚Äôt run into work. It‚Äôs true because I‚Äôll need to go out of town eventually to get a major surgery and they know this. I wanted to be respectful to their schedule as well. 

But the more concerning reasoning, is that I‚Äôm having daily issues with my mental health along with physical issues as well. It‚Äôs very hard to get days off and I don‚Äôt want to keep requesting days or even switching shifts. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll hit my limit and become physically unwell. 

Due to personal factors, I can‚Äôt quit but I might need to look into disability although I‚Äôve been avoiding it. I planned on thinking about disability after I recover from surgery that is upcoming soon, well, at least before the end of this year if I need to do so.

(Or full time college instead of part time college, if I‚Äôm unlucky) 

My only choice is to continue working right now and I fear at failing/sucking at my job and being seen as a bad employee. I really wanted this job for reference as it‚Äôs my second job and I‚Äôm new to the workforce since I‚Äôm a young adult. I‚Äôve also been trying to avoid unemployment.

The same happened in my most recent job too - we spoke daily and my boss was always super nice to me every day, then the companies sales tanked because of the way things are at the minute and she started ignoring me for my last 2 weeks, only to send me an email on the last day thanking me for all my hard work and to stay in touch, but this was a month ago and I heard nothing from her, nor did anybody else I worked with say anything to me at all and it kinda had me wondering if I just keep building up what I thought were friendships but they always seem to only go 1 way?

She also said it wasn't anything to do with personal performance, yet removed the welcome post she made for me on social media a few months back etc and it was all a bit confusing/weird for me"

3,2022-09-06,Wondering if you should quit after a short amount of time at your new company and go back to your old one? Trust your gut - you should!,u/iHeartBeeJayJay,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x74lvq/wondering_if_you_should_quit_after_a_short_amount/,jobs,"I think we all know the grass isn't always greener on the other side. But sometimes, the grass is actually on fire on the other side, or perhaps may just be astroturf from a glance, lending a false perception that it's even grass to begin with.

I'm sure I'll sound like many other millennials out there right now, but take it from me, if you're having second thoughts about the new job you took recently, trust your gut.

I left my job as a BI Developer three weeks ago on good terms. I was content and doing something I enjoyed and had a close relationship with my boss.

However, I just quit the job I went to after just 3 weeks. I think after you read my experience, you would've too.

**Preface:** 

I made sure to call my old boss back before quitting, and thankfully I left on good terms. He is going to talk to my former CEO to try and get me back on the team. He referred to me as an 'asset at any company' over the phone, so I think my chances as pretty good. I was 100% honest with him about my situation, and let him know I was eating humble pie.

**So.... here's my story.**

A former mentor of mine who I still respect, wanted me to come work for him back in July of this year. He reached out to me and offered me six figures to be a Systems Billing Administrator with up to a $10k quarterly bonus. 

Unfortunately, I had to call a flag on the play for 'false advertising', because I found myself living a nightmare, working almost 65-70 / hrs a week attempting to do the job of ten people. 

Apparently what this company left out in the interview process, was that they were also expecting me to fill the vacated roles of their Sharepoint Developer, Sharepoint Administrator, Systems Administrator (*over four different proprietary billing systems*), Integrations Developer, Project Manager, and BI Developer. 

I was working with (*more like coaching*) their Dev team (*all being college educates, while I'm out here with a make believe degree from YouTube, MSDocs, W3, and Google lol*) and was shocked that I was showing them very basic developer tools and concepts (*i.e. how to use CTE in SQL, SSIS Packages, SOAP vs REST API Calls, etc.,*) that they had never seen before. Yikes.

I finally snapped when I was asked to work this weekend after already putting in way too many hours AND being expected to work through labor day. Uhh..... excuse the \*expletive\* out of me. I'm outta here.

I value work life balance, and for the other introverts who need downtime to recharge, or for those of you who have a hobby you're passionate about, or a family to take care of, I think we can all agree, downtime is a luxury that money can't buy. 

I've always had a strong skillset and interest in technology, which has caught the eye of many people who would like to leverage my strengths for their team. I've done both front and back end development in my career, but in my experience, the ingredients required in the recipe for critical thinking regarding technical solutions, generally involves time, but more importantly, time to plan.

I love analytics and data, but there's no BI Developer, nor Systems Billing Administrator on earth who can do all of this at once:

**1.)** Data model a PowerBI report after being on the job for just three weeks and only getting to peek at the schematics in the databases for only two of those three weeks with absolutely no requirements as to what their building visibility to.

**2.)** Learn administration of four separate proprietary billing systems (and come up with KPI's for them), while coordinating UAT for new releases coming up in 2 of the 4 systems.

**3.)** Tackle front-end development for an abomination of a Sharepoint list lacking an integration layer, that an offshore team heavily modified and didn't fulfill their obligation with, leaving end-users asking ""why it's freezing up"", while the project manager responsible for implementation is trying to pass this cluster off because she too, is ready to get the heck out of this place. 

*""It's freezing up because you let these numbskulls fill up your water bottle, with a fire hose.""*

**4.)** Coordinate with incompetent IT Support people, who are going to give the same excuse as to why they can't create a simple VM report staging environment for an offshore group to VPN into and develop from, citing ""that country is blocked"", as if they don't know how to whitelist an IP address for access to our 'on premises' servers. 

**5.)** Be expected to keep up with miles of email communications which could've easily been mistaken as an RSS feed. 

*In my first 3 weeks, I received roughly 2,300 emails. Not kidding. I thought this might have even been a world record.*

6.) Here's the cherry on top - you're expected to do all of this, in less than a month of starting your employment. 

*I started on 8/15 and was given a deadline of 9/12 to ""secure"" all of these items.* 

Impossible - that's several different critical-thinking jobs. 

**Here were my red flags from Day 1.**

**Red Flag #1:**

Everything was locked down from an IT perspective, and much of the chaos was surrounding the IT support team's incompetence. They'd find any excuse to hide their low IQ's, as to why they couldn't get you what you needed, citing policy, etc., 

My guess, is that their policy contains excerpts from George Orwell's '1984', so let's just chalk this up and say their support guys were about as sharp as a marble.

**Red Flag #2:**

A Project Manager I had worked with at a former company was there, and I kid you not, she looked me dead in the eyes and said, ""This is the second worst team I've ever coordinated in my 25 years of doing Project Management. Get ready, because you're about to take this on when I leave."" 

She was ready to pass this off to me like a 'hot potato' so she could skip town. I didn't blame her for this, as it's just business, and this company's a hot mess.

**Red Flag #3:**

My first day was literally, ""Here's all your passwords on a piece of paper, better hop to it...."", accompanied by miles of paperwork I've never seen at any company (*nor court hearings*), that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

*I quickly realized why the office gossip surrounding my predecessor was about how he was having ""mental health issues"". If Clint Eastwood, Mr. T, and Chuck Norris teamed up, they wouldn't have even be able to handle this shear amount of crazy.*

Long story short, I threw in the towel and quit yesterday afternoon effective immediately via email outlining all of this in a few sentences, before I'm even guaranteed my old job back. 

It's a candidate's market. I've got strong skillsets. I've got money saved back to survive on and have been planning for an event such as this. 

Until then, I'm going to ignore all incoming calls I don't recognize, sneak by and drop my equipment off, and enjoy a nice little vacation I'm going to get in the interim, while I fill out some contingency applications for other developer jobs in the unlikely scenario that I don't get my old job back.

I don't regret this decision, whatsoever. Be careful who you trust, is the point I'm trying to drive home here, and I'll pinch it off with this:

**If you're having second thoughts about that new job, whether it's not what you expected, not good for your mental health, or just not interesting enough for you - don't linger. It could get even worse than it already is, and if you know that you have a home or an opportunity elsewhere, pursue it, take care of yourself.**

*I'll never forget these last three weeks, as they've given me a whole new outlook that will stay with me the rest of my life.*"

when he's with me it's just 'ok, alright'.

this started a week ago. 

i am worried if it means they are considering to kick me out or something as I have no idea what that means. the change in attitude is very abrupt and I'm pretty sure I'm not imagining it.

1532,2022-09-06,"A german view on why ""working as hired is not ""quiet quitting""",u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x79bmp/a_german_view_on_why_working_as_hired_is_not/,jobs,"Edit: I cut out all reference to US economy... except for Obama and Trump complaining about germany exporting too much :)

I know this is a controversial topic and especially emotional. I also know that certain types of people will not listen to facts, no matter how much proof I would put on display. Still as I feel an obligation to those that are interested in facts, I will add links to it.

Just to get the facts straight:

\- In germany ""quite quitting"" is actually the standart. You work as hired. You deliver work as hired. You leave home and have time for yourself. Regular shifts are 8 hours with mandatory breaks.

\- EVERY german worker has a contract by law. Even the cleaning lady has a contract with a mandatory 1 month period after the worker was let go. There are specific laws for the reasons and you have to pay a compensation if you break them.

\- Overtime has to be paid or compensated with extra vaccation time. Working time is strictly regulated and break time has to be used. 24 Mandatory vaccation days per year is the minimum. Added to this are the holidays. If you don¬¥t use them up, you are forced into using them by a specific month in the next year. Your boss sends you home because he gets in trouble otherwise.

\- Regular fulltime week in germany is 40 hours of work.

\- Accidents at work cost the employer a ton of money. You get super special treatment and all bills and medication are paid by a special insurance company. If the accidents pile up your workplace gets a visit and your boss will actually get fried alive.

\- These laws demand precise planning and execution to get the most out of an employee. Which the management has to adapt to or it makes losses. Well they adapted to it.

\- Work-life balance are like the second amendment for the germans. They existed for over a century. They are older then the german republic.

But we all know that this amount of lazyness, workers rights and ""socialism"" must hurt the german economy and production rate! I mean that are known facts! Aren¬¥t they?

Well...

\- [germany has an export overcapacity measured against it¬¥s imports of over 240 billion](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/DEU) this is only surpassed by china with 400 billion +

\- germany only has 45 million employees and still it is the second biggest exporter in the world in comparisson to it¬¥s imports.

Fun fact. There was one thing [Obama](https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/06/Obama-Has-New-Scapegoat-Now-It-s-Germany-s-Fault) and [Trump](https://www.dw.com/en/trump-slams-germanys-us-trade-surplus-as-bad/a-38986975) where both on the same page. Complaining about germany exporting too much (it was really hard to find english publications about this. I wonder why. We had a good laugh)

Still with all these restrictions, germany produces more then it needs. They don¬¥t need to force extra hours on every week because the output is higher if you work as hired and planning.

Thats what ""quiet quitting"" actually is. **""Work as hired""**

Stop calling it ""quiet quitting"" because it actually is granting the possibility to emotionally blackmail you into a proven disfunctional system. You work as hired and do your job as hired. To the best of your knowledge and skills. You plan your work and get it done as needed. Germany is smaller and they surpass the US in sales with less work time... Those are the facts. Can¬¥t help it"

She wasn't that much older than me, she was only older than me by a month, but she is sharp. Her thinking is much more matured than mine. She is Indian, so she was very uptight and serious and wanted everything perfect. I would say that I am a good worker. At first, things between us seemed okay and normal. But then as time went on, I think she easily picked up on a few of my quirks and noticed something. I always had this feeling like she didn't like me. 

She has always complained to me about how I look at her. So have other coworkers as well, but I still didn't stop whatever they said I was doing. She has said to me numerous times, ""Why do you always look so scared?"" One time when she was talking to people, I stopped whatever I was doing and stood there looking at her as she talked. She said, ""What are you looking at?"" When she passed by me through out the day, I would make eye contact with her, even though I wasn't even going to say anything. I looked at her just because I saw her. One time I saw her in the parking lot but she was far far but she could still see me. She yelled, ""Oh my God!!!"" And ran away. Because she didn't want to talk to me outside of work.

I was the only one whom she felt uncomfortable to. There was this other coworker my age who started at the same time as I did, and the manager liked her and even talked to her about non work related stuff. She commented on how she was such a good worker right in front of me. But when she spoke about me, she said, "" For example, if I don't like her, would it be fair to treat her like \*\*\*\*?""

Then she moved to being a manager for a different department. I guess she didn't want to deal with me anymore and couldn't handle it. Even when she wasn't my manager anymore, she would yell at me and tell me to ""Hurry up!!!"" Once, I went on a leave and she thought I wasn't going to come back so she moved again to my area. When she saw me, she was shocked and said, ""What are you doing here? You were gone for like a year."" Then she moved back again.

Wow. She moved to being a manager for a different department because of me? Am I really that important? Was she put off by something about me?"

I‚Äôve been in different sales jobs the past 6 years post college and the past 2 years in tool sales. Company provides a vehicle, gas, insurance, internet, and it‚Äôs mostly remote, but I have to travel a lot. I got married a few months ago and being away from home so much has been hard. 

My first position in the company was on a sales team in a different category in which I was a top salesperson. A couple months ago, corporate decided to disband the team since it was not as profitable as predicted and I was forced to change roles in the company. I was told that I would need to stay in this role until at least December before applying for promotions or transitions, but there aren‚Äôt any new positions in this category, so I will need to change jobs in the company once again. My new role is unstructured and I make my own schedule for the most part except when I need to travel. 

I have a bachelors degree and I make $60k salary with a $3k bonus at the end of the year. 2% annual raise with a good performance review.

All of this has been taxing and I‚Äôm told the higher I go with this company, the longer the hours will be and I‚Äôll spend even more time away from home. My family is far more important to me than this job.

Question:

I‚Äôm sure this is not a new question, but what are some solid career paths for someone who is good at sales but wants more stability?

Update: Thank you to everyone who has commented so far! These options are really interesting and I‚Äôm currently looking more into them!"

There was no real criticism of my performance at all, in fact I was told how much I stepped up this last year.

I attempted to negotiate, as I had found a competitor's job posting paying at least 5 dollars more for the same experience. I was once again told that there was simply no budget.

Recently, one of my coworkers quit, and they posted his position. The job posting had a maximum salary that is $6 above what I make. I have worked for this company for almost 5 years and am one of the most senior guys here. We work in a very specialized field, which means they would be very unlikely to find someone with more experience than I already have.

Since I was in company x as an intern, I already knew the manager from company x (let's call him A) and we talk a lot through teams. But the project manager is a new one that just got promoted as Overseas Manager (let's call him B). The manager B keeps scheduling 30min meetings 2x a week, we communicate through email and don't use Microsoft teams because the outsourcing company doesn't have an option to chat through that (we have different emails).



The meetings are so time-consuming and I have no idea how to bring it up to Manager B... the problem is not the amount of meetings but the content. Once, he just scheduled it to say the same things he has written in an email he sent yesterday... the SAME thing. He says he wants to see what's going on, what activities I'm doing or if I'm having any trouble in my new role. He says he knows it's quite annoying to schedule so many meetings but he wants to track my progress and show the new Director the activities and projects we are doing... he's a nice guy but this things are getting on my nerves, I barely have time to do my stuff... 30min might not seem much but it really breaks my work flow... How can I suggest to reduce to 15min? Or at least once a week? I also have a few online training classes and he wants the details in a worksheet, which day I'm doing it, how many minutes or hours each course has...

Welp....after a long job search, I was excited to start a new position at a LA company.  4 days before my starting date I received a video call saying the company is ""reorganizing"" and my position is no longer available.  To say I was stunned is the understatement of the century.  The day before I picked up the laptop they sent me.  For the last 2 weeks, they have been contacting me about what jacket size is, sending me a goody package, and the IT team letting me know they will contact me on my first day and set everything up.  I got an email from HR head of talent telling me that she is new and wants to get to know me.  I really thought my talk with this HR lady would be about what to expect on my first day (another hr told me right after I signed the job offer letter that someone would contact me before my start date).   I prepared questions I wanted to ask, and had my husband take the dog out while I was on the video call.  To my surprise, the meeting lasted less than 15 seconds.  Basically was,  ""Hi blahblah,  I hope I pronounced your name correctly. No easy way to say this, we are reorganizing and your position has been terminated.""  I told her I literally picked up the computer yesterday and was told to drive it back to fedex and send it back.  After 5 interviews (one of them being 2 hours long) and an extensive 2-week background check (I've studied and worked abroad), and weeks of constant communication (to the last day), they did this in like 2 seconds and fucked me and my family royally.

So, I have offers from two companies and I'd love your opinions on which one is a better choice.

Company A: 

Pros: 

1. World-known large tech company that'll look AMAZING on my resume. 
2. Starting pay is slightly higher than Company B's starting pay. 

Cons:

1. I didn't really vibe with the people I'd be reporting to. 
2. The work hours are super inconvenient and unpredictable. 
3. Job expectations are somewhat vague and up to interpretation. 
4. Growth trajectory is unclear and undefined, though they claim it's there. 
5. Since it's a huge company, I'm worried about being easily laid off.

Company B:

Pros:

1. I like the people I'd be reporting to and they seemed to also really like me.
2. I understand and I'm excited about the job expectations.
3. There's a clear growth trajectory within a short period of time. 

Cons:

1. Previous employees that I personally know have had a negative experience (in a slightly different department, but it's worth to note the company in general has a bad reputation on Glassdoor... but so does Company A.)
2. Start pay isn't as high as I would've hoped, but it's clear they expect me to move up fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know the answer might be clear, but maybe there are things i haven't considered. Please give me your feedback on what I think I should do."

I was not even told what to change in my performance in this particular review meeting, just petty reasons like guilting me for taking a short leave (my first leave ever in this company) to visit my hometown, or being chatty with my coworkers during lunch.

I prepared custom CVs, wrote cover letters, and researched every company - no results. I found a local manager was teaching a course in my college about a thing I already knew, so I signed up and excelled there, which was enough to get me an interview for an internship with his referral. He even told me what to prepare for. There were some questions about inner workings of a technology and some programming task. I got the job! It was paying **$5.5k per year** (in Russia that's about minimum wage). I worked my ass off for 2 years, sacrificing all my time, putting my college on pause for a year, and basically burning out. It was a terrible work environment but I got my skills developed to a decent level. Then they lowballed me offering **$6k**, so I looked for a different job. HR noticed my active resume and snitched on me, which resulted in a very awkward meeting with my manager. I wrote a custom cover letter and a custom CV to a big bank and they actually responded! My skills were enough to get the entry-level position and my salary tripled to about **$17k per year**!

However, I may have relaxed too much, so, I didn't pass the probationary period, and they fired me. I decided to try and move to EU, so, for 3 months all day every day I've been applying everywhere gradually lowering my expectations but eventually, I got a reply from a startup in a small country Estonia! The interview was very easy, just a multi-choice questionnaire and a couple of behaviorals, doubled my salary to about **$32k**. Got the visa, worked there for 2 years, and it was awesome, traveled the EU a bunch even sometimes on the company budget. At the end of my work there my salary was **$48k**. Then COVID happened and I was fired due to company financial issues, so I started to apply anywhere in Estonia to save my visa.

After a [ridiculously over-complicated logic puzzle task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle), I got a job at another big bank with a pay cut because of the task to **$42k**! It was ok but I decided to start applying to US jobs as I really wanted to move there all along, it was unreachable before but now I got 4 years of experience.

After working at the bank for 3 months, I got a job at a super small US consultancy with a branch in Estonia for **$60k**. That was extremely lucky, my wife and I both sent out my CV to more than 1.5k jobs and only got this single reply. The interview was very chill with the owner where I simply showed some code I had already written for some other interview. I worked remotely for a year from Estonia, got to travel to the US a couple of times, and eventually got my visa. The consultancy had issues with clients for the last half a year so I basically waited for my visa without any income from them, so I had to hustle a bit on the side but it worked out.

Within 2 months when I got to the US, I interviewed with Amazon and passed through all their hoops like 1.5h assessment (2 leetcode tasks), personality/""what would you do"" test, HR screening call (behavioral), developer interview (leetcode + behavioral), and then a multi-interview 4-hour day (a bunch of leetcode + behavioral). I then transferred my visa to them and moved to Texas, and also I left my last paycheck behind for the small consultancy as a token of appreciation though. Even though I had 5 years of experience at this point they only gave me their ""entry-level"" offer but it's for a whopping **$170k**! So, after taxes, I now take home 10k every month. I've been working there for half a year, it's been great!

So I was laid off from my job in January, and I've been having a hard time finding a job in my field.  


I was thinking of trying to get back into a regular clerical position, just so I have some sort of income.   
My resume has my degree, which is Graphic Design and some of my duties include Social Media Management. 

But I'm starting to wonder if having my degree and social media duties in it, is giving the wrong impression and maybe that's why some companies don't seem to want to bother. Years and years ago, I worked retail and this one interviewer got on my case about why I was looking for a Clerical job, when I went to school for Graphic Designer (Uh, because I need a job and money?! lol)   


So I'm wondering if I should leave the graphic design and social media management out when applying for a clerical position. 

I thought maybe it would help because my first graphic design job, I had applied for a clerical position with that company and when they saw I had the graphic designs experience, they made me part clerical, part graphic designer. In my head, I would hope that would happen again, but things like that don't happen often.

What do you think? Should I leave it all out?"

I work for a small company that has acquired a client out of state. As such, they are suddenly ‚Äúrequiring‚Äù me to travel out of state once a month to visit our product to insure QA and help the remote employee as needed. 

I requested a meeting with management to discuss this sudden change in responsibility. Mostly in terms of compensation. 

I am expected to travel out of state and back in a days work (normally 8-10 hrs), totaling at least a 14 hr day. Upper management seems reluctant to compensate with a raise or with PTO the following day. This is additional work on my shoulders that is not expected of other employees and I do not come out on top financially in comparison. 

What are my rights here and what expectations can I have? Again, this was not agreed upon hire 2 years ago."

Long story short a common question in interviews is ""how i overcame something"" or ""solved a problem unconventionally"". I have two go-to stories of things I have done at my current work but i seem to get caught up when the interviewer follows up on it.

Basically i figured out a workaround in our system to acheive the same result but with many less steps and time saved, and I also figured out a way to help higher pevel people process requests from the lower level people by creating a specific email template/procedure. Neither of these things have been acknowledged as ""good job"" and neither have been officially implemented. Everyone I have shown how to do these new procedures now use them daily, and i have checked that we are allowed to use my procedures and they dont break any rules.

My point is, several times in interviews they have asked something about my department implementing my solutions as official procedure and whatnot. Is it best i tell the truth that no one seems to really care or appreciate my solutions (obviously not worded that blatantly) or should i try to dodge to make it vague if I have made an impact at my current role. I obviously dont want to lie and say ""everyone loved it and i got a raise and they declared me king of problem solving!"", but i dont want to avoid bragging about my acheivements in clever problem solving for interview material if it gives me a leg up."

The first 2 weeks were intensive trainings and it was just a lot of information at first, but I managed to keep up with the tasks, even tho I'm doing everything a bit slow.

Yesterday my 3 bosses (CEO, COO, Head of dept) had a meeting and they apparently talked about me. In the afternoon we had a team meeting with them and right from the start I could feel the conversation was steered towards me, basically all of them said that if I need help I should come to them, and I should start picking up the pace, and it's better to make mistakes than do nothing. They also  indirectly compared my performance to the other new co-worker, who started a month earlier than me, which I think is unfair. They said it nicely but I was shook! I'm angry and disappointed. I was very enthusiastic about the job and the company. Now I don't know what to do.... 

It really feels like it's not about how much you do, it's how much your boss thinks you do.

What should I do guys? How do I make my bosses think I'm performing better, maybe even better than I actually am?"

My job is also a contract position, I only have about a month and a half left. There is not really any possibility of extension and to be honest I don‚Äôt really want one. My job is about an hour away and I‚Äôve spent a fortune on gas driving back and forth. I‚Äôve tried to move into town where my job is but I‚Äôm also so depressed to be away from my friends, family, and SO. Being off of work made me realize how unhappy I was and how it‚Äôs not a great fit for me right now. 

I‚Äôm looking at other jobs especially with my contract being up. I found my literal dream job. It‚Äôs double what I make now, in my town where my family lives, and gives me more responsibility and actually let‚Äôs me develop professionally. I think I have a pretty good shot of getting it as well as I have some great connections. 

I just need some advice on what to do. I really love my current bosses and I don‚Äôt want to leave them early, I‚Äôd love to still use them as a reference. This job would be incredible if I got it and I‚Äôd be so much happier. I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôll be able to return to work in time for my contract to end.

The main reason for my search for a job abroad is that due to the lack of representation of my job line in my country where its very overlooked and pretty much deserted, employers here could not care less about their security and find the job redundant, and me wanting to fully pursue my security journey I cannot see myself continuing here due to lack of such positions that help me build the experience and due to not being able to buy certificate exams/vouchers without using shady and risky third-party sellers.

For some background, I currently work for a FAANG company as a contractor. My manager has given me the green light to apply to my heart's desire to full-time roles in the company(he wants me to become full-time since my current contract will not be extended due to a lack of budget). 

My dilemma: I can view all the internally posted jobs and I want to apply to multiple, however, two of the jobs are for different industry professionals: Business strategy and community management. If I was applying purely externally, I can easily tailor my resume for either business strategy or community management however, the hiring managers of both jobs work in the same department as my manager.

I doubt both hiring managers will compare my resume if I apply for both but I'm a little anxious that if I tailor my resume to two different roles, it might ruin my credibility (or something of the sort).

Any recommendations or suggestions? I was thinking of just submitting one resume that kind of reflects both job descriptions, but I want to maximize my chances of actually looking credible for both job."

I‚Äôve been a cabinet designer for 7 years now.  I started at one company making $13.00 an hour. I eventually worked my way up to $16.00hr in the 5 years I worked there(yeah, I know.)   When Covid hit, I was able to pick up a remote cabinet job that paid a the same.  But same job, but from home? Sign me up!  So I‚Äôve been here and the raises are much nicer.  I‚Äôm making $20hr now.   But I‚Äôm at a point where I feel under utilized and honestly, it‚Äôs really affecting my performance at work.  I lack so much motivation at times, it‚Äôs really difficult to stay focused on my work.

I just feel like I‚Äôm owed more. I mean, 7 years is a big chunk of my life and I can‚Äôt help but to feel I‚Äôm worth more than $20hr.  If that sounds selfish, please let me know!

Anyway, I‚Äôm not necessarily struggling financially as I make ends-meet. I‚Äôm not living paycheck by paycheck, so I feel I‚Äôm really fortunate. But I don‚Äôt exactly have a lot of spending money.  Which is a problem.  I‚Äôm getting married next year and have other expenses in my life as well.  So being able to make more money would be nice. That wedding isn‚Äôt going to pay itself sadly.

Now I found another remote job within the same field but a separate company, but they pay much more! Almost double! Any they require 7 years of experience, so it sounds like it‚Äôs meant to be. 

But here‚Äôs the scary part.  Im a homeowner paying mortgage, bills, car payment, insurance, basically the works!  If it doesn‚Äôt work out at this new job, I can‚Äôt pay those bills.  My current job is safe.  Is it worth leaving the safety of my current job to try and reach my potential at a new job?  Having higher pay would be such a huge help. But it‚Äôs honestly terrifying."

They have come back to me saying they need a written reference letter that is a description of my position and responsibilities, the duration of my time at the company, and should speak to my abilities/qualifications/contributions to the organisation. It must also be written by my supervisor, manager or director of my most recent company. 

I‚Äôm fine with all of that but I‚Äôm just wondering what the majority of people would be doing in my situation, I have a good relationship with my manager but I feel bad asking them to do extra work to help me find a new job.

Is it something that I should be writing myself and then sending to my manager for ‚Äúapproval‚Äù and then sending off to the new agency? Or should I be asking my manager to write some cringey essay about all of those things for me either in their own time or company time?

I‚Äôve been here for a month and a half but they‚Äôve been so nice and the manager has been really kind and everyone here is chill but in terms of career progression it‚Äôs much better to go for a real big company like the one that's offered me. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to leave this place in the most non chaotic way possible especially since 2 people in our office of 8 are going back to school (that‚Äôs why they hired me ) so if I leave too it‚Äôll cut their workforce by nearly half. I also feel sad because they invested so much education onto me already + they were joking around, we threw a lunch for the 2 folks leaving for school and everyone was like ‚Äúheyyy let‚Äôs celebrate the two quitters ‚Äú as a joke but for me it‚Äôs gonna be real it‚Äôs just gonna be so awkward if I have to stay another 2 weeks. One of the guys at the office has no filter , he‚Äôs been nice to me but I feel he‚Äôs gonna chew me out if he learns I‚Äôm leaving.

Today, me and my boss chatted about the weekend it was so nice and then I needed a box to return an item back to amazon and the front desk lady spent 30 minutes of her time finding me an empty box, and it just made me feel so sad I have to do them so wrong. 

I feel so guilty, if only they were mean to me then this would be alot easier but there is nothing wrong with this work place other than I think the advancement is a tad slow, guys have been there for a few years and only advanced one rank, whereas in the bigger company it's going to be a lot faster and the benefits are nicer and the pay is higher.

It's been causing me great turmoil because I don't know how to tell this job im leaving, they've done right by me for the month and a half i've been here but I can't turn this offer down. Also my manager is not based where I am at so when I call him on Microsoft Teams, the whole office will hear. I don't know what to do, I have been stressing for 2 straight weeks.

This has left me not wanting the job now.

I've had previous interviews where they talked crap about their previous employees and I'd let it slide and take the job and the environment was toxic af.

The reason I'm unsure is, the other four people did not. Here's the thing, the one who talked smack is the one who'd be above me. 

They said I could start right away, but I'm seriously thinking of just rejecting it. The pay is less than where I am now (except it would be bi-weekly instead of weekly) and I am not sure if there are any benefits. There's a commute and a 90 day probation period.

I know none of you can make the choice for me, but I just can't shake the feeling I'd be in the same environment as the previous places where they smack talked the people who held the job before me. 

What would you do?

Edited: Going to answer some questions that have popped up. She was definitely not joking. She was very serious about the people before me being stupid and incompetent. It was a very awkward moment.

Did I leave? No, I let the interview play out and they offered me and I said I'd think aobut it.

Am I taking it? No. I wanted to make sure I wasn't overreacting (I have autism so I may read people wrong) but I am absolutely certain she was not playing or kidding. 

Am I going to mention it in my rejection email? In a roundabout way. I'm also going to include her email address too. I know I'm making the right decision and I may regret not getting the experience, but I won't regret not hating going to work every day."

I worked at a pretty terrible staffing agency. I have been miserable for weeks now. Finally landed somewhere else.  Anyway, put in my 2 week resignation via email and within 30 minutes I was locked out of everything. Never got anything back saying this would be my last day. They just took away all of my logins so I couldn't even wrap up all my lose ends with dozens of candidates. My coworker text messages me an hour or so later saying ""so and so sent out an email saying you resigned and that you are no longer with the company."" And I was like, wow they sent the email to my team before they even told me it would be my last day. So today comes and goes and they never say anything to me at all about it. As it turns out this is pretty normal for them to go full Mean Girls when someone resigns.  

So here I sit, with all of my remote work stufd that I need to return. Waiting on further instruction. From who? I have no idea. But I'm assuming at some point they're going to ask for their ""think pad"" back......Tacky R US."

Position #1
Contract position at a big name biotech company (Genentech). 
-6 month contract
- Salary is from 130-160K (internal recruiter pushing for latter)
-no PTO and possibly expensive health benefits (haven‚Äôt gotten the exact monthly price from them yet) 
- no guarantee they will hire me full time after 6 months but there is a possibility depending on performance/need

Job #2
- full time with great benefits
- mid size start up company with good funding 
- asked if I would accept 90-95K. I let them know that 100K is my minimum but after hearing the second offer I would much rather be making 110/120K
- they seem to have some push back with the higher salary and with a higher level job title
- told them I have another offer coming in (both phone calls were in the same day with this one being first) and they asked me to keep them updated.

Which one would you take? What should I say to option #1?

3,2022-09-06,Been an Educator for over a decade and it's time for a change...but what??,u/mrdude12,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x7u07r/been_an_educator_for_over_a_decade_and_its_time/,jobs,"I've been a special education teacher for over a decade and it's not what once was. The reason I got into it is no longer the same. At this point in my life, the intrinsic reward of being helpful does not match the pay I feel I deserve. I'd like to work somewhere that rewards for success monetarily versus a handful of ""attaboys.""  Except I have no idea what to do. 

Short version of my resume:

* 10+ years of teaching math/science to special education and general education students
* Approximately 4 years of graphic design and fabrication work in the commercial sign industry.
* Brief retail experience (I did well, just found a better paying job) 
* Project management experience
* Some technical skills in the Adobe Creative Suite and other web design skills that are there, but rusty.
* Other random skills that could be too niche to do much with but make for good conversation?

My reasons to not leave education are: The time I spend with my family, teacher pension, and taking a job with less pay and more hours required. And honestly, the summer I spend working a part time job that I enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts on what I could do? Anyone got a million dollar idea they want to share?? LOL Maybe you're hiring??

I got weird vibes during the interview but it was my only job offer so I went with it. The communication between the guy's position I'm taking over and our boss is also weird (it's a tiny team, like 5 people max), where the boss doesn't understand the position or what he actually does. He came up to me today and said he wants my position to be office manager, even if that's not what I applied for. I'm just so unclear on what to do, because I wanted this to be a temporary job just to save up for a bit, and didn't sign up for this, and now I think they want me to have all this responsibility. It was never mentioned during the interview, but the position was meant to be temp-to-hire, and I feel the communication is just strained and I can never speak up for myself. 

I asked him to clarify later today, and just still feel like I can't get a feel for the job. It's just not what I signed up for and they're slowly trying to transfer the role to me (the guy I'm taking over will be meeting me on Zoom part-time), I already had my reservations because I thought I did terrible during the interview and didn't trust my gut even though I didn't truly want to take the job - I had to to make money. 

I kinda feel terrible and am experiencing cognitive dissonance, but don't want to be stuck in a role I just, entirely don't like. Help?"

All of us are part time (30 hours) and 2 people are full time (40 hours). A few months ago one of the more seasoned employees left. She was 40 hours. So she was replaced by a girl hired a couple months before me, and she became full time. I asked if there were any more possible full time spots opening up and they said no, but they'd let me know. I asked a couple times in the past.

Recently, I just got accepted to a program to return to school, lasting about 6 months. Tuesdays and Thursdays I'll be in class from 3:30 - 6:30 pm. We changed my schedule and I was good to go. 

One of the full time employees got promoted, so that opened a spot. They brought me, the girl who was 40 hours, and the girl hired after me that is also 30 hours, into the office to tell us they would be giving us more responsibility, and that giving one of us the spot would give us more tasks. Today i found out the girl hired after me was chosen. I asked about it, and she said that ""Yes, we chose her, but we're losing another girl so that'll open up more hours.""

I feel upset because I wasn't chosen. She's been getting more responsibilities as of late. I asked if my performance was good and they said it was. Could it have been because of my schedule change? I still want more hours.. I just wonder if they're working to promote her or they favor her. Should I ask if it's because of my schedule? Admittedly my ego took a hit."

So basically, I am in grad school and I‚Äôd like to apply for a job (25-40 hours per week) until I have to do a full-time internship around May. It‚Äôs September now, and some places that offer part-time work have actually turned me down because I had a full-time managerial job before grad school, and they think I‚Äôm too overqualified for entry-level positions like a Starbucks barista. Super frustrating, because a simple barista job would have been perfect for me right now. Anyway, my friend suggested I apply to Sam‚Äôs as a personal shopper, but they are wanting to hire full-time people. If I worked mornings, I would do 40 hours a week (no more no less) and be done by 12:30 for me to have the rest of the day to do homework. I would also get benefits during this time. However, I know that I will need to leave in May when my internship starts. Is it shitty of me to apply for a full-time position when I know I have a timeline? My past interviews have not asked me for what I plan to do when grad school ends, so I wonder if Sam‚Äôs will. I will tell the truth if they ask, but will this be a problem for me if I don‚Äôt mention it until I have the job? It would really improve my situation to have reliable hours like at Sam‚Äôs."

I work in a supermarket at minimum wage and after 5 years, I finally got a permanent job offer in my field. However, it‚Äôs for a small company and it‚Äôs a part time position.

My problem with that offer is that I don‚Äôt seems to get any insurance (maybe because of part-time) and I don‚Äôt get any vacation day for the first year and only 2 weeks after that.

Even if I currently have a sh*t job, my employer allow me to take any vacations I want from 2-3 weeks and some people even take months of unpaid vacations.

Mental health and work/life balance is very important to me. How can I negotiate that? Is that even possible to negotiate vacations?

I live in Quebec, Canada btw.

I was kicked off the company email and received a termination letter with no explanation shortly after. I asked them why and some of the reasons were:

Taking breaks, the company didn't need that ""kind of engagement"" in a fast paced, high stress work environment. I took a 15-20 minute break every day to grab coffee and walk around the block. I worked through lunches, worked 8-12 hour days and often on weekends. 

-Taking advantage of the flexible WFH schedule and working from home too much. Mind you I always asked for approval and made sure I wasn't needed in the office. My bosses worked from home frequently without even telling the team if they would be in the office or not. 

-Too many personal problems in too short a period of time. I was assaulted by a guy trying to steal my car earlier this month, had my roof partially cave in and had to go to funeral. I will admit my performance struggled, but my boss literally took 3 days off due to a panic attack before I was let go.

I never once received a bad review or had any issues brought up to me during my time there. They hired my replacement before firing me. 

I'm so done with giving shitty companies my all to get treated like garbage. In my decade of working I have never had anything like this happen to me. Feeling a little defeated from my career at the moment."

Except in my case. I was fired quite harshly by a bully boss and was jobless for over a year because he would not give me an employment reference and told Human Resources to tell potential employers that I was fired for misconduct and see that it was nearly impossible to get back on my feet.

Living in a small town I kept running into the ex-boss from hell all over town. It made my life miserable. Every time he saw me he asked me if I had found a new job yet. (He knew I had not.)

Two years later I had moved out of town, finally got a new job, and thought I had moved on. I went on vacation to visit family and walked to my seat on the plane and who do you think was sitting right next to me on the full flight- Yes, the boss from hell who had fired and blacklisted me.

I'm thinking ahead and seeing that any further promotions or pay rises from here will not provide as much take home increase as before. Are internal promotions still a standard 10-20% increase or is it common for raises to be higher as you move into higher ranks and higher tax brackets?

My next step will be a much bigger responsibility, but I'm now thinking it might not be worth it. In UK there is also a tapered reduction of child benefit from 50-60K, where it completely ends at 60K. With child benefit being 95p/m for 1st child and ¬£63 p/m for each child after, the jump from 50 to 60K is one of the bigger hurdles to get past in UK salaries to overcome.

If the status quo is that pay rises are the same at this level vs any other level, I can accept that, i just don't want to be missing out if it's common place to argue for larger pay rises in this range.

Some context, I would be moving from Senior Analyst to Manager. Current salary is 50K, based in UK.

  
EDIT: Please all know I am aware of the common misconception that higher tax brackets only apply to any salary above the threshold. I was hoping not to have put in this disclaimer, but this does not change the nature of my original question."

I am currently work in company A as a manager for production system with stable job, but underpaid and no room to grow anymore.
I have discussed it with my superior, but he wont even bump up my salary.
Although i love my job stability, i dont like the toxic boss that don't care and the under-payment.

I got a new job opportunity for quality manager in company B, and company B offered me assistant manager instead, because they said I lack experience but thought the assistant manager position would be a good fit for me.

I ll give a comparison:

Company A
Bonus: once a year
Medical insurance: yes
Contract: Permanent contract
Position: manager


Company B
Salary : 15% more than current salary
Bonus : once every quarter
Medical insurance: yes
Contract: fixed term contract with a possibility to become permanent contract
Position: assistant manager


I would like an opinion, what will you do if you were me?
Will you accept the work in company B?"

For context, I worked at Company A for about 4 years. I made a career switch to join Company A, and left a job where I was miserable. At Company A, I worked on a pretty small team and we had a great relationship. It wasn‚Äôt the perfect job or company, but the work was sometimes fun, I liked my coworkers, and it never really felt like work. Outside of very specific reasons, I never really had any Sunday scaries at Company A. I felt more than comfortable enjoying my life and being able to separate work and personal life. I left for growth opportunities and a higher salary. I am about a month into my new role at Company B, and I wake up most mornings and immediately think ‚Äúno, I don‚Äôt want to go to work‚Äù. It‚Äôs just not really what I thought it would be and I am already feeling so anxious about going into work everyday, something I rarely felt at my last job. The work/life balance is not great, and it‚Äôs very startuppy so there is MUCH less infrastructure than my last job. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôm anxious on the weekends about going in on Monday. Being that I previously worked somewhere where I was miserable, I know what it feels like and can see this job turning into that. I really don‚Äôt know what to do.

EDIT: it also was made aware to me after I started that Company B has had a hard time retaining people in my position and department."

I‚Äôm interested in pursuing a degree majoring in Business Admin with a minor in Finance since I feel it‚Äôd be relevant with my current and prior military experience. I used to be an escalations case manager for a popular electronics company. 

My current admin duties have me managing training and travel finance metrics for over 700 soldiers and briefing those things to the expensive people in my chain.

But I started 3 days ago and all I've been doing is the standard e-learning with little to no check ins from any team managers. I haven't actually met my team manager because he either hasn't been in the office or has been and hasn't introduced himself. No one's said how to log my hours or add myself to a teams group because I'm supposed to be going remote soon. 

My last job was really hands on during the training I was rarely left to my own devices in the first week so I'm not sure if offices are more handsoff and want me to be more proactive. 

It's also hard to get to know people because everyone seems really busy and they're all quite spread out so when they want to speak to their friends they walk across the office to do that. And at lunch I want to meet people but I don't want to be awkward and disturb someone's me time. 

So I'm not sure if I'm just over reacting because it has only been 3 days or if it's a sign that it's not as good a company as I thought it was. Does anyone have advice or has anyone been in a similar situation?"

I have been a manager all my professional life. I‚Äôm used to being in the decision making process. Not being included on it quite honestly makes me feel worthless. They won‚Äôt do anything about employee dissatisfaction either.

It‚Äôs a huge company, so yes I still get paid every two weeks. Thus I‚Äôm wondering if I should quiet quit and wait for my spring bonus (next year) and then leave or just look for something else right now. Another dept has a manager position I was interested in as well.

I‚Äôve been working full time for a bout a year and this is the only experience I have. I graduated in 2021. I enjoy leasing and helping people find apartments, but now that my property is fully leased, I mainly just deal with maintenance issues and complaints. It‚Äôs a new property but the builders did an awful job, the rent is ridiculously high and getting higher, I don‚Äôt even have an on-site maintenance person, and our vendors are terrible at communicating. Some of my residents have been without working dishwashers or water dispensers/ice makers in their fridges for 5 months because the appliance vendors are overbooked and understaffed and just awful at communicating. It‚Äôs overly stressful and I want out since I have no support from my company. 

I have a BA in English with a minor in Art, but my emphasis was on drawing and creative writing. To employers, I don‚Äôt think that translates well to communication jobs or graphic design jobs. 

I applied for an onboarding position at a property management software company, but I‚Äôm waiting to see if I made it to the final interview. I‚Äôve applied to writing positions and communication positions with no luck. 

I have experience in Excel, Outlook, etc. Technically I have sales experience, but I really don‚Äôt want a sales job cold calling people. I worked in the writing center at my uni, but again, that doesn‚Äôt translate well to editor positions apparently. I‚Äôm detail oriented, very good with data entry etc but that doesn‚Äôt really show on my resume. I‚Äôm really at a loss for what kind of jobs to apply for, especially since I want to work from home, preferably in tech. I plan on getting a UX and SEO certification, but those can take up to 6 months and I really want put of my current job before my mental health gets worse. 

Any suggestion or just similar experiences would be extremely helpful!"

Edit: sorry, forgot to mention that they said this was their final offer. I only countered once and this was their response. I was expecting some back and forth so the finality of it stings a little.

Edit again: okay, seems like my wording was confusing regarding the offer. The company offered $x/hr (which is $2 less than what I make now). I countered with $x+6 and they told me their final was $x+1. So no, I was not going to get paid $6/hr. 

And I did end up replying yesterday disclosing that their final offer was less than what I'm already making, and gave them my actual comfortable minimum. No response yet, we'll see. Thank you to the folks who offered guidance and reassurance! In the moment I was super disappointed and just needed some support and validation, so thank you.  To the 2-3 of you who were rude and insulting for no reason, I hope you're surrounded by opportunities to be treated with kindness and learn that being a gratuitous dick does not have to be your default lol."

I am going for my second interview as an HR Coordinator position with a bank. While it is an entry-level position for HR, I do have professional experience as a legal assistant in banking as well as about 6 months in a different HR assistant role.

My current salary as a legal assistant is in the low 50's.

Would it be reasonable to ask the Bank for around $62k-$65? That salary will definitely put me in a more comfortable living situation, and being that I do have some real-world professional experience I dont think it is too much of a reach.

This company makes really good money and it benefits to my boss and his family as the company is family owned since several generations. Our salary is of course a fraction of the money they make.

On the 4 employees, 2 are newly recruited and work well, 1 is on parental leave for half a year and there is me. The boss and I share the structural and essential competences with the employee who is on parental leave (not replaced for reasons below).

I‚Äôve been in this company for nearly two years and I‚Äôm recognized in my field. My boss and his mother have been really cool with me since the beginning and always helping. 

The only ‚Äúsmall negative side‚Äù is that as my boss is also the owner, he is the one who decides for vacations and salaries, and he already refused some vacations because he had some vacations on his own (but organized after I did). And no salary increase in sight despite asking.

I have always orally told him that I planned to stay in his company and that he could count on me. 

The problem is that I‚Äôve been offered a job in the same field but payed three times more, in an other state. Despite some organizational difficulties such as daycare for childrens, I don‚Äôt mind moving. 

I‚Äôm really motivated for this new job but I cannot be replaced in my current job because it is too ‚Äúniche‚Äù and there would be no candidate to replace me (as there already is no replacement for the guy on parental leave).

Therefore if I decide to take the new job my boss would be alone to do the work of three people, which would make the company fail the majority of their contracts. 

Would I be the asshole if I took advantage of my essential position and ruin the future of their company by leaving ?

I am left to do all the work while he works on his self-promotion.

I can leave in six months and I will as soon as that date has passed and I have secured a new job.

Does anyone have any advice on how to get through this with some sanity intact?

Job A (current job)

Title: Product Support (Tier 2 help desk)

Pay: $40,000 year


‚Ä¢	City: Central Florida
‚Ä¢	96% remote (can move anywhere in US)
‚Ä¢	Small tech company
‚Ä¢	Very easy, lots of downtime, I probably actually work 4 hours a day.


Job B:

Title: Enterprise Tech Support


‚Ä¢	Pay: $50,000-$60,000+ year (no final number yet)
‚Ä¢	City: 99% remote 
‚Ä¢	Large Communications Company


I know it seems obvious to go for the one with more money but the job sounds really stressful. At my current job, tickets come in and we solve them ‚Äúas needed‚Äù we have a lot of meetings, but I like my boss and the laid back flow of everything. I am a bit worried about layoffs considering the nature of the company. I‚Äôm also doing more advanced work (level 2-3 Helpdesk)

At the new job, I will be monitored and tracked with strict KPI‚Äôs. I‚Äôll know have to take inbound calls, and deal with customers a lot more than I am now.  It will also be at a lower level than I am now (between level 1 and level 2 work)

The new company has a lot of upward growth, especially in the field I want to move into (Cybersecurity). The company also has better benefits, pays for tuition reimbursement, and is more recession proof

What do you guys think? I have been soft applying to places for the last few months and haven‚Äôt got many bites"

He is actually a buisness manager engineer and works for a ""study office"" (sorry, literral translation from french)  and is in charge of 'ground studies' for construction sites, most of the time, of individual houses or small residential buildings.

He does the quotation, organizez the intervetion of the technicians on site, tabulate the results, write the study.

This is not a job he likes. Too far from geology and the respect of the environnement.
And to be honnest it seems like there is not much orther jobs to do in this field.

I'm not sure if this is the right sub for the question but here goes.

I just recently moved to the States and I'm currently living with a friend to help me settle down with the essentials. Currently living in the East Bay area and I'm searching for Accounting entry work.

Main issue or concern I have is that I graduated around 2019 and briefly worked in public accounting for around 6 months before getting fired and interned for while before moving here. Then the pandemic hit and I got laid off and ended up working in retail temporarily, later moved to the States from Australia.

I have a goal of switching to tech/web dev in the future and I've been on the self-study route so far for around 7 months now and I'm no where near ready for applying for applying of dev roles.

Since I moved here I'm searching for entry Accounting roles to sustain myself, I have this gap year where I'm studying to ""switch"" to another industry in my resume - my concern is how do I address this with interviewers with the Accounting roles I will have interviews with? I'm sure most companies would want someone long-term to avoid having to train them again, and my gap year seems like a red flag for hiring managers since it looks like I would leave in a few years once I get a dev opportunity"

3,2022-09-07,(Rant) Resigning Immediately from Job,u/poppy_girl_12,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x8bzdn/rant_resigning_immediately_from_job/,jobs,"I (25F) have been working in the bioPharma industry for a little over two years now. I have been working at my current job for a little over six months now, and I absolutely hate it. My previous job was not that great but at least I had my awesome coworkers. Also my immediate supervisor wasn't the best, but he would still always tell me how much he appreciates me here and there. The real problem with my previous job was upper management of my department where they would keep employees from being promoted, paid fairly, and getting bonuses when deserved.

However, with my current position there is absolutely no upside to it. My coworkers all keep to themselves, the work is very boring, but most importantly my immediate supervisor is the most toxic. I am not sure if this is normal of a supervisor because I have not had that many jobs in my life, but here are a couple of things:

1) She is very lazy so she pawns of her dirty work on me to do with little to no instructions, and she expects me to pull something out of my ass within a week.

2) She has mood swings, I do not know if I will be getting Jekyll or Hyde that day. It's a lot to have to change up the way you approach her on a day to day basis.

3) On top of making me do projects and her dirty work, when I do get it done she doesn't show appreciation or signs that she is impressed at all. It is extremely frustrating

4) She is much nicer and compliments all the male coworkers under her, but doesn't treat me the same.

5) She barely shows up to work. Always ""works from home"". She either leaves early or doesn't even come onsite and she barely gives us a heads up. On top of that, she expects all of us to stay onsite though. It is not fair at all. 

6) What started my hatred for this job was someone was literally going out of their way to throw me under the bus and another supervisor from the same department stood up for me. Of course, MY supervisor was nowhere to be found that dat and did not witness it. When I talked to her about it the next day she treated me like I was overreacting and basically siding with the person who was ratting me out. 

7) I work on weekdays and no one is there to help me and when I reach out to her for help on teams, she replies back hours later acting like I'm still at work. 

I have been holding all of this in, but what really pushed me over the edge is I took today off because I was sick and she said the team is already spread thing, but if you really need to take off take off. Like I'm sorry why dont you get your ass in the lab and help then. Then she proceeds to send me an angry email reprimanding me about an overdue training I have and repeating occurrences will cause disciplinary action. She doesn't understand that i have been swamped with work trying to fix other people's mistakes without being noticed, and the thing she tries to be petty about is an overdue training. I cannot stay any longer, I never have anxiety or get stressed but this job and my supervisor really make me feel both of those things. I am planning on leaving my laptop and badge and a resignation letter at her desk this Sunday.

What do you guys think? I have been continuously applying to jobs and I have 20k saved in my savings although I pay rent and live with a roommate."
0,2022-09-07,Reflection on today's horrible interview,u/ThrowAwayAz_,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x8ccms/reflection_on_todays_horrible_interview/,jobs,"I had an interview today, that went horribly wrong. As i am currently reflecting upon it, i would like your thoughts on the matter:

Before we start:
- I am completing a master in mathematics with an equivalent of 3.5 U.S. grade (1.5 German grade). While i am completing my master thesis, i decided to apply for work
- I am also doing a master in mechanical engineering, and am currently at 3.7 U.S. (1.3 German) grade.
- The application is for a position as a research assistant in machine learning.

How it went:

- Unfortunately, i suffer from social anxiety and hence get stressed during job interviews, exams, ... . This problem gets exacerbarted due to the fact that i am not a native speaker of the language of work. I hence tend to make a lot of mistakes.

- The cause and consequence to this issue and the fact that i do 2 masters and that i don't usually speak or go outside. My communication skills are actually at zero. I am mentioning this, because a smooth talker can wiggle their way through tougth questions and not seem panicked.

1. They asked me what my favorite optimization algorithm was and to explain it: Well you see, i don't explain things to people. Equations and formulars are stucked in my mind and i just don't know how to bring them out. Basically i could see that they were disatisfied of my long and unorganized answer.

2. I applied for 2 positions at the same company. One was more theoretical and the other was more practical. They asked me which i would chose. I can do both. I study math and mechanical engineering but i couldn't say i could do both and i wished i have the communicational skills to properly handle the answer.

3. They asked if i were covid vaccinated. I said no. They replied that in this case the vaccinations (2) usually take more than half a year to complete and they are required for the job. I answered that i have not gotten vaccinated because it was not required at the places i have worked or studied. However that if required i could get started with the vaccinations today. Unfortunately i noticed how disfavorable this was.

4. The problem that broke the camel's back is when they asked if i have already submitted my master thesis, and followed that this was required for the work. I have not, every other course was done, just the master thesis which will be submitted this month hasn't been completed.


All in all, i got 2 greetings when the meeting started from both interviewers but only one greeting when i was leaving. 

This job is my dream job in the dream neighborhood and i blew it. 

What can i have done?"

I found out today, that I was passed over for a promotion. I‚Äôve been at this company for a little over 2 years and it‚Äôs my first job out of college. But I have ~1.5 years of experience from internships I did while I was in college. my manager has given me nothing but great reviews my last two years. 

last year I was even given the highest rating you can receive at my company, ‚Äú exceeds expectations‚Äù ( only like 10% of people at my company get this rating every review cycle). according to my manager - and even his manager- I‚Äôm doing everything right and they both have been impressed with my performance. 

yet, I was looked over for a promotion. Obviously I was disappointed but I kept my cool. I asked what areas I fell short in and if I was still on track for a promotion in the future. My manager said there aren‚Äôt any areas I fall short in but that the whole department is full of very qualified people and it was a hard decision. And that I‚Äôm still on track for a promotion in the future. 

He ended our meeting with saying ‚Äú let‚Äôs focus on ending the year strong and delivering our end of the year goals‚Äù  

I don‚Äôt know, I feel disappointed. I feel like the hard work I did the last two years didn‚Äôt mean anything and they‚Äôre just dangling this promotion to keep me from leaving.

Trouble is I have no post-compulsory education qualifications (I did A Levels in Literature, Philosophy and IT because I was interested in the subjects at the time, not because of any particular end-goal in mind).

I work an administrative job (part-time). It‚Äôs not ‚Äúbad‚Äù but I absolutely think it‚Äôs monotone, boring, and useless in the grand scheme of things. I have phone anxiety also. I feel incompetent because I am not very proactive and don‚Äôt know what To do sometimes.   


Now I started the new semester. I hate it, don‚Äôt want to study, no interest in anything, don‚Äôt want to go to campus‚Ä¶I feel sleepy all day‚Ä¶ Maybe it‚Äôs that I had a 4 month summer, maybe I just hate university.  


I have no idea what I would do as a job. I have an artistic/creative personality, but I wouldn‚Äôt do art for 8h/day everyday + it doesn‚Äôt pay well‚Ä¶.  


I have considered dropping out‚Ä¶ but it would be a shame‚Ä¶ I have good grades, lots of potential. And want a good salary.  


Anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do? Any advice?"

In my prior jobs I've been absolutely miserable, I'd have panic attacks twice a week sometimes. I've spent nearly 4 full years trying to get a job I'm actually interested in. I wasn't in the line of work I wanted to be in. Finally earlier this year, I got an offer. 

I live in a very high COL city, my rent is quite high, and with recent inflation, its been something of a nightmare. I took a paycut from 78k to 64k, and have probably the crappiest benefits package I've ever had. For the first time in years, I have &lt;1k in my checking account, as unfortunately the start of this new job coincided with a vacation I booked months ago when things were better. It ended up costing me a bunch while I was there. This was my first vacation since 2019, I needed it and still do not regret it.

That said, I'm not totally dreading waking up every day. I have projects I'm excited to do. For the first time, I generally want to go out of my way to start new projects and take initiative, rather than wait for people to start asking for stuff. My plan was to stay at this job long enough to build a portfolio, get the experience I need in my new line of work, and move on to somewhere that will pay me better. 

I guess I'm ranting a little bit, but I wanted to see if there was anyone else who is in a similar situation. How are you doing? was the decision worth it? How long did it take for you to regain your footing socioeconomically? Is your career path better for it?"

Basically I've been offered a job offer, but one that requires relocation to a much higher cost of living situation. Details:

&amp;#x200B;

* Currently making 87000$, would move to making 142000$ (plus some signing bonus / stocks)
* Just bought a house two years ago, mortgage is 1400$
* New area we're looking at around 3000$ to rent
* Current 401k match is 4%, new 401k match is 2%
* Getting 7000$ relocation funds
* Current job is very little stress, but also very little growth opportunity. New job would likely have more stress, but I'm hoping much better growth
* Both wife and I are late 20s

&amp;#x200B;

That's the gist of it. We're thinking with the mortgage on the house being so low, we might just rent it out for some passive income. But doubling our monthly housing payment is just a bit on the scary side of things. If I can provide more details please let me know.

Here's the back story - I work in the mortgage industry, and we just went through some major layoffs. I was kept on through the downsizing, and was assigned one of the busiest teams in the region. I also work employee loans because they trust me. Today I was asked to work an employee loan for a co-worker who does the same thing I do (but hasn't been with the company as long, and works for a much slower team) and as part of the set up process I have access to her employment history. So I wasn't snooping or even gossiping to find out this information. My feelings are hurt, I'm feeling taken advantage of, and very underpaid. 

My question is - How should I bring this up to my boss? With the cuts going on I'm terrified it will just give them ammunition to fire me, but I'm feeling so discouraged now to keep giving them my all. I've done 2 years on the job with no raises, and no incentive to keep doing my best. I'm wondering if it is time for me to part ways with this industry? Any advice is greatly appreciated!"

I have been counting and keeping notes because I am noticing a pattern.

Out of 1 month of putting in 200 applications here is what happened: *(I am in the US applying for remote sales jobs and I have ample experience in full cycle sales and startup experience).*

* 1 straight up was a NO SHOW to the interview
* 1 pushed job back to 2023 after having 1 interview
* 1 was a mega condescending bitch to my face who loved rejecting me although I have a decade of experience and was perfect for the role
* 1 company I go all the way to the last round and they reject me with a generic automated rejection email *(I also get a lot of those automated generic rejections regardless before getting an interview, that's probably the only good thing is that I know to move on without having to wait and wonder about those)*
* 3 ghosted me after the first round

Therefore I am now left with only 2 companies who I am interviewing with out of 200.

I'm noticing a lot more companies are ghosting even after you've met with them and had an interview. That is so not cool.

I can't take this. I have been doing this for nearly 3 years and I keep getting into positions where I am either laid off after a very short term or I am unfairly fired and not given a reason.

I'm at a loss as to what I am suppose to do when I am spending over the amount of a full time job each week and even weekends digging for jobs and applying, and by this conversion I am probably going to have to put in double or triple the applications to try and get a job.

I have spent ages preparing myself for these and I know all the formalities and STAR method, and have watched all the YouTube videos galore on the subject and whatnot and I think I am a strong candidate but I just don't understand why I keep getting rejected, and my resume is really good, even took a course etc.

I had an interview with CompanyX which went well; they offer great schedule flexibility, but pay low. I am interviewing actively and have a few other negotiations &amp; interviews processing that provide greater pay, BUT I don't have any offers at this point and I am very interested in securing a job (ANY job, if you catch my drift).

Here's what I'm wondering:

1. After interview with CompanyX, things look positive on the whole, but they circled back to say the starting payrate is firm. Because I have seen job postings, interviewers, and offer letters provide different numbers for benefits, I would like to get a solid set of numbers with CompanyX to best assess the opportunity. Can I reply to their recent message asking that they send me an offer letter to consider? How would you word this?  
2. I am HOPING that a different CompanyG does offer me a position, but I'm early in the process. Plus, they let me know the start date wouldn't be until the middle of next month.  What are your thoughts about me moving forward with CompanyX even though I am hoping I could begin working with CompanyG next month?

The job also allows negative or borrowing PTO and I probably need to ask for some to cover the whole vacation. Just want to see if others have been able to go on vacation with similar situations.

7,2022-09-07,Excessive meetings are not just a quirky excess or mild inconvenience. They're actively hostile to employee productivity and a drain on worker wellbeing.,u/Beautiful-Opinion554,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x8jcxu/excessive_meetings_are_not_just_a_quirky_excess/,jobs,"It's kind of a commonly passed-around trope that office culture has a problem with meeting excess. I can Google ""meetings are a waste of time"" and get plenty of results that nod towards this idea that companies should settle down on the meetings or rethink the way they do them.

This sentiment doesn't begin to touch the problem, in my opinion. It's not just that ""too many meetings don't have an agenda,"" or that ""there's too much off topic conversation in meetings."" Those aren't false, and are fragments of the issue, but the truth is that the vast majority of meetings with 3 or more people are a **hardcore net negative**, hands down no question about it.

There are kinds of verbal exchanges that *appear to flow more quickly and efficiently* in the form of vocal conversation. People who are extremely sympathetic to a ""meeting culture"" hyper fixate of this kind of exchange and assume that because of this, meetings are universally a net positive when compared to email or chat. This gets massively oversold as a kind of ""next level collaborative mojo"" when really it's just an aesthetic of ""quick chattiness."" Furthermore, the analysis stops here and no one, in kind, identifies the *several* equally negative problems with meetings that, in my opinion, at least cancel out and probably far outpace the advantages.

I had two meetings today, one virtual and one in person, that both went over time. Between the two of them, I experienced 1. listening to people in other departments give updates on tasks that I am not a stakeholder in, didn't know needed to be done, and the outcome of which had no impact on my day to day, 2. two people (of a group of about 12) struggle to articulate concepts to each other, and take about 10 minutes of the meeting time essentially having a two person conversation in front of an audience, 3. one portion where, at the end of the meeting, our conclusions from the meeting were summarized, at which point one person out of the group said ""wait no I thought you meant X"", causing us to spend another 15 minutes clearing up one person's misunderstanding, 4. a few cul-de-sac moments of too many people talking at once and needing to ""pull back"", and 5. a lot of casual chit chat and filler. Among other things.

Both meetings had an agenda and a succinct stated purpose.

In a meeting, for every quick flowey exchange of words that appears to be an example of highly functional communication, there are 5 clunky and redundant faceplant moments like what I listed above.

Now, this is life, not everything is fully optimized and perfect and I'm not here to demand that things be that way. But now think about *how many meetings happen on a weekly basis,* and imagine this level of dysfunction being repeated ad nauseam day after day. As I stated earlier, the idea that meeting fixation is not always benificial is not out-of-the-mainstream, and it's a sentiment that pops up in business/workplace discourse from time to time. Yet in spite of this, many companies *aggressively defend the idea of meeting frequently and demand that it's essential to their culture and their success.*

Some people actually have *lots and lots of grunt work to do,* and are not in that echelon of higher-up exec where essentially all they do is meet and BS. And for these kinds of workers, being constantly pulled into meetings just to witness people have one-on-one conversations and overcome interpersonal communication barriers isn't just slightly annoying. This is the kind of thing that makes the difference between getting all your work done in your 40 hour work week and needing to open your work laptop on Saturday.

It's not enough to gently remind people to stay on topic or keep agendas for meetings. People need to recognize that there's something in the air in the white collar office culture that drives people to want to meet, and that needs to be actively corrected for.

There needs to be a bias against meetings. This is the only way. People can't control themselves. Email. Chat. If you hit a communication wall while doing these two things, ring the one person you need to clear things up with. The impulse should not be ""oh here's a question, let's schedule a one hour meeting with 10 people."" The goal should be to wear away at the impulse to have meetings. Because that impulse is completely out of control today."

Thanks!

Why does Amazon pay so much more for video production jobs, compared to what other (large and small) companies offer for the same or similar positions/titles/experience level?

According to Glassdoor, as well as *one* of the job descriptions I saw posted by Amazon, they (apparently) pay 2x - 3x as much for the same jobs that I've been applying to, elsewhere.

... Like, a virtually unheard-of amount of $$ for an already decent paying role in my industry. 

ALSO...Is Glassdoor generally accurate about this data?
 Anyone know from experience working in videography and/or at Amazon if this info is correct? (If not, why is it listed as such)?

...Honestly, just more curious about what you guys think is going on here...what's their game? Guesses and conspiracy theories welcome. üôÉ"

I'm a 28F with a mortgage, no kids, no other debt. I'm lucky to be presented with a choice in two job offers within HR:

1. Hyper growth tech company with more demanding hours (average 50 hours a week) but it's an hourly position and qualifies for overtime pay. Company culture is debatable, as the high turnover is typically due to poor culture and lack of work/life balance. The base rate is decent at $97k, 25% bonus, and a $8k sign on bonus. Total cash comp can come out to $180-190k a year. Requires 3 days in office with over 1 hour commute in traffic each way. Potentially would need to move to be closer. 

2. Stable and established company with great work/life balance. Base at $90k, 10% 401k match, and 5% annual bonus on average. Manager is working to get a sign on bonus since the base is lower than my ask. I don't know what the bonus will be but I can safely assume it will be at least $5k. This position is currently requiring 4 days into the office (20 min commute each way) but means I won't need to pack up and move. 

What would you do in my case? I've spent a chunk of my career being underpaid, laid off, or I quit because of terrible company culture. I'm very tired of job hopping and just want some stability in my life at a slower pace. Right off the bat, it seems like I should go with the stable company for lower pay, but the tech company's offer seemed too good to be true, which is making me doubt. I'm also aware that this salary is not the norm for someone of my level in HR. My average base pay should be around $100-110k (In CA) for my experience. So if I were to get fired or leave that company, chances are I'd have to take a large pay cut. 

Any advice or personal experiences appreciated!"

For context, they are both relatively the same role, within the same industry, with two competing firms and the benefits are relatively the same. I live in the suburbs of a major metro area on the east coast. 

Job 1: offered $140k. I countered @ $150k and they accepted. 5 weeks of PTO + 1 week of sick time. Annual bonus of up to $25k, standard options for medical/dental/vision and 401k with match. Located firmly within the city with some remote flexibility but the expectation is to be in the office. Offers 16 weeks of paternity leave but only if you‚Äôve been with the company for 1+ year (my wife is due in January) and therefore I wouldn‚Äôt qualify by the time the baby is born. 

Job 2: offered $120k. I countered @ $140k and they accepted (used my first offer as leverage). Bonus, time off and benefits are all relatively the same but this office is located within the metro area (not in the city) and closer to my house (less gas, less commute, but also less money). Same level of remote flexibility but also expectation to be in the office. Also offers 16 weeks of paternity leave but with no length of service requirement (or so I was told, they are confirming). 

Objectively, which offer would you take given the facts presented? I countered job 1 to offset added commute time, gas and parking in the city. Job 2 offers free parking for my level of position and again is closer to my house. 

Thoughts? Thanks, in advance!"

I recently started a new job and actually really enjoy it. It‚Äôs part time, not bad, and I work hard and do really well. I get along well w everyone, too. Unlike some horror stories I read online, it‚Äôs pretty great.

Anyways so yesterday I got notified that my 3 shifts for this week were removed (in the Teams app). I texted my supervisors saying I noticed this , and she read it and ghosted me. Very weird, I feel suddenly shut out and strange. 

Apparently they were able to run the cafe without anyone to bus tables and wash dishes and roll silverware ? (I checked team schedule and no one was doing my job). And the other guy who also does my job is schedule for a few days this week. Honestly I think I work harder than him. The only thing is I have missed a few days of work since starting. But I wish they would tell me that‚Äôs why. If that‚Äôs why. I work very hard. And relations are great. And now I‚Äôm suddenly removed from schedule and ghosted? I texted the manager above the supervisor, maybe she‚Äôll get back to me. I told her I‚Äôm fine w working 3-4 shifts a week and asked her if there was any reason I was taken off for a week last minute. Again I work very hard and probably harder than the other guy they have scheduled, and usually when he‚Äôs scheduled I‚Äôm there too so it‚Äôs 2 people doing our job (bussing, dishes). Maybe they‚Äôre trying it out with just one person and chose him? Or in the case of today, nobody doing that job? Any ideas?

Honestly I feel a bit duped for trusting these managers too much, idk. Or being too trusting/nice. Then this happens. The fellow employees are cool though.

I'm looking for ideas on careers that match my skills that I may never have thought of. 

I've spent 15 years in the oil and gas industry as a pipefitter (with stints as a foreman or lead hand), equipment operator and laborer as well as some time as a residential plumber and safety manager. The last 2 years I spent with a piercing jewelry startup, researching and developing finishing processes and managing the shop, then leaving due to incompetent ownership. I find myself unemployed and unsure of where to go from here.

I'm not afraid of hard work, but a damaged rotator cuff and compounding injuries from 15 years of construction plus a case of diverticulitis makes getting back on the tools a tough go. I just can't put out like the younger people anymore.

I ended up LOVING the work, am an inventory/cost accountant for a large wholesale electronics company. Was my first taste of cost accounting and I absolutely loved it, had worked tax accounting before and some trust accounting.

I started almost three years ago as an Accountant I. When the whole federal threshold changed in December 2019 for exempt employees it was discussed to get me bumped up back to a certain salary so I can become exempt again. In February 2020 a teammate announced he was moving to a different team within the company, so the opportunity opened and instead of just promoting me, they consolidated majority of his work and mine and bumped me to an Accountant II. 

That was manageable, it had its busy moments especially when End of Month reporting came, and especially especially when End of Quarter came. But ultimately manageable.

Well I went through 2020 and 2021 content, but when inflation really started rising beginning of 2022 and we were on year three now of no raises, I voiced my frustration to management. Their resolution was to bump me again to Accountant III to fill a position that had been vacant for four months, with all the work building up causing a huge backlog. I was fooled into thinking it was a ‚Äúwell oiled machine‚Äù though, so I accepted the position and started March 2022.  

Biggest work mistake of my life. It was not a well oiled machine. There is such a large backlog that even the previous person hadn‚Äôt gotten it under control with the 2.5 years they were working on it. It‚Äôs from a subsidiary company we obtained a few years back, and apparently no one from the original company is with us anymore, and there is no proper documentation on how to process items. I can‚Äôt ask anyone for help, I‚Äôm always told ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, ask ‚Ä¶‚Äù. I go to those people and four redirects later I hit dead ends. I‚Äôm told to do ‚Äòtrial and error‚Äô in production data until I figure it out. Then when I do that (which I feel uncomfortable doing already), I then get asked why I did something, to which I reply it was my ‚Äòtrial and error‚Äô, to which they respond to just come to them to ask and they‚Äôll help. And it‚Äôs just a vicious  circle from there.

On top of that, another person left our team in June, and guess who was her backup if she was OOO. And I‚Äôm the only one on our team that knew her work.

And no replacements have been hired.

So I‚Äôm working essentially four jobs right now. They check in occasionally (‚Äúhey how ya holding up?‚Äù) but they are expecting the same output of work. I just stayed up until about midnight for the third day in a row (that‚Äôs right: Monday a company holiday as well), and worked late Thursday and Friday last week, because it‚Äôs another EOQ. We have a huge partner review to prepare for so that will take up majority of my time the rest of the week. Thing is, the part I need to prep is for that backlogged job I have no help/resources for, so I‚Äôm basically thrown in a lion‚Äôs den until I‚Äôm choking up and on the verge of tears.

I can‚Äôt take this anymore. My brain is in a constant fog, all the time not just at work. I‚Äôm burnt out. This isn‚Äôt worth it. I worked at a CPA firm before so I get deadlines will have longer days, but god damn man I‚Äôm ALWAYS FUCKING BUSY FOR LIKE 10 HOURS A DAY AND NEVER MAKE A DENT IN MY WORK. All the while people are escalating emails to management because I‚Äôm not responding. BECAUSE I LITERALLY DON‚ÄôT HAVE THE TIME TO GO THROUGH MY INBOX.

I reached out to my supervisor, manager and director in an email laying out all my frustrations and struggles in July. I thought it was a positive response and they put job postings out that week to expedite new hires. We have one person starting in two weeks but they hired a level down than what they need so they won‚Äôt be able to actually take on a decent load of work. The other position is still posted with no hits.

I feel bad for my team because we‚Äôre already struggling, but I can‚Äôt keep living like this just to help others out. Another person on our team keeps saying they‚Äôre polishing their resume cause they‚Äôre overwhelmed. If they‚Äôre ready to leave then I should be.

I‚Äôm scared they‚Äôre gonna convince me to stay, I‚Äôm bad with that sales mentality where they always have a response to your concerns in order for you to give them what they want. I‚Äôm scared I won‚Äôt find another job I liked as much as this one at the beginning. I‚Äôve loved WFH, and scared I won‚Äôt be able to find another job that offers it.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk."

It‚Äôs a remote/ field based position. I‚Äôm 4 months in and I have had pretty much zero training, I still don‚Äôt have access to a key computer application needed for me to do my job properly plus waiting for other things. My boss/director is pretty much hands off when it comes to actioning anything I need. But the company is dumping work on me like I have been doing the job for years. Last week my boss advised us all (her team) she would be out on vacation for 2 weeks. When the day before her vacation was starting she advised she would be doing some work the next day in the morning then leaving for vacation. She sent me a Teams meeting invite to have a catch up meeting for 9am, I accepted, I joined the call and she never showed up. I waited online for 20 minutes, I sent her a message on there telling her I was waiting and did I mix up the time? Zero response. A couple of hours later I sent her an e mail inquiring if the meeting invite was in error because i was waiting and she did not attend. Zero response to that e mail. Her out of office popped up saying she was on vacation and was not reading e mails. 10 days later I don‚Äôt hear any response from her no ‚Äúsorry I couldn‚Äôt meet with you‚Äù or nothing‚Ä¶. But she has been sending out other group e mails on other subjects.
So I‚Äôm actually furious about this. It‚Äôs a regular occurrence she ignores e mails and even texts (my colleagues told me she is ‚Äúbad‚Äù with e mail) This is a director in a major company‚Ä¶. What gives? This is just so incredibly rude to me to just ignore a new employee who has questions/needs support.
I told myself I will give this job a year before making any hasty decisions about quitting but I‚Äôm irritated and demotivated right now."

Apologies in advance because this is absolute word vomit. 

I‚Äôm an intern/TA at a high school and my job description is really up to interpretation. I deliberately applied as a TA but our new boss has given us new schedules for this new semester that include me helping admin input data and less helping teachers in the classroom. I deliberately went over his head one day and did not attend admin and instead helped out a teacher. The school day ended and I walked into the administrative lounge/office to grab my stuff and go home but I was met with three (including my boss) men who are just sat around at the end of the conference table. My boss asked me ‚ÄúOh hello are you finally going to help Mr.___?‚Äù mind you I was completely not expecting any sort of sarcasm so I told him I could help out right at that moment. He proceeds to say ‚ÄúAre you in lunch? Are you sure? Check your schedule.‚Äù I told him no, still completely oblivious and because it was the end of the day. Mind you, the admin staff member I was meant to help was one of them and his face was clearly annoyed and angry. My boss then instructed me to sit down next to where he was at then proceeds to motion to the other men ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go‚Äù and they all left? I am SO incredibly confused by the situation except that I essentially felt degraded by the whole thing as I think he meant to teach me a lesson. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have gone over his head but I wish he had given me a straightforward warning instead. I just sat there for forty minutes really upset over the whole thing. I feel incredibly stupid and dramatic over this mostly because it‚Äôs my fault but I don‚Äôt know if I should directly confront him about being straightforward as he had made me uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt want a hostile environment but I feel like I need to stand up for self but I‚Äôm nervous. I‚Äôm not sure if he was suggesting I was not doing anything at work and was taking ‚Äúlunch breaks‚Äù?? There‚Äôs really no context behind that. Oh boy.  

If you read up to this point thank you so much, honestly. I‚Äôm just lost and not sure if I‚Äôm overthinking it."

I had the opportunity to work for a much bigger hotel in a bigger brand and I took it because I really wanted to try planning bigger events. I've been there 1 month (not long I know) but I kinda hate it. I hate the office culture, don't particularly like my colleagues and my manager, I felt very left in my own at the beginning, no proper training, procedures are all over the place, and I don't feel I can give my input because people are too busy and not interested.
I hate coming to work in the morning and want to cry in the evenings.

Now when I left my previous job they restructured the department and open a position as senior manager (a proper right hand to the director), I made it clear I wanted to leave and there was nothing to do to make me stay so I wasn't considered for it. They are still looking and they are in a bad place because of understaffing, I have been thinking of applying. It would be a bigger salary, opportunity to grow in my leadership and make a difference, and it's worth mentioning that I didn't really leave because I felt I had nothing to learn anymore, I just had that opportunity and wanted to try .

My only concern is I know I haven't given much time to my current job and I haven't even gotten to plan the bigger events I wanted to.
Although my old hotel has a sister property with same size so that could be an option in the future maybe (there are only a few this size where I live). But the senior manager position is open now and I'm worried if I wait and really don't like this job it might not be anymore.

Any advice?"

 Also what if the bullet points aren't aligned by the system, even though it seems to be? Like in Word, when you highlight one bullet point, the others below it that are also aligned will also be highlighted. For one of my experiences, when I highlight one bullet point, the others below it aren't highlighted, meaning that they aren't aligned according to Word. Will ATS flag that?

0,2022-09-08,New to the job? Want to advance in an office environment?,u/thatburghfan,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x8z7ck/new_to_the_job_want_to_advance_in_an_office/,jobs,"Just sharing some observations that have worked for me to move up over time while also not burning out, and how I saw it work (or not work) for others.

* Bosses like people with skills but they also like likeable people. Be likeable. The brilliant crank keeps his/her job, but will be off to the side, never in a leadership role, and secretly the managers want to get rid of those people.  We had a genius engineer who could never be wrong. That meant he would never help plan the work or commit to ANYTHING because it might not go as planned and make him look bad. So every meeting all we would hear is ""Don't know how long that will take.""  Eventually they stopped involving him with planning, and he got pigeonholed into a ""consulting"" role.
* If your co-workers are slackers, figure out how to be productive without being flamboyant about it. And be grateful they make you look good by comparison. At one of my first jobs, I had a guy tell me I needed to slow down because I was making the older employees look bad, and I should be more compassionate since they can't produce at my level any more (this was a desk job, not physical labor). It was just a smokescreen so that guy, a slacker,  didn't look bad by comparison. 
* Make it easy for your manager to move you up. Biggest mistake I see is people not working on the goals set in the annual review. Every month set a reminder to review your goals and make sure you're still on track to meet them. Then six weeks before your review, write up your own self-review that documents what your goals were and the things you have done to achieve them. Include things you did that weren't directly related to those goals. This is probably the single best thing that worked for me.  Bosses hate doing reviews. If you hand your boss what is essentially a pre-written review the boss can adapt and re-use, I promise you it will be re-used if you wrote it in an unbiased way. And don't be afraid to point out where you fell short and why. No one is perfect and it shows self-awareness of where you can improve.  If you've asked directly what you need to do in order to move up, and you do it, and you put it in your self-review, it's tough for the boss to ignore it. If you want to move up, say so just so there is no misunderstanding.
* Find out what your boss wants, and give it to him/her. Be careful not to always do the things you find easy or what YOU think is important. It matters what the boss thinks is important and doing those things lead to promotions and raises.
* Be dependable. Bosses hate excuse-makers, and they see right through those lame excuses. Deliver what you committed to. That alone will put you in the top 10%.
* Keep developing skills. Come up with ways to make your own job easier and less time-consuming. I streamlined some of my duties, giving me an extra 3-5 hours a week. I used that time to learn how to do something new. After a couple months I told the boss I could help out with X since I have learned how to do most of it.  I was doing more but not working more. I also wasn't shy about pointing out tasks that I felt added no value and maybe we should stop doing those. I was frequently wrong, but the discussion pointed out things I didn't know so I had a better grasp of the big picture.
* Be observant regarding who has clout. Does the boss tend to always agree with Jane and rarely with Joe? Then be more like Jane and less like Joe. Usually there is an obvious path to follow.
* Develop a network of contacts. Easiest way is to volunteer to help people. If Dave is swamped with end of the month work because he was off sick for a couple days, offer to help out for a while.  If you need a favor down the road, Dave will likely be happy to help.  It's very valuable to have contacts in different departments.  And remember the admins, too. They often hold power you don't see on org charts. Be kind and help them out when possible, they will definitely remember it.  And if you see your company is doing some volunteer thing or hosting a group, that tells you right there the company sees that as a valuable effort. Volunteering to help at such things often lets you rub elbows people higher up. Make a good impression, and one day when managers are discussing promotions, you might have someone in addition to your boss supporting your promotion. 
* None of this is to suggest you need to be a lackey, a kiss-ass or a workaholic. It's managing your own progression in an achievable way.  You can't sit back and hope someone discovers your underutilized skills. 

Of course, not everyone wants to move up because it may come with undesirable side effects (heavy travel, duties which others have failed at many times, etc.). That's when it might be better to move laterally to another department or company to find a growth path more compatible with your desires."

- Not all dogs receive walks each day 

- Disorganized management 

- Dogs pacing/ howling constantly

I was prepared for the kennels being noisy, but a lot of the dogs go without walks because there's very few staff and it breaks my heart. They're just sitting in their kennels for hours each day with the odd 10/15 minute walk in the field if they're lucky or if it's a day when their owner receives updates in the form of pics/ videos (always staged as if the dog is having these epic long walks and play sessions everyday).

I've heard other kennel assistants say things like ""I work in kennels and I'd neverrr put my dog in kennels.""

This is my first time really negotiation on a job offer and I'm pretty nervous. 

I'm negotiating a job with an online ecommerce company to be their digital experience manager (the title they suggested for me is Strategic Project Manager in order to keep it in line with their business expectations and to give me the freedom to work on projects with any and all departments I need to in order to improve their customer experience). 

I've negotiated a few things I wanted pretty easily like working from home &amp; the title change (originally I was supposed to be a PPC Strategist but during the interview process, it became very clear they wanted me to have a much broader role than just PPC). 

They initially offered me a salary with bonus. I counter offered with a salary offer that's 16% over what they intially offered me. It was at the high end of the range I quoted them, but is a little lower than the average for the position that I'd be doing. 

I sent the counter offer 2 days ago. 4pm today will be 48 hours since I sent the counter, and I've not heard a peep from them. Nothing like we'll look into this and get back or anything. When I negotiated the title change, the hiring manager emailed me back within 20 minutes and now I'm almost 48 hours out with no contact at all. I'm freaking out a little bit that they'll rescind the offer or that I pushed too hard on negotiation. 

TL;DR: I countered my initial salary offer with a 16% raise &amp; title change. Got the title change easily, but haven't heard anything from the company in almost 48 hours regarding my salary counter. Should I be worried or is this normal? I'm trying really hard not to freak out, but I'm freaking out. It's more money than I've ever asked for, and I'm worried that I may have pushed them too far &amp; they'll rescind the offer. 

I do know or at least feel fairly confident that I impressed the team quite a bit and that there is absolutely no one in their hiring pipeline that could replace me, but I still worry."

The HR and my boss sent out a promotion application for an internal promotion to be a assistant to the director. I had all the qualifications possible, and sent in a resume and cover letter. 

For the past couple of months I have gotten MANY compliments on my work, my work ethic, have had both of the owners who still work at the company come compliment me on how productive i am (even on the day of the interview)how I have the best turn around time for samples (literally was given the paper to prove this), I‚Äôm the most versatile, I even got told I was the best analyst by my boss‚Äôs boss and that‚Äôs why I get the most samples. My boss and I also have a great relationship. 

I thought the interview went great. I was really excited for. There were 4 people including me who applied for the job, only one person I was nervous about going up against because she has been in the industry much longer than me and had been at this specific job longer than me. 

BUT they end up going with a guy who has been here at 6 months (I‚Äôve been here almost a year) and does not do nearly the work I do. I mostly see him standing around, doesn‚Äôt do nearly as much as I do, etc 

There was another person in the interview room who used to be the lead (who is now higher up) who definitely favors him. 

I‚Äôm not upset at the guy because that was not his decision but I‚Äôm kinda hurt I got passed over after all the compliments and appreaction I‚Äôve gotten recently.

I have recently started applying for new jobs about 4 months ago and have never heard back from anyone. I have had about 3 interviews and got nothing back. So I recently had a job interview yesterday and got offered the position. The pay is alright however I will be having to split my time between the local office and the office that is 1 hour away from me every 2-3 days a week. I asked about bad weather and they said they rarely close for weather (which Driving makes me very nervous and in the snow it‚Äôs even worse so having to drive an hour in the snow seems like I won‚Äôt enjoy that) I also asked about PTO which I was told I get 0 days of PTO the first year that I am there. After my first year all I get is 1 week worth of PTO which includes sick time. Why this makes me question is because I don‚Äôt personally feel like 1 week is enough. I don‚Äôt want to be in a position where all I can do is work and not take any time off to go anywhere outside of work. I was planning a dream vacation for next year to Japan that if I take this job will no longer be able to happen. As much as I hate my job where I am now they let me take off whenever I want. My parents have told me ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt get hired anywhere else if you don‚Äôt take this job it will be the biggest mistake you ever make‚Äù while my one friends mom has told me 1 week after a year is not with it at all and will burn me out, especially since the pay is only 50 cents more than what i make now.

So the manager called me today though, so my base pay would be 15.97$ an hour which is salaried and then I would be projected to make up the rest doing 9k$ in sales. Now I know the store, we rarely make those sales at time.

My girlfriend works for the same company, at a different location, in a different department.

I know poaching sucks, but I want more money, and I‚Äôd actually get to see my girlfriend every day, at least a little.

What things should I consider before I accept their offer? Would this have consequences outside of my current location?

4,2022-09-08,Should I wait to go back to the job I just quit or try to find a new one and move on?,u/aunttjemima,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x92wex/should_i_wait_to_go_back_to_the_job_i_just_quit/,jobs,"

This past Sunday, I did a no call no show at my job that I had been at for 8.5 years.  No history of discipline and perfect attendance record.

What lead up to it is a long story.  Basically, my district manager was asking me to cover up that a manager from another store who was closing in this store overdosed in the office in front of minors working that night.  I heard the truth on Saturday from everyone who was there the night this happened.  

We've been operating without a district manager for over a month now and so I've taken over the responsibilities of that and love doing it.  But every time I would do anything that a GM would do, the DM would get mad and say she wanted to do it.  So new applicants are going ignored, food safety is her last priority, truck orders and schedules not done, invoices not entered, inventory not done, equipment not getting fixed, and the store's cleanliness has ranked.  And I finally had enough because this, on top of covering up for an overdose, is not what I worked for all these years.  

So when I didn't show up on Sunday, the store didn't open until after noon because nobody told her that I wasn't there.  Everyone scheduled to work that morning just went home because they couldn't get in the building.  Five people have already quit since finding out I'm gone because they liked me and hate the DM.  

The company has lost so much money this year under DM and her bosses and the franchise owner know this.


Now here's my predicament:

I actually liked my job.  I know a general manager of a fast food place isn't a glamorous job but I liked it and felt comfortable at it, that's why I stayed so long.  But when I couldn't do the job because of DM, I felt like I had no role there.  DM's boss has already reached out and said I can come back any time and that she doesn't blame me. She is going to try to convince the franchise owner to get rid of DM.

I have an interview at a factory this Friday.  I know it's just an interview and it's not like I've been offered a job or anything but I don't want to leave the field I'm good at. I liked my job and have a very hard time seeing myself doing anything different.

Even though I have no income right now, I have a huge emergency fund and want to wait this out until DM is gone. I would love to have the time off and can afford it. But I don't want to bank on it just in case that doesn't happen. And since I already have an interview scheduled for the factory, I don't want to blow it with them by cancelling or turning down an offer if I do show up.

It's been a very long five days since I quit and I regret it but I also don't because something needed to change.  I want to go back because I worked so hard at it but I can't continue working for the DM.

So what is the best thing to do here?"

Job A (which is the one I want the most) called me in to complete on boarding paperworks, which I did, but I still had to wait for an official offer from the state HR department. A few days later job B called with an official offer, I told them I would like to wait for a week to tend to family business (which I had to anyway, not a lie) to wait and see if the others will call. They said ok they will still send the official offer thru email anyway, never received it, so I thought maybe I blew it by telling them to wait. Then a day later job C called and officially offered as well, this time I said sure please send me an email. They did and gave me 2 days to answer. I have only a day left to decide if I want to accept job C‚Äôs offer, I‚Äôve been holding out as much as I can for job A. What I suspect is when I ‚Äúdeclined‚Äù job B, seeing as they are all state‚Äôs deps, they might have to go thru the same HR dep, HR turned to job C and told them to offer me the job. In that case should I decline job C, that would kick start job A‚Äôs offer? But in the chance that they are not going thru the same HR dep, declining job C is risky because I might not hear back from job A. I‚Äôm at a lost of what to do. (Sorry ahead for the confusions)"

13,2022-09-08,I've been offered a higher position with same salary of the original position,u/pasquale83,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x98ll5/ive_been_offered_a_higher_position_with_same/,jobs,"Hi, I've had a round of interviews for a Senior Manager position and we discussed also salary expectations and since my expectations where matching their budget, we agreed on a salary, let's say X, with the hiring manager.

When I talk to HR for discussing the whole package, they say they would actually offer me a Director position, that is a job level higher than Senior Manager. Salary does not change though, still X. Benefits also are the same. To be clear, executive positions at this company start at two job levels above, that is VP.

To be honest I feel they want to give me more responsibilities with same salary and benefits and I am disappointed. Or should I look at it as an opportunity to get already a more senior title?

EDIT: just to give a more complete picture. Accepting the offer implies a relocation to a city where cost of living is higher. Especially rent is double the one in my current city and house prices are huge.

I've used the numbeo website to have an idea of how cost of living compares and it's 10% higher when looking at net salary. I've then calculated the corresponding gross salary and added some percentage to account for the higher position/scope and the amount fairly matches the Director salary figures I collected asking to some connections I know working there already.

So a higher salary package is justified also by the higher cost of living, not only job level."

The recruiter asked me a few questions on my background and skills and within a week I had an interview with the department manager (not the hiring manager) of this company. They decided to offer me a job, which pays more than what I make more, however, the part that worries me is that I would be an employee of Actalent, not this company that I really want to work for. The recruiter emphasized that this is a long term position and has no end date listed, but she did acknowledge my concern that this means it could be a short term position as well if the employer decides to back out early. This of course, would be bad for me, wife, 3 kids, home, 2 cars, etc. Just trying to get an idea of how many of you have had a consultant job that turned into a full time position with the company?

How do I find jobs in aerospace or with vehicles in Europe.

I was laid off in June from a mortgage company that I had been with for 2 years. (Was with another for 5 years before that) It was HR's decision, my supervisor was not happy I was leaving, nor was she told. This left me a bit shaken as I have not been unemployed since 2015 when I graduated college. I was given 10 minutes notice and then was locked out of my system (remote job). I have a degree in English  with a minor in business and stumbled my way from a temp agency into mortgages where I was really enjoying it and doing a good job. Now, however, I've decided to work more ""in my skillset"" which would be writing. (I don't want to teach, I don't want to market, and please don't make me try to sell things!)

What's killing me is that I've submitted 5 applications and I've spent hours on my resume as well as had someone from the unemployment office review it too (their resources are great) in addition to others. I think it's pretty cool, does a good job of being humble while highlighting some great things I've done, and is well written. So what am I doing wrong? One was an application through email, but I'm worried it got caught in spam- should I apply through their website? (Both were options). Do I do a follow-up call to HR?

And what's with the ""If you're the right candidate, we'll call you"" nonsense? Just shoot me an email that says you're not interested. I'm sure that can be done.

Advice, commiseration, anything is appreciated. I've got unemployment through December, but it's not equal to what I was making and with rent increases, I'm getting a little nervous.

\*\*Disclaimer: I'm not against finding something else in the meantime if time runs out. I'm being picky now because I have time, but if December rolls around and it's nothing, I'll find something local and keep sending my resume out\*\*"

Both are better and closer to home than the job I started today.

It's a warehouse job, paying decent money and doesn't seem too hard. I was really excited to take it because I have a 9 month stint to save up money before I'm making a move to a different part of the country. Didn't want to get a job that expects me to be a professional or pour my soul into the work. 

The only problem, it's a major retail chain. I assumed there would be some ""mandatory"" overtime and I wouldn't have minded doing about a 48 hour work week to save up a little bit of extra cash. The job description posted said nothing at all about overtime, and that would have been fine as well. Today during our orientation they told us that they are starting peak season and a 60 hour work week will be required until the new year. The manager of training also told the 45 new hires that he expects approx. 15 of us to make it past 90 days. 

Low key was excited to get a mindless warehouse job just moving boxes (this is not what I think of warehouse workers, but the job description is literally just unloading trucks and pushing freight along).

Not so much excited anymore. Really hoping one of the other jobs I'm interviewing for come through. They will have some amount of overtime as well but the description says not to exceed 48 hours a week on those. 

Just feeling bamboozled and considering ghosting this place after my initial training. Figured I could get a factory job or a job at a chicken plant that pays similar if the one's I'm interviewing for doesn't work out. I know that's kind of shitty, but I really didn't sign up for 60 hour work weeks. 

Kind of just wanting to rant, but also looking for advice. Has anyone else experienced something similar and how did you react?"

2,2022-09-08,Late 20's Accounting Career Change Advice,u/drex123,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x9g9fn/late_20s_accounting_career_change_advice/,jobs," 

Hello Reddit,

Appreciate you all for taking the time to take a look at this post. If anyone has some insight, both positive and negative, providing feedback would be greatly appreciated. I am currently employed full-time in a role where I get placed on contracts with clients doing basic staff account duties. I am in my late 20‚Äôs, and now looking for a career change. I have an accounting degree and have worked several different staff accountant jobs over the past 5 years since completing my undergraduate degree. To say the least, it has been a sub-par experience, seriously affecting both my physical and mental health. I have decided on a career change, most likely a different position in a similar field, and think that hearing other people's opinions on moving forward would be very helpful and appreciated. 

I cannot handle the traditional accounting path anymore. I will give you a bit of background. Did a public accounting internship while still a student, did not like the experience, and decided to pursue industry post-grad. I was never an A+ student (didn‚Äôt struggle, but did by no means excel) and did not see pursuing the CPA exam as the best use of my time. Accounting was proposed to me as a path with decent pay, relatively low stress (depending on the industry), with excellent job security. A reasonable work-life balance is what I wanted, why I did not pursue the CPA license or convince myself that I would climb to the top of the corporate ladder. 

In each company, I have worked for between 6 months to a year. I have never felt comfortable at any of the companies I have worked for, always in a training phase of sorts, and never seemed to get the hang of things. Socially, there are no issues. I get along with and enjoy socializing with coworkers. I have little confidence about what I have learned in any of my positions over the years. While I understand accounting concepts, it has taken me a few run-throughs to grasp each company's way of doing things. All I know is as of now I need to make some life changes and do something different. I can go into more specifics about the jobs if you would like.

From talking with others, it sounds like I have not received the best training in the past. Never trained from someone that held the position prior to me, always ‚Äúhitting the ground running‚Äù, jumping between different employees piecing together how to do the job. In interviews, I make it clear I value training and am able to learn if shown how things are done. I did not learn what an SOP was until recently or that most companies have actual training programs in place. I know I made my own mistakes along the way, but can‚Äôt help but think I made mistakes by accepting some of the jobs I did. At this point, I am so defeated from never being able to fully adjust to a company or feel fully confident in my work that I could use some other thoughts. 

Mental health and substance abuse has had a severe impact on my life. The mental health issues, bipolar, were there well before work stress came into the picture, but (prescribed) substances came in after and started to have a negative impact on my life. After quitting my last job of a year, the most adjusted/ stable positive I've had to prioritize mental health, I was able to take the time to detox (still had the classic benzo withdrawal seizures) and stayed sober. A few weeks after starting my new position, I am back on prescribed benzos for unbearable anxiety and heart palpitations among other things. I refuse to live like this and know the cause is work. I‚Äôm caught in a negative feedback loop and could use someone to smack some reality into me. 

Being able to WFH, 100% remote would be strongly preferred. I got a dog a few months ago and both of us are happier with me here. I am much more productive and relaxed with my own setup. I would be happy to take lower pay for a job where I don‚Äôt have to experience this level of stress.

I can‚Äôt keep up with this amount of anxiety, stress, and overall failure. I am overwhelmed. Just need to get over the bad attitude and keep searching. I know there are decent options out there that could work for me, just need to keep grinding and will eventually find something that works. 

My current thoughts are on bookkeeping. I already have my own small LLC for a hobby business and imagine that with an accounting background, I could adjust fairly quickly to a bookkeeping role. The pay would not be as good and I do not see many options for advancement but it seems like the most logical option at this time. 

Since I am currently employed and coming off medical leave shortly, I want to figure out what to say to my manager on how to proceed. I doubt they would want to fire me as it would probably be easier to assign me to lower-level jobs. I can not accept another client with the expectations of the last. I am unable to watch someone perform a month-end close once and then have the expectation of doing it myself without assistance the next month without any questions. Even when the person training me told me it took them about a year to get comfortable with the month-end close, for some reason the expectation is that I could do it after a month. Is this standard? When speaking with my manager I will express my concerns about the previous client but do not know how to move forward from there. How do I express that I essentially want lower responsibility and less stress? Of course, this would come with an adjustment to my contract to decrease my pay. Just keep hitting mental roadblocks on how to relay my concerns about my ability to do my job to my manager. 

Any thoughts are appreciated. Thanks Reddit

The company is large, has great benefits, and pays well. Even though I had already accepted an offer I took the interviews. There is a good chance I get an offer from this company but I am struggling with the fact that I might have to balk at an offer I already accepted.

2,2022-09-08,Newer Manager Seeking Advice on Personnel Issue [or non-issue],u/ApolloUnitus,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x9gupc/newer_manager_seeking_advice_on_personnel_issue/,jobs,"I looked for a couple of places to post this and this seemed appropriate.  If it's not, I apologize and will remove it.  Just looking for some advice or guidance from other people's POV.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a newer manager.  I've been the operations manager for about 3 years of a smaller subsidiary of a bigger parent company.  I'm 35/m.  I have a crew of 15 people under me, all of them but 1 was hired by me.  The job is a manufacturing type job.

Here is my situation I need some guidance on.  I have an older gentleman who has resorted to following the ""putting my head down and getting my job done"" method with 3 employees, since these 3 employees are younger in age and a bit more immature.  They're decent employees but they are the 3 that I have to stay on top of because they tend to complete tasks and stand around for guidance rather than taking initiative and finding something else to do.  The older employee is pretty old-school in the sense that if he's done with tasks, he will grab a mop or broom and clean or organize.  He's also cross-trained so he's always helping others out.  Until now, only 1 of the employees has complained that the older employee seems ""different"" around them and it's stressing them out - something that I saw as kind of a non-issue.  They weren't being mean or confrontational, just quiet around them and they used to joke around with them more.  This employees has complained on 3 separate occasions that this older employee stresses them out so much that they are at their ""whits end"" and even thought about getting a new job.  Again, they are communicating about job related matters but nothing more.  Against my General Manager's advice, I met with the older employee to see if there was something more to it or just the matter of them not wanting drama and to just work.  They were a bit surprised that the other employee felt upset enough to bring it to management but said that they were just ""avoiding any reason for the other employees to complain about him.""  Again, I felt that there is nothing I could ask him to do since asking for an employee to joke around with another employee is something I can't do \[nor would I want to do :) \].  I had an honest conversation with the employee making complaints and seemed to resolve the issue and he understood that he needed to get his job done and he'd ""man-up"" \[his words, not mine\] and accept that it's probably not personal.

Where I'm at now is finding out that the other 2 younger employees are now ""aligning"" themselves with the main employee making the complaints and are now avoiding talking to the older man because they are afraid he's going to be mean to them.  Tasks are being put off and communication is being put off and it's becoming an issue.  I was notified by another employee that there was some talk going on between the 3 employees that they were just going to avoid speaking with him.  I approached them and asked if a task was communicated to the older employee and they had said no.  When I asked them why, they said ""I don't know.  We're just avoiding have to talk to him because he seems different.  Like he jokes around with Dean \[another older employee\] but he's short with us.  We're kind of afraid.""  I had asked if he was being confrontational or being mean, and they said ""no, he just is short with us.  He just seems off."" 

More context is that the older employee was out of work for 6 weeks for cancer.  He's going through treatment every 3 weeks as of now.  I know from experience that getting a terminal diagnosis from cancer is life-changing and that could play a role in his new ""head down"" approach to his job.  These 3 employees are well-aware of his diagnosis as well.

I'm all about having a good working environment and I understand that just because I had to deal with asshole co-workers while working in manufacturing for years, these employees shouldn't have to do that - but it's very hard to look at this as a problem with the older employee and not tell the younger employees to toughen up and just accept that not every co-worker is your buddy.  It's ok if your co-worker doesn't want to go get a beer after work.

Any help, guidance or maybe a different point of view would be GREATLY appreciated.  

I'll be happy to answer any questions for more context."

After a week I followed up and found out the email was already sent and they did not notify me about it. (My fault I should have checked spam, lesson learnt now I always check spam).

Right now, again a friend's friend is recommending me for a job I would LOVE to have.

My last job laid me off after a pretty rough patch and could no longer afford me, so they decided to outsource IT.   I had been there 5 years and my old boss tried to find me another job himself and they wrote me a glowing recommendation letter.   I contacted my recruiter who got my old job and they recommended a few jobs that didn't pan out due to pay or other reasons.  My main thing besides pay was to be at least hybrid work from home.   

This place said it was two days in office and 3 home and the salary was right.  I decided to go ahead with it.  In the paperwork, was an NCA that was a little extreme, saying that I can't get another job that performs the same duties in the same field for customers or partners shared by the companies for 18 months.   The partners were listed as companies like Citrix and Microsoft.  

 Basically I can't get another IT job for almost 2 years.   Lucky my gf is an attorney and she said that due to wording and omissions, the nca is unenforceable.   I spoke with my future boss about it and he assured me that would never happen.  I pointed to a line in the NCA that said that it supercedes any verbal or written statements contrary.  I decided that I should take it anyway and see how it goes.  Everyone seems to think it's a great company and if they try something we can fight it.  Today was my first day and my ""hybrid work from home"" has become ""We'll see how it goes and decide how many days I'll be in the office."".  I'm pretty pissed off and I passed on higher paying full time onsite jobs because this was supposed to be hybrid work from home.   I wanted to further discuss with my new boss but he was out almost all day.   Complaining to him about it makes me feel akward since I feel like I'm being a pain in the ass, but I'm honestly over this kind of shady, dishonest bullshit from employers.   Part of me wants to just walk away.  Part of me wants to get past my training and see if they jerk me around first.    What do you think I should do next?"

I've been working on this project - a banking app for the local bank, the personnel who started the project all resigned and only 2 of us are remaining. The project got deferred due to limited personnel working on it and since they are planning on restarting the project and moving to a different approach in coding, I decided to move on since they are redoing everything and I'm underpaid on the job.

I explored my options and was given an offer from another company. During my rendering I did all my turnover documents as well as explaining them to the new hire. I crossed out all my checklist.  So at this point I'm done with my turnover.

My signed contract states I should have 30 days for rendering if ever I resigned. In the middle of the year, they required us to sign a mandatory memo about extending it to 90 days.

They assured us that if you're done with the turnover you can leave early.

Now the company wants me to turnover EVERYTHING, literally the whole project when I only did a few parts of it. The past personnels that resigned did their turnover documents so expecting me to turnover everything despite the availability of the documents from the other resigned seems a bit unfair.

They want me to extend past my rendering period to properly turnover the WHOLE project, even the parts I didn't do. Even though I'm part of that project I don't know everything about the project.

What do I do?

I was delighted to hear this as I'd still been on the lookout for a job. After telling the manager of my availability she said that I had the job after I filled out some paperwork (the onboarding). I filled out the paperwork with all my personal information, happy to finally have a job. However after I turned in the documents she would not respond at all, leaving my family afraid we had been scammed and very worried. While through this whole process we had been texting to communicate, after the onboarding she did not respond for almost two weeks and I had to call the store's number itself to get an actual response from her. When she finally responded she said that the paperwork never went through to corporate and she would call me the next day after she had contacted them. I never received that call. I texted 3 times and received no response. This whole situation has cost me my time and money and the fact that she was unresponsive after the personal information was submitted has only left me and my family more worried. Is there something I can do about this??"

I've been working in my field for about ten years and while I'm making a decent salary for what I do, I feel like I've basically stagnated and haven't moved past a senior analyst position, even though my title has manager in it. I think part of this is I tend to get pigeonholed into doing a specific type of work (system administration) and am only involved in strategic projects when it relates to systems. Also no one ever seems to feel the need to hire anyone underneath me or promote me. I also work for startups most of the time and a lot of the meaty projects tend to be taken over by others and I'm not the type to fight for to own a part of the business.

I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience or has any advice based on this limited information.

Thanks in advance!"

I have a second interview tomorrow for a possible career. I had a short interview with the recruiter the other day. We didn‚Äôt really talk my professional experience ‚Äî it seemed like he was listening for my over the phone skills. It is a job as a sales broker for personal lines insurance. 

I‚Äôve never not gotten a job that I‚Äôve interviewed for. At my last job, the interviewer said it was the best interview they‚Äôd ever done, and I was only 17 at the time. I study the company, the listing, etc and prep like crazy. But im only 20 and im scared. I have experience in insurance, im licensed.

I need a second source of income.",u/XKlip,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x9kqv6/examples_of_filler_jobs_or_make_your_own_schedule/,jobs,"To put things simply. I work an extremely random amount of days a week and it varies wildly with my current (and only) job. Some weeks I work 6/7 days, others I get as little as 2 work days. The reason I don't quit this job is because the pay and benefits is very good (assuming I'm actually working obviously) so I have no desire to simply leave it entirely as of right now.

Instead however this leaves me with many days that I have nothing else to do besides lay about and work on hobbies, which is nice, but I would rather put some of this excessive free time to making more cash. ""Get a second job"" is the common idea here, but getting a ""standard"" job is IMPOSSIBLE with my current first job's random schedule. I can't commit to any days for a second job because I work so randomly and sporadically. My only benefit is that I always know my work schedule a week in advance, so I will know what days I am on and what days I am not on next week ahead of time. The idea here is I need to find some form of employment that is extremely flexible to the point where I select how little/much I work depending on the days I have available as I will know what days I have free week to week, but CANNOT commit to static schedules because these free days will constantly change on a month to month basis. The only suggestion I got from coworkers thus far is ""uber driver"" related things as these jobs seem to just allow you to be ""on the clock"" whenever the hell you want, but the same people that suggested me also warned me about how poor the pay is and on top of that it's my own car's mileage and gas I pay for, so this is all very very unappealing and I don't think Uber stuff is for me. I need more suggestions/ideas/whatever to fill in these days. I need filler work that pays."

I went to college for an Art History degree, I know I know, I just hate anything having to do with math and CS is really horrible as well. 

I am really good at writing however and I can write relatively well. I also worked at an ""internship"" at an archaeological office for six months and that was enjoyable, and I mainly did data entry concerning archival materials. 

I knew going into college that the single most important aspect of it, beyond grades, was networking. And I reached out, especially to professors, and could talk on and on with them about various aspects of their careers, interests, etc, and I wanted to build a rapport and I have in a lot of ways, but they are professors, and it's helpful when reaching out to them in terms of academic career advice with grad school and such. 

I hope to go to grad school... but I'm really frustrated with where I live, where I currently live is not where I grew up, and my family doesn't live there anymore either, it's extremely expensive to live there now and while it's home, I'm not sure my possible salary would cover many things, and I just want to experience something different. I want to move to either Philadelphia or Chicago or MAYBE Minneapolis. But frankly, I feel like my academic career has just led me to not have any useful connections at least in any of those areas, 

I am frankly interested in just doing office work. I didn't mind the data entry work even if it was boring, it wasn't too bad. 

One of my parents could possibly get me a job at a good insurance company back where they live...and I should be grateful, but I just weep and gnash my teeth when I think about going back there. I have ZERO friends, ZERO connections, it's a smaller, boring city and I've already sacrificed 8 years of my life living there or within the vicinity of it, and for what, to just move back there after college? It'd be pathetic. I hate it there, and it's a really incredibly bitter pill to swallow. My parents also don't particularly care for the place either so they emphasize with me to an extent. But yeah, I'm miserable there and it's painful just thinking about moving back there. There's nothing there for me except for a possible job, and everything thing else would be the weeping and gnashing of teeth. 

Just really frustrated and anxious, and while I could look for temp work in either Philadelphia or Chicago, It seems like I'd be making not much money at all. I'd be trying to make 22 an hour because that would make me comfortable as long as I had roommates in those places. Is there any advice you could give me for work or anything?

I work in a vet hospital. I started during covid about a year and a half ago. When I started, we had no one directly above me, but rather the hospital manager was over the technician team. A year ago a tech supervisor was hired, and is the technician team's (my team) direct supervisor. 

At first the tech supervisor was fantastic. She did a working interview and was able to place a catheter, new everything she was supposed to and jumped right in on training everyone. She has years of experience. 

Shortly after being hired, she stopped helping with appointments and won't monitor surgeries. She says it's because of a stroke she had 2 years ago that has really messed with her brain and she would like to be an office support only, really just working in her office and not on the floor. 

She stopped training the new hires and asked me and one of my coworkers to train them instead. Me and my coworker trained these new technicians from the ground up as best as we could, but we are relatively new to the field as well. The tech supervisor, after months of us training the new hires, pulled me and my coworker into her office and said we are too hard on the new hires and need to train with more patience. 

At this point I told her that I would no longer be training any new hires because I don't feel confident in my training skills since she thinks I'm not patient enough. She immediately back tracked and said what a good trainer I am and please would I still train.

I would like to emphasize that training new hires is directly her responsibility. When I told her I'd be more comfortable if she would train them instead, she says she can't train them because her brain doesn't work right because of her stroke. 

Now she's trying to get me to train the new hires on surgery monitoring, and I told her I'm not comfortable with this. I told her that I think the new hires have a lot to work on before they are ready for surgery monitoring and that I'm not willing to train them personally until I think they're ready. She won't stop asking me to let them at least shadow me. 

Recently I approached her about an issue I was having with another coworker. Said coworker is supervisors friend and they worked at a previous clinic together. Supervisor told me that my coworker works extremely hard and she doesn't see any of the issues I'm describing. 

Supervisor then goes on to tell coworker about what I said and tells coworker I'm the one having problems with her. 

I feel all confidence is broken, none of my complaints are taken seriously, the stroke is used as an excuse, and my concerns about training the new hires in monitoring are being completely ignored. I have had other issues as well with supervisor but I just don't know what to do anymore

TLDR: supervisor is trying to coerce me into training when I'm not comfortable with it, told coworker about complaint I had, and constantly blames prior stroke on any poor performance. What do I do?"

While my grievance is being addressed I also started applying elsewhere. Regardless of the outcome, I gain leverage or get a new job.

Enter ‚ÄúChad.‚Äù¬†

I received a call back from ‚ÄúChad.‚Äù It was a barrage of questions, half of them illegal. What are my mental illnesses? Am I on SSRIs? Have I tried Shrooms? How old am I? Where is my father? What is my political beliefs as he didn't need any BLM riots in his shop. He claimed to be a¬† Libertarian. Lectured me on politics. I ended the call after an hour, but he quickly texted to schedule a another call, I admit, despite the red flags, I wanted to know where this crazy train would go. Call it morbid curiosity.

As it turns out, he's a racist Chad. His hatred of poc was apparent. He made it a point to talk about why stereotypes exist. He hates the Chinese, Asian women, and everyone else including his employees. And he ended the call ranting about black on black crime. Much more was said, but that about sums it up. As politely as I could, I ended the call. However, an in-person interview was quickly requested.

This led to multiple discussions between friends, family, and my SO. It made my skin crawl to listen to this man talk about people, and his language was disgusting, but I convinced myself I still needed bargaining power. I decided to interview, and if I got the offer, I'd use it at my current company. I brought my SO along. During the interview he 
went off-topic, argued endlessly, and he insisted he'd change all my views, stated he'd ""red pill me"" and I could join his ""cult."" He said he was an elite and better than others, something I made clear I didn't agree with, ones values isn't based on what they offer society. He managed to work in how he likes his women snow white and asked if she was my favorite princess. I ended this conversation by telling him that I had to leave. He told me we weren't finished, I made it clear we were done.

He sent a text, I could name a number and we could make it work. I didn‚Äôt accept his offer. I said there was a lot to think about and listed all the reservations I had as to not accept the job. My purpose was to demonstrate my value to my current employer in order to improve my treatment and this text was all I needed.

Although I believed I had conveyed my reservations clearly to Chad, apparently I did not. He has continued to text since then. He asked for another interview, but absolutely not.¬†

I stopped responding. But he kept texting. I eventually responded again stating he didn't address any of my concerns. He told me he thought I wanted to work for him and ""I think you are perfect for the job you are dedicated you live close you aren't overly tied up with your personal life your intelligent young and cute. But you seem more interested in being in control and dominating me and I'm interested in that too a point bc I'm hard headed and stubborn and I need someone to tell me when I'm wrong but I think you do too much of that."" He stated he made it this far without a lady and he didn't need my help, that I needed to have a sense of humor and be fun to work with. And he only responded to what he deemed as important.

I responded I talk to you the way I talk to everyone. That he reads a lot into texts and assigns tones to them (I already told him this was a him issue when he accused me of trying to take the keys to the castle based on a text about his responses to google reviews.) All I have requested was mutual respect and hes not giving it. But I ended the conversation with I don't need your job. I am not the only person that can help you and who am I to stop you from looking for your purple squirrel, have a good night.¬†

This was a crazy train I thought would be fun to see how far it went but turned into creep central very quickly and I ignored the red flags for personal gain. I got the text I needed for work but I'm a little worried. I have blocked him on all social media and am having cameras installed. Don't ignore red flags."

I started at the clinic as an intern for 2 months before getting officially hired. In total I have 6 months experience.

Today I overheard the Pediatrician and office manager talking about firing someone, and being the newest (everyone else has 15+ years of working there) its obvious they‚Äôre talking about me. Im freaking out big time. I suspect its due to 2 errors I did today- I left potentially important information out when doing triage for a 6 month old today when I forgot to mention that the baby had begun teething. This was important considering the baby was exhibiting symptoms of excessive crying and fever. The second mistake I made was with another patient. I thought Rhabdomyolysis was a chronic condition so I wrote it down as such when it wasnt.

Besides that, I have yet to commit any vaccine mistakes, inaccurate vitals, wrong medicine to the pharmacy, or errors when writing X-ray / ultrasound forms. Im so stressed out because i‚Äôve never had work experience at all before this. Its my first job ever and I enjoy it so much. I have no idea if other clinics would accept me due to my age and limited experience, not to mention being fired. 

What should I do? Will I be able to find work? Can I even put 6 months on my resume considering I was an intern for 2?"

The two times that I've used this line, they've responded ""It's very early in the hiring process and too soon to tell. We want the best candidate and we can't yet tell if you're the best candidate.""

This just happened to me for the second time today. I didn't have the balls to call them out on blowing me off. It definitely felt like the interviewer was responding by rote. He has encountered this before and knows how to sidestep it.

In all fairness, the interviewer today did offer to let me know even if I'm not the successful applicant, and offered to review what he thought with me. But only after I've officially been rejected for the job. This is honestly above and beyond what I would've ever expected. I really hope it wasn't an empty promise.

Why aren't interviewers interested in giving you honest feedback during/after the interview?

Is the advice to ask the interviewer how they thought you did bad advice?

I actually don't know what I wanted to achieve other than know sooner if they thought I was a good fit. I can understand not wanting to tell me if it could create some kind of liability issue. I have just remembered the suggestion to immediately ask for feedback twice and had similar responses both times.

The interview was for a network support contract role."

0,2022-09-09,Should I quit this retail job if the work feels grueling and I'm starting to accumulate minor injuries?,u/ThrowThinkAway,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/x9nz86/should_i_quit_this_retail_job_if_the_work_feels/,jobs,"I started a retail part time job about 1.5 weeks ago, but in short I kinda hate this job and it's actually harming my health. I won't name the company but just know it's one of the better retail companies in term of reputation and benefits and pay. It's a nice bit above minimum wage where I am (better than other retail), but of course still not good enough to afford this HCOL area.

The job is assisting with cashier work, but also running go backs. That's not bad, but pushing many heavy carts outside in the blazing summer sun and lifting heavy products for customers into their cars/trucks has been grueling and actually bad for my health. I quickly learned I hated physical work, and I already hated working in high temperatures. Then we had a recent heat wave, and we still had to work outside in temperatures reaching 111F. Law mandates we don't stay out longer than 30 minutes in that kind of high temp, at first managers were good at switching us out but yesterday and today in &gt;100F temps they forgot to switch me out like twice.

On day 2 I lifted something the wrong way and I felt pain in my upper back near/on the spine. My doctor said it may be ligaments connected to the spine and requested a physical therapist, it could be months before I can get connected. Then yesterday I pushed heavy carts and felt a sting in my right Achilles Heel, and then later my left one. Today I still felt a sting in the left Achilles Heel when pushing carts in 103F weather. Keep in mind I'm very weak overall, makes me wonder why I even selected this job. Then again I asked this company for a job and they recommended this one, and the job title itself doesn't really indicate such heavy outdoor work, and I was hoping to land a better position in this company. I clearly underestimated and thought I'd be fine with it, but I learned I wasn't.

My days lately have been just waking up tired, slogging away at work, then coming home tired and aching and sleeping with no energy for any of my other pursuits or important endeavors like exercise (although this work itself is like exercise). It doesn't help that I have depression and ADHD, so I'm extremely fatigued and ADHD doesn't seem that compatible with retail in my opinion.

Is it time to quit this job even though I've barely started? The coworkers are very nice and the managers too, and the coworkers have been very supportive that things will get better (less cart time the longer you're employed), and many of them have been around for YEARS. I don't like to let people down and I love to be loyal to those around me, but I don't want to keep up the facade that I like this job. I'm tired of the pushing and lifting, the sun and heat (even though fall is soon), the injuries building up (if I tell management I will get laid off during this probationary period for sure) and retail is certainly not my desired career (although I still don't know with certainty what my career should be... I considered tech or IT but I'm stuck there too).

As for what else... I don't know. I live with family but my credit card debt needs to be cleared, but fortunately the intro APR is 0% for now... so I'm not in urgent danger but it's still not good. I need some part time job or some kind of income. I already graduated college, yet I failed to land any full time job, and any part time jobs I have landed have been either temporary/seasonal in nature, or have huge caveats or downsides. I've always been either failing or running away, and if I leave I will be running away yet again. 

What do I do? If I should quit, should I do my 2 weeks? Should I come up with an excuse for why I'm leaving already like I happened to find a better opportunity (which isn't true but it deflects from the real reason being I don't like retail which would certainly burn a bridge). "

Backstory: I (late-20sM) have spent the last 8 years (basically my entire adult life) working for a start-up company. While I haven‚Äôt been making pennies, I‚Äôve definitely been underpaid for the amount of work I do. But I‚Äôve stayed on because the company also gave stock options.

It‚Äôs not a position I was dying to get, but it would‚Äôve been a little more money and different work which I was interested in as I feel like I am underutilized in my current position.

Now politically If it were to ever hit my current employers radar I fear this would negatively Impact my relationship with them as it would appear I'm being unloyal and just hopping on new opportunities.

Additionally I work in finance.. privacy is a huge part of what I do. Is the fact I learned about this on the job technically bad for me to use off the job. As how I look at privacy is when I'm working, I'm in it. If I'm not, I don't know you or anything about you.

The Situation: I got an offer from another company, and I almost accepted it but did not sign any documents yet.  
In my current company, I have had a meeting with my boss and informed him that I have got another offer and that I feel that it is time for me to leave the position I am currently at.

My boss tried to persuade me to stay by talking about his plans for our department and that he has a lot of future plans for our team. He even mentioned that he sees me as a candidate that could be head of the team in the near future.  
At that moment, I told him, that I am certain about my decision and that I am leaving.

On Monday, we will meet with my boss again to starts this process, sign documents, etc.

In the meantime, I took my time and tough a lot about the decision I have made and began to realize that I have made a very bad choice, a mistake that I will definitely regret in the long run.

I would like to have another discussion with my manager, tell him that I changed my mind and that in the long run it would be better to stay.

Another thing is that I will always be able to go to another company because they are always looking for a specialist like me, but the position I am currently at is unique, and to be honest it requires luck to get a position like this.

I feel very bad that all my colleagues also found out that I am leaving my job I told them myself. What I am afraid the most is that if I will say now that I am not leaving, they'll consider me weak or someone that doesn‚Äôt know what he wants in life and sooner or later they'll fire me. How stupid do you think it would be to tell my manager that I have changed my mind? I feel so ashamed of my actions... Is this a red flag for managers? Will my boss be able to trust me again in the future?"
1,2022-09-09,i left my cushy government job and I'm starting to regret it.,u/killingyounglings90,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xa1ebn/i_left_my_cushy_government_job_and_im_starting_to/,jobs,"I (31M) recently left my job at my states DOT. I was there for three years. While my pay wasn't exactly the greatest ( 21.18/hr ) the benefits were outstanding and there were a lot of really cool perks ( 12-14 paid holidays a year, 12 vacations days a year, 4 paid sick days and 3 paid personal days ). I mostly enjoyed my work as it was something new pretty much everyday. Some work assignments were dangerous ( especially working on the interstate where the public couldn't care less about your safety ). I live in a Midwest state where we frequently get 3+ feet of snow so during winter it wasn't uncommon to spend 90 hours or more a week at work plowing. I mean for the most part I did love my job and especially the men and women I worked with. We had a small unit of 9 people so we were like a small family. 

The biggest issue why I left was it was almost a necessity. The state used to operate a program with payroll that was usually about 2 weeks behind. So when it came to earning your PTO it would be 2-3 weeks late then what it was actually supposed to be. for example my PTO accrual date was the 8th of every month but the old system wouldn't actually credit that time to your file until 2-3 weeks later. So if you earned a vacation day  on the 8th and used it on the 9th, the time you used would actually be from the previous month. Like if you had 0 hours of PTO on the 7th, earned 7.5 hours on the 8th and used 7.5 hours on the 9th, you would actually get a "" lost time "" fact file, even though you technically actually had the time.

So in my 3 years there and I had unfortunately had 2 "" lost time "" incidents even though I technically had earned the time. Those incidents occured early in my time there. Eventually they updated the system so earned time was actually available to use the day you earned it. I hadn't had any issues or negative fact files in the proceeding 2 years and all was great until I had an incident where my alarms didn't go off in time. A storm blew through knocked out our power so we didn't have wifi ( my house runs Google assistant smart devices for everything ) and in a funny coincidence my phone was still connected to my cars Bluetooth so when those alarms went off it was completely silent. I woke up about 10 minutes after the start of my shift and immediately called in to report I was gonna be late and that to make up for the time to take it out of my personal balance ( of which I had 60 hours to use )
I arrived about an hour late and worked the whole 10 hour day. 

A week later, our operations manager asked me to his office to inform me that I was being suspended 5 days without pay for my 3rd "" lost time "" incident. I thought this was completely unfair because not only had I had the time to cover it, but I came in 2 nights earlier at 11pm to do traffic control for 5 hours ( my shift is 6am to 4pm ). And still came in to my 6am shift 2 hours later. The state has a no over time policy ( except for winter operations ) so once your 37.5 hours is in for the week, you're required to leave early at the end of the week. I told him that it's not lost time since A.) I already had made up the hour I was late 2 days earlier and B.) I had more than enough time in the books to cover it. And  C.) It's not lost time if I'm not being compensated for it it. My time isn't yours unless you're paying me.
He refused to listen to what I was saying and the decision came from HR in the capital and it's out of his hands. I was infuriated and that afternoon I updated my indeed resume and began looking for a new job. I applied to several places and the very next morning a manager from a company called me and said he would love to interview me. I said what the hell and went to the interview. The manager ( let's call him Derek ) told me about the job and how much it paid ( nearly 25K more a year ). We didn't go over benefits too much ( except they offered them ). Looking back, Derek sold the job to me the way a used cars salesman would and basically refused to let me leave without accepting his offer. And I was more than eager to say yes because it felt awesome to actually feel wanted at work as opposed to feeling the need to almost bet to work.

When I returned to the state, I put in my resignation and did everything required to leave on good terms so I could be hired back if I desired. Our foremen and operations supervisor even asked if there was anything in their power they could do to convince me to stay. I told them what it would take and they said if it were up to them they would've done it. So, I left and began the new job this Monday.

This new job is pumping septic tanks. It's by no means a glamourous job but it's very well paying ( I'm starting at $25 an hour ) with 10 hours of overtime a week. The job itself doesn't seem awful ( there's actual a lot to learn ) and its not nearly as gross as you'd think. My biggest issue with it is that the benefits are pretty good awful ( insurance is good and actually surprisingly cheap but is very costly if you add spouse and children ). We get 40 hours of paid vacation and holidays off and can have time off as much as requested unpaid. It's small family company with about 15 employees. But its definitely a different culture and structure than what I'm used to.

And I'm emotionally struggling with it all. I'm having a hard time not remembering my old job with rose colored glasses and I'm regretting quitting my old job. 
I have a family ( wife and 3 kids ) so my priorities are always what I think is best for them. On the one hand I'm going to be making a lot more money, but on the other I'm giving up a job I genuinely loved going to that gave me a great work life balance and great benefits for the family. Thankfully we have our states HIP plan so insurance is still taken care of.

I left the state in good standing and I was told I would be welcomed back whole heartedly if wanted. So it's nice to know I can always go back. I just need some good ol reddit advice here.

TL;DR : I quit my job and I don't know if made the right decision and I'm struggling accepting this big change in my life."

And it wasn‚Äôt until an insurance rep needed to know how much I made for benefits quotes that I finally found out my pay. To my surprise, I am earning significantly less than what was verbally told to me before hire, so much so that I wouldn‚Äôt have accepted the position if I knew in advance. 

Good employees are leaving in droves because my employer refuses to offer raises. Besides finding another job, what recourse do I have?"
0,2022-09-09,Negotiate a 15% Salary Increase?,u/under_glass,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xa2lct/negotiate_a_15_salary_increase/,jobs,"I interviewed for a position over the last month at a fairly prestigious organization.  In my initial interview I was told that the salary range for this job rank is 44k - 88k and that they attempt to hire at the midpoint of that range, which would be around 67k. My salary expectations on my application were 68k. I understood that I would be making a lateral move to take this job, so I was fine with that salary. 

I received my job offer at 60k, which is less than I currently make.  Given the cost of some benefits I would be taking home significantly less each pay check. 

I am at a loss as to what to do.  Should I try to negotiate a 15% raise to their salary offer or just let it go?"

What happened?,u/BunChargum,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xa2o7r/do_you_know_anyone_who_has_sued_their_employer/,jobs,"Back in my days in Human Resources, I was involved in research with an Attorney in a number of wrongful termination lawsuits against my employers.  I was always shocked at how many ex-employees actually worked with an Attorney after they were fired.

Few cases made it all the way to an actual trial but the mere fact that someone sued the employer caused lots of embarrassment, finger pointing, and calls to discredit the employee who attempted to sue. If the lawsuit got to the point where the company had to provide documents and make statements, then the SXXX hit the fan. Because there are two sides to every story, the manager always looked stupid and in some cases, they took the fall.

Many wrongful termination lawsuits where the plaintiff was a protected class ended up with a financial settlement.

So do you have any observations or experiences with a wrongful termination lawsuit with your employers or with family or friends?  Observations?"

I have been in my position for about 5 years and as my role has evolved so has my salary. Recently it was decided that I have taken on more project management work and do not have the capacity for some of the administrative work I do for our department. We decided to hire an administrative employee to help with some of these tasks. The job was posted today and all duties are things I have done in the past and the qualifications for the job are a minimum high school diploma with experience. I have a masters degree and almost 10 years of experience. 
I looked at the salary range which is about an $11,000 range.
If the person hired is on the low end they would be making about $11,000 less than me‚Ä¶if they are hired in the high end they will be making $1000 more than me.
I felt this was a bit crazy and feel I should bring it up. However, maybe I‚Äôm overstepping or shouldn‚Äôt assume they would be making the higher end of that range?
Any advice? Experience?"
66,2022-09-09,My recruiter BLOCKED me?!,u/BitchEpidemic,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xa3pb9/my_recruiter_blocked_me/,jobs," 

Hi guys,

I'm just so confused about this situation. Not sure if this would even be the right community. But I applied for a job at American Express towards the end of last month. Was assigned a recruiter and we spoke a couple times before scheduling a one on one interview. Mind you, the first time we scheduled he forgot about it and didn't even show up. No big deal but he was ghosting me (I only had his office cell and email at this point) to hide his mess up until I had to call my friend's recruiter who took it to his supervisor. We scheduled it again, no hard feelings and he said he thought I was a good fit and scheduled the group manager interview. He gave me his personal cell in case I had any questions which I didn't use until today. The group interviews were last week and said they would be reaching out by yesterday to let you know if you got the job either if you did or didn't. Still haven't heard anything so I first called my recruiter's office line, it wasnt in service (?) and then went to text his personal cell and I am blocked (I know because we both have iphones). I get it, I probably did not get the job but blocking somebody who has been nothing but nice to you? It's highly unprofessional and I am extremely upset. I want to take this to his supervisor, this is not how you handle people, its literally your whole job.


UPDATE: I‚Äôm so embarassed y‚Äôall. Today I got an email that I got the job."

My boss was a major PITA at first (she always has been), then chilled out once she realized I could technically leave any time and was grateful I came back to help. 

It was nice to say bye to everyone, exchange numbers, connect on linkedin, go to lunches, etc.- and the head of my old department said the door is always open. No one seemed to bat an eyelash and a few people whose wives stayed home or who stayed home themselves told me I was making the right choice. It also really helped ease my anxiety about the life transition. Being back at work was fun overall, but not what we need right now.

Obviously it depends on the company, and I regretted it at first with my boss's behavior, but overall I would definitely do it again for a company I liked. And we get to keep that sweet retirement cash too, so that's a bonus!


-----

My maternity leave is coming to an end and I plan on submitting my two week's notice the day I get back to become a SAHM, so I will work there for two weeks and help wrap everything up before leaving. No one is aware of this as of now.

Obviously I'll do the standard notifying my direct supervisor/notifying department head/notifying HR, but I'm a little lost on how exactly to phrase this since it's primarily due to location (long commute) and not feeling ready to leave my baby. Do I just say that? Is it unusual to submit notice the first day back?

Thanks!"

What if they think I do all of these things at once??? I also said I deep clean these places every day on account of the fact that I do tend to deep clean every now and then.

6,2022-09-09,Indeed.com is phasing out its Advanced Search filtering (2022),u/realAzazello,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xa5dnh/indeedcom_is_phasing_out_its_advanced_search/,jobs,"**TL;DR**: for those of you who use Indeed's [advanced search query options](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/tips-on-how-to-get-better-search-results-on-indeed.com) e.g. **title:**, **company:**, etc., I received a confirmation from one of their 'Job Seeker Success Specialist' that Indeed's product team is phasing them out over the year--and have already started.

&amp;nbsp;

Indeed.com has one key functionality that NO other job search service has: an advanced, boolean-driven query system **that works** - *what you filter is what you get*, that allows you to filter job listings based on Title **and/or** Company **and/or** words within the Description.
&amp;nbsp;    
e.g.    

+ LinkedIn can filter using limited boolean logic, includes exclusion using 'NOT', but the query applies to ***both*** Description and Title; and you cannot filter on Company using a query string.
+ Glassdoor is the same, but does *not* allow exceptions, i.e. **'NOT'**, seemingly only honoring the use of quotes.
+ Other sites pretend (most don't even) to allow advanced filtering. *On purpose*--as their revenue is based on the ""pay per click"" model. *You take what they want to give you*, and you can eat cake if you don't like it. {I'm looking at you Careerbuilder and Monster...}

&amp;nbsp;

With Indeed, you could create e.g. the much-requested queries to search for ""entry level"" jobs:

{*This searches just the Description, NOT the Title*}

(""entry-level"" OR ""entry level"") title:(Technology OR ""IT"" OR ""tech"") title:(-Director -Officer -Principal -Senior -""Sr"" -Architect -Recruiter)
&amp;nbsp;

-or-
&amp;nbsp;

{*This does NOT search the Description; just the Title*}

title:(""entry-level"" OR ""entry level"" OR Generalist OR Trainee) title:(Technology OR ""IT"" OR ""tech"") title:(-Director -Officer -Principal -Senior -""Sr"" -Architect -Recruiter)    

&amp;nbsp;

While troubleshooting an issue where I was not receiving daily alerts, I asked the Job Seeker Success Specialist:

&gt;Please confirm that I interpreted correctly what you wrote: Indeed.com discontinued the use of advanced search terms??!!! And will formally kill them in a year?!

&gt;Is this true--we users can no longer filter queries based on Title or Company-name, and more??

&gt;If so, is *any* advanced filtering usable anymore? What are the new query usage instructions?

&gt;I'm devastated if this is true.

S/He replied:
&gt;&gt;I will be the bearer of bad news. The Advanced Search is indeed being phased out, and there is currently no plan to replace it with a similar function. We have passed on your feedback regarding this change to the product team so that they might reconsider the move. At the moment, however, the simple ""pillbox"" search options represent what is at our users' disposal.

&gt;&gt;Please also bear in mind that job alerts that have been created while the Advanced Search was still available may now be affected by these changes.

&gt;&gt;We would therefore recommend creating new job alerts with fewer/simpler search terms to ensure that you can still receive new job postings.    

&amp;nbsp;

Some years back, /u/sts8162 wrote a critique of Indeed's UI, that morphed into expanded complaints by other members about the entire service. Although I disagree with over 90% of the complaints, even Indeed's biggest opponents have to agree that its query system is the best on the 'Net. No other site has ever come close, and still doesn't.    
(And /u/sts8162 wrote an excellent description on [how to use it expertly](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a8b3fj/my_tips_on_how_to_use_boolean_operations_on/ ""My tips on how to use Boolean operations on Indeed to improve your search results""))    

&amp;nbsp;

So if this is truly end of an era - that Indeed intends to kill its best feature, that distinguishes it from every other search site - then all that will be left are those 90% **legitimate** complaints about the service."

We are excited to announce an upcoming AMA with Donald Truss, Executive Recruiter and Client Concierge for the Food &amp; Beverage industry!

Don started and operated a staffing company focused on recruiting and placing scientists.He sold it after 20 years and became an executive recruiter working on contingency.For the past 20 years, companies have paid him to find  ‚ÄúNeedle in a Haystack‚Äù candidates.

As  a contingency recruiter, his candidates are a little bit like business  partners ‚Äì he doesn‚Äôt get paid unless his candidate gets hired. Thus he  provides a little coaching on what to say and how to say it during their  interviews. Don will use this talk to share ‚ÄúBest Practices‚Äù for resume  writing and interviewing

I am having an extremely hard time finding job that‚Äôs full time, that pays at least $20/hr (so I can pay my rent and eat and pay for the gas in my car)  without any catches.

I have no idea what to do. I‚Äôm currently searching on indeed, and not much is turning out for me. Advice?"

6,2022-09-09,Former employer is asking me to return equipment months after leaving and after having returned it. What do I do?,u/pinguini05,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xa848f/former_employer_is_asking_me_to_return_equipment/,jobs,"So set the stage. I worked on site and durning Covid our office shut down. When we left they said to take all our personal items and any equipment needed.  They also said to send a list of the equipment taken home to our manager. I did that, but also decided I didn‚Äôt need all the equipment at my desk so that was left behind. 

During Covid I moved cities and found a better job so I resigned.  When I resigned I again provided a list of equipment I had and asked for boxes to return everything. A week later the boxes arrived and was returned. 

Now four months later I got a letter in the mail saying I didn‚Äôt return everything and I either need to return my equipment or it will be added to my W2 as compensation.  I contacted the company via email as the letter said to do so I could find out what was missing, thinking maybe I had a company iPad or something like that that I had forgotten about.  They replied with a list of computers and displays that they say were not returned. 

I have since found out I was assigned a new cube and got new equipment because they thought I was returning when the office reopened.  One of the displays was in that cube and taken by a former co-worker to use at their desk.  All of the other items but one were not items I took home and I presume were the equipment left behind when the office closed.  The one item I think I took home was returned. I am not sure it is the same though because I recorded a different, but similar, asset tag number.  So I think someone fat-fingered the number.  

I have provided them the FedEx tracking numbers and asset tag numbers for everything I returned but FedEx only shows tracking info for the last 90 days and the asset tags I sent don‚Äôt match what they say is missing.  The letter sent to me also references a WFH contract they state I signed, but I never signed such a thing because I was not a remote employee. 

At this point I don‚Äôt know what to do and would appreciate any help.  I don‚Äôt feel like them waiting four months to contact me was unreasonable especially when they know boxes were shipped to me to return the equipment. I know I returned everything but I don‚Äôt really have a way to prove that or prove I don‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt have the equipment at home they think I have.  What happens if I never hear back from them and my W2 is wrong because they add the missing equipment to it?  Can I have my W2 changed to reflect the correct amount?

TL;DR: My old employer says I have equipment I don‚Äôt have and are threatening to add it to my W2 as compensation unless I return it."

I‚Äôm having trouble doing so though because I went to 2 court houses and was told that because it was so long ago the record has been ‚Äúpurged and destroyed compliant to California code‚Äù.

Also I was reading that in California , criminal background checks can only go back 7 years. So why is Chase asking me for this information?

A bag was left on a chair, it looked like a large purse, a 3rd person asked who it was and I suggested it belonged to a lady nearby and jokingly said he wanted it. Nothing else was said and we continued on. A few minutes later the owner, a male, comes up and grabs it and I said ""oh I thought that was her purse"" to the 3rd person who asked. The owner of the bag quickly grabbed it and walked away. Drove to the main office and filed a complaint with HR against me. 

I was given a verbal ""reprimand"" by my boss and was told he had to submit a report that he had talked to me. I wasn't asked by HR for my side of the events and the offended told HR he didn't want to be contacted by me and didn't want an apology. What now? I have no say, no defense? No chance to save my reputation, my integrity, my honesty all just ignored and given no choice to confront my accuser?

I contacted HR directly and gave my own report of the events, their response was they would accept my report but I should just proceed to work as normal but be more respectful and mindful. They just want everyone to be treated respectfully and everyone to work together nicely.  I just feel like I'm the one being disrespected. I'm being reprimanded or accused of something other than just being mistaken by calling a bag a ladies purse rather than a man's bag. I don't want to have to ignore this person, he was nice and friendly and we got along at other times we have met. Now I have to watch out for him, avoid him and change my attitude around him just because he was offended by a word?"

I began to look for a job in May. In late June one company offered me an above average salary. I knew that my skills are worth more and tried to bargain. But instead of bargaining they dropped the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

Later, in late August another company offered me 50% more compared to what the first company offered. Now I am getting this job.

&amp;#x200B;

It was also my mistake that I didn't accept the first offer. I lost 2+ months of pay. I could have gotten this higher paying job while being on the first job just the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

In short - my advise is to make job search an ongoing process. Every day or every other day go through job listings and apply for a few. Every 1, 2 or 3 weeks pass an interview or two. Eventually somebody would offer you more than the current job. Then you change jobs and keep looking. Rinse and repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the way to increase your income. Don't expect to find a job and just stay there forever, that I think is what most people expect. You should continuously keep looking for better conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

Just wanted to share my advise based on my experience."
1,2022-09-09,Company not matching IRA,u/throwmeaway1804,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xaa5dx/company_not_matching_ira/,jobs,"I qualified for my company IRA a few months ago and elected to have my company match (3%) taken out over the course of a couple of paychecks instead of every paycheck because honestly this place is a sh\*tshow and I'm planning on exiting as soon as I find a viable job. I think our company operates pay cycle to pay cycle based on several factors.

I've also found out in recent weeks that several employees who have been there for several years (5+) have not had raises in 3-5 years. I was also promised a raise twice in the past year which has yet to happen.

With that said, I met with the financial advisor that is in charge of our plan and didn't really vibe with him but decided to do the match anyway because of free money. Several months (3 to be exact) went by and the financial advisor called me and asked if I planned to contribute otherwise he was closing my account. I told him they had already taken the money out of my paychecks several months prior. He called HR and they sent a check within a week...but they only matched about $160. I thought they would start regularly contributing so I didn't think too much of it...until I looked at my paystubs today and realized they have not contributed anything since the original $160 two months ago. I tried calling the financial advisor today but he was not in.

Is this normal? Do they just contribute it all at the end of the year or what? I've been self-employed my entire career and I'm only in my 20s so I honestly do not know how this works. I do not know if I will still be here at the end of the year for them to match. I am inclined to call him and tell him I want my money so I can invest it elsewhere."
0,2022-09-09,Salary before interviews or even talking to the company is the worst thing.,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xaa5vm/salary_before_interviews_or_even_talking_to_the/,jobs,"I have really mixed feelings, but more on the negative side for sure, on the whole ""what's your salary range"" before even considering an interview or even after a phone screen before an interview. I feel like this has all come since after the pandemic started. It's all a card bull/bear game with this. You tell them the market rate or what you think you're ""worth"", lol, or what the salary levels for the area and company are. Then they consider from there if they want to proceed. It's all about getting someone with lower pay. How does this even feel right to other people, I mean we are all human. You wouldn't want to be doing that to someone else, would you? Like companies make tons but don't want to shell out a good pay for what the range is or consider money first. It's all a collective effort on not paying as much or as well, it's not like you as an employee really have much skin in the game to really push salaries down. I mean maybe you'd get paid better if you didn't pay others as much to come on, but then it's for you to get better pay. It's all just a big circle, so frustrating. Asking salary before even talking with someone is insane. People are the ones that even make society work. If we didn't have each other to build upon or didn't want to do that then we would literally be in a field doing nothing.

In my experience, great, good, or even decent companies don't ask for pay or even ask that, they give the offer come when they give you the offer. They don't ask you for your salary range first. Honestly, is it worth even working for a company that even asks your range first? Do they deserve to even be in business? Don't give a range, and then expect to lowball someone and manipulate them for a lower salary before interviewing.

This is all just ridiculous honestly. You have people that don't do much or have anything to do with what you're paid, artifically pushing salaries lower. Most people don't do much in a company and want to push salaries down. It just turns people against each other since the company as a collective does that based on a piece of paper that says what to do basically. People don't really think where the whole salary level and pushing it down stems from even though they can pay more.. it's just a circle and you don't know where it starts and just forget about it and go after the goal on pay. Not wanting to pursue someone because of the salary range or companies thoughts on pay is annoying. Shareholders don't do anything either. I guess that's just how literally everything works. Push someone else down to push yourself up no matter how worthless you are in society."

They of course let me know the time frame of ""soon"" of when to expect next steps if there is a next step. The other....

I had that interview today. As in like...a couple hours ago. Early afternoon. It...it's almost too perfect. I *aced* it. It was oddly very natural and relaxing. I didn't need to use my worry stone at all for my anxiety like I normally do. They appreciated my honesty when I answered a question that was ""when did you fail at a job"" which I thought was interesting to note. Everyone seemed pretty chill but professional. It more lines up with my major since it would be with marketing (I'm a film major with Production emphasis and the position would almost be like what a producer does. Essentially what a producer on set does is...They are responsible for everything-most importantly, they must deliver the project on schedule and on budget. Here it would be a lot of scheduling, budgeting, ensure everything is setup for photo shoots etc so again it fits pretty well) so I can draw on that for experience, and it just seems like something I'd love to do.

I am a 22 year old college student in NY, I just finished up my 2nd round of interviews for a receptionist position with an elderly care facility. I want some type of work that will pad my resume better than retail or fast food would, but I obviously need to make a living wage.

I have multiple years of admin experience spread between Finance, Retail, Banking, and Dealership experience. 

Job duties include but are not limited to organizing and keeping track of EVERY residents check book, sorting mail and forwarding any mail received by old residents, writing and submitting service orders for any issues regarding a residents room, answering any and all questions residents may have, answering, screening and directing phone calls, providing administrative assistance to 8 different directors/managers, creation and organization of new residents paperwork, monitoring residents so they don't slip out the door, and taking residents reservations for weekly events such as Walmart Wednesdays, weekly stylist visits, in facility events, take out nights, etc. 

The pay? $15/hour, and that's WITH my 4 years of general office/admin experience. The recruiter almost seemed STUNNED when I told her that wasn't anywhere near what I'd accept for the duties, let alone WITH my experience. Starting pay is $13.50 ($.30 over state minimum) with no experience. So my experience isn't even worth an extra $.50 per year. To add insult to injury, most gas stations around here pay their attendees $15/hour plus. I currently make $16.50/hour at a coffee shop. It's literal bull. 

But keep telling us about how ""no one wants to work anymore""."

I received another offer to start the entire process over at a new company. This excites me, as I really like the challenge. However I hesitate.

1. As an engineer I'm an introvert, and I am comfortable with my current coworkers. New coworkers and boss and the unknown of it is a bit scary for me.

2. The work at my current job is not 100% finished. I worry if there is enough knowledge in the group to continue with the work. I would be a bit heartbroken to see all of the work go off the wayside if I were to leave.

What do you all think? What questions could I ask to relieve my reservations? Thanks!"

3,2022-09-09,Interviewer told me my presentation was not engaging enough,u/LegitimateWatch9,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xaeioj/interviewer_told_me_my_presentation_was_not/,jobs,"Today I completed my last day of a four day virtual interview. To give some background I had six interview panels across four days in addition to a 30 minute presentation on my doctoral work and 15 min Q&amp;A session. I am in the process of re-directing my career from a strictly oncology research field to data science. The interview was for a senior data science expert. 

For the most part I thought the interview was going well, especially considering how it took up a good chunk of my week. There were two interview sessions where I spoke with the members of the team I would be working with on a daily basis and I thought it went surprisingly well. The conversation was pleasant and thought provoking. To be honest up until my last interview of the day I had the mind set that even if I didn't land the job I still appreciated all the conversations I had over the course of four days and felt like I had nailed the presentation. That is until my last interview.

 It was a panel interview consisting of the director of the bench research scientists and the other two were research scientists.   Based on the body language of the one person who had their camera on I felt like I was answering all their questions well. However 10-15 minutes into our conversation,  the director interrupted the conversation to say that she did not feel my presentation was ""inviting"" enough for the audience. I believe this means she thought it wasn't engaging enough for discussion when it was time for Q&amp;A. Additionally she felt I wasn't really ""speaking to the audience"".  The director also pointed out that it felt like only people who were well versed in the same research background as I was could actually engage in discussion during the Q&amp;A portion of my presentation. She suggested that ""if you have to do this again, include something in the presentation about how you can contribute to the company and the team and highlight the importance of collaboration"". She rounded this all off by saying ""it's really not my decision as to whether you get the job since this won't be a hire for my team, but I just wanted to let you know. It just seems like your answers do not align with the description of the job responsibilities we posted.""
I was kind of taken aback by what she was saying  and tried to handle as best as I could. The position itself is involved in some expertise I am not well versed in, but I was assured by the hiring manager previously that my background was still really good for the position and there was a lot I could contribute. I tried to assure her as best as I could that this position is really what I wanted and since I would be entering a new research field I am very excited and enthusiastic to learn as much as I can from my peers and collaborators. 

For the last 10 mins of the interview I was allowed to ask the panel some questions.  Whenever the director gave her answers she  would always bring it back to why she had a problem with my presentation and some of my answers. I really didn't know how to respond so I would kind of smile and nod and say I appreciated her constructive criticism and also give input about how I could potentially change my presentation and answers if I were to do it again.

I understand she was really trying to give constructive criticism, but the manner in which it was done was a bit of a shock to me. I don't expect every interviewer to be cheerful and welcoming like most of them were, but it's been a while since someone has completely ripped apart my presentation style and questioned my passion for the career I want. 

I wanted to get input from you guys about a couple things:


1. Was the way I handled the directors remarks appropriate? Should I have done something differently?

2. Were her remarks appropriate? Has anyone experienced this before during an interview?

3. There are a couple things I took out of her remarks that could be really helpful for my future interviews, what are some that you surmise from the conversation?

4. This position was my dream job, and I was kind of crushed by her opinion. Do you have any tips on how to move on? I'm not sure if I got the position, but it seems like there is a chance I won't. 

Thanks!"

I was feeling undervalued, overworked, and had a feeling my boss was going to be replacing me soon or at least slowly be phasing me out for someone that could be there full-time. At the time confrontation was not something I was able to handle in a professional context and I struggled to communicate how I felt with him. I felt terrible not showing up but couldn't bring myself to go into work anymore. 


I still list the job on my resume. It gave me good experience and introduced me to work that I wouldn't mind doing which is why I've started to look for similar positions. I don't list my previous boss as a reference because though I know he would've given me a good reference prior to all this, obviously the way I left negatively affected them and my character. 


My question is if I'm asked for a reference from that business or if they can contact them, what should or can I say? Should I just stop listing the position on my resume? If I say that I left ""due to unforseen personal circumstances"", I feel like that's not valid enough to warrant why they can't contact them. Any advice is appreciated."
1,2022-09-10,Moving into commission based sales? A smart idea?,u/grenadinegambler,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xahlne/moving_into_commission_based_sales_a_smart_idea/,jobs,"I worked retail when I was in my early 20s and quickly moved from associate to manager at every place I worked, then transitioned into luxury retail. After that, I took a career hiatus and spent some time using my degree to be a chemist. It was interesting but ultimately I missed working with people, so I picked a second job up back in luxury retail and picked it up like it was nothing again.

Historically I‚Äôve been top in sales entirely effortlessly from day 1 of my first job until even now. I‚Äôve achieved sales quotas just in my first few months back that haven‚Äôt been seen in years at my particular region/store (70k+ individual sales in first 80 hours etc). It‚Äôs just natural and fun for me. I have an energy that people gravitate towards.

So I‚Äôve been offered a job in selling timeshares, face to face as opposed to call centre work. Realistically, can my skills translate over? I give tours much like a realtor would and have been looking into realty as a long term career in the future. I have my license for timeshare sales so that‚Äôs not an issue, and I happen to live in a major international tourist destination. But it‚Äôs almost entirely commission based.

Realistically, what am I getting into if I decide to pursue this?

1,2022-09-10,Should I leave my current job?,u/Reply-Cultural,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xahyit/should_i_leave_my_current_job/,jobs,"For the past couple of weeks, I've been contemplating this question and today I ran out of lifelines and behold I have to ask fellow Redditors should I leave my current job?

For some background, I'm a third-year college student pursuing Cognitive Science, therefore having a school-work-life balance hasn't been the easiest.

Now for my job (bare with me), I work at a front desk at an adult residential facility that houses people with different mental illnesses. Along with typical front desk duties, I also have to dispense medications to the residents, report incidents, occasionally sweep, and more frequently serve medication and food to COVID-positive patients. The job is actually pretty chill, I get to study and do homework which is a plus. I'm usually left by myself which is cool and I recently received a raise which has helped out tremendously.

Now for my stance of wanting to leave...my schedule doesn't remain consistent at all which is hard factoring school, there have been instances where I communicate to my boss about my new school schedule and they would accommodate, but now they just assign me randomly despite reminding them of school. Another thing that factors into this is favoritism. My boss doesn't follow seniority and therefore puts people as they please. One instance they literally asked my coworker whom I have seniority over in front of me if they wanted my shift. Another issue I have is overall safety, we were instructed to go to the rooms of residents who haven't taken their medication yet. I don't feel comfortable doing this by myself since there are 100+ residents. Furthermore, when serving COVID-positive residents, I put myself at risk of contracting it and as of lately we've been getting positive residents every week. More recently (and probably the final straw) was a mistake I made that I have been ridiculed and humiliated for despite being so apologetic and honestly makes going to work so uncomfortable.

I've recently gotten an offer from UPS which matches the wages from my current job, but the main difference is the hours I will be working which I can see as a good and bad thing since the hours I will be working will be 3am-9am which gives me time to participate in groups and extracurriculars AND finally be able to attend office hours! However this will require me to wake up early. At my current job I work a mix between 3pm-11pm and 7am-3pm. The consistency in hours gives me sighs of relief. This job, however, is more physical which will be something I will have to get used to. The main reason why I'm gravitating toward this job is the health benefits and tuition assistance none of which my current job doesn't offer any of that. Furthermore, there are no opportunities to grow at my current job. After working there for two years, I'm still a front desk associate and now I'm completely stuck. What should I do?

I appreciate everyone's time reading this and responding to this!!!"

Recently, I decided to get back into babysitting. I have been babysitting off and on for 5 years. I posted on this app called NextDoor which connects you with local people. I posted my ad saying that I was looking for babysitting jobs, since I am just a college student. I put my phone number on the ad to contact me. I get a text an hour or two after I posted my ad. The lady was very vague about babysitting her son on Monday afternoon. It‚Äôs Saturday morning, now. I said that I was free and would be happy to babysit for her. I presumed she would give me more details, instead she just sent me her address and expects me to show up on Monday. I know I made a mistake accepting the job too early, but now i‚Äôm confused and quite worried to say the least. What should I do? The lady only provided me with her first name and address. That‚Äôs it. Is this concerning or am I looking too far into it? Any advice is appreciated.

Tldr: Posted an online babysitting ad, agreed to the job without any details, now i‚Äôm kinda sketched out about going to meet them."

I work for a large school district in Washington state (near Seattle) that has been so unethical and discriminatory towards anyone who isn‚Äôt black. The district hired multiple racial and equity leaders with no classroom experience to help with the hiring. I was interviewing teachers and one of the teachers, an Asian male, was the perfect candidate for the job. I called HR and they asked ‚Äúis he black?‚Äù I told them no, but he‚Äôs Asian and they said, ‚Äúsorry, we‚Äôre not moving forward then‚Äù. 

I started doing public records requests that will PROVE what I‚Äôve been trying to say and they‚Äôre altering the records! Whiting them out, writing on them‚Ä¶

One of the principals, was arrested for level 2 domestic violence and because she cannot work with children, they promoted her and created a job for her in the district office! She‚Äôs black. 

Another coach was accused of sexual misconduct by a student (who‚Äôs black) and the district swept it under the rug. And public records show he was making almost 300k a year. Why?

The started secretly firing principals that are not black  or the principals got jobs elsewhere because their lives were made difficult by the district. So now, there is an admin who is black in every building. 

Now. I don‚Äôt care, but I do care how this all happened. It‚Äôs discriminatory and unethical at best. There are interns who were placed that didn‚Äôt interview once, but only the black interns. The white interns had to go through multiple interviews and were eventually told they don‚Äôt have enough experience. 

The district has not followed their hiring policies. 

My story is more personal and I announced my resignation a few days ago. They are making me go through hoop after hoop and it‚Äôs because I have a solid case against them for something different that was so unethical. They‚Äôre not letting me out of my contract. I‚Äôm currently a teacher. Union is no help because our president is most likely in rehab and on medical leave. I need help. They‚Äôre trying to bully me and it‚Äôs not right!

My last job I was making $56,000 with a 401K match and small bonus so roughly like $60,000 total. 

I left that job to move to a new city and started applying to other jobs. I got a offer outside of my field for $70,000 and turned it down and then got an offer in my field with the city government. On paper this job would be great, but it‚Äôs only $57,000. At first I was okay with this set back in salary because I think it offers more advancement and connections, but I just found out that I must put in a mandatory 11% of my salary to a pension that I will receive nothing from unless I stay for 10 years. I can get it back if I don‚Äôt stay, but I get no interest on the money at all and am not able to invest it. There is no match from the city nor a 401K like option with or without match. 

I wanted this job, but I feel like I have to turn it down because it‚Äôs such a bad offer. However, this means I have to start the application process all over again and it might be another 2-4 months before I get another offer. Thoughts?"

In the interview, the job was described as a mostly office based (remote and in person), 9-5 job with a moderate level of responsibility.

Well.... after doing the job for about a month, I have spent most of my time in the field doing manual labor with little to no responsibility and hours that are closer to 8-6.

On one hand, it's nice to get paid a significant amount of money to a manual labor job, but on the other hand there appears to be no career progression and I am upset that the job they hired me for and the one that I'm doing are completely different.

Overall I like the people I work with but it seems that this job has a lot of red flags.

Would you:
A) Quit the job (I have the financial resources to be unemployed for about a year)
B) Enjoy making project manager money for a manual labor job
C) Confront my boss about the discrepancies in the job listing and the actual job

Why?,u/JOJO8976,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xatoyt/does_company_really_be_using_private_number_to/,jobs,"I'm currently doing job hunting and so far I've missed 2 private number calls, which I assumed it was from companies that I applied. 

The 1st time was because I was in my part-time job shift and I works in a kitchen, so there's no way I can bring a phone near the stove.

The second one was when I was in class and in the middle of a test.

Both of those situation was impossible for me to keep my phone. Other people that are doing job hunting might also had a similar situation, most of those times it was beyond our ability to keep our phones at hands at all times.

And to make matters worse, those 2 calls came unannounced, unlike doing video calls where we will get a notice beforehand. Why not using email, even an automated response from a noreply email would be better than private number.

Doing job hunting is already hard and this only makes it worse .-.

Imagine how many opportunities that job seekers might have missed due to this.

It would be good if there's HR or hiring manager here that can answer this."

I've given up about 4 jobs within the past 3 years and I'm going crazy.

I already have PTSD and a bunch of other mental problems.  
I've made a similar thread about this before while working at a warehouse job for Fiat/Chrysler.

I've taken the advice of having a recorder on my phone on but in this place the music is very loud so it'll be tough to get any evidence.

I just don't get it. They can just ask me instead of going around calling me gay.

It's just outright bullying at this point.  Everyone and I mean everyone at my work is doing this as if it gets them off. I will be contacting the EEOC.

So I recently just got fed up with my job and started looking for a new one. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd find one so quick and the pay and benefits are much better than what my current job offered me.

Once I got offered the new job I requested 2 days off towards the end of the month so I could use some PTO before I leave. I mentioned I wanted to use some vacation time to the new company and they were fine with that. So this was in a total of a month span.

I requested those 2 days off got my days approved by my manager and about 2 weeks later I put in my 2 weeks notice that I was resigning. Old boss gave a few counter offers and one of them I accepted, and then I took those 2 days of vacation off. 

On the 2nd day of vacation I ended up speaking with the new company again and changed my mind and decided to go with them since the benefits for the new company still outweighed the higher pay old boss was offering. 

I gave my manager a call and apologized for the back and forth but decided to still move forward with the new company. She was perfectly understanding about the whole thing. 

Now fast forward a week later and I get my paycheck and noticed they didn‚Äôt pay me my vacation days since I am resigning.. is this even legal to do? I was employed when I requested those days off and was still an employee when I took those 2 days off. Which also means they will probably not pay me for Labor Day either. So that‚Äôs a total of 3 days I won‚Äôt be paid for. Their policy is they don‚Äôt pay out unused paid time off when employment is terminated. 

I‚Äôve emailed my manager, payroll and HR stating I will file a wage claim if those hours are not added on to next paycheck and got a response from no one. I have no clue what to do at this point. 

Also wanted to add I emailed payroll that I wanted to use my vacation hours for those 2 days during that week I took off and she never responded and let a week pass by until I had to email her again asking why my paycheck was screwed up. 

Safe to say I made the right choice leaving this hell hole."

im wondering if a made the right decision accepting this offer and if it would be bad to decline the job and continue looking.

EDIT: wow i never thought so many people would comment. some have great advice, others are leaving negativity which is starting to hurt my mental health a bit. please be kind. as a young girl with no parents and little guidance, the fact that i made it through college was a miracle. 

i have worked at an assisted living facility as a med tech/insulin tech all through college and it has been such a rewarding job. i chose healthcare admin bc i love healthcare, but i wasn‚Äôt sure if patient interaction would be right bc i have bad anxiety (so nursing wasn‚Äôt an option). i know i should‚Äôve probably worked as an admin assistant through college, but giving that advice now is pointless. 

please be kind. this is a very hard time in someone‚Äôs life. many of you do not know me or my story. i wasn‚Äôt trying to sound entitled by the post, but with absolutely no one i could have to support me if i needed financial assistance, money is of the essence to me."

Sorry if this isn't the right sub to post on. Will delete if it isn't!

I just got hired for a two-year graduate / early career program for a big American company (I'm French, the job is based in Luxembourg, and the European side of the company is based in the Netherlands).

I was reading over the agreement they sent me (haven't signed it yet), and basically I found two separate clauses that say I have to pay the company money if I quit the job. The most compelling one was this :

&gt; 6.6. In case of termination of the Early Career Program Agreement on the initiative of the Employee pursuant to article 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 above, the following fee shall be paid by the Employee to \[company\]:   
&gt;  
&gt;Within 1 to 12 months of employment        EUR 2,500   
&gt;  
&gt;Within 13 to 24 months of employment      EUR 5,000 

The other one said I'd also have to reimburse relocation support costs that they gave me, which would be more understandable for me. Articles 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 are if I terminate the employment or refuse the second rotation (second year) they assign me.

Is this normal, or did I misunderstand?? I've never seen such a clause before where you have to pay a penalty for quitting. What the heck. I don't plan on quitting but you never know what may come up... Any advice on how I should handle this?"

I am reaching out to you as this is my last resort, I am a software engineer graduate and I specialize in Data Science, I graduate in Dec 2021 from on the best IT related university in Tunisia (If not the best). 

Now I am obviously still an Entry Level / Junior employee, however I do have interesting internships / academic / professional experience however small it is.

I worked remotely when I was still studying as a machine learning engineer for 8 months, I also went to France for a 6 months internship in one of the best universities in France (Research project). etc

Currently, I am unemployed, and I am looking for a job in my field, or even not, something related to IT (even IT support). I wrote a very good resume, professional, has all types of key words to pass the scanning, etc. I am pretty sure my resume is more than fine, I even compared it to some of my old classmates who graduated as well and it was even better.

However, working in Tunisia is NOT AN OPTION, the state of engineers here is devastating, you can work as a full time Data Scientist and get paid between 300$ and 400$ per month, that's how bad the economy is (whether public or private). So basically all new graduates seek opportunities overseas (Europe, Canada, USA, Asia...) Literally anywhere when you can be appreciated and get what you deserved.

I have been applying non-stop for the last 3 months, LinkedIn, [indeed.com](https://indeed.com), welcome to the jungle, [monster.com](https://monster.com), etc. and all I got is an endless amount of rejections. Now, one of the main reasons unfortunately is the visa issue, most companies do not want to bother with someone who requires a visa sponsorship, but still it cannot be this bad, especially that Tunisia is actually considered a very good source of good quality engineers in Europe, but I got no luck with this. After hundreds (I am talking 500+) of applications I ended up with only 2 technical tests, which I did great on but got rejected anyways.

I am pretty confident that my profile is good enough for a junior engineer, but it started getting on my nerve, especially that I didn't let any type of IT related position go buy, I am ok with the bare minimum of salary just to survive, and then things will turn up.

Anyways, I was wondering, if by any chance one of you works or knows any specific responsive company or a certain position that is available so I can apply I will be more than grateful.  
(Machine learning / deep learning / data science / python / tensorflow / fine tuning ...........)

I am willing to share my resume in private with whoever thinks he can help me.

Thank you very much and have a great day"

I can't enroll into any colleges until December, so I'm just pretty much left with a whole lot of free time until then. I much rather be making money instead of just sitting on my ass all day in a new city, since my parents also moved over the summer. 

I worked at Walmart for a little over a year but that didn't work out all too well in the end. I recently started  working at Office Depot, but it's not exactly a job I enjoy or really look forward to doing or showing up to every day. Even though the workplace environment is small and not very fast-paced, compared to Walmart. I dislike the fact that my nearby coworkers are always looking over my shoulder every time I cashier and babying me over the dumbest of things. I can do my job, I honestly don't feel like certain people feel the need to look over me. My managers seemingly trust me more than certain people do.  Customers are a different story, I feel I've encountered worse Customers here compared to all three Walmarts I worked at. At least when cashiering, like for example today I was asking an older gentleman if he wanted a bag and he told me to ""Stop policing him"".  Whatever the hell that means. I feel like everyday I get some sort of rude encounter with a customer, but that's just retail I guess. 

I can't work at Costco or many other jobs due to the fact I'm not eighteen (although I will be in December) , and I've never really had luck with Target, I always never really did good with their virtual interviews. I feel like Costco seems to be my best bet with retail, but once you turn 18 it seems like there's a whole new world of opportunities when it comes down to jobs. 

Is there anything you guys can think of for me to try for a job, or I am pretty much stuck with retail and fast food until I turn 18 and my diploma doesn't mean much until then?"

Me, my wife, and 2 sons (an 8 month old and 2 year old almost 3) are currently living in the Dallas-Fort Worth area getting ready to move back where I grew up in Louisiana in March of next year. I'm working as an apprentice plumber making close to 55k (really good for an apprentice salary) on my way to getting my license and a raise. I've been offered interviews as a commercial fisherman in Alaska after 3-4 weeks of grinding applications. This job would require me to leave home for 2 months at a time, possibly 3, working 16 hour days, 7 days a week, but potentially making 15-17k for a 65 day contract starting out. The work isn't the issue, it's the thought of leaving my wife and kids on and off throughout the year if I make a short career out of this. My kids are my life and I've been very conflicted about this new opportunity even though I've been working hard to make it happen. The bulk pay is good and I've made plans to put that towards whatever debt we've accumulated out here as well as a travel saving and savings that the kids can use later on. Me and my wife together make decent money but also she has a dream of being a stay at home mom which this new job can make happen.

I applied for a job at my level but with a different ""perspective""--more theoretical than practical, if that makes any sense.  Same actual work but with a different language/jargon.  The interview process was crazy and extensive and I didn't expect it and wasn't adequately prepared.  That's on me!  After the first or second set of interviews I fully expected to be told I wasn't a good fit and I'd go on my way.

Instead they had me continue through several weeks with many (many!!!) additional interviews.  After a month they said they wanted to hire me but with a different job title although the salary would still be in my specified range; they couldn't give me a salary offer until I actually applied for the different position.  I looked at the new job description and it was for an entry level person requiring no job experience at all.  No salary range was listed but even if they offer me an enormous salary I feel insulted.  They wasted a lot of my time and it's clear to me that my different perspective doesn't fit their expectations.  We're not a good match and I'm not going to apply for the other position.

I don't know why they kept me going so long or why they thought I'd go for an entry level job.  I feel humiliated and disrespected and want to communicate that.  What would you do?"

For personal reasons, I want to be able to have a job that would let me travel around from state to state (I live in US) doing my job. However, the two big classes that i‚Äôm taking rn are computer science and graphic design, two jobs which i see as not having any real ‚Äútravel‚Äù opportunities. What jobs are out there if any that would let me travel around with the skill set i will emerge with later in my life? Everything for me is undecided as for computer science i‚Äôm more interested in hardware than software and i‚Äôm not creative enough to be a graphic designer. In fact, i‚Äôm not really sure what i want to do even though the time of me getting a functional job is rapidly approaching.

I haven't worked in retail in over 13 years and i was childless, no hubby. I forgot what it's really like and wasn't looking for retail except for ONE possible option. I was mostly looking for hybrid, and maybe WFH (preferred hybrid) and was looking at the whole ""is it me? Do i want to do that?"" But having a family completely changed my perspective. I realized it because i took a job that is related to my lifestyle, but it's also got not amazing hours and not work from home or hybrid. I thought it was a good opportunity, and it is, but boy is it hard to balance much. The pay is pretty good. But wondering if it's worth it. I am living the reality of it, coming home late at irregular hours, and it's on the middle of the day. I'm starting to see how it will eat up my time. So suddenly work life balance might be a challenge.  I'm not ready to leave, i told myself to stick it out for a year. 

How long do you think a person should work at a place to give a fair assessment? Or decide to quit?  I also realized I'm the only one there with a family. Or rather, a young family. I am a manager, and have a very young (18 mo ) old child. Either people don't have kids or their kids are grown. It was just a real reality check and a reminder to why i didn't look at other retail jobs. I also realized some other perks like WFH and hybrid were such important options, more than i thought, and i really wasn't sure if a ""paycut"" would be worth it or not, and i pulled out of a job for that reason, but it had the hybrid option and I'm kind of kicking myself for pulling out of it. I've been freaking out because of the lack of flexibility.. maybe if i had better hours I'd feel better. maybe it was something else, but suddenly i need to look at my criteria for a job again. 

I'm not sure what this post is about. I guess I'm wondering how long some people have waited to leave a place, and about opinions about job hopping this day and age. Wasn't wanting to do that, but the hours!

I think i need some rest."

&amp;#x200B;

Long story  - I was pregnant when I moved to a smaller city to get out of a Domestic Violence situation. I don't really have anything else going on in this city but a few friends. Luckily I found this job and I am still working through a temp agency. There are many people in the company who have been temps for years. I'm not sure what that means but it couldn't be good. It also couldn't be good that we have so many people retiring, lots of turnover and a bunch of temps who are a bit incompetant/unemployable.

On Thursday, my boss sends me an email saying ""complete this task"" in laments terms. There was no sense of urgency and I'm used to being so backlogged that I put some things off. Usually he will also CALL me to be sure I received an email about anything urgent. We had been chit-chatting back and forth all day via Teams as I was asking questions about certain issues I was running into. He waited until the end of the day to ask if I completed that task. I feel like we have a pretty solid yet light rapport so I said ""Oh yeah, that one. Looks like a mess so I've put it off until the end of the day.""

I called him about it immediately since I didn't get an email back and he asked me ""WHY it hadn't been completed"". My 8-month-old was in the background kind of singing and babbling so I keep apologizing and asking If he could hear her. He said he couldn't at all. Needless to say, I was trying to work through the task with him and make sure I was getting it done. My baby was just going on and on, I was trying to share a screen and open doc's while in an ERP system, and he just snapped on me and said something along the lines of ""This is just completely unacceptable and you've haven't been holding up your end on things for a while now!"" that I ""wasn't paying attention, I couldn't focus and I couldn't even get basic tasks done because I was too worried about my baby."" I was shocked because even with my stressful like (court proceedings, raising a baby alone and unreliable sitters, lack of support system) I work my ASS off for this company. I often send emails in the wee hours and  have sleepless nights.  I work flex hours but I jump right on a task when it's send my way. I also get to take on the problems other people don't want to fix (Accounting).

In the middle of my apology I got angry! It turned into a slight blowup where I explained that he didn't make it seem urgent, he didn't explain the task well and I was basically blindsighted. I also went into personal detail to explain that I had slept about 2 hours in the past 3 days and I was completed burnt-out. He said he would just take the task into his own hands and I said I would be sure to call my agent with the temp agency. Click. Hung up.

We came to terms the next day that he couldn've trained me better and been available more often (He;s usually hard to reach). However, he also made a point to tell me I've made mistakes on simple tasks. Well - we are so backlogged now we've hired a salary GRANADE who is destroying the flow of anything good we had left. I BS'ed and apologized and said I was so appreciative to have the job...but I'm not. I have to keep this job to maintain my freedom and safety but I'm alone, I have no life other than stressful things.

I went on fiverr and got a few people to help me apply for jobs in other areas and even remote. Should I continue busting my ass in hopes this will get better, quit or make it to where they lay me off and I can go get a part-time job along with unemployment? I kind thought I'd meet in the middle and half-ass/do the bare minimum since I'm clearly not appreciated  &amp; my boss pulled a dick move on me.  (He's very aware of my personal life and why I've moved here, why I've taken the job, how it is my freedom &amp; security basically) Thoughts - Suggestions - based on your experience or what you've seen?

Oh, also, I'm completing an online program just to get the RIGHT bachelor's and I'm so far behind. I cannot file another appeal and I can't drop out. If it were up to me I'd just be focusing on my baby and classes.... I just can't do this anymore. I'm losing my mind. Thanks in advance!

PS- before you ask, I HAVE reached out to all family, all friends and literally said I am a wreck! I cannot handle any sleep + all of the stress anymore + mental anguish. No one has stepped up. No one has ever visited except my friend who stops by every now and then. I have a few people who WILL, but it might be too late. Most of my friends and family are online and just see smiling pretty faces and like that. As soon as I complain about work, they are nowhere to be found. ALSO - I do have a therapist. I am working on myself. I'm open to a roommate situation to cut costs. I'm still searching for another babysitter who will work out.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: It's Sunday evening and I sent an email out showing what I worked on over the weekend. I expect to get some calls within the next few weeks. I don't even care if I need to go to a grocery store (well, I do...I'd prefer to work at home)...but if it came down to it, I'd be able to find 1-2 jobs within a few days. I need to not give a damn as much as him. That's just how I feel. I will get my job done but since I'm only a temp I'm not taking on anything outside of the scope of my job description (which we have gone over before). I'm going to get out. Most of the people who left were older women and they seemed to feel bad that I was under his management. Now I see why. Thank you all for your helpful tips and insight. Things are going in the right direction."

I don‚Äôt know if this is new, but I am living it and hearing it from many of my friends. 

Companies will make an incredible effort to hire the best students straight out of college (even a year or two before they graduate!). Since these graduates have no real work experience or connections in the field, they don‚Äôt know what type of work is reasonable (such as working hours, amount of stress, workplace respect, etc..). Many graduates will end up being exploited by theses companies with big ‚Äúpromises‚Äù of potential, when in reality they are doing the grunt work nobody wants to do, with little actual learning opportunities and living through some workplace horror stories. 

As a student, I stayed in 5-star hotels and had all-paid trips to headquarters only to be working as an analyst 12 hours a day, no lunch break and being made feel bad about taking holidays, in an extremely toxic workplace environment.

Secondly, does anyone have experience moving from a laid back role to a more intense one?

I‚Äôve done the maths and I‚Äôll take home ¬£350 a month after all extra costs incurred, is this worth the detriment to my current work life balance? Keen to hear peoples thoughts!

Thanks all."

1373,2022-09-11,"After 11 years in my industry, (25 interviews in 2022) I finally make 100k working fully remote. You can do it!",u/SarcasticLogic,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xbf9rg/after_11_years_in_my_industry_25_interviews_in/,jobs,"Exactly 6 years ago, I was making 40k. From 11 years ago, I was making 32k. I was getting 2k raises every year at the same company for 4 years. That's when this sub and others like it motivated me to keep seeking employment until I was satisfied. I, like many of you, was severely underpaid after obtaining a degree after university/college.


I truly believed in working hard will pay off. That's not always the case. No matter how hard you work, your raises won't be as good as moving on elsewhere. At the very least, use your new offer to ask your current company to match. 


Remember, salary is not the only thing on the bargaining table. I've bargained for signing bonus, vacation days, year end bonus, PTO. My best advice is to NEVER accept the first offer. No matter how desperate you are. Go against how you feel. Whatever they offer you, they will accept at least 2k more.


I hope this motivates you and not dishearten you on your search. I applied at 300 high quality companies the past decade. I refused offers that did not improve my career in some way (title/salary/benefits/commute). Once you have that first entry level job for your career, start applying after 1 year of experience. Always keep your resume updated, Linkedin set to looking for opportunities. Tell your network (not current job) that you are open-minded about different type of work/industry. 


If you are struggling to get that first job, I recommend using buzz words on your resume/cover letter. Example: Attention to detail, motivated, enthusiastic, team player, analysis, data presentation, excel, resourceful, project management, process, client service. Incorporate these things in your resume/cover letter and it will be more attractive. If you have software knowledge in your specific industry, list them somewhere. These things flag them because HR just scans through.


I understand I am one of the very lucky people. I have also been through a whole ordeal with work during covid. I hope whatever you are seeking, you will eventually climb out of your situation.

Good luck /r/jobs!


Edit: Everyone asking what industry; I am in law. I work in a law firm in the Accounting Department as a Billing Specialist. Look up Billing Coordinators, Billing Specialists, Billing Supervisors, Billing Managers, E-billing Specialist, AR / Collections. You will find hundreds of jobs. Most industry needs them. They range from 30-150k. Most will advertise hybrid. This job does not require you to be in the office and it is not tech. Sorry if the buzz words are unhelpful, but that was how I was taught to be caught in generic HR systems. Also, use RECRUITERS. They cost you nothing but sending your resume to them. They will check their database and find jobs for you in your field because they make commission from getting you employed."

It's a good job, I get along with almost everyone. However, I feel like the workplace is also very cliquey, almost like high school. I am in my mid-20s, and half of the people I work with are around the age of 18-21 years old. There are around 80-90 employees at my job or so.

I do have a few friends (like 5 people) who I consider close to me, and we talk/hang out outside of work (we're lowkey about it, since I'm a manager, and they know to differentiate work/personal). We became friends either because we were already friends before I became a manager, or because we bonded over very specific things (like music for example). I'm also friends with one other manager, but I'm not really close with any of the other managers.

It's not that I don't want friends at all, but I'm very picky with who I become friends with at work. This is because I got to know these people over the years and it's always gossip, drama, etc. I simply just feel like I'm too way past that age where I don't want to feel like I'm stuck in that high school phase. I am willing to be friends with coworkers, but these coworkers are just not the kind of people I want to be friends with.

I'm still friendly with everyone, and most people seems to like me and have no issues with me, but I just want a professional relationship with everyone at this point. I just feel like bad about this because it seems that even the other managers (who are around my age or older) seem to be close with everyone, and they're always huddling together and talking, and hanging out outside of work, while I try to avoid that. I kinda just wanna come to work and do my job."

I found a job posting for a technical artist position in Austria ( i live in Hungary) and almost everything they asked for in regards of skills, i had. I figured i will send in a general application, maybe they will hire me as a 3D artist. Turns out, they took my application for the technical artist position. 

\*Surprised Pikachu face\*

We had our first interview on Teams and what was supposed to be a 30-40min interview turned out to be over one and a half hour. The interviewers (not HR, one HR was sick and the other on vacation so they couldn't attend.) would be my immediate superiors and they were really nice, we got along well, i think. They explained what the job would be, that they are considering me as a junior applicant. How the company operates, the pay and why i applied. I think it went well overall. 

They will send me an email next week about the next round of the application, which would be to go to Graz for a face to face, small tests and stuff. How i approach problems. etc. 

**Im fucking terrified. Will i be good enough? Will i be a good fit?** 

Technical artists (TAs) **make the work of the artists easier**. They help develop the games engines, so they work as well as possible for the people making the art. If an artist wants to create something complex, TAs will say if it's possible from a technical point of view and think of the best way of doing it. 

My job would be to research how to implement things, new workflows. Be a pioneer basically. Even though i know they would be hiring me for a junior Position, that the expectations wouldn't be that high in the beginning i still can't get rid of the feeling of being incompetent. Every other company i applied to refused me so far :S

Since I do have a degree and experience and it‚Äôs a contractor job that I have to fill self employed taxes, i would love $25 but would be fine with $24. 

Can someone give me their perspective of what hourly salary I should aim for? Would $25 be too much of me asking? I‚Äôm worried they tell me they‚Äôll offer $20 lol"

To cut things short I‚Äôm an engineer and was recently laid off from my job (3 weeks ago) whilst on holiday. In a bit of a panic I applied for quite a few jobs and have started one and been offered another 2 start dates. Then unexpectedly on Friday I received a call from my former employer offering me an almost ¬£20 pound an hour raise and what I‚Äôm currently on. 

The job I‚Äôm at now is not the best financially but they‚Äôve offered me a lot of training and are already talking about a pay rise after 2 weeks. I don‚Äôt know how I can turn down this other job offer and I feel really bad about leaving as I‚Äôm helping them out quite a bit and feel leaving could really mess them about.  

My hearts set on the other job but I don‚Äôt know what to say to my current employers about leaving. I want to try and avoid all conflict and try not to burn any bridges. I know out of work any person you speak to would understand someone tripling your wages but I think it could get a bit heated in a work environment"

We're not super buddies, but we do see each other out in the community and I like them personally. Also, I am the boss, so yeah, I think I should feel a little guilty. I'm not a sociopath ffs"

Full disclosure, I am a career .net / azure person. Could I transfer to something like ruby and Java? Likely - give me a year to feel really confident. Do I want to? No - not at all. I would have to be pretty desperate. I have dabbled and am completely disinterested in making the switch from MS.   


Is this just a general disconnect in the industry or are other job seekers simply just not as picky as me? I am now at a point in my career where I have had quite a bit of management or tech lead experience. I am searching for Senior and Management roles or even open to being a Director. The latter job postings I find even more frustrating. I am a firm believer in mid-level management actually understanding the technology that all of the people they manage live and die by. I frankly don't want to manage a team of Ruby or Node.JS devs when I have so little background in it myself because I feel as though I would be doing them a disservice.

My thinking is, I'm OK with being scheduled as much as they need during days when I'm available and with sufficient warning, but my wide availability is not the same as being on call 24/7 or your emergency relief worker. They seem to think because I'm available they can call me all the time on my days off when I have things planned. 

Am I wrong for thinking there's a difference between being available to be scheduled and being available on their whims due to their poor planning?"
36,2022-09-11,Landed a job asking for four times my experience...,u/PeterMus,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xbw7j0/landed_a_job_asking_for_four_times_my_experience/,jobs,"I finished graduate school in 2020 in an attempt to make a career change. I spent the first six months of my job hunt being resistent to applying for jobs where the responsibilities were outside of my comfort zone. In my career I've been a SME for the last five years and I'm often the one answering people's questions. So it felt uncomfortable to stretch my skill set. 

After a while I got more and more desperate. I'd land interviews but they'd say I wasn't experienced enough with just graduate school and some slightly related career experience. I'd occassionally hear back that I was ""overqualified"" but it felt patronizing and it likely was just the hiring manager attempting to be kind.

Eventually, It felt like I'd never find a job. I was coming up on two years since graduating and I'd been second choice three or four times for different roles. 

I was struggling...badly.

So I started to ignore job descriptions entirely. I had to stop telling myself no. I had to stop assuming I couldn't make a job work and realize that job duties are always negotiable. In fact multiple times I was directly told the job I'd applied for was going to be customized to the experience of the person hired. 

So I just applied to everything I thought might work for me. 

I landed an interview for a senior role that required 5-8 years experience. The interviewer even suggested that they'd prefer someone with more experience. They questioned why I'd applied and why I felt qualified for the role. 

I told them very plainly that I felt I had the base level skills and every role requires learning and growth. I'm ready to learn and work hard. 

The final interview was a writing sample for work they'd already done to see how it would measure up. 

I worked hard on it and they loved it. They felt I had the right attitude,strongly aligned with their perspective/outlook and have the potential to take on the more senior responsibilities in the next year or so.

I'm so excited the grind is finally over. I was close to giving up on it entirely. But being bold enough to apply for greater roles and advocate for myself really made a path for me to get this opportunity. 

I hope this helps push someone to open themselves up for more job roles and apologetically chase bigger opportunities."

I'm majoring in psychology and I thought this could really improve my resume so I accepted it right away (only had two days to respond). Basically, I have to work at least 15 hours a week but upon asking for more hours they couldn't give me more hours which made me second guess this opportunity. The reason being is that this clinic is 40 minutes away (60 minutes with traffic) and I have to commute 5 days a week, meaning that I'd have to drive a total of 80+ minutes for 5 days for a 3hr shift. A few other things aside from that that deterred me away from the job are the fact that I had to pay $120 out of pocket to get a TB test and a fingerprint scan with no reimbursement (they didn't accept insurance), the two week training period is $14/hr, and that the CEO had bashed people for leaving 6 months into the job when interviewing me. I've gotten advice from older family members and a large number of people did say there were more disadvantages than advantages, such as most of my paycheck going to gas and car expenses and it's just really inconvenient. So, should I take the job for my resume but make not much money out of it? Or should I look for another job simply to build capital? Thanks

Edit: I‚Äôm not really passionate in psychology as I first was but I‚Äôm in my last year and I feel like it‚Äôs a bit too late to do anything since school is really expensive, so it‚Äôs not guaranteed that I‚Äôll even use my psych degree.

I know it's a bit much but I felt such anger towards this company at the end of it.

Describe the company interview process:

Obscenely long and overly complicated interview process. The whole thing took 10 weeks and I had (11) separate calls with my recruiter alone AND then 8 hours worth of time dedicated just to interviews with (I‚Äôm not making this up) 15 different people. After submitting an application directly through their site, they then asked me to submit another one through a different portal, asking for 4 references and to find the exact day I started and left my previous employers. I also had to complete 8 pages worth of assessments (mostly writing prompts or asking me how I would solve certain problems they deal with). My recruiter, overall, seemed like a nice enough person but their quickness in response was horrible. The recruiter was never able to give me an accurate timeline of events going forward, constantly saying they would have updates in ‚Äúa few days‚Äù and weeks would go by without a response. The recruiter also never answered their phone, making it impossible to speak with them unless they called you. Although the recruiter I had, on the surface, seemed like a very nice person, I felt something off. Like they were forcing a smile with every sentence. A bit much.¬†

¬†¬†¬† The interviews themselves were mentally and physically exhausting. I had (3) separate 2 hour interviews. Each of the 2 hour interviews had at least 4 different people I was speaking with. 30 mins each per person or group and then they switch to someone else. Almost every person I interviewed with asked the, ‚ÄúTell me about a time when you..‚Äù questions. They also didn‚Äôt talk with one another so I would be answering the same ‚ÄúHypothetical Scenario‚Äù questions multiple times. So monotonous and frustrating. One person‚Äôs interview skills were just atrocious. They asked me a hypothetical scenario question, I answered, and then they IMMEDIATELY looked down at their notes to ask another similar scenario question. The atmosphere reeked of pretentiousness throughout. They had this arrogant and smug sense about themselves and the work they were doing. They think they‚Äôre saving the world and you have to be absolute perfection to join them. Very culty vibes overall.¬†

¬†¬†¬† Overall, for a job that they say required 3 yrs of experience, the pay was very low. Never in my life have I had to go through so many hoops and deal with one company interviewing me for such a long time for such a low salary. They expect you to just tag along for weeks on end without any updates and hope. Like most people, I'll be applying for and interviewing at multiple places. Do you really think you‚Äôll attract top talent consistently if you make the process so unbearably long? While waiting for an update with OverDrive, I was offered $15,000 more for a similar position at another company and I accepted. Weeks later, after leaving VM messages and emailing my recruiter about a status update (even though employed at the new company, I was curious if OverDrive would ever even offer me something), I was sent a generic rejection letter. 10 weeks later, that‚Äôs all I got. My recruiter didn‚Äôt even have the guts to call me back or send me an email herself. I felt like this company didn‚Äôt care about the time and effort that I put in throughout this whole process. However, I feel like I've dodged a bullet with this company.¬†¬†"

I have been working a little less than 2 years at this small company where I am the only analytics person, and I am responsible for creating dashboards in Tableau, which has occasionally been used by the Customer Managment Team but as of right now it's not part of the workflow. As this is a small company I've had 3 different supervisors, and currently I'm formally reporting to an analytics manager sort of person, but I had been reporting to the CTO for half a year before him. 

Here's the deal--I have been messy at work lately. I had done good things in the past (in fact I have produced work that helped the company create value, and the CEO wrote a post on our company's linkedin that complimented me by name, and I got a salary increase at the performance review in the beginning of the year), but the past 3 months or so I have been spending too much time on Non-work related websites (think reddit) on the company computer, and I've been making a bunch of dumb mistakes in my work. I wish I could give a good reason for this, but the simple truth is I had been growing complacent in my job. I acknowledge my faults and will definitely not do this again if I go through the next week with my position still intact.

 Anyway, the most notable of these dumb mistakes is forgetting to embed all passwords when uploading Tableau Workbooks to the Server, which long story short renders the Customer management team unable to access the workbooks until I fix this. I have made this mistake a few times, and my CTO had given me verbal warnings in 1 on 1 meetings back when he supervised me, an email some time ago, and last Friday I made this mistake again. He sent me a slack message about it in a chat with him, me, and my current manager, and the both of them immediately set up 1:1 meetings with me, both on this upcoming Tuesday, with the CTO after my current manager's, even though weeks had gone since my last 1:1 with the CTO and my current manager hasn't had those meetings before. Given the timing I knew it's nothing good.

I have, of course, been freaking out about this all weekend. According to my own analysis of the situation, I think it's unlikely that either the CTO or my new manager would be firing me in their Tuesday meetings. The CTO doesn't have the legislative right to do so, but he wouldn't have scheduled a meeting after my meeting with my current manager's if my current manager's going to fire me. I think what's probably to come is a stern discussion, at worst a step closer to getting fired. But I am posting this because 1) I don't want to be overly optimistic and misinterpret warning signs and 2) I wanted to know if there's anyway to remedy the situation. Yes, i take full responsibility for my actions and this unprofessional behaviour definitely will not happen again, and I know the only true way of redeeming myself is, well, to not make the same mistakes again. But is there anything else I should do?

Please don't judge my unprofessional behavior, I know I am wrong, and I am working on them. This will definitely be a warning bell for me.

Thank you."

I got a job offer as a senior lead mfg engineer for a startup company. The company looks to be pretty promising. I currently live in MD and they gave me the option of either living in the Boston/Natick metropolitan area or San Carlos/San Fransisco metropolitan area. I told them I would want to live in CA over MA due to the warm weather, things to do, etc. For reference, I am 29 years old and am single although I would like to meet someone and start a family.

The company offered me a salary of 180k which is a decent salary for Natick/Boston but for San Carlos where the median housing price is 2.3 million dollars, I couldn't even afford to live. I don't want to rent and make the landlord rich. I would rather buy my own house and build equity, but when a 2 bedroom condo in San Carlos is 1.2 - 1.6 million dollars, how could I afford this on a 180k salary where over 40 percent of my salary is eaten up by taxes and I have to pay health insurance, etc? I counter-offered at 250k salary since cost of living is so much higher (pay differential).

Did I make the right move? What salary would you deem acceptable for the San Carlos/San-Francisco area? In MD where I currently live, I could live very well off of 180k. But in San Carlos, I feel like I would barely be making it on that salary."

All of her classes were taken remotely due to the impact of the pandemic. Her major is Business Economics. She recently earned her bachelor's degree at UCI. She's never done any internships, jobs, or extracurricular activities ever. But she did volunteer at a real estate office as an assistant for a month in 2020. Nonetheless, that's all she's done. She feels hopeless constantly searching for jobs and internships on so many job sites with no job offers. She applied for jobs on Indeed, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn, and Glassdoor. However, she didn't receive any offers from any job connected to her major. Additionally, she received constant rejections from numerous businesses. She applied to around 60 jobs (some aren't even legit and are not precisely connected to her field) for 2 months. Each of the positions she wants to apply to expects no less than 3-5 years of experience in the field, which is absolutely absurd. For what reason do they require someone with that many years of experience if they're gonna undergo training anyways? I understand if most jobs require that many years of job experience, however, it seems like 90% of them are like this. That's too much. Can anyone recommend to my friend other relevant job sites that are legit and accepts no experience applicants? Thank you all!"

I‚Äôve been at my current company almost 3 years
(Was planning to start job hunting once it hit 3yrs). My previous job I was at 1yr 6 months and my first job before that was a 6 month contract job since leaving education at 19.I left it 5 months due to taking a few months off work as a parent was in the hospital. There are no large CV gaps as for all jobs but the first one which is only 2-3 months. However I was a university student at the time. 

They were all retail/customer service roles.I thought I did quite well maintaining a solid work history and ensuring I had a job lined up to avoid CV gaps. I thought it was very common to job hop/ find a new employer in this current job market as I‚Äôve noticed a lot of people on LinkedIn switch jobs every 3-5 years. However my partners mother who works in HR and was at the same job for 12 years says I look like a job hopper. 

That employers want to see that whoever they hire is committed/ they won‚Äôt be wasting the companies resources training them for them to leave in a year or two. I am planning on applying for entry level office based customer service/ general office/admin roles. I am now really hesitant if I should wait till I‚Äôve been at my current retail job a bit longer (maybe another 6-12months) or start applying. 

Will this hurt me in the long run?"

I'm happy to have this job and don't want to sound ungrateful, but I hoped for a longer time, since I want some financial stability in my life for once. 

When asked, my employer said that there will be another contract after this one and they don't know the details yet. Seems like they want to see if I'm good enough before saying anything.

I was brought on FT and was not given any sort of negative criticism about my work ethic for the duration of my time working where I was. On my last day, my director called a meeting for just him and I where he came down to my office and handed me a termination letter that had no reason on it as to why. He told me he couldn't tell me and when I called the county HR, they also could not tell me. Nobody I called could give me an answer.

When I checked on Indeed as I was job searching, I found my position up, except now it was a seasonal, lower paying position. On my resume, I have that position I was in as seasonal instead of FT despite me being hired on as a FT employee there just so they don't start asking me questions about why I was there for such a short amount of time in a FT position. Does anybody foresee any sort of issues arising from this? I'm going to get a bad review from them if an employer calls them because I put them through some legal stuff (which I won because my old job lied about their reasons and it was seen in my favor).

So the question now: Am I alright to leave it as seasonal on my resume instead of FT, or does anybody think this will cause huge issues with me being hired?"

I was located in Indianapolis Indiana which wasn‚Äôt ideal but I really enjoyed the job. When I started full time Covid created some issues but after a few months the job was great again. One year ago they announced we were closing the Indianapolis office and that we were losing the account for company Y that I was on. I was ultimately left with 3 options.

Option 1. Stay with company X and move to either Livonia MI or Harrisburg PA. But I have had talks with my managers about future promotion opportunities as I was a top performer in my role and took on a unofficial team lead role.

Option 2. Company Y ended the contract to bring the work internal. They noticed I was a top performer and told me to apply where it felt implied the job was guaranteed. Ultimately they gave me one interview in which 90% of it was them trying to convince me to join them. It was the same office as I was previously in because they actually owned the office space company X was using. Company Y offered about a 15% raise + better benefits.

Option 3. Look for jobs elsewhere and relocate to a more desirable city. I‚Äôm from the east coast and didn‚Äôt want to stay in the Midwest forever.

Ultimately I chose I mix between option 2 and 3. I applied to jobs in cities I wanted to be in while I waited for the whole hiring process for Company Y. I was applying for jobs elsewhere because while company Y certainly felt like a sure thing I don‚Äôt consider it a sure thing until I have an offer in hand.

I ended getting a position at company Y to start in December and I stopped applying at that time. I loved it there it was noticeable better doing the work internally than as a 3rd party and I already loved the old job. There was also very little transition because I knew everything. About 2-3 months into working at Company Y company Z reached out to me for an interview. I applied to hundreds of jobs so they weren‚Äôt the 1st company to reach out to me after I started at company Y but they were located in NOVA which was my top destination so I took the interview because why not. Company Z is still in supply chain but I am in a buyer role so it was a new experience and a solid step in my career.

I ended up getting and taking the job after being with company Y for just 4 months the money was 5K more but that doesn‚Äôt account for the increased cost of living but I wanted the location. They also gave me a 5K relocation bonus that I have to pay back a portion of if I leave before 2 years. 

Fast forward 5.5 months and I hate this job. I was really good at my old job and I am awful at this job. I loved all my old co-workers and old manager and worked closely with most of them. Here I don‚Äôt work closely with many people and the ones I do I don‚Äôt really like and I dislike my manager. I believe I have valid reasons for these feelings based on conversations I‚Äôve had with other people. While I do love the area and love being closer to my best friends it‚Äôs more expensive and I feel like I haven‚Äôt been happy in like 3 months. I also fear I could get fired any day for poor performance because like I said I‚Äôm bad at the job.

At this point I believe that either options 1 or 2 would have been better for me both professionally and personally. I also face the dilemma that if I do leave company Z I will have 2 short term jobs on my resume back to back which will look bad. I can explain one easily but 2 is where it gets hard. I‚Äôm also afraid if I stick it out too long I‚Äôll get fired making it even harder to explain. 

I just don‚Äôt know what I should do from here."

Towards the end of last year, I left my job of 3 years to pursue building my own company which didn't work out for various reasons that I won't get into. I am now trying to find another job and finding that it is much more difficult than I anticipated. My previous job was in property management and when I got that job I had actually reached out to them asking for a position despite the fact they weren't openly hiring. Maybe I should start doing that again?

Background: 5 years as a Real Estate Professional (Sales, Renovations, Project Management, Property Management), 2 years as a web developer

I've been applying to numerous positions on Indeed, but have only been contacted by three.

 I applied for a position at a competing company to my last employer, but was declined as I was 'overqualified'. I feel they thought I would outgrow them and leave sooner than they would want.

All of these jobs that I have interviewed for went extremely well and I'm a bit disappointed that I haven't gotten any of these positions.

I currently work in logistics in warehouse operations. The company is pretty old school so they don‚Äôt use data or analytics as much as they could to optimize their processes. I‚Äôve talked to managers before about using various software/programs to collect and manipulate the vast amounts of data we collect but they have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about.

I‚Äôm looking to move to another role ‚Äî still in logistics but more related to inventory management or sales planning where I can use these analytics skills. However I feel that they‚Äôve been getting rusty since I‚Äôm not able to use them. I‚Äôve had a couple job interviews where they ask how I‚Äôve used these skills in my current role and when I give them a limited response, they don‚Äôt seem impressed.

I know there are online courses that I can take, but I find a lot of employers don‚Äôt care too much about them because they don‚Äôt show how I apply them in my current role.

My question is: How can I keep developing analytics skills and showing my practical applications to use them in a new role?"

The only reason I am hesitating on the offer is because this is a company that will require a lot more time commitment from me, 50 hour weeks and no WFH. At my current employer I've become so good at my job I probably only work 7 hours a week, and am completely remote. I just have become very used to my current lifestyle and am very happy, but I feel like I would be an idiot to not make more money if possible. I'm comfortably middle class no matter which salary I make.

Does anyone else think I'm crazy to consider not accepting this new offer? Regardless I am talking to my current employer to ask for a raise or retention bonus.

EDIT: My current job is basically communicating financial data to executives with pretty graphs. If anyone is interested in a similar job you could take a class on PowerBI or Tableau, and maybe brush up on data analysis. There's lots of jobs like these.

EDIT: I rejected my offer and am staying with my current employer"

* I've been unemployed since Feb this year and now living on disability.
* I'm visually impaired in one eye and blind in the other. The VI eye also has photophobia which limits the environments I could work in. Home is best since I can control the lighting.
* I can't drive anymore. There are services around me I can use to get around, but I am uncertain of how reliable they are to get to work.
* I know my way around computers quite well, but no official training perse. Just built a new rig about 2 months ago.
* Looking for a job with income potential of no more than 1350 a month (SSDI cut-off) and benefits are optional. Be able to work my own hours would be a plus.
* Most of my working career has been labor work. Last job had me running digital printing presses, operating other machinery and performing maintenance work for 8+ years. Job before that was data entry for USPS for about 3 years, but that facility closed. And before that, I was a truck driver for roughly 2 years.

I technically don't ""have"" to work. However, I am trying to pay off some debt so I can live on my own again and the money I'm getting from SSDI isn't quite enough. Plus, I REALLY need something constructive to do so I feel purposeful again. I thought living on disability and not having to work would be great; however, I really miss working.

Next, he says, ""That's it then, I'll call you at the end of the week.""

In my mind, I was like WTF, he didn't even ask me anything about previous roles, or any of those typical interview questions. I have no idea what happened.

This process is so hard. All the countless applications and cover letters and assessments. Getting an array of rejection emails from Indeed every day. 

And then there‚Äôs the interview process. I know interviews are my weakness so I spend so long preparing only to go into the interview and get asked something like, ‚ÄúWhat crayon would you be and why?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your favorite joke?‚Äù

And then there‚Äôs the interviews I feel like I DID nail and they seemed to really like me and I feel confident in my chances, only to get ghosted and never hear from them again. 

It just sucks. All of it just sucks. I honestly just want to give up some days because I feel like such a failure. And every rejection or ghosting just adds to that feeling that there must be something wrong with me. 

But there‚Äôs nothing wrong with me. And there‚Äôs nothing wrong with you. We just have to keep going. 

Every time I check this sub, I see people going through the same thing. And seeing their resolve to keep trying, even when it‚Äôs so easy to get discouraged, gives me hope. 

I‚Äôm going to keep trying. And I hope you will too. I know there‚Äôs a company out there that will see the value in each of us and finally cut us the break we so desperately need. 

Until then just know, you are not alone. You‚Äôve got this.

Left my job of 2 years because I was tired of being micromanaged. The managing director of this company said I was overpaid anyways at ¬£21k so didn't really care. They replaced me with cheaper labour at ¬£9/hr. Was doing IT support.

Moved on to another company located on the other side of town in the UK. I've been here 6 months and I'm now on ¬£25k. I work in IT support. Most days I feel like I'm doing quantum physics. My boss loves to act like a militant drill Sargent. They also micromanage us, but in a different way to my last place. If they ask why x work isn't getting done then I'll say we are too busy doing other things because we are being unrealistically overloaded. They do not accept that as a valid answer. If we make mistakes then we are belittled and told human error is not acceptable. Any mistakes are counted and tallied and affect us getting a raise. You made 10 errors this year and one was a spelling mistake? Well, no raise for you.

I've raised two complaints with HR, but unfortunately they are on holiday until the end of September so those have gone unseen.

I'm not well off by any means, but my husband supports me in just quitting whether we can afford it or not. He hates to see me treated like shit.

I'm 34F and I'm not sure if I want to stay in IT support if every place is going to be like this. Maybe I want to do just admin or something else. I have no idea. I'm happy to take a pay cut just to get out, but also am dreaming to make my age in salary.

I took this job cause I desperate and thought this somewhat accounting related since the title was ‚Äútax accounting assistant‚Äù (it‚Äôs just a tax assistant). There is barely any accounting which upsets me more cause I‚Äôm trying to be an accountant. It‚Äôs also a specialized type of tax so I‚Äôll never be able to use it in other tax jobs. Also there is NO PROPER TRAINING. In the job description it stated TRAINING PROVIDED. It‚Äôs been a whole month and got no training. Apparently I‚Äôm suppose to ‚Äúlearn on the go‚Äù and to just ‚Äúask a lot of questions‚Äù. My boss is horrible at explaining tasks. I keep asking him to repeat the same stuff but get even more confused. He also gives me the wrong information sometimes and get annoyed since I did it ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. It‚Äôs his fault in the first place. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to learn anything since I have to legit ask every single second on what to do. Everyone here seems to give me different answers when I ask them on things related to management (poor communications between everyone). There is a one on one lunch with my boss which I don‚Äôt want to attend. It‚Äôs already awkward enough and I know it‚Äôs going to be a evaluation of me.

1,2022-09-12,Toxic Manager/Workplace,u/heskt98,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xcm2an/toxic_managerworkplace/,jobs,"From the day I was hired, my boss has never been able to give me the time of day. He is overworked and very busy, which I truly empathize with, but he is also the worst communicator I have ever worked with. He‚Äôs incredibly rude, passive aggressive and plays favorites in the workplace.

He‚Äôs now begun not even saying hello to me when he passes me in the office, looks at the floor when I pass him/say hello or good morning and goes to lunch with our coworkers without inviting me. He never did these things in the past, although there was always passive aggression and rudeness. I‚Äôm a naturally positive, gregarious and friendly person who enjoys other people. I come into the office every day with a positive attitude and a willingness to complete assignments. I‚Äôm chopped down within minutes of entering the building each day.

I have never gotten a word of positive feedback from him, and almost every time I have been asked to be shown how to do a task I‚Äôm given, his response was ‚Äúread the procedures‚Äù (which all contain wrong information/are missing information. I‚Äôm in the process of rewriting two of them as we speak).

I found myself in an HR meeting a few weeks ago because I went on a trip that he APPROVED online not long before I left. He then told me another reason for this meeting was for my work on the previous afternoon-he said ‚Äú I needed help and you did nothing all day.‚Äù He asked for a list of my work that I completed that afternoon-which I sent to him. I was at my computer/with my work phone all day and I did not receive one call, text, email or any other form of communication from him. There was no way for me to know he needed help and he lied to our HR director, telling her I essentially took the day off. **He also showed up without the union rep that he offered to me (which he legally has to) and I confirmed twice that I wanted present.**

As a way to ""resolve"" the meeting, he told me he wants me to reach out to him when I'm finished with my work to ask for more. I do this now about 2/3 times every week and never receive a response.

I am being literally verbally abused/harassed weekly by another coworker/de facto second boss with screenshots to prove it. And I don‚Äôt even feel I need to go into this-it‚Äôs damning and ridiculous.

To acknowledge my own part in this, I do make mistakes at work. I‚Äôve gotten much better and have always done my part to fix them, but they do happen. I have shown great improvement in the past few months, as I‚Äôm getting better at mastering my duties (with hardly any guidance).

But these are all mistakes in the work I‚Äôm completing, because I‚Äôm at a new job that hardly gave me any training and keeps me out of the loop-they have never been the ‚Äúshowing up late, missing meetings, not meeting deadlines, etc‚Äù mistakes. This is my first job post-graduation and I‚Äôve been here six months. I try so fucking hard daily to make everyone else happy and not want to kill me, and every mistake I make feels like I set myself back 100 feet, especially if it‚Äôs a mistake I‚Äôve made in the past. I try so hard and get nowhere.

Anyone else been in this situation? Words of encouragement, etc.? Thanks in advance.

Also, yes, I‚Äôm leaving soon. Starting to apply for new jobs. I‚Äôll be out by Jan. 1st."

I am currently working remote at a marketing job, the same company since 2018, making ""ok"" money (though it is below industry standard), and my boss's love me. They laid off the entire team during the pandemic and only brought back 4 people, including me. They gave me a raise back in April, though it was not the rate I requested.

I love working remote, especially because they laid off all the friends I had at the company and I hate my other co-workers.

Because it's such a small team, whenever someone leaves, life is hell for the rest of us. It's been that way since I started in 2018. And the whole team is burnt out. We just had one of our account people quit, which means life is going to get worse.

On top of that, there are no plans to hire anyone new. I made a pact with myself that if I don't find a job by the end of the year, I will quit without having anything lined up, because the stress is just too much, especially in January when new client calls/deliverables begin. Even when we try to begin in December to prepare, my boss refuses to pre-plan ""just because""

Anyway, I have a few interviews lined up but I'm scared. I hate my current job and it's causing me anxiety, but I'm also deathly afraid of jumping into something worse. I'm sending out resumes like crazy and getting some career advice as well but I'm just so petrified about being underqualified for a new job. Then on top of that, I'm worried about quitting without having anything lined up, as I've never done that before. But I know the stress will keep me up at night.

What should I do? Any and all advice is welcome. Thank you so much!

TLDR; Trying to leave job I hate, worried about jumping into something worse, what should I do?"

1,2022-09-12,Company is moving by end of February. But has no idea where.,u/kimburrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xcpm04/company_is_moving_by_end_of_february_but_has_no/,jobs,"I have no idea how to be brief with this or flair it so I am sorry for the length.

Company is a 24/7 biotech lab in the San Francisco Bay Area and an essential business. Most of the hands-on work is done by Lab Operators and there are departments still on site (Laboratory Development, Shift Managers, Scientific Operations to name most). 

I was hired on in February as the Inventory Specialist so I have a hybrid role in the sense where half my work can be done from a desk and the other half is in the weeds of the lab. It's a job that seemed to be made for me and I have really enjoyed the work and the team.

Starting in late July, one of the Operators started taking others Ops aside to let them know that the company would be moving at some point and there was some speculation of it being out of state. It wasn't until middle of August that the company's CEOs sent out an email that the actual lab did indeed have to move since the entire block's properties had been sold by the landlord. But be excited! Here's information of the cities we are looking into and you can vote for your top ones!

The closest city is a 30 minute drive from the current location. Next place is 200 miles away. Then Southern California. And then twenty other cities all around the US. This basically meant that unless it was the close city, 75% of the Operators would have to find new work because it would not make sense to move. All the departments not required on site could most likely be able to work remote or move to the new location if they wanted to. 

The Operators had a meeting last week with one of the CEOs. We have been waiting for this meeting for two weeks, hoping to find out where they are moving to so we can start planning. But no news. Just that they have narrowed it down to four cities/areas, with only one close by. We have to be out of the property by the end of February and have no determination where it will be.

&amp;#x200B;

So, 

What could we (who cannot move and will lose our jobs) ask from upper management?  
Would this be a situation where severance could be approached?  
Is this the time to really look into what everyone would have to be promised to retain us?  
There's a decent amount who are higher tier Operators that want to jump ship and that would actually be really bad for the lab since hiring and training takes so long.

This was my first job outside of retail Operations for a large company so this has really shaken me on how quickly a company can ruin my plans. I thought a physical lab would be more long lasting, even if it was small, and was planning on moving closer at my lease end in February so I didn't have such a long commute.  


Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Lab-based company is moving without a clear place where and on-site employees don't know if they will be out of a job soon. What can we try to get out of the company if we are basically let go?"

So...I applied for Marketing &amp; Sales assistant position and somehow got the offer. BUT I DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

I do have very basic marketing experience, making designs, posting on social media and doing surveys.
But that's it. 

This position requires me to know about digital marketing, market research, softwares and strategy planning. Which I dont have any foundations.

I would feel better if they were giving me full training. But i dont think they will. The CEO bascially said she wants me to work (mostly) independently and she wouldnt have time to seat next to me and explain everything. Ofc there is someone i can ask for vague guide but it seems this position means I have to do most things by myself. They know I have bascially no experience but I guess I marketed myself too well.


Anyway, this would be a good chance for me to learn whole new things but I dont think I can be a good employee. I dont know. Maybe I should just take it and fake it till make it??

1,2022-09-12,Assessment before entering a new job.,u/coco_bandy,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xcpyu7/assessment_before_entering_a_new_job/,jobs,"Hi people,

I have a question about an upcoming assessment in order to get the job I applied for.
Long story short, I applied for my dream job and got through, last thing to tackle is this so called assessment which I‚Äôm not familiair with. The assessment consist of three parts. An personality test (online), an IQ-test (online) and a psychological test (at a specialized company). 

Because I‚Äôve never have participated in such an assessment I wanted to be prepared. So I googled on assessment and found alot of websites to practice (mainly the IQ/skills test). The thing is some of these questions/assignments were fairly easy to answer (within the time frame give) but some were so hard I couldn‚Äôt even read the question before the given time ran out. After spending two nights of practicing I‚Äôm starting to feel anxious because of the unknown part of the questions/assignments and the level they hope to score. I‚Äôve passed my Bachelor study without any issues but always knew how and what to study before the exam came around, something that feels impossible for this assessment.

Does anyone here ever done such an assessment and could give some insight in how these IQ/skills tests are build up? I‚Äôm not looking  for answers to specific assignments because that won‚Äôt help, just a general idea on what to expect and maybe to focus on.

Thanks in advance! 

Tldr: upcoming assessment, how to prepare?!"

The candidate is set down in the interview room that is monitored. The interviewer then realizes they don't have a pen to fill out the interview sheet, so they have to leave the room to get a pen. This provides the applicant ample time to look at their phone. The test is how the candidate acts when nobody is looking at them.

The test supposedly tells the company whether or not the candidate is able to beat the temptation to use their phone in a business setting. I was told about it from an employee at my last job, but I have no idea whether or not it's true.

It'd be some weird mind games for a bigger company, that's all I'm saying."

I am going to try to explain the situation without being super specific. To give a little background, during the prime of the pandemic I took this job waitressing at this big corporation. After a few months of working there, there was a new sales director hired, let's call her Kelly. 

Kelly needed to rebuild a sales team and offered me the opportunity to join her team. I am in my early 20s and took the opportunity since I did not know what to do with myself career-wise. Kelly was new and did not know how the system worked, so she was unable to properly train me. I have no knowledge of sales, so I was visibly struggling to learn this new trade. 

Kelly did not think I had it cut out for her side of the sales department, so she threw me into another sales department. At this time this department did not have a director. I had to train myself for the job by calling our jobs support line. Eventually, someone was hired to be my boss. I was doing very well.

Fast forward a year later, Kelly had her fourth employee in her department quit. I was doing so well at my job, that Kelly offered me the opportunity to take this person's place. Now this job is way above my current job. I would never imagine that they were going to offer me this position. 

My current boss at the time begged me to stay on her side of sales and was worried about how I will handle working with Kelly. The GM even sat me down and warned me about how difficult she can be to work with. I still took the position because it was over 15k more than what I was currently making, and a big career jump on my resume. 

The new job started off a bit rocky since I had to take this new job over while training someone new on how to do my previous job. There was not much expected from me in the beginning since I was learning something new. 

Now we are currently 6 months into this new job and I feel defeated. I am not making my goals and my boss is putting so much pressure on me out of nowhere. I am very organized and great at everything with this job besides the main part, the selling. 

Kelly went from saying that I am doing an amazing job to saying I need to be better. She is setting these unrealistic goals for me. She sat me down and said if I do not sell more we are all out of jobs and named people that I work with and told me what I sell affects their money as well. This was a complete 180 in her attitude towards me. 

She curses a lot and yells constantly at me and everyone, including our GM. She talks badly about me to others and I had colleagues tell me. I even confronted her on this matter and she started yelling and swearing on her kids that she did not say anything bad about me. I know she did since she talks badly about everyone. She asks me inappropriate questions about my personal life and my boyfriend. She does not know how to use the system or even something simple like email. She makes me constantly stop what I am doing to help her.

She micromanages me, gets upset whenever I leave my office for a second, and tells me constantly that I must work a 9-hour minimum. She talks so badly about previous people in my role as well. I am friends with the previous people in my role, and they tell me they quit because of her and the unrealistic expectations she has. 

She has no standard procedure on how to do things, and everything is extremely unorganized. Everyone at the job dislikes her because she makes everyone's job more difficult. She even argues with our HR in front of people. I went to HR as well and basically was told by her and the GM that they will never get rid of her because of how much money she makes our company.

She is always giving me more work to do, I am working 12-hour shifts at least 3 days a week. I am tired and at my breaking point. She was the one who gave me all these opportunities and I am forever grateful, but she makes me so miserable. I am always upset and worried about what mood she will be in when I go to work. I am never doing anything right in her eyes. 

She does offer to help train me more and whenever I try to learn more from her, things get more confusing since she constantly contradicts what she is teaching me.

I feel like a failure to quit and I feel like it is career suicide to try and quit. I love everyone I work with besides her. I feel like I am awful at my job now because of how she makes me feel, and I feel like I am not myself anymore. I just do not know what to do.

I do not have enough experience to get a new job making what I make now and in the job position, I am in now, especially at my young age.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I am grateful to my boss for giving me endless opportunities, but she will not train me properly and I feel miserable at my job."

0,2022-09-12,HR investigation,u/AltruisticWish3002,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xcrlk6/hr_investigation/,jobs,"I made a formal complaint against a toxic supervisor two weeks ago. This supervisor has a reputation of getting 16 girls fired before our company bought out our company. Everyone was scared of her. I have an mba and a bachelors in communications. So I know some stuff. So i assertively told this supervisor that she will respect me and talk with to me as she had interrupted me and told me not to pass the info along to her team (even my supervisor via hr). 

Other employees decided to ride on my coat tails and call our hr representative. She told my supervisor that her this investigation is ab me and my incident. She told my boss if I talk to other employees I could be in trouble for citing a rally. She said that the employees past transgressions do not exist since it happened before the buy out. It‚Äôs not existent.

Tomorrow I am meeting with her and the Vice President to talk ab the incident and such. Can I request i to have the conversation recoded since she‚Äôs basically the vps advocate and I want to document everything? 

If 5 employees including myself complain about her behavior but the other four employees are being disregarded bc ‚Äúwhat happened before the buyout doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù Is this legal? Should I consult an employment advocate or state that I have retain an employment advocate. HR already stated to my supervisor she can not stop the snide remarks she makes towards me or about me (like she asking everyone if I am high behind my back. ) I guess to try to discredit me. 

She is a vile person who believes ‚ÄúI have trauma and I am a bitch bc of it‚Äù (she legit told me that)

I told hr I didn‚Äôt want her fired. I want her to go through leadership and sensitivity training when I asked. I am not out for blood. I didn‚Äôt want to involve HR. After the confrontation I tried to have my supervisor mediate when I went to apologize and she refused to apologize. She then told my supervisor if I was assertive towards her again with me being subordinate and her being management she would fire me on the spot (like under the old owner) and that‚Äôs why I filed a formal complaint. 

What is your advice?"

The last one was exploitative because I do their work for them, they get credit then push me very hard to hide the fact that I'm doing my role and their role.

Now I'm in another position where a project manager has been employed and she doesn't know how to use excel so she wants me help her aka do them for her.  It's not in my job role and she's trying to use the fact that we're both ethnic minorities that need to support each other.  It's frustrating to have two degrees, a project management qualification, working knowledge of project management tools, and not able to get into a senior position because I'm also used by unskilled managers above me who can't use computers but are still able to get office management jobs based on their age.

I'm an ethnic minority who looks 15 years younger, and the culture is very age-centric (older people are in charge).  It's so bad that a previous employer called me 3 months after I left berating me for not reminding them to file my exit admin properly after I left. 

It's not been a good thing for me to be competent and work hard because it's exploited not rewarded.  Does anyone have any tips for how to get around it?  Someone said I'm too nice but often I find these managers are so desperate for money and toxic they can always out-negative me."

I had been hired same day as my interview, and the owner said they made their decision when I came in for the application. Then after working there for three months I had my performance review. They said I wasn't picking up on things quite as fast as people in my position had previously. And that I didn't finish tasks as quick. And that I didn't go out of my way to make enough small talk with costumers. Then after one month they wanted to meet for another performance review. They said that I was going out of my way to talk to costumers much more, but that I still wasn't finishing other things fast enough. Then they fired me and said that it just wasn't my thing and it would be like them becoming a mechanic and how they wouldn't be good at the job. But like, retail is the easiest shit ever. How can this not be my thing? They said I should do something that requires my brain more, as if I'm physically slow but not mentally. And that I should get out of our small town. I don't have any idea how I'm slower than the person before me when she trained me in and I saw her work. She filed her nails, did school assignments, and more or less sat on her ass unless she needed to do something. And apparently training me in wasn't something she needed to do because she didn't do it . I kept myself busy while she just sat around.

I know there are a ton of posts in varying degrees in regard to this topic, but I haven't found any posts that are similar to mine.

I just got an offer of employment email outlining salary, benefits, PTO, my supervisor, et cetera. There was only one phone interview with the person I would be reporting to and their manager. During this 30-minute phone interview, one of the questions I asked was their start date. I didn't get an exact date during the call but it is indicated on the offer of employment letter. By the end of the interview, the job was offered to me verbally, but they did inform me they needed to forward everything to HR to make everything official.

Since there was only one interview and I didn't know the start date until I got the offer, I didn't get a chance to tell them about some pre-planned dates I need off. I have 2 dates within 3 months of employment that I will be informing them of for sure. However, I have 3 trips in 2023, from late March to May, that would require anywhere from one to three days off.

My question is: would it be best to inform them of the 2023 trips now or in 2023? I usually submit my request for PTO or time off as soon as I know because I have previously gotten fired(not the official reason but everyone knew why) for going on a vacation even though the manager knew and approved.

Possible relevant information: this is my very first job that has more than a total of 5 people(outside a restaurant) so I have no experience in anything ""corporate.""

So firstly, I just want to apologise in advance if this post turns into a bit of a long winded random affair. It's 1:30am here in the UK and I'm having a late night contemplating my life direction and such.

To give you a short history of my work history, I come from a customer service background. I started my first Saturday job at 16 in a local corner convenience store whilst I was doing my A Levels (post compulsory/pre-Higher Education level stuff). I then did a gap year at 18 as a Youth Support Volunteer worker at a local church I was attending at the time, and gained a VRQ3 in Youth Work, Informal Education and Community Learning (so effectively although not recent, I'm qualified as a sessional youth worker, just very out of practise). The reason I didn't carry on after this 1 year was because I had a crisis of faith (specifically, I came out as LGBT and the church wanted to send me to conversion therapy which I declined). Kinda soured the whole youth work thing for me.

I then worked for 7 years for a large chain supermarket, covering all aspects of ""front end"", I did 4 years in a car insurance call centre, and most recently (my current job) I've been working for almost 2 months as a hotel night porter before being transferred to day shift as a receptionist/front desk host.

So I'm now at the age of 32 and still not entirely happy with where I am in life.

Ever since I was young, aged 7/8 or so, I often wanted to be doing something in teaching. But as time went on, other potential careers came and went, and I never really (even now) had a firm ""I want to be x for the rest of my life"" goal.

Anyway, I'm sat here late at night looking at local job ads, and there are a lot of Teaching Assistant vacancies locally. And a fair number of them are ""entry level - no employment experience required"". The most they ask is ""history of supporting children and/or young people in any capacity"" which I sort of have from the youth work, but also in more recent years from play/help with my niece and nephew. Niece is 9, has additional learning needs (dyslexia and dyspraxia) and nephew is a pre-schooler who's had the unfortunate start in life of having ""Covid restrictions"" interrupt a lot of his development. So whenever they're around I like joining in with games (cafe food delivery is a family favourite!), having genuine conversations about stuff (niece is obsessed with Minecraft - I don't fully understand the game myself but I still show an interest when she's showing she's passionate about something), helping niece with her spellings etc.

On a more personal note, I'm (undiagnosed) Aspergers myself and have suffered from anxiety over the years... even though this may seem to some like a ""block"" against a career in education, I personally feel it's given me an unconventional advantageous insight in that I know there are things I've worked to overcome, I know when it comes to learning new things there's no ""one size fits all"" approach, I know there are times to be direct and times to sit back and take a moment... and just the general ""pay it forward"" of it all.

So yeah. Without knowing me personally, from what (little?) I've explained so far, does it seem like I may be a good fit for working in education?

If things go well for me, I may at some point do a ""from home"" degree to qualify as a teacher (I think I'd prefer early years/primary, for the curriculum variety and general ease of getting on with younger children). If so, would something like the Open University be acceptable to a) get onto an Initial Teacher Training program and b) find a job with afterwards?"

I hope I can get some clarification on a contract clause. Some info: I recently landed a job through recruitment company here in Australia and they just sent me their company contract.

The Clause: Should you be offered further assignments or a permanent position with any Client or its Related Bodies Corporate, where (company name) has arranged an assignment, this new assignment or placement must be made through (company name).

Does this mean that if in the future I apply for a position directly with the employer I'm placed with, I'll be stuck working for them through the contracting company?"

6,2022-09-12,Similar Experience? Rejection email immediately after an interview,u/TorontoSoup,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xcwa50/similar_experience_rejection_email_immediately/,jobs,"Hi,

I've had an interview (2nd round) with a sizable company today at 2:00, ending the interview on 2:45 ish. Interview went very well (in my opinion at least) and the interviewer ended the call by saying that he'll notify the director of my interview and that director will follow up with me for the next steps.

Shortly after, I logged onto my email to start drafting a thank you note and realized that I've received an automatic ATS rejection email from the company minutes after the end of the interview.

I panicked and called the HR personnel who's been very helpful and responsive in answering my questions. She notified me that I'm still an eligible candidate under consideration for the position; however, the reason why I received a rejection email is because the **original posting I've applied for was actually for hiring an entry level personnel,** whereas I qualify to be considered for a senior position. They apparently filled out the entry level position so they've closed the job posting and hence, I've received a rejection email. Meanwhile they didn't post the senior position on the portal which I'm being considered for. HR personnel ensured that I'm not rejected for the position and it's an error on their end, but something doesn't feel right. 

Is this something common that happens in hiring? 

Anybody have a similar experience?"

I‚Äôve been at this company just over a year. Therefore they said they‚Äôre putting me on a PIP. 

It blindsided me because I‚Äôve been getting solid reviews from my one manager and he also told me this past month I did the best yet. 

I had a meeting with HR back in June where they said my managers noticed I rushed through my work and made silly mistakes so I was told to slow down. Since then I‚Äôve done that and now they told me I take too long to complete tasks. Also I‚Äôve only worked under one manager for the past 4 months so I‚Äôm not sure where they got plural managers from. 

When I told them I‚Äôve been getting solid reviews they didn‚Äôt understand. I asked if they spoke to my current manager who I‚Äôm working under and they said no which I found weird because they‚Äôre the ones who make my schedule so they would have known that I was working under this manager. How do you not speak to him?

When I told them no one approached me about taking too long to do tasks and about the solid reviews they said there has to be some disconnect then because they‚Äôre hearing one thing and I‚Äôm telling them another. 

They still enforced the PIP and are speaking with my manager sometime this week to understand what‚Äôs going on. They gave me 60 days but want to meet with me every other week or so to see how I‚Äôm doing and the last month will really determine their final decision. 

I‚Äôm applying to jobs already because this seems shady. Like someone is intentionally bad mouthing me and wants me gone. Even if I survive it I feel like best course is to still leave. 

Do I have a shot in surviving it or should I just leave now?"

I'm probably going to be going away on and off now up until Christmas. My original plan was to resign completely but my boss got me to stay on. 

Are there any companies/Jobs out there where that would let you give 2-3 months' notice if you were successful? 

The point of this is I don't really want to have to apply for jobs and then start one while I'm still in the LSL period.

I have had this compounding anxiety deep down since 2020. I understand that current times are dire but I am truly confused and paralyzed for the sake of my future.

In 2018, I joined the part time military but I have not been able to take advantage of the benefits because I don‚Äôt know what pathway would benefit me the most. I have a secret security clearance and some tuition assistance when applying to colleges. 

There are many things in my life to be grateful but I feel without a proper plan, I won‚Äôt be able to get out of this hole any time soon. I will be 25 years old soon and I feel I am in no better position than when I was a teenager. The only thing I have going for me is I live with my mother and I don‚Äôt have too many monthly expenses. 

I am not in a sustainable position.  

I am asking for any advice from anyone that can help me. I am willing to do anything at this point 

Thank you for taking the time to read my post"

My boss told me I'm not required to go but it's highly desired. How bad would it be for me to not go? Could I lose my job over this or could it cause problems? I have no idea how long I'll be at this company, which is why I'm hesitant to go. The culture isn't bad, but the pay is low and I'm currently applying for other places.

1,2022-09-13,What is an appropriate raise to ask for?,u/NightmareClan2018,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xd5sxp/what_is_an_appropriate_raise_to_ask_for/,jobs,"Hi! New here!

I‚Äôll try to keep it as short as I can, but I‚Äôll provide context. 

I was hired a year ago at a construction company, to be part of the sales team. However, they weren‚Äôt sure of my exact role on the sales team. At first, we all kinda thought I was going to be a hybrid of outside sales, but certain days being in the office to filter our leads, and handle incoming phones. But again, we weren‚Äôt sure. I was offered 50k in guaranteed salary this first year. 

Well, my position changed. I‚Äôm still sales, but I‚Äôm full time office. More of an inside sales and sales support hybrid. I do all the 3D model generation from our CAD drawings, and I cost out all of our jobs. I genuinely enjoy this. Basically, the outside sales guys take pictures and measurements and notes, send it to me, I design the project in a 3D model, and I cost out the job. They review it, make sure the proposal looks nice and if they have to touch anything up, they do. Basically, I handle 90% of their office work and ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù work that customers don‚Äôt see. 

On top of this, I handle all scheduling, lead filtering, and all incoming phone calls. 

I‚Äôm coming up on my 1 year, and plan to sit down for a review meeting, at some point within 3 months before 2023 comes. 

Since ive been out of training (Feb through today) our revenue is up 9% verses the same time frame last year (Feb-Sept). Our close time from lead origination to job won is up 15%. Meaning, we‚Äôre winning these jobs much faster, customers are spending less time shopping. I do not claim credit for this, as we‚Äôre a team, but I do help contribute. Since I‚Äôve taken on this position and it‚Äôs a position I help create, outside sales is less stressed and our quotes get out to customers MUCH faster than before, since it‚Äôs my full time job to handle the office work side of it. 


I plan to ask for a 30% salary increase for 2023. Is that reasonable? It is a combination of a standard 1-2 grade promotion from what I found to be typically about 15%, as well as a cost of living raise, and consideration for a salary correction raise because I‚Äôve felt to be working at a discount. 

I live in Ohio, so salary‚Äôs here aren‚Äôt as high as say, CA. 

Is 30% reasonable? I know it‚Äôs high, and my minimum raise I‚Äôd settle for would be 20%, but I think starting the conversation high would be a good starting point for me, negotiation wise. 

Help is appreciated!

*Edit, I also work 45hrs per week, after lunch breaks. During peak season, closer to 50 hours. So that plays a factor too!"

I have been trying to find a new (marketing) job for months now. MONTHS. I'm almost 30, and have worked at the same small company since graduating college - almost 7 years ago. The company I currently work for has just become so toxic over the last few years and I don't make nearly as much money as I believe I am worth, so several months back I decided to start looking for another job.

Now when I say that I have been looking, I am not talking about constantly searching the web for new jobs and applying with diligent follow up to the hiring manager for each company. A single person cannot do that to every job they apply for, that is a full time job in itself. I am however trying to follow up with some specific companies.

My issue with all of this is I can't even seem to get a damn interview. I recently spent a good chunk of change to get my resume updated, which sounds much better than it did before, but I still can't secure an interview. ANYWHERE. I have even had references from people that work in some of these companies and I still can't get to an interview. The most frustrating part is that I am 100% qualified for every single one of these jobs with the experience I have.

Is there something else I could be doing or an extra step I am missing somewhere to secure an interview? I just don't know what to do anymore and it is very demoralizing to constantly get rejected for jobs that I know I am qualified for.

So Reddit, any suggestions? What should I do?"

My boss has told me if it was up to him, he would let me stay remote, but there is a ""image"" our CEO wants us to maintain. One of my department coworkers knows how I feel about the hybrid policy, just that I have done fine working remotely and do not like coming into an office. Over a one on one call, she mentioned to me that she thinks I am quitting but does not know when. It was an incredibly awkward conversation to have, and I felt backed into a corner. I just did not really comment with any of my plans to her, I was not intending to share that information. I have not even found anything as of yet, just looking each day. She spoke of how she is going to lose her mind if I leave without training someone to help her, and she would be heartbroken. She said that she hopes I speak to our boss and give him enough notice to hire someone for me to train. I feel like I'm being guilted for leaving now. If I decided to speak to my boss, he is very laid back and could take it in a positive way, but it could also go differently. Most people I know have left on good terms, and my place has little turnover and people who typically work there for 10+ years. I have been working there myself for 8 years, and I know he sees me growing into a senior role. This is something I've always heard to be a bad idea, so I'm not sure what to do."

I am from the UK, a recent graduate and I have two offers in different fields. One is in a data engineer and the other is in R&amp;D in a large automotive company.

Both are fantastic offers in fields I very much enjoy which is why it is stressing me out on which one to chose as I have to decide in two days.

The data engineer role is with a newish training company which would have me start at a client in the UK roughly in 8 months time after (half of which would be paid as minimum wage for training in london). After that I get full pay comparable to the other offer in the 1st and 25% more in the 2nd year at the start .

The other is a typical 2 year engineering graduate programme ,an immediate start but would have lower pay progression by about 15% compared to the tech one.

The main issue is that I am leaning towards the tech one due to pay and an interesting career progression but it has an 8 months delay on actually starting. I can tolerate some risk but in this current climate I am worried about something happening until then. The other is an immediate start.

Am I missing something? Should I go for the less risky one and transition later? Aiming long term."

If there‚Äôs any other ideas please let me know, I‚Äôm really not sure what to do but I can‚Äôt keep doing what I‚Äôm doing currently and go absolutely nowhere.

Also I‚Äôm not against trades but my issue is I have herniated discs and my current warehouse job gives me mega issues, so I feel like it sadly limits me. I am interested in welding or electrical work if you don't think it would be too bad, I can't do a ton of digging or things like that. I'm also a very tiny human."

I myself am an IT person, not a teacher, but I recently applied for a position at a school. The ""Non-teacher and Support Staff Application"" in my district requires a paper copy of a background check certificate (I understand why this is needed, but I don't think making the applicant pay out of their own pocket for it is fair), three signed reference letters, transcripts from every school you attended, and a five page application. Custodians, food service workers, and secretaries all have the exact same application process.

If I hadn't already done the State Educator's background check for a position I applied for in the past, it would have been $50 out of my own pocket, plus i'd have to schedule an appointment to get my fingerprints taken.

No raise or offer of hiring on permanently since. My (new) manager would like to offer me more and has been pushing her boss for it, but he stonewalls. Our company also entered a hiring freeze in June/July‚Ä¶ after proving myself since the previous March. Contract now extended to November. 

I asked for a raise more than a month ago. Followed up once, manager said she needed to get a hold of her boss to clear it with him. I‚Äôve heard nothing since. 

The money is *okay* but with no benefits, a large portion of my paycheck goes to paying for not-so-great medical coverage. 
I have no PTO. Hell, I‚Äôve never been to the office. 

Other than being told that I‚Äôm an asset to the team and my manager is ‚Äòworking on it‚Äô when I ask about a permanent role, I don‚Äôt feel like a valued member of this team.

I apply to new jobs *every day* and I‚Äôve had 4 or 5 interviews since the beginning of the year, but they never go anywhere.

1,2022-09-13,Should I quit?,u/Letbutt,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xddxxa/should_i_quit/,jobs,"Hi fellow reddit people, I need some strangers advice! 

So I work for the national postal company in Belgium. I have 2 functions depending on where I am needed. One is doing everything post related, things like registered letters, normal letters, advertisements, parcels, pensions, etc... Lets call this function mailman.   
The other one is just parcel delivery but in a higher quantity. Lets call this function Courier. 

As a mailman the hours vary day to day and week to week. I start at 6am.   
About 65% of the time, I work around 9.5 hours or more a day. 20% of the time I work 7.5 hours and 15% of the time I work around 6 hours. Also I take shortcuts to cut down on time like leaving work for the day after. I dread the mailman days, my week gets very unpredictable and I don't enjoy it because the workload is so big.   
As a courier Its more consistent. I start at 9am.  
75% of the time I work 7.5 hours and 25% of the time I work around 6 hours. Never more than 8 hours. I do this function fully, no shortcuts. I enjoy this job.   
When I have which function is a gamble, it depends on how many absentees there are.   


Here is the catch tho, every day I get paid the same amount which is based on 7.5 hours of work. So I've had days were I grind for 11 hours straight and had a single day were I only worked for 2 hours. I got paid the same.   
But I would say in general that I work more 'free' overtime than I get payed early leaves.   
Also being a mailman comes in the way of my daily life and I have had to cancel certain plans because there was so much work, for example I've had to cancel sports training. 

The wage I get is competent, nothing to rave about but higher than minimum wage by a bit. 

The dislike I have for the mailman function is considerable but I don't hate it. Its just too much work.   
Should I stay or should I leave? I have enough savings to go half a year jobless. 

**TLDR: Should I stay in a company that expects me to work free overtime because they also pay full when I leave early.**"

‚ÄúI would prefer to be asked to support this instead of being ordered to help.‚Äù

For context, communication between me and my manager is strained to the point of HR involvement. A lot of my manager‚Äôs communication to me has been inconsiderate, hurtful, and hostile. I want to do things by the book and go directly to my manager before going up the chain. 

I am an agreeable person and would most likely have agreed, especially when the need is obvious. However, being given orders like this, having to cancel plans made far in advance, and our history, hits my stubborn streak and I want to reject the ‚Äúrequest‚Äù and cause problems."

I also have a long distance gf. I have a part-time job with no benefits. As far as I know I don't accumulate vacation days only sick hours. I am a sushi chef.

I was under the impression that as a part time worker I could kind of just tell them 2 weeks in advance if I was gonna be out a week or 2 and it would be no problem like how I see a lot of other part time employees do at other places. I wouldn't say I travel that much. I traveled to Singapore last December for 2 weeks. And called off 1 week in August because my gf came for 3 weeks. Now I'm planning to call off 2 weeks during Halloween time to visit my gf in Australia. Before my Visa expires in January. I also plan to go to Japan for 3 weeks next summer, but I may quit just before then and just get a new job on return.

My big question is am I going to be fired for taking too much time off? My dad says he could fire me if I take off on Halloween time. Because I've already had time off this year. As far as I remember those r really the only big vacations I've taken apart from being sick with covid for 1 week. I haven't asked yet but I'm scared but tickets were closing and getting pricey so I kinda impulse bought with my gf. I don't plan on taking anymore vacations from then til the summer."

2,2022-09-13,Employer using Equal Pay laws to justify lower pay,u/Document-Parking,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xdhajx/employer_using_equal_pay_laws_to_justify_lower_pay/,jobs,"Wanted to see if anyone had experience with an employer telling you they could not pay you more based on Equal Pay laws, and what to do in such a situation.

I recently applied for a professional job with an employer I have long wanted to work for.  I made it through multiple rounds of interviews, and I'm the final candidate for the job.  At this point, they made a salary offer.  I was disapointed in the offer.  They offered me the exact middle of the salary range listed in the job posting.  This salary would pay me significantly less, and I had inside info that I had the best qualifications/experience among those that interviewed.  

I tried to negotiate for a higher salary (a salary still within the salary range from the job posting) by pointing to other similar positions in the industry.  HR and a high-up manager took a strange approach to the negotiation.  They absolutely agreed with me that the offer was significantly less than my market value as an employee.  However, they told me they could not offer me a higher salary without violating the equal pay for equal work law.  They said they have to pay me based on my years out of school and could not pay me more, even though I have significantly stronger qualifications/experience as compared to my age/years out of school.  They said the only way they could offer me a higher salary is if they increased the salaries for all current employees of the same age, which was not feasible.  

When I pointed out that the job posting included a range with a higher salary, they claimed the top range is there just in case someone with 30-40 years experience applies for the job.  That's pretty absurd because this is more or less the entry-level position at the organization and its not reasonable to expect someone with that years of experience to apply. 

In summary, I'm just frustrated that this employer is using Equal Pay laws defensively in salary negotiations.  That seems to run against the intent and language of the law."

1,2022-09-13,Am I missing something? My current job is all over the place,u/shaneomaniac,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xdit05/am_i_missing_something_my_current_job_is_all_over/,jobs,"It's been 1 year since I started my current job, as a marketing assistant for a small business specialising in niche medical equipment. While I was glad to get some more permanent work at the time, being in the midst of Melbourne's lockdowns meant things weren't smooth sailing. It was hard avoid the news and in general, avoiding everyone and trying to lay low while I do my thing - design brochures, flyers, promo material, managing the online side of things, organise our place at conferences etc. It was pretty chill with a lot of downtime.

Fast forward to the end of the year, and despite only a max. of 8 people there's some internal job shuffling. At the end of year review, which I was dreading, it was announced that I was made service coordinator. A whole bunch of new responsibilites, a small payrise...and no explanation. I did not want this. All I wanted was my laidback creative stuff still.

My boss just brushed me off when I asked why, he just said the spot opened up &amp; the guy who previously did the service role became Product Manager. There was no Product Manager when I started. Right...

Since the start of the year has been painful - frequently making mistakes, wording stuff badly, and so on. Again, no reason as to why I was thrust into a role trying to organise service calls, provide basic tech support (if possible), be a key communication link between technician and customer &amp; review service reports.

Just to rub it in, the last couple of months I was playing temporary store man. It might have been my warehouse experience, but I enjoyed that a lot more than the service work. Even though we have a new guy and he's pretty speedy, I'm a little miffed that there wasn't an opportunity for me moving to the warehouse permanently until it was too late (i.e. the new store man was hired). At least I got a small $$$ bonus doing it.

Even worse, it feels like an expectation that you have to do everything. I'm not a technician but my boss has made a couple of ""nudges"" (e.g. ""You don't know how to change a battery on a morgue trolley, do you?) which has been too close for comfort. I have no plans for technicial work, because alongside the service work, I'm being pulled in a direction I never intended. Problem is with our technician leaving soon this is almost inevitable.

So my question is what the hell? What's the real benefit of being part of a typical small boomer family business? Where there's so much inconsistency when all I wanted to do is keep my head down and just be somewhat creative, but thanks to hospitals etc. being needy, our local technician constantly reminding me I should be chasing more service work for our interstate techs (pls no sales), and me not giving a shit about small talk, where to from here? What's the benefit of having this random experience from one job?

It's the longest I've had a full time job, and after a mix of easy delivery driver &amp; warehouse gigs, I feel like I'm losing control. All I know is no more small businesses like this. I feel mislead.

P.s. I'm searching for more ""creative"" roles right now (most common is marketing) but it's harder as a typical day at my job is becoming less relevant. And I haven't really cared about references, nor a real ""career"" within this company. Only immediate fallback if I do quit instantly is Uber Eats which is tough given that I recently moved into an apartment &amp; live on my own.

Oh, in case you're wondering, graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (majoring in Digital Media) 6 years ago. If anyone asks about degrees."

Some background: I've only been with the company 6 weeks. The person who trained me (coworker 1) was currently doing the position as well as other work closely related, but because of new growth in the company, to help give coworker 1 a break as to not get overwhelmed with their task load their job was split into two and I took half. The half I took also relieved coworker 1 of having to communicate or assist with talking to contractors and construction supervisors we work with.

So I do not answer the phone during dinner with my family. It is a simple rule that we cook together and eat together phone free. Tonight after dinner I check my phone and I have 7 missed calls and 5 unread text. My phone has been away from me about two and a half hours now. I check the missed calls and see 6 missed calls from a contractor and 1 missed call from coworker 1. I go to my messages and have 2 missed text from a contractor and 3 from coworker 1. Apparently contractor didn't know if they could finish a job tomorrow they had to leave today. When they didn't hear from me they called coworker 1. Coworker 1 reached out 3 times and after they gave it about 5 minutes they ended up emailing the supervisor of the construction job in question and asked them then gave contractor the information needed.


I am VERY annoyed right now and feel like coworker 1 overstepped their boundaries reaching out to me for the contractor and emailing the supervisor. I wasn't even given 2 hours before both contractor and coworker 1 both disregarded me and went over and did what they didn't need to do. 

How do I handle letting them know? I have only been with the company for 6 weeks and I don't want to maje enemies but I think the whole thing was overstepping. I don't want to go to my boss and make this a huge issue either. But I want to let everyone know I can handle my duties and I shouldn't have coworker 1 essentially doing my job for me because they didn't hear from me within 5 minutes. Especially after 5pm"

1,2022-09-13,Backing out of counter-offer,u/Foghkouteconvnhxbkgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xdrcaz/backing_out_of_counteroffer/,jobs,"So I am a chef and had given my 2 weeks to start at another place which has a higher overall salary.   


Unfortunately, about a week in, I ended up getting enticed by my current company to accept a counter-offer. I didn't expect they would be willing to match the salary of the new position.

&amp;#x200B;

I made it clear that I would need to read the contract before signing on to the agreement, but unfortunately I said I was heavily leaning toward staying with my company. They said they would send the online contract tonight, but I am still waiting on it. They already agreed to a +$1 promotion which makes this more difficult (i didn't sign anything though).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now the main issue is I'm having second thoughts. Firstly, I am highly skeptical my employer will actually supply a higher tip pool to meet \~ 30 an hour as they counter-offered (signing the contract would not include the verbal components we agreed upon) (an old employee in the same position said they were making under 23. Granted i could really be boosted in pay that much). Secondly I think that I prefer to work at the other company more, especially since we have pretty much no staff and I want to.

&amp;#x200B;

If they never deliver on 30 an hour promise (which is pretty likely), I miss my opportunity to work at the other place offering that.

If they do deliver on the 30 an hour promise, working there would be my preferred outcome

But if I choose to work at the other place, understandably my current company would be bitter that I'm not trying to go into management I almost verbally promised (pretty much saying i need to see the contract).  


It's a mess. In retrospect, I think I should have ignored my bosses counter offer but I can't do that now and this was my first real job so I was kind of na√Øve and unprepared.  


I never signed anything officially for either job, but i did make verbal agreements

Either place would give me the job without much question, but if they found out about the dynamics, that could change, and I have a pretty limited window, since for my other job i have like an orientation shift the next day (still haven't signed anything)

What are the ethics I should be considering here?  
Any help or thoughts are appreciated  


Thank you"

All management positions in my past have been from promotions so walking into a new establishment completely blind is quite different for me and I don't want to be taken off guard and for that to work against me.

Would this be seen as... manipulative? Weird? From my point of view, this would seem more proactive and in all honesty, a SMART way of going about this. But I am also... a very logical person and less so emotional (I am on the spectrum) and this works against me sometimes. I am not sure how this would come across to the average person.

The thing is, the way it‚Äôs structured now, the math doesn‚Äôt even work out for you to be able to earn two weeks within a year. It‚Äôs one hour for every 30 worked. So it takes more than one year to earn two weeks PTO. When I mentioned this to him he exploded and told me to take a hike. He told me I was only creating problems, not solutions. When I talked to the accounting department their response was ‚Äúbe glad you even get PTO.‚Äù I‚Äôm at a loss for how to have my boss, the CEO, see that two weeks PTO is not a lot these days and that everyone deserves time off. He seems to think that because our company is remote and you can WFH that vacation is not important.

I can‚Äôt tell if they are saying this to try to keep morale up and reduce turnover or if it‚Äôs genuine, but I think that‚Äôs my imposter syndrome talking. Coworkers have told me promotions are few and far between so I‚Äôm leaning towards applying, but I‚Äôm dreading an interview. 

I guess I can ask my manager what she thinks about me applying.

What‚Äôs your experience applying internally?"

Bullshit reason. Shit company. I‚Äôll explain more if needed. 

Been actively searching for work. 

Had an interview for a job in the same industry today, the job I was fired from is not listed on my resume. 
However, I do have other jobs listed. 

Interview was going great until the guy said ‚ÄúThis next question may be abrupt and I want to ensure you don‚Äôt feel that I will cast any judgement. As you know it‚Äôs a tight knit industry but I was hoping you could tell me more about what happened with you and *former company*?‚Äù 

I was a bit jarred. 

I have no info on my resume about that job so I wasn‚Äôt sure how they found out? 
Also, had me worried about what my former employer could have said about me (they were not the best people to work for)
I wasn‚Äôt even there that long and when I was employed we were having to work remotely, so I never crossed paths with this person interviewing me. 
Also the former company is still very new. 
The owners don‚Äôt even live in this area. 

Wasn‚Äôt expecting that at all. But I explained the situation, at least from my perspective and was still very professional. 

They seemed pleased with how I answered, interview continued just fine. 

But I‚Äôm still perplexed.
Is this a common thing to ask? 

Until now I had never been fired, let alone written up at any job so it definitely damaged my ego. But wasn‚Äôt sure if I now need to be prepared for that question in the future?"

These programs are extremely competitive and picky, so I'm trying to gain relevant experience. Both clinical and research experience is crucial. 

Out of college, I hoped to either be an assistant psych or join research on the social-behavioural side of mental health; but didn't get any offers. I very recently started work with a team researching neurological determinants of mental health. I'm not very interested in neuropsychology, but thought it'd help me learn transferable research skills. But that's not the case at all. I'm being trained in very niche skills using specific software made for cleaning MRI data. In short, I dislike the job and I'm not gaining relevant experience for my chosen career path. 

I don't know if I should quit asap to save the company's time and resources, or wait it out until I find a new job. If I quit now, I'm seriously considering finding unpaid internships or voluntary work just to gain more relevant experience."

1,2022-09-14,WFH for many is ending,u/RuiFigo,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xdyhc9/wfh_for_many_is_ending/,jobs,"This is just a warning, but with the recession, layoffs happening or coming in the US, for many established businesses with large offices they are going to require people go back into the offices more days than not if not back to 5 days a week 

I was with an executive last night and talking about his office here that has 8k employees.  They are supposed to be 3 days in office with 2 days remote.  Most employees are still not coming into the office 3 days, they just don't show up.

One team said they could not come in because of the ""glare"" from the window.  My friend sat in the desk next to the window yesterday and ""closed the blinds"".  

He said they've been internally discussing when they would force people into the office or let them quit.  Now that Goldman Sachs, Apple, other A+ employers are doing layoffs this is the time.  Layoffs are coming for many companies. I wouldn't doubt there is some collusion with these companies about ending remote work.

So you will see companies talking about layoffs (after talking about hiring freezes) and then announce ending WFH.  And if you want to stay remote...you can get laid off.

For developers, engineers, you'll most likely be able to stay remote but those other jobs, be careful out there.

Workers had a lot of power the last 2 years.  That power shifts back to the companies when recessions happen.

Be careful"

I have been Vice President for the last 4 years and I'm currently making 50k a year. I had recently asked for a $12,500 yearly raise, which was contured with $1 more an hour. I was caught off gaurd with that. Also I have zero benefits.

What I do is manage the shop and people within it, do 100% of all AutoCAD 2d/3d, setting up and running the cnc machines, 3d printing, custom fabrication and making parts in house that generate a ton of revenue for the company with high profit margins. I am CONSTANTLY doing r&amp;d so in house parts are always the best they can be and faster to cut on the cnc or assembled together faster and easier. I take a lot of pride in my work. I have gotten very proficient at design and drafting and taking everyone's ideas and turning them into a real thing that can be either decided as not nessesary, or it's a new way of doing something for the future. I am essentially doing 20 side quest to make the business money, while still working on the main product. We did 1.4 million in sales last year and I have helped either save or make hundreds of thousands of those yearly sales. 

Over the last 5 years I have single handedly improved our main product by doing tons of small little adjustments to make it better, even if it doesn't save any time. I do so many individual things now and right now I could go to any factory and make the same money doing fairly simple work compared to what I'm doing now. 

Last I talked with my bosses (parents) they went on about how they couldn't afford to do that, but when I did some estimation on how much yearly money just 3 parts I make brings in, which would easily cover the 12,500 I was asking. They said no, following with well just hire someone else to do the design work, we'll just go back to buying x,y, and z, which would cost WAY more than 12,500 a year. They say the greatly appreciate me yet under value me all the time. I'm more frustrated than anything. 

I am the only one here than knows how to do any design work, setup the machines, maintain them, cut 90% of the stuff we need as our product is heavily reliant on cnc work. If I walked out right now, which I am ready to do, it would be a very devastating blow to the company. And there is a good chance other people will leave if I do which then would completely bring the entire place down on its knees. Sure they could recover but this isn't a place where you can get a new guy and they are ready to go after a week of training. It takes a minimum of at least 6 months to get into a flow and an entire year to know what you need to do so you can work solo while being confident. 

I guess I'm looking for input, I'm only 25 with a family and I've been here since high school, but what I was doing two years ago to what I'm contributing now has drastically changed. I know my skills and knowledge are worth more than $25 and hour. I have applied to another job that makes cnc tools and have built a good rapport with them as I use their tools everyday for work."

I am 31 years old living in North Carolina and looking for a new career. I'm not specifically looking for a remote job, but the job market where I live pays quite poorly for the most part. 

I currently make $22/hr with fairly good benefits. Before I got a $2 raise a few months ago I was looking for jobs locally and having a hard time finding anything paying over $20/hr, so now I feel like I'm really in a pickle trying to find a job paying over $22. Which is why I'm interested in finding some remote work.

So here is some information about my education/experience:  
**Highest Level of Education:** HS Diploma

I have worked in a variety of fields and positions over the years. After high school I worked in a Walmart distribution center for 4+ years before leaving to work for a Valet company. I started as a Valet Attendant and became an account manager within about 6 months and managed multiple accounts over a 4+ year span. This job was almost entirely customer service based. Greeting customers, collecting payment/tips, dealing with customer claims, etc. After that position I moved to NC where I briefly worked at another grocery distribution center for 7-8 months before starting with my current employer. This job is in manufacturing. I was hired as a packaging technician and within about a year I was promoted to a Fulfillment Lead (Fulfillment is both packaging and shipping combined). I've been with this company for 4.5 years now and I just don't have the utmost faith in the success of the company, primarily because of the decisions and unawareness of management. In this position I spend the majority of my time working on continuous improvement projects as well as boosting departmental efficiency. I have great organizational skills and excellent task/time management skills. I also believe that my communication skills are well above average.   


So with this information, what kind of remote jobs do you think I should be looking for. Ideally, I would like to be making $60,000+/year and looking for consistent growth opportunities.

After almost a week with no response or word about it, I followed up to see if a reschedule was possible and was blamed for the entire thing. It came as no surprise this offer was no longer on the table for me, which I accepted and responded professionally to just in case I wanted to apply here later because I know one person's mistake doesn't reflect a whole company. I know HR is not an easy position and I tried to be understanding, but their response was extremely rude.  Luckily it appears that I'm moving forward in the application process in the same position as this one, with another company, but is this a place I should still consider in the future if need be?"

It will probably go down as gross misconduct which is the sack.

I‚Äôve told my manager the truth, that I went through a rough break up and turned to my friends that are all weed smokers and so I smoked daily for about 2 weeks straight. I stopped and was off it for a whole month before my urine test.

 I‚Äôve been at this job for nearly 5 years I came with no qualifications and worked my way up to a rig manager not failed a single examination and have been a grafter since the day I started. I‚Äôve even passed previous drug tests as short as 6 months ago. This is my argument that‚Äôll I put forward Friday morning even suggest regular drugs test in the future.

The reasoning is this: I'm an accountant, and I'm doing well, but I need more money.

-I focused on smaller more local employers, switch to Indeed and state job boards

If you want to work for a bigger company, contact a recruiter. They can help you get seen.

I helped my boss to start his company in pre-covid time, so I'm considered one of he key members for the company. I always enjoy my work and give my 100%, to the point where I don't even care about my health. So I am one of those dependable people in my workplace.

My boss is an emotional person and he's a person who works with his ""emotions"" which I and other key members have questioned many times. Because he thinks of me as a core team member, he always shares his emotional and work concerns and I being a responsible team member always try to find best solutions. 

Now here's what's happening, he has hired few people who only got the job because they played the emotional card. After some time these people started slacking off and I had to do the work for their negligence. These people would take offs whenever they want, and I had to work in their stead. I had warned my boss that these employees were taking advantage of us but he  answered me that he couldn't say no if the employees had some reason to go. That time lost my patience because in my emergencies he never hesitated to say no. And the excuse he gives me, I am the core team member and he trusts me, so he can tell me whatever to do.

The other day a lot of people were absent and he used me to vent out. He tells me take control on all the operations and when I try to do something he overwrites my decisions, then tries to play that emotional card on me. He's taken me for granted. I feel like losing my respect at work and it's really stressing me out. 

I'm thinking of quiting, but people around me tell me not to. I really need some good words."

I communicated this to my current boss, and he and the company are fine with it as long as I bill appropriate hours and things dont slip through the cracks. The new company doesnt know and I have no intention of letting them know.  The hours overlap for the most part, so I should only be working 8-10h days for around 250k a year so it seems worth it to me.

3,2022-09-14,Minimum Wage Will Increase Very Soon,u/UltimateResearch,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xe7qd8/minimum_wage_will_increase_very_soon/,jobs,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ezx3b19oyun91.png?width=1175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c044e3c6eddca57924808f8e5376d1a1f4c922e0

 

* The Federal Minimum Wage (currently $7.25/hr) is almost guaranteed to increase very soon. 
* Currently the longest streak without an increase in the Federal Minimum Wage (13 years -- last raise was in 2009. Previous longest streak was 10 years from 1997 to 2007)
* Many other States and Cities have already been increasing their Minimum Wage significantly. Federal rate will have to follow and catch up. 
* High inflation and cost-of-living will push the US Government to take action. 

**It's time for the US Government to raise the Federal Minimum Wage, and it most certainly will happen soon.** Currently in the longest streak without an increase (13 years dating back to 2009), the $7.25 per hour Minimum Wage will have to quickly catch up as many States have already taken action and raised their Minimum Wage over the past few years. Further forcing the issue is the high inflation and rising cost-of-living which adds huge pressure on the Government to take action. 

The U.S. hasn't raised the Federal Minimum Wage since 2009, the longest streak since the national Minimum Wage was enacted in 1938 under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).   


Most individual States have already increased their Minimum Wage (see table at the bottom). Cities have done the same, with Seattle, San Francisco, Denver, New York City, and others already at a $15+/hr minimum wage. 

A number of major corporations have already raised their Minimum Wage, including Amazon ($AMZN), Bank of America ($BAC), Costco ($COST), Chipotle ($CMG), Starbucks ($SBUX), Target ($TGT), Walmart ($WMT), and others. 

President Biden recently raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15, so the movement is already underway. However, there is still a battle in Congress whether the $15 Federal Minimum Wage will become official. 

&gt;‚ÄúOf course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages‚Ä¶and to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.‚Äù  

	‚ÄìPresident Obama, State of the Union address, Jan. 20, 2015

Things to consider:

1) Does increase in Minimum Wage lead to higher inflation? Even if it does, don't these workers deserve to get paid more?

2) $15 per hour might be worth a lot more to someone living in a city or state with a lower cost-of-living. People living in major cities with high expenses might need more. 

3) Could higher minimum wage have negative effects on some businesses? Perhaps.

**Whether the Minimum Wage will increase to $15 or a lower number is still up for debate. However, an increase, even a smaller one, is certainly needed.**

I am fully aware a lot of people get promoted to this role from within. But, I am leaving the company I am at now (Software Dev Manager) for a few reasons. I feel I have a good resume (20 yrs experience, 3 as a dev manager, 5 as a tech lead, 4 a consultant, 8 as a Sr Dev). I am considering a move up and am surprised at the number of director jobs I see at tech companies available right now.

Some things that make me hesitate:

1. I have no Sr. Leadership experience except at a VERY successful side hustle I sold over 6 years ago. Had 12 employees... mostly low income manual labor but otherwise I ran the business with software I personally wrote. Didn't make a lot, but was fun.
2. I get a lot of my confidence from being a technologist. I am in the weeds, even as a manager I prefer to mentor people to become more experienced developers. I enjoy this more than anything, which is maybe NOT something a director should be doing. I realize reviewing PRs, writing UMLs, POCs and hosting KTs is not something I'll be doing likely.
3. I know what people want to hear from perspective dev managers, architects and tech leads in interviews. I'm honestly a little unsure for a Director role as all of my past directors seem to do a bit of everything. Even at a large tech company where I spent 6 years (think Microsoft, but not) my director wrote code occasionally. Did a lot of liaison with the business, met with leadership a lot, changed some policies etc. but was mostly what I would call ""a technologist"" at heart - like me.

Maybe it's not for me and I should be sticking to dev management. I applied to some Director jobs anyway, but could use advice."

I'm terrible at it and It's not what I went to school for (I studied an undergraduate of Commerce and a specialization in Marketing).*

I originally went in to the government to pay off student debts but now I'm trying to escape. The following skills I possess with different levels (ok, good and great):

**Social skills:** Great - I am really good with connecting with customers and make them feel comfortable. I can often wear many hats and make people trust me. I'm very charismatic.

**Presentation skills:** Great - I am very good at presenting, It's always been one of my strong suits which I gather probably came from my stint in acting growing up.

**Teamwork skills:** Great - I work great in a team setting and often end up motivating the group or leading the group.

**Problem Solving:** Great - this is going to sound terrible but I have often been able to talk myself out of anything or able to resolve any scenario. I find problem solving to be fun and challenging. This drives me to put more effort in, and it gives me a sense of pride after.

**Personality:** Great - I know this sounds conceded but my personality has always been my strongest characteristic. I make the work environment colorful and fun.

**Easy learner:** Good - In University, I taught myself to code my own website. I've tried learning something if I can't figure it out. I usually pick stuff up very easily.

**Leadership:** Great - I was a president of a club in university and led an entire team of executives. I'm also great at helping new people get the ropes.

Anyways, I don't know where I can check regarding these options. I'd love to be in a dynamic environment with a lot of decision making. I am creative, problem solving and very people savvy. I love working with people.

If you have any ideas please share. I would love to stay within the business realm but open to suggestions."

I didn't hear back for a bit and when I follow up later, I get an auto-reply that she's on hospital duty and may not respond to messages immediately. Okay, that makes sense so I wait. I still don't hear back for maybe a week I think and then decide to follow up again. This time, met with an auto-reply that says she is on vacation and will return at such and such date. I'm thinking, okay, it's a new program so maybe she's just really disorganized? But I leave it alone and continue job hunting and I still see the listing up! WTF. And it's a limited term position too so I would think they'd want a timely hire. I'm not really interested anymore at this point but just want to know what happened. Any ideas? Our only meeting was maybe 10 min, I don't think I could've done something to disqualify myself that quickly."

The person they ended up hiring had more experience with said system. 
The position recently opened up again, so I applied again. And got an interview in two weeks. I still haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to gain more experience with the system, but since I last spoke to them, I have a new job with more responsibilities and objectively a step up from where I was two years ago.

How can I convince them that I‚Äôm a good fit for the role? If they ask about the system and how I would deal with that (they did that the last time) my plan is to say that I‚Äôm very eager to gain more experience, and that I‚Äôm a fast learner, and the only way I‚Äôll be able to learn is someone being willing to hire me so I can prove myself.

The other job pays quite a lot more at 89K. But it is a 6 month contract with no insurance and 5 days a week. I suspect the workload will be very light in comparison, though. I  think that it might take a lot of time for work to get done and flow up the command line though, as it's for a major brand. Also fully remote.

I think I am overthinking this.  My work requires me to communicate through email occasionally with supervisors in other departments.  They don't work in the office and I've never met them/talked to them even in a call to gauge their personalities, its strictly just through email.  Their emails sent to me are very short and dry.

Sometimes they will send me an email to ""Please do xyz simple task.""  I don't know if I should be responding back something along the lines of ""This xyz task is now done"" or just leave it.  On one hand I think its nice to give acknowledgment/confirmation that you've done the requested task, though on the other hand I think these folks are usually very busy people and I don't know about clogging up their emails.  So far I've just stuck to not really writing a reply back unless I think its something a little bit more important.

I am currently 33 and have 3 years on the job as a Corrections Officer. I do not like where my life is headed in this job as it strains my home life ie getting mandated 3-4 times a week and barely being able to stay away for my son. My past life was just a disaster in some ways, I went to CC and just got my general studies out of the way and chose Criminal Justice after that only because I really had no guidance or idea of what I wanted to do. Fast forward through my 20s and I had random jobs mainly security minded, private investigator and then once I couldn‚Äôt take the mundane life I was living I made the bright choice to join the Navy at 26 years old. I am sure if anyone is reading these your probably rolling your eyes by now as I sound like a lot of other people. I did 4 years in the Navy and got out in 2019. Most of my time in the Navy as a F18 jet engine mechanic and the way it happened , I learned the job basically on the job with no schooling so I never was very proficient at it. I got out went to the Corrections Academy spent 2 years at a prison 3 hours from home and now I am finally home working at a prison my father has been at for 20 years and I am completely miserable. I cant see myself doing 19 more years of this, the job is awful and the politicians in NY have made it a nightmare when your lower then the convicted individuals. So here I sit thinking should I just quit like several have been the past few months? Should I go back to school after a 10 year lay off and use my GI Bill? Do I just suck it up because the job provides and I have a pension, medical, dental, etc for my son and I? Sorry for the long post I just want to see if there are like minded people on here have gone through a similar sort of dilemma and how you went about it. Thank You!"

I shot a bunch of cold emails to music management/labels I was interested in working with and my current boss took me on in April. He's a great guy, but he just doesn't really have the work for me and I've tried to get involved more numerous times and it never really materializes into anything. 

After a couple call sessions that we had, he decided to let me run the social media account starting in early August, which is fine, but it's really inconvenient with my time schedule as I'm at work when he wants me to post and I pretty much never get breaks at my real job. Numerous times I've had to pretend like I had to use the bathroom just to get the post, but I've had maybe four or five days where I couldn't find time to post and he was evidently pretty frustrated with me today for missing my post. I feel really bad though because the first time I feel like me wanting to get more work actually materialized into something, it just hasn't worked out.

The issue though is that in the industry, practically everyone is connected. Any business that I'd want to go work with has probably worked with my boss before, and I feel like going behind his back and trying to find a new position without him knowing would back fire so fast. 

How could I go about addressing this to him? I'm super thankful for the opportunity he's given me and would definitely wish to keep the relationship going, especially if I stay in the industry. It's just that I think our goals of what we want aren't aligned and it might just be best to move on. Would love to use him as a reference and use this internship as experience too."

So my question is this, should I stick it out til I find something new? Give them a proper two weeks even though I‚Äôd technically still be in training? Or just tell them I‚Äôm not into it and call it quits on the spot?

Update: I appreciate the responses. I sat down and thought about it and I‚Äôm sticking with it. Some people mentioned I was likely just complacent and comfortable  with my previous and the new one.

I am still in University and have tried to use the services available there but they haven't been able to help me.  I don't have any references or any one I know that I can help me get a job. I don't have a printer so I haven't been able to apply to jobs in-person. Resume writers are also too expensive. I have tried feedback on other subreddits but usually can't apply it or they just tell me the resume is terrible (got some useful advice though).

I've been working in a small company as a data analyst for 8 months now and I am so ready to give my two weeks notice. Since this is my first job after college and my first time giving two weeks notice, I'd like to get some advice on what to say and how in my situation.

I've been searching online about this issue and my situation involves the fact that 

1. It is a sudden two weeks notice to my company and there is only two people working in my department, where most of the technical part of the department is handled by me. The company is even trying to expand and rename our department so that it tailors to my role specifically. They have been asking for new business ideas from me that is related to analytics. Since I had no choice but to provide new business ideas, I'm worried that I am giving the company a situation where I'm excited for the new department but is quitting all of a sudden. 
2. I don't have any job lined up. I have been having issues with my health currently due to stress and anxiety (chest pains). I just want to take a break, take care of myself, and prepare for grad school. 
3. My work is remote. 
4. My direct manager is great but he is one of those people who micro manages with a smile to alleviate the pressure. 

&amp;#x200B;

To give more context of why I am leaving this job without another job, 

1. Health issues due to stress and anxiety.
2. Company management including the CEO emphasizes that the company is a ""family"" business but I noticed couple of people getting laid off over the past 5 months.. Company is also proud that they are transparent with their employees in terms of company progress and such but we were asked to fill out new business strategies every week and even I (more related to back end) was asked for new sales strategies every week. 
3. Manager is great but does not communicate with me in terms of changes in my department. Even when new intern interviews or new partnership meetings related to my department, I wasn't informed and was rather left out and heard about it later. I just felt that my work was appreciated but I wasn't treated as a colleague. 
4. HR is terrible. I know I should've been more smarter about this and asked before joining the company but HR didn't even tell me about PTO or other benefits until 4 months after I joined... When I asked about these with specific questions, it took 3 emails to know that the company gives 10 days of PTO and 3 hrs (accumulative?) of sick days. Plus, still didn't receive my reimbursement. 
5. My work is not appreciative. I work in the analytics part of the company. If the company request for any type of data or analysis or even small researches, I do it. Basically, because of this, I am involved in many projects related to sales and other departments. The only problem is, even after working and constructing the baseline template for them, not a single word given to me or my department during company calls. It all goes to people who actually brings in the revenue, which I understand as companies run from revenue but it really sucks to be the person who do projects after projects without appreciation. 
6. No opportunities to grow. I've learned a lot from my current role but I think I'd like to learn more in different directions, which my company cannot provide. I believe I need a new career path.

It was really long and I am fully aware that I should have a new job lined up but this thought have been with me for more than two months. If you could give me some advice on how to give my two weeks notice in my situation, that would be really really helpful for me as a first timer. Thank you so much!"

I'm a self-taught graphic design student with over 7 years work experience in retail business and admin work (worked during school holiday and weekends) and I recently applied for a job with a larger company for the junior graphic designer position. Things went well, I went in for an interview and they really seemed to come through, and due to the fact that it's a small town... My references on my CV really helped carry me through since it's some of the big names where I come from.

The problem came in where I hoped to get the position of junior graphic designer, and make R8000 a month. I was excited and really keen for it... But I was told afew minutes ago that they found a bettr position for me, and that would be to work with the online team, running the online part of the store which is growing substantially, for a much lesser salary.

I don't know who to talk to, since this is a new job and I don't really know anyone who has worked like this before hence why I looked to the internet. My questions are...

Is it worth it? I will be working 8 to 5 everyday, and 8 to 1 on Saturday. I also have to find a way to get myself to and from work, since Uber isn't available where I'm from. So that would take a bite out of my salary as well. I thought about walking but I was told not to, since it's a fairly dangerous area and it would mean an hour walk to get there.

Will the work load be difficult? It's currently a team of 15 people... Running an online store. I was told that it's not that difficult and the team would be there to help me... But what if they make the new guy do all of the work?

Any tips and advice? I just need someone to talk to about this to calm my anxiety since this is a huge thing for me, as well as being my first proper job. Thank you for reading this!"

On LinkedIn it says the company has 11-50 employees, so it's not the biggest of companies. Still, it feels like a bit of a red flag. The interview invitation was only the login for Microsoft teams with no other text whatsoever, the CEO sent this email using his business email address and he is the one that's going to conduct the interview itself (I assume, since the guy gave me no information at all).  


I've researched the company today and it seems legit, they have a lot of products in a lot of stores, good reviews, I could find the CEO on Linkedin too and it looks fine.   


Do you think this is something I should worry about or is it just good ol' overthinking?"

I look after the construction sector and in the recent years we have been having a lot of success in winning major projects in our state. As a result, my company has asked if I have an idea of a new title I would like. 

My current title is Product Engineer. My role is mostly internal sales (putting together quote proposals) and I also provide extensive technical and R&amp;D support during projects. Due to the size of the contracts we have dedicated project managers. Recently I have also been doing contract review and negotiations. 

I report directly to the GM and I don't have anyone working under me. I work closely with the project managers.

Are there any title that describe the ad-hoc nature of my role? Or maybe a job title that would help me get get to a higher level of employment later? Or does it all fall under my current title? (To me Product Engineer is mainly to improve the product over time, but does not have any relations with contracts or projects.)"

-Support work for Customer Support colleagues;

-Become a trusted advisor to our customers by understanding strategical requirements and implementing solutions.

Requirements are basically having energy and enthusiasm for working with customers and be proficient in english. And also ""use excel like a ninja"", they say. They pay is quite low 900 to 1000 euros a month. Average wage in my country is 1200 but everyone (college professors, colleagues and redditors) always told me mechanical engineers should never accept first jobs that pay less than the average.

They ask for someone recently graduated in these engineering areas: civil, mechanical and electrical. My question is: Is this some kinda of call center job? And if so, why would any engineer accept this kinda job?

Yesterday we all received an email from our health insurance department to inform us that the annual enrollment was upon us and that our premiums are going up by 10%. Which brings it to an additional $40 a month increase.

When I reached out to the union to question this, I was told that they fought for us and got us a 1.7% CoL increase that went into effect last month. 

Considering that inflation in my city is around 13%, cost of rent has gone up 30%, food is up around 15-20% and don't get me started on gas.

I was talking to my coworkers about it and it seems everyone is very unhappy about it all. 

So my question is, is 1.7%, or what equals out to around $900 a year, enough as a CoL increase? I feel our union totally shit the bed on it but perhaps I'm out of line in my thinking?"

They wrote me last night scheduling an interview for next Wednesday and yet another one for the week of 9/26! I'm so happy!!! There's hope!!!

--------------------------------------

Hi! I've applied for a job in my dream company around two months ago. I've known the hiring manager for a while now and we have discussed the possibility of me working there a few times already. 

It took them a month to invite me for the first interview with HR. So I got through HR screening quite smoothly, then I had an interview with the hiring manager a couple of weeks later. 

The interview with the hiring manager went great (it was supposed to be a 30-minute interview but we ended up talking for over an hour). She told me several times she was very excited about my application and that I was a strong candidate. She wrapped up the interview by telling me I should hear from them soon about a third interview (a panel with other members of the team).

Ten days later (this Monday, Sep 12), HR writes me an e-mail asking about my availability for the panel interview this same week. I answered a couple of hours later, giving them 3 available times on both Wednesday and Thursday (Sep, 14 and 15). Then silence...

Wednesday around noon, I decided to follow up, just to check if HR had gotten my e-mail and reiterated my interest in the position. I've also confirmed my availability for Thursday and gave them a few more available times for next week, just in case. Nothing...

What should I do? Am I being ghosted? How long should I wait before following up again? Should I write the hiring manager next?

The job posting is still up on their website, so I don't think they have already filled the position either.

Thank you very much!"

I'm EU based and I was working remotely for a major American firm, being paid a third or less of what would be a competitive American salary. 
I figured quitting without another job lined up wouldn't be a problem (I receive offers daily and I could use a sabbatical). 

I want:
- remote from anywhere
- 90k + salary (which is still on the lower end of the US market)

As I said - I receive offers daily. As you can imagine tho the hard part is not getting offers, is finding jobs meeting those criterias. I've been laid back in the past two months (not being proactive in the search) and I almost scored a position before being canned by the CTO. 

I'm trying to understand if I need to persevere. I'm planning to better my curriculum (working on getting the GCP cert soon) and switch to a proactive job search. The question for this board is: how likely is it that I'll find something without dropping one of those points?

NB - I know exactly what companies think when hiring abroad - ""life costs less there, so I will pay you less"". I don't fucking care. It makes no sense for me to sell short my skills on the basis of where I was born."

There was an escalation that got pretty bad, despite it not being my fault, however I was the consultant tied to this customer. The reason for the transfer is to protect my reputation from further potential escalations. My company likes me and ultimately wants to retain my talents, but I'm not that interested in staying. In the meantime, while I interview with other internal teams I am mostly doing non-customer related tasks and administrative work behind the scenes. It can be kind of boring, but I'm glad I no longer have the stress of customers because this summer was hell. When I started in my role last year, I set a soft deadline for myself that I wanted to start looking at other jobs around late summer/early fall 2022 since that would be my 1 year mark with the company and I'm ready to move on. I received an offer from another team at my current job but I declined it and I also received an offer from an external company, but I also declined the offer. I'm still searching, but I'm applying for a position that I'm really excited for and hopefully can land it! However, I'm getting messages from our company recruiter about internal teams that are interested in me. I'm basically pretending to be interested, since during this time of administrative task work my manager would like me to interview with other teams. Ultimately I'm done with this job and want something non-remote. Remote work has been getting lonely and I'm an extraverted person. I have a meeting with my manager later today and really want to say that I want to keep doing these administrative tasks (to keep my job/pay) until I find an external job, but I know I shouldn't say that.

What should I do..?"

Edit: I guess my problem isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs $3k less‚ÄîI know that‚Äôs pretty insignificant‚Äîbut it‚Äôs about the principal and accepting less than what I feel I‚Äôm worth :-(

In a span of two months of joining, she was an absolute nightmare, she would purposely assign me the incorrect tasks and would be extremely rude and micromanage. I was asked to give a daily report in the morning and evening regarding what tasks I was working on. She would even be racist and make comments like ‚ÄúWhy are we even paying you?‚Äù And she even made fun of my co worker‚Äôs disabled kid. 
I was laid off in a span of 3 months after making that complaint and since the company didn‚Äôt have any formal HR, I had to report to the managing director who offered no solutions. This employee (my manager)  is known to withhold benefits and pay and be absolutely rude to other employees as well and the MD had received numerous complaints about her. He has always defended her and even told me that I need to learn how to work with her and that conflict is good for workplace. After complaining, she stopped working with me and would make my tasks extremely hard. I was laid off later on by saying that they need to pay the company‚Äôs rent even though most of us were working remotely. 
I recently found out that they hired someone for the exact position and guess what? They hired my abusive manager‚Äôs daughter as my replacement within  6 months of my layoff, Do I have any legal right to sue this company for harassment and unethical layoffs? They have a trend of over hiring and setting unrealistic expectations without providing training and laying off people within 6 months of hire.

1,2022-09-15,Any job/company ideas for a recent computational linguistics MSc grad?,u/zettasyntax,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xf3n94/any_jobcompany_ideas_for_a_recent_computational/,jobs,"Hi, so I recently completed my masters in computational linguistics from UW Seattle over the summer and my degree should be awarded soon. I was looking for job role/company/etc. recommendations as I start applying. During my undergrad, I took a class called ""human language and technology"" where we had a guest speaker who worked for Disney doing sentiment analysis type stuff. She said she had a PhD in linguistics, but no programming experience whatsoever - not even Python; claimed it was a ""fake it 'til you make it"" moment. Anyway, Disney isn't the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of computational linguistics, so I'd love to hear about roles/positions/companies to help broaden my search. You can definitely send me a message if you don't feel comfortable sharing info about places you've worked at and such. During my time in the program, faculty has forwarded recruiting requests from alums at places like Bose, TikTok, etc., so it would be really cool to see what other places I can add to my search that I may not have thought about. I've also noticed that many positions don't exactly say ""computational linguist"". An alum of the program sent out a recruiting email for a ""data scientist"" to join his team and when I checked out the posting, a graduate degree in computational linguistics was one of the acceptable degrees.

I am not exclusively tied to comp ling/NLP stuff. I'd be interested in other roles that I might qualify for. My undergraduate degree was also in computational linguistics and I interviewed for jobs like system analyst, application programmer, and some IT roles. Salary wise, I'd be okay with anything in the 75K plus range. The director of my graduate program sent some salary statistics from about 161 alums who shared that info and the mean was $112,721 and the median $119,000. She said I could use this info for negotiation purposes, but given that I haven't exactly worked in the field, I'd be okay with lower as previously mentioned since it would be my first job related to my degrees (my most recent job was part-time home health care work while I worked on my masters). 

Also, I tried asking over in the linguistics sub-reddit, but my post was deleted twice and I saw another post asking about job advice get deleted, so I'm not really sure what they actually allow to be asked over there.

Thanks for any advice."

I am 25 yo, from Italy, with a Master‚Äôs Degree in Asian Studies (I speak Chinese), and with 3 years of job experience, mostly in education. 

In the future I won‚Äôt stay in Italy anymore and I will move to China, so I am planning what to do. Here you gotta help me :D

I really like teaching, languages especially, and in China I guess my only option would be to teach Italian (or something related to Italy), since honestly I have nothing else to offer. However, my goal is to work in University. Do you think I need to get a phd? So to focus on a specific field? Or a Master‚Äôs degree and experience is enough? 

In the past few months I got extremely interested into Videogame Industry, especially in China, I did my master‚Äôs degree thesis about it and I want to publish some researches about it, because I noticed there are not so many experts in this field, at least in my country. 
So here is my question: do you think I should pursue a career in this area? Maybe by doing publications, following online courses and to specialize in this industry? 

I really want to do something I like. Phd is fine but I don‚Äôt like the idea of spending other 3/4 years to ‚Äústudy‚Äù something I might not like, at the same time a different path might be too complicate.

I don't know what to do.",u/Shalini-Jha,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xf4l12/ive_just_been_threatened_by_my_company_to_opt_for/,jobs,"I'm a product researcher for a Dubai based, remote, mental health product. I have a Clinical Psychology background, but it doesn't pay well where I live, so I decided to opt for a product role.  


The story begins with how petty my manager has been. She has no background in mental health, yet she has consistently micromanaged me and other researchers. She has made us look incompetent, and treats us like students. The worst part is once you stand up to her, and be assertive with your language, you'd be BOUND to face a revenge later on.

Here's an example - She asked me, extremely rudely, why my output was less for the week. Now generally, she'd expect you to apologize, feel guilty, and walk on eggshells. I was sick of doing that for 8 months! So I assertively told her I was on an off for a day on the week, which is why my output was affected. Nothing wrong with this, right? Well a couple of weeks later, she gave me a shitty appraisal.

There'd been incidents like this with everyone, not just me. 

Now for the story. In March, the company was struggling with their UX flow.  I have a bit of a background in the UX research area, so I was able to come up with some ideas. At that point of time, they did not appreciate me. But then my manager began to pressurize me to leave the content team and be a UX person for them. ""It's totally your choice, of course,"" she used to say.

My last appraisal was today. She began the meeting with asking me what I think about doing the UX work. I said it excites me, sure, but right now I'm happy with being a content researcher and would be happier in the role I signed up for. She then said, ""I'm sorry but you're not the right fit for us as a researcher or a writer anymore.""

I was shell shocked. I did not know where this was coming from. We had a couple of ""disagreements"" this month (very small ones, like the example I mentioned above. I didn't know I'd stepped on her ego) and I knew she was acting in vengeance. She told me that a UX agency would be extremely expensive for them, so it makes sense that I would go in that area, since I have prior knowledge and knew the product inside-out. And if I chose otherwise, then it's best I search for a new role as I no longer fit with the company.

I was shocked, outraged. I told her this was unfair, this was horrible, that I never saw this coming. I told her I'd be excited to learn UX but how would it affect the company if I was being threatened to move into another team?  She said, ""oh no please don't take this decision out of some threat. This is totally your choice. I don't want anyone to take such decisions out of threat. It would affect our work.""

She then made it sound like I should be grateful they weren't firing me, but giving me another chance to prove myself. No amount of disagreements made any difference; the company was decided.

Reddit, how does it make sense that they're forcing me to shift to another department when I never signed up for such a role? Oh, the cherry on top is that my pay would not increase in the UX area despite it being a tech role. I am so so upset about this. I've been crying non stop. I feel jaded. I gave so much of my time to the mental health area, so much of energy to building this promising product. 

I'm confident I'll find a new gig, but the disrespect is something I can't get over.

My friends and boyfriend are suggesting me to take the UX gig on the surface to buy time, and find a new gig till then, before dropping them without notice. I agree with them, but I can't imagine facing her again for anything.

I'm just so jaded man. Feel upset."

My assistant is ready to move up and I hope that after everything I‚Äôve done they will take my word that she‚Äôs ready. If she takes over everyone will be okay. I love my staff more than I can express and we are all very close.

What, if any, advice is there for something like this? My stomach is in knots."

But the interview process has been so drawn out I‚Äôm afraid that it‚Äôs a red flag and that I should consider walking away. So far I‚Äôve completed:

1- phone interview with director of sales 
1- Additional phone interview with director of sales 
1- video interview with Human Resources 
1- video interview with a team member
1- video interview with another random team member 
2 more phone calls with director of sales

Today, at yet another video call with the director of sales I thought for sure I was finally going to get an offer- NO. Another hour long video interview! And then, a request for TWO MORE INTERVIEWS with the creative team and another department next week.

They won‚Äôt tell me the official salary and they won‚Äôt give me a time line as to when they want to have this role filled. Is this really how people interview for mid-level positions in 2022?

- What makes a good program assistant/what do you expect out me  to make your work go smoothly?

- Are there any concerns or questions about my resume/experience that I can address after having this interviewed?

- What has been your favorite part about working here? Biggest successes and such?

I've never interviewed with someone higher than a direct manager, or at the very least, someone across the country that I don't necessarily interact with regularly. I'm not quite sure what kind of interview I should expect nor do I have any idea what to ask them about when it's my turn.

I've never had a peer interview, but it's the shortest (30min) so I assume it's the most conversational. Obviously I'd ask them about day to day responsibilities, and my first round interview mentioned having to handle requests from different managers at once so I figure that'd be a good thing to pick their brain on, but apart from those questions, how else should I make a good impression?

It's essentially on-site data entry, with some small technical knowledge. Using EHR software,  navigating a Remote Desktop, encrypting information, etc. They also send me all over the country, so there's a lot of working independently &amp; trusting that they can send me out to represent the company to our clients. In the past, I worked as a sales rep for a brand &amp; prior to that I worked a retail job.   


Today I had to work in the city and I saw a lot of people similarly aged to me look like they were thriving &amp; it has made me start to reconsider my life choices. I'd like to start to look for a new job but I'm not even sure what I would be qualified for.   


I've got constant work experience &amp; an associates degree. I am very much a people person &amp; I am knowledgable with PC, etc. Does anyone have any insight as to what kind of jobs I should look into? Do you love your job? I would love to know what you do.

I have a few base resumes I'll update on occasion, but I'm really not interested in crafting resumes to each position. Not to mention with everything else I do; I'd have to pay for software to help me do so more quickly (which isn't in my budget) or take a week to apply - and by that time the position would likely be closed or be competing against 100 people PLUS internal candidates. The reason why I refuse to play their ""show me how perfect you are for our organization"" game is incredibly simple: I don't have enough brain space to talk intelligently about how I am the perfect candidate for XYZ company, because if they talk to me, they'll want me to echo verbally what my resume says. If they call me up, I can't say ""I'm sorry sir (ma'am), but I need to have both my customized resume and your job description open to be able to talk to you and have what I say make sense."" 

Having said this, I'm finding I'm having to be doing a \*few\* more different resumes to represent various aspects of my skillset(s). But those too will be ""base"" updated only rarely.  

So... I look forward to your answers / discussion on the topic."

 How do you go about asking for that? What do you even say to someone who you haven't talked to in a couple years?

So, uh. I left my last job in July because I could not stand how terrible my boss was. Nice guy, but would not follow up on anything, generally absentminded, disorganized, and fumbling around. 

This is a semi large national corporation, but our presence in my state is rather minor and we are the only location here. My boss‚Äô boss is in another state and my boss seems primarily responsible with avoiding his boss from knowing how terrible he is.

(All this combined usually meant my boss had me doing a lot of what were his responsibilities, but he would be taking the credit.)

Anyway, I couldn‚Äôt take it and was able to get another position in July. I gave my 2 weeks notice in a formal resignation letter. My boss panicked, he knew how much I did for the company. He asked if I could work longer than 2 weeks. I said no, but I would be willing to stay as ‚Äúas needed‚Äù for supplemental shift work if he wanted. He liked that idea and agreed, and stated he would have corporate change my designation from full-time salary to as-needed hourly. 

I also had 100 hours of PTO accrued that I asked how that would be paid out. He told me it would be paid ‚Äúwithin the next t month‚Äù

Anyway, 2 weeks go by, I get a regular paycheck. I assumed it was just my pto getting paid out and ‚Äúit would take a month‚Äù meant it would be in installments.

2 more weeks go by and I‚Äôm paid a full paycheck, thus blazing by the 100 hours owed.

I realized, oh my god he forgot to take me off payroll. This will be a funny phone call. Surely he‚Äôd discover it when he hired my replacement and had to pay them too.

Talked to a former coworker. I‚Äôve been replaced, new guy is presumably getting paid. Still haven‚Äôt heard anything. Checked my paystub, I‚Äôm still accruing PTO as well. (This made me laugh out loud when I saw it.)

I loved that job. Just hated the management. Part of me wants to call boss‚Äô boss and tell them this is exactly why I quit btw. Please fire this dude and I‚Äôll be back next week. 

The other part of me thinks my boss would not let his boss know of his mistake and never reach out to me regarding the money. Even if he ever found out about it. And that it would just quietly stop one day.

Anyone else ever hear of any other situations like this? I‚Äôm not spending the money and will give it back if they ask about it. In the meantime, I‚Äôm just flabbergasted and want to see where this goes."

Hi,

I really don't understand quite quitting and hopefully Reddit can shed some light here. 
Quick background, I'm from Germany, worked as a project lead with around 6 people in my team and since 2020 have my own software company with a few employees.  

Since a few weeks all over the news, internet etc. I read about quite quitting and I don't get it. 

I mean what's wrong with just doing what you are paid for? 

If I go to a Cafe and order a latte, I don't expect my car to be washed as well. 
If I hired someone to write Excel sheets for 8 hours and this person gets paid for 8 hours, I am happy with that and after their shift they should go their merry way. 

So what's going on here and why is this a topic and not the norm. 

I get it there are sometime situations which requires overtime, which should be paid, but it's not constant and not expected. At least for me and in my worldview.

Am I that much out of the picture, that I as a ""boss"" don't treat my staff like horseshit? 

Thanks for your insight!"

I want to be as smart about this as I can in order to work towards another chance in the future.

For one, I‚Äôd like to know what I need to improve on. But maybe that is too pushy if there wasn‚Äôt even an interview? I‚Äòve also been in contact with one of their HR people over LinkedIn but don‚Äôt want to be annoying.

Any recommendations on what I can do at this point?"

I've been in my current job for 3 years or so now. I like it sometimes, but I wouldn't say it's a forever job. It's safe and straightforward, and I'd say I'm good at it, which as someone with traits of autism, makes me feel comfortable. I really like my colleagues and would feel as though I'd be letting the already very stressed team down if I left. I want to progress and move up a ladder, which I can't really do at my current job. However, my main reason for leaving is pretty much due to the cost of living crisis as my current job won't let me work from home and I would save hundreds a month by working from home in a new job of a similar salary (Saving on petrol, dog care, wear on car, etc).

I've got a new job lined up which I'm pretty sure I'll get, and now I'm having cold feet: I'm leaving the security of my current job, where I know people and have established myself as a knowledgeable and competent worker, to go to a new job in a completely different industry. I'd also be going from public to private sector, which makes me nervous due to lesser job security.

Is what I'm feeling normal? If so, how do I manage it? I feel as though this new job offers me a new frontier to explore and develop myself in, but I just don't feel good right now taking it."

Just wondering if you have stayed in a job to aid your recovery or where you were mentally/emotionally at the time before you then moved onto something else?

I like my job.  It's easy and even before this raise it paid crazy well.  I am a non-exempt employee with a high base salary, which makes my OT rate ludicrous.

1,2022-09-16,"""Skill Transfer""",u/SleazyClam,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xfqe8i/skill_transfer/,jobs,"What would you do if your boss has been (for the better part of a year already) urging you to ""transfer skills"" to the team?

I was hired as the digital manager of our team. As the most tech savvy person in our team and department, people often come to me with all sorts of IT related solution requests and support with using software. I'm good at what I do, and I do know that I have developed a reputation around the company as the 'guru' in this respect. 

You know, I get it, if I were the Department Head, I would also try to reduce the manual work and attempt to elevate everyone's technical skills so operations can be more efficient.

But sorry, even though I can be altruistic, I'm not so noble that I would happily ""transfer"" all my key skills to team members so the team and department can run more efficiently.

Some of these skills were hard-earned from over the years through trial and error, others I believe are just innate abilities and 'feel' that can't be easily replicated in another person.

The point is, I've been delaying and subtly dodging this subject of 'skill transfer' with my boss for over a year now. Call me selfish but why should I teach others my skills when I don't stand to benefit from it directly? And yes I know I sound insecure, but if my team could theoretically start applying my skills, what does that leave me? Why should I give others my competitive edge for nothing in return, just so ill have find a new competitive edge to separate myself from the pack?

I honestly don't know if my boss is aware of all these concerns and insecurities. It's operationally the right thing to do, but on a personal and professional level, I'd like to hold on to my monopoly of knowledge and skills. It just seems foolish to sacrifice my interests for the betterment of the team, when it could easily turn into a ""so if everyone else can do what you do, what's the point of keeping you?"" situation. As they saying goes, if you're good at something, never do it for free. 

Am I wrong in thinking this way? For what it's worth, maybe my boss is slowly giving up on the notion as she's hiring another person to be my subordinate / apprentice, so I can focus on even higher value projects. By default, I could get a promotion by having a new person report to me. So it's weird, do the selfish thing and benefit personally / professionally, or do the altruistic thing, and I could very well still be stuck in the same position and possibly endangering my value. 

What do y'all think?"

I joined a start-up in 2019, thinking that was my big break, but it was a toxic work environment, and due to the pandemic, my role was eliminated by October of 2020. 

I was unemployed for 10-month during the pandemic, where I got a social worker job, supporting my company, but that was a contract opportunity. 

I then left that job, to go to a full-time non-profit role. At the time, it made sense, just due to length of time.

Over the past 2 years, my career has gone from rock bottom to a peak and then back to rock bottom. My first job at 16 was McDonald's and 3 years later, I moved states. By chance, I got a job as a teller at a credit union. Moved up to loan processing less than a year later. It was an okay job, but it was the lowest paying financial institution in the area. I couldn't survive anymore, and on top of that, I was denied a huge promotion into marketing that I was qualified and endorsed for because it required moving departments and my boss in the loan department told me I was not allowed to move.
I was extremely emotional and decided to put in my notice the following Monday. And in a panic, I became a stripper.
It went very well for about a year until I suffered a severe injury and had to find a ""real"" job. Ended up getting a serving gig at a local high end restaurant and loved it, made good money, no complaints. Until a few months later I got pregnant and was unable to continue working a physically demanding job due to high risk and multiple issues. Couldn't quit working, though, because we needed my income, so I started job hunting and landed a position as a receptionist at a dentist office. Easy work, sitting all day, seemed like a decent place. But the manager was also pregnant and was jealous of the attention going to me instead of her, so she got a bunch of people in on it and they literally bullied/harassed me every single day and I would go home in tears. I couldn't take it anymore. Quit on the spot one day when she called me an idiot in front of everyone at a meeting. After that I started working part time as a pizza delivery driver since I could just sit in my car most of the day. Gave birth, took 3 weeks of leave, came back and immediately got promoted to management. But pizza isn't what I want to do with the rest of my life. I would like to go back to a professional field, since I am studying marketing, but with my r√©sum√© being such an absolute disaster, it's impossible to land any opportunities. I only keep my relevant experience on it, and no, I don't list being a stripper; I keep that period of time listed as ""self employed."" 
I just really want to be successful but I feel like I'm stuck and can't get out. I'm extremely smart, extremely well-rounded, extremely hard working, everything an employer could want, but because of the shitty hand I've been dealt, no one will give me a chance. 
So if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated. I'm willing to do anything at this point."

2003,2022-09-16,Coworkers are pissed that I negotiated WFH and higher pay.

I love my job but wanted higher pay and work from home. I brought these offers to my boss, and he matched them (i am the only one that can do my role) . So, more I work from home 90% of the week. 

I came into work today and the other coworker in my ""department"" asked to talk to me privately. She told me that the sales team had been approaching her to complain about me getting to wfh (not sure what they know about higher pay). That it is bad for morale. They tried to get her to agree that it wasn't fair. That isn't the part I am angry about. 

They accused me of working two jobs. One of them tried to get the names of the companies I interviewed for (she didn't know them) so that she could call and see if I was working there. That seems incredibly fucked up to me. I want to say something to them but my coworker doesn't want to get in the middle of all this (they will know she told me).

I don‚Äôt have a term on my contract, and when I interviewed, the director said that they are looking for someone to hire on and eventually take the position of my manager, but they don‚Äôt have the ability to bring me on as a salary employee yet. So this is essentially a contract-to-hire situation. 

It‚Äôs a digital news organization and pays very well which is why I decided to take the job even though I planned on avoiding journalism after receiving my degree (too many newsroom horror stories). But when I started, I realized that they really need help. I am essentially on a team of two and we both have massive responsibilities. 

I‚Äôm not the type of person who avoids getting things done because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot my job‚Äù but I also highly value the effort and time I invest in projects because I‚Äôm very aware of my tendency to burn out. 

A project that needs to get done is a style guide which I have essentially volunteered to do because‚Ä¶ well, someone has to and I have guide writing experience. But I‚Äôm worried about doing extra work like that when I‚Äôm only a contract employee.

I know in general headhunters are compensated by a % of candidate's salary (if they are hired)... so does that mean headhunters are incentivized to refer as many candidates as possible?

It's been my first long holidays since 13 months (through that time I had like 2 days leave ma ybe twice) and I reminded myself how life can be without work.

My life dream was always to travel, be on the move and just see what another day brings. Of course, the 'real life's verified that dream very fast. Rent, daily living, social life etc. I'm living with my partner but for reasons that are not important for this topic he cannot work, so I'm the only one financial provider.

10,2022-09-16,"I got laid off and have been looking for 2.5 months, I have lost all hope. How much longer before I'm truly screwed due to a resume gap?",u/FrankleyKonkey,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xfx6bi/i_got_laid_off_and_have_been_looking_for_25/,jobs,"I got laid off at the end of June. I was a great performer at the company and was there for almost 3 years. Without giving away too much about the company, it was a well known tech company, and I previously worked for other well-known tech companies. I have 10 years experience total. You'd think I'd have an easy time on the job search but honestly it's been worse than I've ever heard of anyone's job search before, and I cry every day about it (I'm a mom doing IVF and on a ton of hormones, if that helps excuse the crying.) I'm genuinely afraid I'll never have a job I like ever again. I'm definitely open to advice but please try not to be too brutal as I already am pretty much hopeless.

I actually got to final rounds with two companies both of which had roles I was very excited about, but then got the canned ""your experience isn't quite right"" at the end of my presentation even though apparently I was otherwise a ""very strong candidate."" I can only deduce the issue is that my previous role at my most recent company was a weird hybrid of product marketing and product development, and honestly the company was a total shitshow and everything was disorganized. It feels like despite having a ""perfect"" resume with tons of experience, I'm not quite qualified enough to do anything in particular.  I've been applying for product development and product marketing roles across pretty much every company I can find, because I know beggars can't be choosers, but ever since I got rejected from those two companies I'm getting nowhere.

The only thing I'm picky about is remote work with no travel, because I'm a mom of a young child. I'm willing to work for pretty much any industry. Although I was a director at my old company most of my work was more IC level so I'm open to leadership and IC. I'm willing to go down $20K or more on salary.  I apply to pretty much everything. I tailor my cover letters, I've fine tuned my resume, I've met with executive coaches to perfect my ""story."" I'm truly afraid I will never work again. If I wind up unemployed for 1-2 months longer, then I have a ""resume gap"" that will make me truly unhireable, if I'm not already.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Is this something unique to me or is the job search just hard right now, and will it ever get better?

2.) Other than what I already mentioned, is there anything I can do that's still feasible as a parent (like, I'm not going to go back to school or whatever)

3.) How much of a resume gap will truly screw me over forever?"

\-1.5 weeks after final interview- email update that everyone really enjoyed interviewing with me, but hiring manager is out of town so will have update on potential next steps by next week

\-end of following week receive a voicemail from talent acquisition that another manager on the team responsible for final decision is also out on vacation + recent labor day holiday has backed things up a bit, but they are still ""very very interested in continuing to discuss the position"" with me. Am told they will get back with me for further update the following week

\-following week comes and am told via email that there are no new updates, but that hiring manager has agreed to give one by next Thursday

\-Thursday morning am advised via email that the entire team is out of town at an industry conference, but that they want to touch point with me next week and schedule a call (essentially my status update is pushed out yet another week).

So, next week I have a 30 min video call scheduled with just me and talent acquisition (at this point all correspondence between me and talent acquisition has been phone and email- while interviews with managers have been video call). 

\-**Do you think they would scheduled a rejection call via video conference an entire week out?** 

\-**It feels like I am possibly being ""kept warm"" by the recruiter in the event that their first choice does not accept an offer, but if that were the case would they really need to make all the comments/excuses of this manager is out, that manager is out, everyone is at a conference?** 

\-**Anyone on here have something similar happen, and if so what was the outcome?**"

This is my first time posting on /jobs so excuse me if I make a fatal error. 

I have become mostly disabled since last year when newly diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. This disorder has left me with chronic fatigue, and severe muscle and joint pain. It has also cause me to lose my manufacturing job and my prospects of working in that industry, which I have the most experience in. Due to personal circumstance, I have no schooling or other specialized training. Basically, I have been working dead end jobs and now find myself unable to work 'unskilled' jobs. 

Also putting it out there, I find it highly unlikely that I would be able to get on Disability as most of my symptoms are self-reported. 

I am posting here today to ask if anyone here has any leads or suggestions that I can follow. I am currently searching for local data entry jobs. I would be happy to find something remote, though remote customer service sounds like an absolute nightmare. Mostly just worried about days full of rude, difficult customers. 

**Tl;dr: I can no longer do 'unskilled' physical work and am in need of help finding a niche, possibly remote, entry-level desk job opportunities.**

Ever since I started, I have had a very toxic coworker who has treated me badly...as far as lashing out and cussing at me. She didn't get written up for doing so. She has continued to be passive aggressive while trying to control me. Three months ago, she blew up at me again but did get written up that time. 

I decided after the last incident, I was no longer going to put up with it and start looking for a job elsewhere. My previous job actually reached out to me asking me to come back and join them.. it is a great offer because it is a remote opportunity from home and I got along very well with my old coworkers.  When I told my boss that I am leaving and have another job offer to work remote, he started begging me to stay and counteroffered me more pay with the extra incentive to work from home.  I let him know that my reason for leaving is due to the toxic coworker and I have had enough of her.  My boss then set in motion the plan to fire her to keep me but there is ""not enough documentation"" at this time to do so and told me that they will strongly reprimand her by placing her on ""PIP"" for her continued actions and if I were to stay and she says one more negative thing to me, she will be immediately terminated. My immediate supervisor made the comment that ""she wishes that I could get past the negativity of the toxic coworker and stay.""  üò≥  That comment really rubbed me the wrong way!  She also said that she ""feels bad"" because this coworker is 61 yrs old and will not be able to find another job that easily and also needs the income/benefits. 

I am very torn because I feel pressured into staying but at the same time I would be much happier without the toxic coworker.   What should I do?!"

I work in construction management and have around 3 years of project management experience. I recently decided that I wanted to switch companies and have been applying around. Mostly assistant PM type roles.

One small consulting group reached out and did a phone screening with me, a zoom interview, and a in person interview with the same people as the zoom interview plus a client and a VP. They also had me fill out what I suspect was a bootleg IQ test while I was on vacation. I‚Äôm relatively early career and have at this point talked through most of my cornerstone professional experiences with them. They gave me lots of praise throughout the process.

Called me yesterday saying I could be a good fit and wanting to talk next steps. I want to draw the line after the client interview. I haven‚Äôt called them back yet. I would entertain an offer but don‚Äôt want to be yanked around with any more steps.

I was transparent with them about looking to leave the large company as it‚Äôs too bureaucratic. It feels like I may be getting into more of the same. Am I just impatient?"

What do you do if you have a bunch of interviews, you get an offer for one job but you have preference for a different job? Do you accept the offer and then back out if you get the better offer? How are you supposed to navigate this?

Long story: I'm not American, but I'm living in the USA on a working visa (J1, the worst visa). My contract was supposed to finish in January, so I've been applying for jobs all over the place. This week, I had two interviews that went very well and I'd definitely be interested in either one of them. I have a few more great job interviews lined up too.

Today, I received an email from my current job saying that they have found money to extend my contract for a year and will try to keep me funded for years to come. They will sponsor my H1-B visa too.

My dilemma is that my current job is better than nothing, but the potential jobs I've applied for or interviewed for are better. If I don't get an offer for somewhere else, then staying in the USA is fine. If I get an offer, I'd think about moving. Thing is, if I accept my job extension and they sponsor my visa, is it unprofessional to back out and go somewhere else? Sometimes I wonder if I should just leave and not care if this situation happened, but I thought I'd check to see if anyone had any advice on what to do in these cases.

Thank you to anyone who has any advice.

Note: I am a scientist, so salary is usually paid by ""soft money"" which is funding you have to apply for. It's not a secure career, that's why ""finding money"" sounds weird but it makes sense in science.

Note 2: there are 5 potential jobs, 2 are back in my home country, 1 in my city in USA, and 2 elsewhere."

1,2022-09-16,Quiet firing or shit management/micromanagement?,u/LetsTacoBoutScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xg2khn/quiet_firing_or_shit_managementmicromanagement/,jobs,"I'm in my early 30s and have been at my company for almost 4 years now (in finance). Though it isn't what I studied in college, I don't mind what I do and I mostly love both my position and the company.

I was hired in Region A to work for Region B which is halfway across the country, but I was stationed/assigned to Region A's office location prior to COVID-19, working remotely for Region B. I guess the company does this sometimes to fill in gaps if one location struggles to find a qualified, local individual.

Once the pandemic hit, all locations went remote and they decided to remain remote in 2022 with the option to return to an office if desired.

I chose to stay WFH because I love the freedom to not deal with traffic (I have exceptionally high anxiety with driving due to an abusive relationship years prior), pay for as much gas, or pump higher mileage into car. My dogs also love having me around the house. Over all else, my mental health is flourishing thanks to working from home.

We went through a few acquisitions around mid 2021 and I got transferred to another manager from one of our now sister companies. Things were great until our parent company implemented a ""workforce intelligence"" bot to monitor productivity.

I'll admit I'm a laid back (ish) employee and will grab coffee/water throughout the day, but I complete all of my tasks for Region B's office and these are the tasks I was hired/trained for (mostly moving funds, managing stocks/investments, compiling reports, etc.). These tasks/assignments move ***VERY*** quickly and, thanks to our software, only take 2-5 minutes to complete individually.

My workload depends on what our clients send in. Ex: if we receive nothing from our clients as far as updating investment portfolios or moving funds, there is nothing to do. So some days I'll have 10+ items to handle and some of those items can be complex, but rarely are a bother. Other days I'll have maybe 2 items to handle that are super easy and leave me with literally nothing else to do after working for half an hour straight. (My training sucked soooo bad too and my position is so different so I'm a little behind from what people in Region A can do, who have the same job title, but no real reason to train me because my region doesn't deal with the type/technique of work that Region A does)  Work also comes in scattered throughout the day as in it's not like I'll clock in and see all items ready to be completed by end of day. Sometimes the morning is slow and I get swamped in the afternoon just before my cutoff time for moving funds for same day use/verification. Other times it's switched with a busy morning, but a painfully slow if not dead afternoon.

Recently, my new manager (exclusively manages Region A, but I got her because my ""home office"" is still assigned to Region A) has brought to my attention that I'm clocking less than 4 active hours of working through the bot. She went on to say that other employees are clocking at 10+ hours of active work per day. First of all, who the actual Hell is working a 10+ hour day at a 9-5 job not including lunch??? One issue I have with other workers seeming to be way more ""productive"" is that Region A's tasks are so much more complex and 1 item alone can take as much as an hour to complete depending on banking and broker websites cooperating, having to phone the client, calling previous brokers/banks, pdf printing an excessive amount of confirmation receipts and email screenshots, etc. They also have nearly 5x more clients than my location (Region B) so no shortage of work to do...Region A also frequently has a backup of 30+ tasks per day despite having 5+ people with my job title and a strong variety of other workers in different positions.

Another issue with my work in Region B is if there's a discrepancy in employer-investor account information for my clients, I need to contact my coworker who can take as much as 2 hours to reply to me and may/may not address the issue. We're also all in different time zones with my manager 4 hours behind me (in Region C) and my immediate coworker from Region B is 2 hours behind me. This makes communicating/coordinating a bit difficult.

My manager also seems a bit inexperienced/unfocused. I know they were previously a manager for our acquisition and that's why they remained manager, but they now deal with a much larger number of direct reports.

That acquisition was a very small company (almost a mom &amp; pop vibe going for them) offering similar services to ours so it made *business* sense to just take them in. In our parent company's mind, minimal training would have to occur for those ""new"" employees. However, it seems that we well under-/over- estimated their talents and abilities to adapt to change.

How do I dispute to/remind my scatter-brained manager that I'm working for a different location with much less work/clients? I do all that I'm assigned to do and a bit more. I'm the only employee for Region B that handles Region B's investments besides the one lady a step/title above me who I work with closely is overloaded with work since she speaks to clients directly and handles other high-complexity items (and she's the only one as well for her position/responsibilities in Region B).

I've relayed to my manager that I do have incredibly busy days, but that's when clients send their weekly requests on time. If I left, Region B's location would be doomed until they find and train someone to take over my position, but we're all disposable anyhow. \*shrugs\*

*- I'm already putting in dozens of applications so I can leave ASAP, but this whole thing is currently* ***stressing me out***. Even more stressed because it took me **YEARS** to find a steady ""big kid"" job after college because of the experience paradox. Now I'm a classically trained scientist stuck with only experience in the severely underpaid entry-level banking/financial industry post-graduation. \*cries in student debt\* -

Obviously the bot can't clock when I'm reading my physical notes I have on paper in the notebooks I've kept throughout my training period or when I'm listing to-do items on post-it notes that are urgent for the following morning. Also recently found out it doesn't clock time spent using file explorer or reading emails on Outlook. This is problematic because I spend time ""cleaning house"" towards the end of my shift. This is a task I created for myself to lessen confusion over what was addressed in our inbox\[es\] since no one seems to know how to mark an email as ""complete"" or archive them. In file explorer I also implemented a few procedures to keep things organized in case we need to return a year later to hunt down a specific document for any one client. Since the rest of the company (globally) has finally started using my method of organization, some are still learning how to archive items and name files. This means I have to frequently go back into our file tree and move/copy files over to their correct, designated locations. I'm a bit of a perfectionist if you can't tell.

Seems like they're (Human Resources) doing the whole productivity distribution bell curve thing to cut the bottom 10% out and save money. Almost seems like that bot can hurt them in the long run because HR ***AND*** *management* are so out of touch with employee job descriptions and responsibilities region to region. My previous manager told me before I was handed off to my current manager that my team would be royally fucked if I left because no one can juggle the differences in our client quirks as well as I do.

Just hate how it (bot) makes me look ""lazy"". I'll be offered some projects to do soon, but these are pointless and have absolutely nothing to do with my position/skills PLUS are for *yet another location* (Region D) full of whiney long-haul employees who nitpick absolutely EVERYTHING and refuse to communicate adequately on any one subject/task. Previous projects I've done with that location shortly after being hired on has gotten me a strict 1 on 1 with my then/previous manager due to not processing X/Y/Z item correctly. Proving their own lack of comprehension skills, I just try to avoid Region D as much as possible.

I was told the other Monday that I could be much more productive if I open myself to handling ***ALL*** of our global clients when needed to process their items. Very overwhelming because this is in the excess of 2-2.5k client accounts we currently hold worldwide. Each client has their own quirks/odd requests when handling their paperwork and accounts so it'd be a challenge that'd definitely call for much more than just a simple $0.20/hour raise like I've gotten in the past. IMO, I deserve the $380/hr or 20x what I'm making now if I'm taking on 20x the work and 20x the stress from my manager and incompetent coworkers outside of my main region (B) so let's all laugh together.

\- New manager seems incompetent and slow to adapt to how we (parent company) do our work

\- AI bot tracking software is causing issues/alarms in productivity; bot may hurt company in the future

Does my manager/company suck due to the acquisitions?Am I being quietly let go?Am I going through a slow career death by suffocation through corporate's doing?"

Ever since I started, I have had a very toxic coworker who has treated me badly...as far as lashing out and cussing at me. She didn't get written up for doing so. She has continued to be passive aggressive while trying to control me. Three months ago, she blew up at me again but did get written up that time. My supervisor didn't think it was worthy of a write up im guessing because I found out it didn't happen. 

I decided after the last incident, I was no longer going to put up with it and start looking for a job elsewhere. My previous job actually reached out to me asking me to come back and join them.. it is a great offer because it is a remote opportunity from home. When I told my boss that I am leaving and have another job offer to work remote, he started begging me to stay and counteroffered me more pay with the extra incentive to work from home.  I let him know that my reason for leaving is due to the toxic coworker and I have had enough of her.  My boss then set in motion the plan to fire her to keep me but there is ""not enough documentation"" at this time to do so and told me that they will strongly reprimand her by placing her on ""PIP"" for her continued actions and if I were to stay and she says one more negative thing to me, she will be immediately terminated.  My immediate supervisor made the comment that ""she wishes that I could get past the negativity of the toxic coworker and stay.""  üò≥  That comment really rubbed me the wrong way! She also said that she ""feels bad"" because this coworker is 61 yrs old and will not be able to find another job that easily and also needs the income/benefits. 

I am very torn because I feel pressured into staying but at the same time I would be much happier without the toxic coworker.   What should I do?!"

However, my supervisor at my new job is all sorts of trouble.  Problem is, I had been unemployed for 2+ years prior to starting this job last month or I would exit immediately. But I‚Äôm only two months in so it might be hard for me to get another decent job with 2 year gap then 2 months at this job.

I kind of don‚Äôt want to reveal what I do, but I will say this, 10 of us started together and we have all different supervisors.  No one is else is getting relentless pressure and scrutiny like me. It‚Äôs a hard job to learn so we are all struggling, but I‚Äôm the only one with a supervisor interrogating me all the time.  

I broke down at lunch today and I guess someone higher up saw so I got called to a higher supervisor‚Äôs office. I was so so hoping the conversation would lead to a supervisor reassignment, but I don‚Äôt understand this workplace enough to flat out ask. I could always go back and ask. I just really want them to come up with that idea.

But honestly, the main problem is this toxic supervisor.  She‚Äôs eroding my confidence and making it hard to learn.  

Everything is why did you do this or not do this.  But she doesn‚Äôt want answers.  She wants to lecture.  Really, I‚Äôm not super soft, but I can‚Äôt deal with her.

Electronic music production in my own time- this stuff really doesn't pay though unless you get very big,

Working with UPS as a seasonal/holiday driver- I actually like this but it's work that kicks my ass so I'm not sure I would want to do this all year- though I do sometimes consider,

Run an ecommerce site- I enjoy this but Amazon and the cost to keep up with quality SEO kind of ruined this online business for us over the years

Teaching driving lessons- starting to do this a little bit but I'm not sure I see myself enjoying this as a long term prospect. 


I've considered learning stuff like coding for data analysis but I hear a lot of people see it a way over crowded field and super competitive.  It is something I've been thinking about though.

1,2022-09-16,Send Another Follow-Up Or Move On?,u/RiceRedandBeans,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xg4sp3/send_another_followup_or_move_on/,jobs,"I work at a startup and want a change of pace, benefits, and stability. I graduated a few months ago and am already working 50-60 hours weekly. The senior engineers I work under get really angry at me or laugh at me when I ask questions or don't know something (thankfully, I've been able to learn on my own and from the other junior engineer). I also feel kind of uncomfortable at the office because when they see me by the coffee machine or my desk, they seem annoyed at my presence. The pay is also subpar for the area (DC Metro), but I took it over another because I didn't want to move out of state but did need to move out of my parents' house.

&amp;#x200B;

I was very excited about working for a small DoD contractor, but I've become pretty frustrated with their recruiting process. I applied the first week of August, and a recruiter from the company emailed me a week later to set up an interview. We spoke the day after, and she said she wanted me to do one or two technical interviews with the team and would let me know the next day when the interviews would be.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to the second to last day of the month, and I haven't heard anything, so I follow up, and she says she was sick and has been out, then confirms the interview date for the next morning. The next day comes, and she says it'll be some time at the end of the month and that she'll let me know the exact time and date later. I free up that time window by lying to my boss.

&amp;#x200B;

I had been studying for a couple of weeks after work to prepare for the technical interview and was able to solve the coding challenge and explain my solution well. Since I passed the coding challenge, I proceeded to the final round interview right after, where I really hit it off with the leads. I knew most of the answers they threw at me; we had a lot of similar interests (they weren't that much older than me) and even cracked a few jokes. Unfortunately, I didn't ask when I should expect to hear back since I had felt bad about pushing the recruiter to set this up when she'd just returned to the office from being sick. I sent everyone a thank you note after the interview before going to work.

&amp;#x200B;

A week later, I sent a follow-up email to the recruiter to check the status of my candidacy. She replied the next day, saying that it was a short week (Labor Day holiday), so they had been slow to pick things up, but the team I interviewed with was very interested in me and that she'd hopefully have an update for me early in the following week. A couple of days passed, and she didn't get back to me. I called the office to see if I could speak to her or someone else in HR, but the receptionist said none of them were in, but she'd forward my message to the HR manager and they'd get back to me by the end of the week. The end of the week has come, and nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

My job hunt is nearing three months. I liked this company and am tired of sending apps and doing three interviews per company just to get ghosted. I've noticed a lot of places have been laying people off and cutting openings for new grads and junior devs. I'm frustrated and want to leave my job, but I have to bare with it until I find something else. Should I even continue to bother with this particular company? And any advice for my next move would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I posted this one another sub yesterday but didn‚Äôt get too much response. 

I am in my early 30s, I have been trying really hard in the last 2 years to get a senior job ( public health sector) I finally get one but it is a part time one and I initially felt I have to accept it as opportunities don‚Äôt come up as often.

Now, I am regretting that as new job needs to work on holiday and weekend shifts, and I feel it will be more than I expected 

I have reduced my hours of my current job, so I am still technically working full time ( but 2 part time jobs). Money wise, my current job is already decent pay and I feel like a part time senior only generates more income when I work on weekend / holiday penalty rates. 

I don‚Äôt have a family (i live overseas) but I feel like this will affect my relationship with my partner as he works classic 9-5 Mon-Fri

I also need to put on pause with my post grad study ( I am not sure if I enjoy studying but it is a career move) 

I feel like I have made the wrong decision to sacrifice my rest time and my work life balance for little more money and little more senior experience. I have been in a stable full timer for 10 years and I feel like if I should have stayed in my current junior job and eventually a full time senior job somewhere more suitable will come up.


I do believe it will build my resume as it is a challenging job and I can finally try to apply my project and conflict management skills .

I keep telling my self I can quit any time but then I haven‚Äôt even started , so it feels really bad to plan the escape plan before I start. 

Any advice on this ?"

I also told her about a lack of planning from my co-worker and asked about my co-workers plans during a staff meeting, I explained that I needed more details to properly plan a digital campaign.  My boss ended up turning the situation around on me and claimed that I had ""poor communication skills"" because I did not tell them that my co-worker wasn't giving me what I needed to perform my role. She said that it's her job to make sure that my co-worker was on track, but that I also needed to ""take accountability"" for not informing her earlier and that I had embarrassed her in front of the coach. 

About a week or two later she put me on a PIP citing Timeliness, Communication and Attention to Detail as areas of improvement. 

I had been struggling with coming in on time for a week and  immediately got my act together around that. However the Communication and Detail Oriented aspects of the PIP feel trumped up. 

For attention to detail: 
I must send drafted copies to the boss and communications consultant without any grammatical errors 90% of the time.

Today she claimed that I sent an unapproved copy to staff, which I can easily prove is false. 

She cited that I forgot to remove the ""rd"" and ""th"" on the date of a rough draft copy I sent to the comms consultant for editing (AP Style, something they just recently required us to do) and missed capitalizing the ""d"" in Voter Registration Day. 

For communication: 

I must consistently improve communication at least 90% of the time using text messages, g-chat, phone call and meeting requests. 

Last week she claimed that I was failing to communicate because I responded ""yes"" to a calendar invite to an OPTIONAL work event and did not show up.  

For timeliness: 
I must show up to work/meetings on time 90% of the time. 

I haven't really had trouble with this area. 


At this point I've just started looking for another job, i'm not really trying to get fired and I don't plan on quitting but I am really sick of this. At this point it's whatever comes first, I'm tired, demoralized and don't care anymore."

I am a 27 yo Operating Room Registered Nurse in Australia, have 3 years of experience in the area. 
My job is high stress, physically demanding and the pay is very bad. At first I thought it was my work environment that was making me hate my job, but I moved hospitals and I still do not enjoy what I do. The nursing culture and politics surrounding it are not for me, and I do not want to stay in the career. 

I have a bachelor in biomedical sciences and a master's in nursing practice. 
I tried working as a research assistant in a lab after finishing biomed but I did not enjoy it as I had barely any human interaction. 

Considered a career in medicine, but my grades are not good enough for it. 

Any ideas how I can get out of nursing but still have a career in healthcare? I enjoy the patient interaction, and I like being of help to them by offering empathy and problem solving for them. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I am not comfortable hearing that when I know I am replaceable and can be fired without a second thought. We also have professional goals to work on and that stresses me out cause I see people are taking courses and classes and I just want to be okay with doing just my job and mentally checking out afterwards. I don't want to squeeze in time to accomplish these things. I don't see the point either if it isn't pertinent to our jobs, but I guess it's good that it will boost my resume. Honestly, I've enjoyed everything else about my job so far except when things began focusing so much on improving that I feel like things have become less efficient and less enjoyable.

1,2022-09-16,Offered job I really want but at a salary 10% below what I listed as my minimum requirement. Need to negotiate.,u/bigfancytiger534,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xg9gfq/offered_job_i_really_want_but_at_a_salary_10/,jobs,"Hello everyone,

I interviewed for a job that I'm really excited about and was offered the position, however at significantly lower salary than I listed as the minimum of my range. Let's say they offered $70k. My ""Salary Requirements"" range was $77k-$87.5k (10%-25% more).

While I am very excited about this opportunity, accepting at the offered salary would be a slight decrease from the salary I can expect if I simply stay in my current role and get my raise in January. Additionally, by leaving before the end of the year, I will be forfeiting a 15% guaranteed EOY bonus that would be paid out at the end of January.  All of this was taken into account when I set my range, and since they never brought up salary during the interview process, I expected them to make an offer within my range and I'd be trying to negotiate towards the higher end. However, now I'm stuck just trying to negotiate up to the bottom of it.

On glassdoor, the industry average for my role and experience in my area is around $80k and I'm regularly bombarbed by recruiters on LinkedIn asking me if I'm interested in roles at $85-90k+. As much as I want the job, I'm willing to walk away below $77k, as I'd be taking a pay cut below that when factoring in my lost bonus. I'd be very happy with $80k and anything above that I'd be thrilled.

This is a little longwinded but my question is really just how aggressive should I be in negotiating higher and where should I start? Do I counter with the $87.5k knowing they will likely come back somewhere in the middle? Or is countering 25% more than what they offered too much - risking shutting them down immediately? I am secure in my current job but I've already mentally checked out and am set on the idea of leaving so I'm really trying to thread the needle here.

Any advice is appreciated!"

I got this interview for a job but over the phone with who I assume is outreach and they have instructed me that I would be required to work Mon-Fri for 6 hours each day. Thing is I am a student who goes to university, and I have class that may conflict with that time as well I would like some time to study and do assignments that may be due during that time.

And my question is I was wondering if it would be ok if I asked the person who is conducting the interview if I could have a couple of days off? For example I have classes only on monday and wednesday that I need to attend in person and would like the have these days off for assignments and work that I have to do. How would I properly convey these concerns without assuming they will already hire me?

37,2022-09-17,AITA for turning in my line lead and her getting terminated?,u/Apprehensive_Dog_572,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xgj79w/aita_for_turning_in_my_line_lead_and_her_getting/,jobs,"TLDR: line lead has been touching me and other workers extremely inappropriately and we went to HR and she was termed. 

Names changed for privacy. 

I (20f) work for a chicken factory. After a few months, I was promoted to orange hat on one of the debone lines to assist the line lead Amber (39f). 

The first mistake was accepting her orange hat position because she was NOT supposed to get the position of line lead anyways because the rules state you must be a shoulder cutter and she wasn‚Äôt. She was a tender cutter. Anyways, not to the problem. 

When I took the position, I realized she made me do EVERYTHING. All the pre work set up that takes 30 minutes while she just stands there. I‚Äôve asked her to help me and she said, ‚Äúhaha that‚Äôs what an orange hat is for‚Äù. Which is FARRR from true because the other 7 lines do not make their orange hat do it all. They work together like they‚Äôre supposed to but since she got the position Unrightfully, she doesn‚Äôt feel she needs to help. 

The reason she even got the position is because the manager and her had a thing meanwhile they‚Äôre both married. Not my monkey, not my circus so I kept my mouth shut. 

Anyways, after a few weeks doing everything I eventually I got over it. I didn‚Äôt mind staying busy. But then touching started‚Ä¶ 

She constantly touches me on my ass, boobs, And vag as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù and laughs. At first I thought it was funny and we were just close friends but it kept happening. I NEVER touched her back because it did make me uncomfortable. I found out later I wasn‚Äôt the only one going through this. She also touches line workers (normal line workers, not orange hats or line leads). 

I went out of work in Aug for 2 weeks for a hand surgery and returned this month on the 6th. I asked the fill in orange hat how they, Mary 35f, like working for her. Mary admitted to me she‚Äôs going through the exact same thing I was. I talked to a few others about taking it to HR. 

Another workers, April 22f, is a close friend I met there and she ALSO is going through it. She was been ‚Ä¶.hurt‚Ä¶ in the past so touching like this is triggering. 

I decided to go to HR after dealing with it since June. The reason I didn‚Äôt sooner is because I was nervous. I had only been there 4 months when this all started and Amber has been there for 4 years so I was afraid they wouldn‚Äôt believe me but now I had more people willing to come forward to help back me. 

So Wednesday night, (I work nights), I went to HR and gave a statement as did the other sweet women dealing with this. HR immediately termed her before the shift even ended and now I feel guilty for being a reason someone is now jobless. 

My dad tells me I fucked up because I‚Äôll be the talk of the work place as the orange hat who got her line lead fired but I felt I was right going to HR. 

I just had surgery again yesterday, so I‚Äôm out until oct 9, and I‚Äôm scared to death to do back to work because I‚Äôm super thin skinned and don‚Äôt want anyone to think I did it on purpose and lied about everything to get her fired.

EDIT: She also makes me do everything at the end of shift such as cleaning chain gloves, and cleaning the line. My boyfriend, josh 22m helps me because he works there too and without him, it would take me over an hour and a half but with us both it takes around 45 minutes. Amber barley helps at all besides cleaning maybe 3 of the 20 Chain gloves that are NASTY and covered with chicken skin so it takes a while to clean them. Especially being they‚Äôre chain gloves, it isn‚Äôt easy

Edit 2: she also bent me over one the production floor to spank me for the birthday last Wednesday‚Ä¶ that was my last straw"
11,2022-09-17,Respect is a two-way thing,u/StrengthOfMind1989,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xgjb44/respect_is_a_twoway_thing/,jobs,"The respect and good, friendly vibes between a manager and employee is a two-way thing. Not just by the employee or by the manager, where the other side doesn't treat the other right.

In most cases, it seems if you don't fit in, if your performance isn't where the manager wants it to be, or if they just don't see you as someone ""cool"", they won't treat you right.

Even though we are grown adults, you will find a lot of managers in the workplace have a school kid mentality where they respect the cool kids but not the ones they view as nobodies.

These types of employees and managers make work a misery.

We should keep our personal lives personal but the relationship between an employee and their manager shouldn't be so stiff and serious. Managers need to learn how to create a more positive environment for their employees.

Employees need to feel valued, respected, and cared about for them to stay long term. This will also improve their work performance as their spirits and morale will be higher."

This next week is the online interview and want to make it as best as I can and I need some wisdom from reddit.

More details:

- I'm 25(M) with a Master's degree in Engineering (Industrial engineering/Unconventional processing, Lasers, 3D Printing, Nanotechnology as the specific field) who is a junior in engineering (less then 2 years in the field).

- I'm currently working( 1 year) as a Automotive Engineer at a tech company for a bigger company who are making Automotives(The big one is a French company) 

- I have an Internship of 3 months at National Institute of Lasers and Plasma in my country who will be a plus for the new job.

- English is not my main language (as you can probably hint it) but I am confident in understanding and speaking it (more problems arise at writing) the job requires only English as a language but I've started learning German as well.

- The job is title is Engineer Aplication for Metal Printing and I am really enthusiastic because it was one of most interesting topic for me in the 6 years at University. 

- I have a place to stay temporarily (2-3 months) within 20 Km from the job and the job also requires that I have a Driving license (which I have) so it's either public transportation or travel via car.

- I am also aware that I must be verified by the Engineers Association in the region before I can use the Engineering Title as the job is strictly regulated. 

There are more to say but I think this will be enough for now.

Now the questions are:

- How should I sell myself better, on what to put the emphasis?

- What should I avoid saying or what should I say?

- Today and tomorrow I will write down some common questions and answer them? ""What did you do at... What did you learn.... How did you improve... etc"" but what are some unique questions regarding this field?

- Any advice or thoughts?


This is not my first interview but this is a job that will impact quite significant my life( professional and personal as well) so thanks for reading this. :)"

I work in healthcare and transitioned to a non-clinical role. I am new to the world of pay negotiations. I was offered a job that was higher than what I anticipated and so naturally I accepted it. I then realized that perhaps I anchored myself too low since my current role is very underpaid. They offered 97k and after doing some market research average turns out to be \~99k-100k

I have not signed any of the paperwork they sent me yet but I'm wondering if it's acceptable practice to call/email my HR contact and negotiate for a higher pay (even 99k I'll be happy). 

What I absolutely don't want to happen is for them to take away the offer and not give me the job. 

I am absolutely find with them rejecting my proposal and sticking with my current one. I could use the experience of negotiating more than anything else.

Since this post, the other employee I spoke of was fired, the portion of our total work that's specific to what I was hired for has increased, and I've trained 2 employees to do what I do (they are learning but it'll take a while). I've also been interacting with my boss more in and out of work and feel like I'm getting closer to him, or that he likes me now. I've also gotten even better at the job. 

So, I feel like I'm much better off asking for a raise now and maybe even a promotion. I want to bring it up though before they go and hire someone else or make any decisions that may hurt my chances. I'm payed 25% under the median average for a person with 1 year experience and the same degree in my city. So my ask is going to be a hard raise to the median. I feel like I have leverage considering I'm the only one who can do what I do now. And I have out in tue growth and extra effort this past year. 

I'm just looking for tips or any advice for going in and having this conversation with my boss, who I really do respect. I don't want to screw the team up but if they won't play ball I'm heavily considering leaving."

1,2022-09-17,Annual leave request left unanswered?,u/Smooth-Wait506,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xgpd9w/annual_leave_request_left_unanswered/,jobs,"Context

I recently joined an organisation where the AL leave year runs Oct-Oct. I have 6 days accrued. It's generally a use it or lose it scenario and while leave can be carried over in certain circumstances, it's generally frowned upon

I've had several convos with my *boss* about when I can take this leave, one of them occurred during a social gathering and they basically replied *discuss it with your line manager tomorrow, which is me. T*his happened in front of the rest of the team and just felt like a powerplay.

They are never available to discuss anything, constantly show as busy in Teams and just come off as generally unapproachable to me. The projects I've been working on have been super-high priority too and I've turned myself inside out with the workload, meaning I've had little chance to plan when to take my leave.

About 2-3 weeks ago, I decided to take 5 days for w/c September 26th and was told to send them a formal AL request by email, which I did the next day - basically giving them 3 weeks advance notice. TBF, they had one more day to see this before they went on their own annual leave, I got zero reply my leave was approved.

They were due back last Mon but had to take time off due to stuff at home and had intermittent access to email/Teams etc. Still no confirmation of approval, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.

Yesterday morning they ping an email round requesting confirmation from those people who needed to carry over and asking for an instant response. I'm thinking *have they even seen my leave request from 2 weeks ago?* and basically asked them as much in my reply. I also followed up with a Teams message as they were showing as busy. No response to either.

It would have taken them two minutes to acknowledge either and say, *yes, your leave request has been approved.* Nothing.

So I finished for the weekend feeling highly conflicted - I get it, he has had family stuff to sort out last week, but for fuck's sake - talk about treating your staff with some level of respect.

If they come back next week and approve my leave for w/c 26 Sept, that has reduced my chances of booking places to stay etc, it also feels like I am not respected or worthy of a response.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone from the team was leaving the company just as I was joining, didn't think too much of it then

Within a few weeks of starting, I was in the office and witnessed my boss on a conference call talking to one of the junior guys like a piece of shit. 2 weeks later the junior guy goes off sick and I overhead my boss complaining on yet another phone call to someone else that the junior guy now won't open speak to him. Junior guy has been off sick for well over a month now.

This boss's general attitude towards me as been aloof with cold levels of hostility masked in corporate-speak from the get-go, plus subtle put-downs and devaluing behaviours which all seem to be geared towards keeping me suppressed. He's also partly joined in someone else's attempt of misgendering banter towards me - which is utter bullshit, as the company preaches inclusivity

I've really disliked the experience from day one, but there are occasional days that make me think, *hang-on perhaps it's all in your own head and its okay here?*

This last week I've been waking up at 5am or so and not getting back to sleep.

I woke up last night at 2.40am and the first thing that came to mind was seemingly being fucked around with my annual leave - which might actually be the last straw with these cunts. 

I'd already started looking and applying elsewhere before this latest stunt.

At this point, if they said, *look, it's not working out, here's a termination letter*, I would be relieved"

**FIRST OFFER:**

Graphic Designer for an engineering firm in Dallas

* $55k salary + $2500 moving bonus
* 120 hours annual PTO (including sick and catastrophic)
* 6 holidays + 2 floating holidays
* 401k vested in full after 6 years / employer 2 to 1 match contribution up to 4%
* Less work-life balance: Salaried position but overtime will be expected because of work demand -- I've been told they make up for it with bonuses and incentives throughout the year as well as a large bonus at the end of the year.
* 7:30 am to 5:30 pm work day
* Half-day Fridays
* 75% compensation for position-related class ($400 max/credit hour) &amp; 50% for non-related
* Have been told throughout the interview process that they value flexibility and communication if I ever feel overwhelmed/can't stay overtime/need to work remotely from time to time

**SECOND OFFER:**

Social Media &amp; Content Strategist for university in Fayetteville, AR

* $40k salary
* 180 hours annual PTO + 96 hours annual sick leave
* 12 holidays
* 403b vested in full after 2 years / employer contribution of 5% when employee contribution is 5% or less; contribution match above 5% and up to 10%
* More work-life balance
* 8 am to 4:30/5 pm
* Guaranteed opportunity to work remotely one day of the week
* 90% discount on tuition &amp; opportunity to attend class during work hours
* More laidback &amp; chill in terms of demand

**CONCERNS:**

I have visited both Dallas and Fayetteville recently. Fayetteville is beautiful and seems to be pretty progressive with a large demographic of people my age, seeing as it is a college town. Dallas, on the other hand, has more people to meet, more things to do, and more opportunity to grow career-wise. I've always wondered what it might be like to live in a big city, although the driving there does intimidate me a bit (I would definitely choose to live walking distance to the office). Additionally, I fear that I might feel overwhelmed working for the engineering firm even though they're telling me they work closely with their employees to make sure nobody is burned out. I know I'll be able to handle it regardless because I was a busy bee in college but the concern is still there. My concern with Fayetteville is that I will wonder what could have been if I had chosen Dallas instead and that the position might look less impressive on my resume. The salary is lower but I have experience in grad photography and would probably be inclined to make up the extra money by doing that on the side. Definitely something I could do in Dallas as well, but I'd definitely have less time to put into that.

**FUTURE GOALS:**

I haven't entirely figured it out yet because I am only 22, but I really enjoyed being my own boss doing freelance photography and would like to see myself pursuing more entrepreneurship-like opportunities in the future. With that being said, I don't even know if I see myself wanting a master's degree or to climb the corporate ladder -- I just know I want to see myself doing more graphic design, photography, videography, etc. and potentially owning a business related to those.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is only my first job but both are great opportunities and I want to make sure I am making the right choice so I'd really value the opinions of others who have been through this process. Thanks!"

They offered me $11.25 an hour, which isn‚Äôt great but not terrible in my area, for a part-time side gig while I‚Äôm going back to school. Communication, thus far, hasn‚Äôt been great and I‚Äôve already been accused of one no-call no-show when I‚Äôm not supposed to start until tomorrow, 9/18.

Yesterday, my wife (22F) and I were in a local video game store just looking around and I remembered that I had applied a month prior. The manager looked me up in his system, and after, he hired me on the spot because he liked my energy. Needless to say, I was excited because working at a game store is much more aligned with my interests and my skill set than working at a pet store. I would be taking a $1/hr pay cut, compared to the pet store, but I value my mental health more than $1/hr.

Now, to the quitting part. I have already accepted the video game store offer, and am now figuring out how to handle the pet store job. My wife feels that I should call the pet store and tell them I‚Äôm not coming in to work any of my scheduled shifts. I personally don‚Äôt find that necessary as they have already been kinda shitty to me, I really don‚Äôt want to change them still requiring me to pay for my uniform, and, from the sounds of it, they didn‚Äôt plan to properly train me at all.

So, I‚Äôm asking Reddit. Should I ghost the job or should I call to quit?"

I will be working in Data Compliance for a nonprofit. They use Salesforce and I am in the process of getting my certification to become an Admin. (My exam is at the end of the month!)

I'm 27 and am planning on moving out from home in the next 3 to 4 years. I just want to make sure I am secure financially and career-wise which requires me to make at least 2.5 times my new job's salary of $37k.

So I would love tips for planning my career as a young woman. 

What I have done/will do so far:

* Upskilling to transition into the Salesforce community which has positions with higher salary and better benefit.
* Networking. I recently did an informational interview with someone who transitioned from an unrelated industry and for Salesforce. Looking to talk to more individuals to get more perspective on the work.
* Taking any possible learning opportunities at my new job and asking manager for clearly defined goals to be on track for a promotion within a year. (Probably not in those direct words)
* Slightly unrelated but get healthier. I have ADHD, GAD, and am overweight. These really affect my self-esteem. I'm in therapy but need to progress to healtier self.

Am I missing anything? TIA."

In the U.S. most people rely on their job to provide them with healthcare insurance. Yet they won‚Äôt make it available for applicants to see when considering jobs. Probably because by hiding it until hire they don‚Äôt have to compete against other companies offering better benefits. I also blame the insurance companies in America for this, because they intentionally make everything hidden, confusing, etc so that the companies subsidizing it and the employees paying into it can‚Äôt see how much they‚Äôre being ripped off. And I mean beyond just job sponsored healthcare. They rip everyone off. 

But this is just something that really bugs me. If you‚Äôre someone who has health issues or you have dependents who do then it‚Äôs important that a job offers insurance that is affordable and covers your needs.

Advice?",u/thelastsubject123,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xgz51z/started_with_accounting_pivoted_to_dentistry_want/,jobs,"So I graduated Dec 2020 with a degree in accounting. Prior to 2018, I had a set plan, get my CPA, work at big 4 and make money. However, in 2018, I made the decision I wanted to do something in dentistry but didn't want to spend an extra year finishing a degree in biology as well as wanted a safety net in case dentistry didn't work out.

Fast forward 2 years later, I have 2 years of experience in dentistry as a dental assistant (which you can consider customer service), 0 experience in business. I absolutely love dentistry and have racked 2000+ hrs for my dental school applications and have submitted my app. At this point, I've shown I love dentistry for admissions and will have about 9 months before I start dental school (assuming I get accepted).

I am very unhappy with my pay as a dental assistant and envy my finance friends who are making 3x my money. I love equities as a hobby and love valuing companies with discount cash flow models, reading income statements/balance sheets, and reading the news. I was talking with a friend of a friend who's an analyst about why I'm very bullish on a certain company and how I derived my price target for them and long story short, he told me I should pursue a job in the industry. He said I don't need to know anything and just need to be a likeable person that can follow directions and told me to think about it as I'll make double my pay just starting out.

Reddit, what are your thoughts on this? My current job is a 730-6 job and already consumes 40 hrs a week but is only 4 days a week. I have excellent job security as dental assistants just need to have a pulse and can find a job (cause we're paid nothing). Would I be able to find a part time job as audit/accounting/analyst or be able to pivot easily? If so, what's the best way about doing so? Thank you for your time!"

I am a new grad applying for jobs in the financial industry and data science. For many of the big employers, if you look at the careers page, a huge amount of the listings are jobs that are in other countries. In terms of positives, the requirements for these positions are usually much easier to satisfy. 

However, As an american citizen, can I really apply to these jobs? Does it mean I need to select that I DO need sponsorship for a visa? I heard that will often get your application thrown out. I'm just confused because many of these listings are in English, even for non-english speaking countries. 

If anyone can enlighten me regarding the reality of applying to foreign positions and the best practices, it would be really helpful. Can I self sponsor a work visa?"

After several (like 3 or 4) weeks of silence, I still didn't have any shifts.

It turns out I had forgotten to redo my availability when school started and by the time I did, they already had signed me up for that shift. I managed to get someone to cover it, however. A few weeks (3 or 4) after that, I got really sick and I ended up getting a shift during that time. I didn't know that, as I was asleep or throwing up and feverish most of the day and didn't check my work schedule. I didn't notice until the day after my shift, when it was too late. I got a review from work about how I missed that shift as well. 

I talked about it with my parents and they think I was just hired to be a backup plan in case someone quit randomly. However, I never ended up telling my parents about getting a shift while I was sick, because I thought I would deal with it myself. Now, though, I am realizing I have no idea how to quit a job.

i don't ever usually have a last minute emergency where i need to request just a half a day...

Had also just won employee of the month last motnh and you would think the leasst they could do is give me this last minte request.

Had surgery back on September 2021 and this tuesday is just a one year follow up.

So friday the receptionist called to remind me about the appointment in the afternoon.

asked my boss if i could work a half a day on tuesday and got pissed that why didnt i tell them before. 

or how did i not remember. Even if i had put that on my calendar on my phone, my phone would just have reminded me the day before that i had a doctors.

I had this surgery before i had this job back in February.

Because my job can be easily done remotely i offered to work remotely after my appointment for whatever work i diddnt catch up on, i have access and have worked from home one day during the year. She then said where it is and how long it would take which i then said idk, probably 2-3 hours. She then said just come back to the office, i just said whatever.

Now im likely going to cancel my doctors because there's absolutely no reason for me to drive past my house (doctors is by my house) and drive back to the office (commute 30 mins) when the work can easily be done remotely. And also theres no guarentee that it takes 2-3 hours.

Had my other co workers had asked, im positive she would if said yes, i say that because my co-worker unexpectedly worked from home this monday and tuesday and I overheard my boss say she had something that popped up, and a few one or two employees.

The gratuity is prepaid as part of the fee for the event. The organizers split it between them, then everyone has to email them if they want an unknown amount of gratuity. The servers and bartenders have no idea how much was paid, or how much to expect. But they never get it quickly if at all. 

Further, the bartenders are chastised and told not to accept cash tips which customers give. Even setting out a tip jar is forbidden.

My Skillset is in the IT world;

Over 12 years working in IT, A+ certified. Associate Degree. Computer Science classes, Project Assurance, Web Developer, Technical Support, Imaging, Migration deployment, Virtualization,  Chat-bot training / A.I., Linux Administration, Networking.

The last 3+ years of constant / relevant work experience working for big tech and pharma. My last job was $28/hr as a contractor .( aiming for $40-$50/hr) I am healthy and don't need health insurance or benefits to cover prescription or anything, but it doesn't hurt to have if offered or affordable.(which it was not as a contractor)

At first i apply all over the USA, then i thought, i have a passport, why not the whole world?

Only a few things to consider, or may *disqualify* me?

I have a **felony** for weed possession from 2006 and some other misdemeanor for marijuana possession after, but all over 10+ years ago.

(doesn't show up on regular background checks due to how long ago it is)

I remember hearing certain countries could turn me away at the gates. Such as Canada, and Japan do not allow tourist with felonies to enter. Is this still true for people going there to work?

Does each country have different visa programs, or am i able to just go with my passport? Should i start applying being pro-active for anything?

I started applying internationally to places like ; Dubai, New Zealand, UK, Germany, Switzerland, etc.

When it asks me if i am legally authorized to work in whatever country i just say yes, or if i need sponsorship or a work visa, i say yes. But i haven't actually looked up which countries i am allowed in, or how hard/easy it would be. My plan was to wait until i had an interview , and then explain and ask the specifics for that country. So i'm looking for advice on which countries to avoid, which one's maybe i should focus on?

I am still considering work in USA, but am focusing on international at this point because i think that would further my career best. My only requirements are;

1. I have a 6 year old dog who has to come with me.
2. I am 420 friendly and don't want to die/get arrested for it
3. Any relocation package or reduced cost to move and find shelter goes a long way."

I was scheduled for 16hrs when my contracted hours are 20. I negotiated working 4-5 days a week with the previous manager and always had at least 30hrs. The new manager started last week and our previous rota was by our old manager. 2 staff members from our location were transferred to another store and the new manager has transferred over 3 new staff members currently. 

I only got an extra shift to push me over the 20hr threshold as another staff member was scheduled despite being out of the country and refused the shift as she arranged it with the previous manager. I had previously had taken another job a but after working there a few months (childcare) it wasn‚Äôt for me and my manager rehired me before she left as we had a good relationship. 

I don‚Äôt dislike the new manager but I‚Äôm very concerned when she says the hours on the schedule are final as hours got cut. I feel like I‚Äôve come back too all these changes and that we aren‚Äôt in the loop. I‚Äôm worried this will be a longterm issue but there‚Äôs no way to find out as all the new management team are from the previous managers store.

I was hoping to work at the current job for another 6 months to hit 3 years on my CV to look less like job hopping as I was at my previous job only 1yr 6 months. I have concerns over the longterm health of the business as well due to stores taking a hit due to Covid despite massive online sales as the brand is Russian owned currently and staff including myself have received a lot of hate from the general public. 

I feel like it would look really unprofessional as they were willing to hire me again for me to turn around and immediately start looking for another job ?

I‚Äôve been working retail since I left education and it was supposed to be till I figured out a career path but I‚Äôve just been there since then.

5,2022-09-18,"Working retail has me accustomed to a particular way of life, and now that I want to leave, I'm afraid I'm not able to.",u/KROMExRainbow,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xhd1x4/working_retail_has_me_accustomed_to_a_particular/,jobs,"**TL;DR - I currently work as a retail manager making $85-$90k/year with about a decades worth of experience. I'd like to move into a Monday-Friday, 9-5 office job that would suit my skill set without taking a significant pay-cut. What jobs should I be looking for, and what kind of things should I be learning now to make finding these jobs easier?** 

***

So I've been working in retail for close to a decade. I started when I was 17, and it's the only industry I've ever worked in. I obviously started as a casual sales assistant, and have worked up to managing the most successful store (in my company) in the state. We receive very high levels of positive feedback, and I consider myself incredibly capable of dealing with the high work load that being in this store presents.

All that being said, I've now run into two problems: 1) In my current company, there's no room to grow. We don't have any area or state managers, and the Head Office is in a different state. 2) Even if there was another position I could move into, I'm not particularly interested. There are aspects of retail that I love, but overall, I'm ready to move into another industry.

I go through phases of browsing job listing websites to see what other options are available to me, and am always hit with the unfortunate truth: to go to another industry would be to take a significant pay cut. I'm currently making around $85-$90k a year, and have living expenses that reflect that. I'm not talking about unnecessary purchases, but things like rent/bills/etc. that I'm required to pay. It feels like the only positions that I'd receive an interview for would be low paying, entry level jobs somewhere in the ballpark of $50k/year, and it just wouldn't be feasible to live my life on that kind of salary. 

Of course I'm aware that I could uproot my life and move to another city, and completely change my way of life, but that's obviously not ideal, especially considering I have people currently relying on me.

What it boils down to is that I'm ready to leave retail for a variety of reasons, and want to move into a more 'typical' office job. Working Monday - Friday, 9 - 5 sounds incredibly appealing to me, especially if the majority of my work is done on a computer. That being said, as I currently have no experience in an office setting, I'm also not really sure what kind of jobs my skills would be applicable to, nor what kind of entry-level jobs I could apply for that would still be on the higher end of pay.

I'll happily take a pay-cut to move into a new industry, and achieve a better work/life balance (mainly only working 38~ hours a week and having weekends off), but I still need to be able to afford my rent and bills. I'd be *hoping* for somewhere around 70-75k on the low end to start off with.

What kind of jobs in the office-space (and I know there's a large variety of industries that are 'office jobs') could I move into fairly easily without taking a massive pay cut and hugely sacrificing my quality of life?

Whilst I don't *hate* retail, I'm really scared by the prospect of staying in the industry forever. In my current job, I know I could probably stay around until I was 65 and live a comfortable life, but I really want to get out. Please help!"

I am interested in applying for customer service rep, administrative assist or general office roles. I would like to spend less time on my feet due to ongoing physio after a fall which left me with a dodgy knee (fingers crossed is slowly getting better).

I know it's not always so feasible (especially if your interests are very obscure)  but I really feel like it's bloody important to make every attempt to work in an area you're at least somewhat passionate about because not only will it make life considerably more pleasant but it will naturally also reflect in a better performance.

At the very least it's sickening that there are so many people who actively despise their job and feel a serpent in their stomach any time they think of it"

I work for a business process organization who provides service to a well known client. I work as a call center agent right now but genuinely do not like the position. I hate being on the phone and I‚Äôve been doing it for just over 2.5 years. I interviewed to become a team manager in august and although the position was given to a quality evaluator, I was told verbally that when another position becomes available, that they‚Äôd be happy to offer it to me. This is with the expectation perhaps if one current manager career paths, moves on, or quits or another business need arises

I was supposed to start training in September but they told me very last minute, on of September 6, to start September 8, and I wasn‚Äôt in the office to check my emails (can only check when working), and I called in due to feeling Ill. Hence I wasn‚Äôt able to do the training and missed out. I was told that she would have to see when and if she can enroll me in the next class. How bad does this look, if at all?

Is it fair if they take away this promise from me? Should I ask for this job offer in writing? When would you say it is reasonable to follow up? Since there were no stipulations set if or how this offer would be revoked, can they if my performance in my current role drops?

So I am grateful to be making money, but because of the current state of my mental health, I'm struggling in this job and being mostly alone all day. I guess I need to take advantage of this time and learn new skills, but being alone for most of the day is really taking a toll on me.

I'm 26, and know I have to sacrifice things and be an adult, but my mental health is still not great. I know a job doesn't equal happiness, but having no one to interact with all day really gets me down and makes me feel so very alone. I'm not sure what to do, I'm still looking for other jobs because I don't thrive in this quiet environment, it actually makes me feel like death, and I just crave connections with people.

Hi all, 

I always used to have pretty difficult trouble falling asleep and eventually it kind of just turned into me staying up late. 
now staying up is one of my favourite things. There‚Äôs little to no noise and I can just relax with no pressure or the anxiety I feel throughout the day doing normal things. I can also now fall asleep in a few minutes because I‚Äôm usually exhausted at that point which is a bonus for me.
I usually stay up till 6 am and wake up around 11:30 which is when I set an alarm to get up regardless of how long I slept, so I average about 5-6 hours of sleep.

So what could be potential jobs I could do from home? I currently only have a cert 4 in tourism. I also wouldn‚Äôt mind taking a short course/ classes to pursue a job that I could do at home for up to 16 months till I return to uni."

I received an interview for next Friday for a job that is 1 hr and 30 minutes away from where I live. I told them I would be willing to relocate for this position, which is still true.

However I saw another posting for the exact same job at the same company (and this position is permanent, other was temporary) that is only 20 minutes from where I live, so I wouldn‚Äôt have to relocate.

Is there any possibly that I can ask to have my application and/or interview transferred for the closer position? And how to bring it up with HR? The hiring manager is the same person for both positions. 

Thank you!"
5,2022-09-18,How to resign/quit after a week,u/No_Metal_4824,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xhp2ij/how_to_resignquit_after_a_week/,jobs,"To keep a long story short, I am planning on quitting my new job today. I've only been there for a week, and its really not going as I had expected. There are quite a few reasons why I can't stand to be there any longer, and I already have another job that I still work at (have been at this job for almost two years now) and I found this second job to make some more money as a college student. 

This new job is very understaffed (which I didnt know about until my first day working there) so I feel like I was also baited into working there, as they also gave me lead position right off the bat and told me I'd be getting paid more. (Mind you I also have never worked in this field before so I was very confused as to why I was offered the position so soon)

But when I walked into the job there were only four workers at the time, including me and two other managers, as well as an intern. And on my third day I was left in charge for the day, without being fully trained or informed of where everything is. And then my current pay rate is still the same as a regular employee's pay rate, so nothing has changed. 

I'm currently drafting a resignation letter, but Idk how to write that I don't wish to return on my next scheduled shift (which would be tomorrow, as I'd be working the entire week Monday - Friday) and apologize for leaving when it seems like they really don't have a lot of people."

I had many sleepless nights on how I threw away a good job and won't ever repeat this kindof careless behavior. But at the same time they never warned me and would neither listen to me now.
As for the comment on the woman. I tried asking but no luck..They won't tell me. Also I stopped pushing it or it could get documented and that's worse.

How do I explain to my new HRs on the situation? I thought of saying that it was difficult to manage that job with my studies and the manager was not okay with me working less.

1,2022-09-18,Feeling stuck at work and trying to figure out how to remain ready for next thing--internally or externally,u/Tenmaru45,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xhqtgi/feeling_stuck_at_work_and_trying_to_figure_out/,jobs,"Hi, don't really need a throwaway account here but I will be as vague as possible.

I'm feeling stuck at work and unsure what to do. I work for a large corporation and before COVID had a reasonably strong/certain promotion track. I was promoted to a higher level of management where I had about 40 employees between a mix of direct and indirect reports (supervisors and front-line workers). Now, after COVID, layoffs, and several restructures, I have a team of direct front-line workers, about 10. Furthermore, half of my team's work was spun out into another team, keeping my team's work very siloed. My title was then downgraded, although my performance is excellent and was only to better align the business.

In essence, I went from a lot of employees including mix of directs/indirects, to a small team of directs only, with less variation in work.

However, I had been doing a version of my ""current"" role for several years, and with my team size, plus half the work moved over to a different team, I have almost nothing to do on the daily. I manage my team so well (hence the pre-COVID promotion) that they rarely need me throughout the day. I have done some large special projects in the last 18 months to great accolades--but they were the skill level of projects I did 4-5 years ago. I am almost hidden in the work from home environment--because I am not needed to resolve issues (because I manage my team so well), I have people I have worked with off and on for years who don't even know I'm still in my role.

I am not challenged at all at work. I am not gaining new skills, such as managing other managers, which I was doing. My work is more restricted, so I am exposed to fewer areas. My current team does not really promote out or up, mostly because they are so specialized or just don't want to, so I don't have many promotions of others under my belt. Because I'm not gaining other skills, I feel like I'm less competitive internally. I volunteer for every project I can, but because of the restructure, there just really aren't any. This really scares me because situationally I don't feel like I have the skills to myself get into a different department to increase my career advancement. When I do mock interviews, my critiques are that my examples are from too far ago--but it is not my fault.

I was supposed to be up for a promotion but just found out it did not get in the budget so I'm at a loss there.

Any tips on how to get around this situation? And when do you know whether it's time to search outside of work?

Thank you."

I live in Vancouver BC, I'm 24 and I've been looking into working in the trades industry. Never worked in trades before and I made a short list of the ones I'm interested in:

\- Aviation / Heavy Duty / Automotive / Elevator Mechanic

\- Millwright

\- Machinist

\- Electrician

\- Instrumentation Technician

&amp;#x200B;

Some factors to consider:

\- How taxing is it on the body?

\- Pay

\- Work environment - I don't do great in heat but I understand it could potentially be part of the job

**ANY** insight on these trades. I also wouldn't mind working outside the city at all or to relocate.

Thank you in advance!

Edit: I'd like to add I've also considered joining the Military as a Pilot or IT/engineer (something that I can use outside).

It pays pretty well. The problem is that this company doesn't have any kind of professional branding‚Äîno logo, no website, no social media presence, and even the company name is just a placeholder. They have a physical office and a team of about 5-10 people, but I'm still a bit wary about accepting this position because it seems they are still in the extremely early stage of building a company. I met the founder and he's a nice enough guy, and I'll be reporting to the company's Head of Communications.

I'm still waiting on an offer this week from another company. I don't have many options, seeing as I'm very young and have no educational qualifications. But I still don't want to be in a position where I'm forced to do a ridiculous amount of work just for the company to go up in flames in a short time.

What do you guys think about this? Is it normal for a company to start recruiting when they don't even have a proper name?"

Back in school, I was a workaholic who did several degrees, jobs, and side-projects at the same time ‚Äì mostly Engineering and Science, including a PhD, plus an MBA.  Then for about 5 years since, I‚Äôve been focusing on solo-development of a major project pretty much 24/7 ‚Äì basically making a new type of AI.

Now I‚Äôm hoping to get a second job (with the solo-development being the first) ‚Äì ideally the sort of job someone would tend to hold as a full-time position.  And I‚Äôm going to have to convince potential employers that they‚Äôd want to hire me despite it being a second job \*\*and\*\* despite me not having been on a payroll in the past \~5 years.

To my advantage, I‚Äôve been doing some pretty crazy loads since undergrad very successfully ‚Äì and if I could explain that to a potential employer who was interested in me, then I‚Äôd feel confident about being able to sell it.  But first I‚Äôd need to get to that point, and I‚Äôm afraid that potential employers for the kind of work I‚Äôd be interested in might give my resume a pass if I don't find a way to inspire confidence.

Over the next few days, I‚Äôm probably going to start putting together my resume, looking around at what sorts of jobs are out there, figure out how to present myself, and probably post more questions here trying to get perspective.  So as I start this process‚Ä¶ any thoughts, suggestions, advice?  Basically trying to get grounded and find my bearings."

I am a newly graduated renewable energy engineer from Canada. I worked my ass off to get this degree and I was always told it was the future and that I would be getting amazing jobs left right and center.

So I started working for over a month now in a waste to energy company abroad. And I couldn't be more bored. I work in an office and since I am new they have me filling up excel sheets, compiling lists of clients, writing basic reports that my supervisor looks over and hands in.

Well, this definitely is not what I expected. I have 2 questions, firstly, do energy engineers ever go on site? I cannot stand working in an office for 9 hours a day, I really want to be able to work outdoors and see the construction happening instead of dealing with all this office work.

Secondly, I wouldn't mind that much office work if I was doing something challenging and was more in line with what I studied. such as designing, management, calculations and studies. So does it ever get more interesting? am I in the wrong field ? 

Sorry for such a loaded question, I am just a bit frustrated and bored and I've been questioning my choices as of late."

It's definitely a position I am well qualified for based on the (rather vague) job posting, and it is within my desired pay range. I had a preliminary interview in May 2022, and then I didn't hear back until August 2022, when they asked me to interview  only two days later. I was traveling in a rural area at the time and requested that we move the interview two days after so I could get somewhere with better connection for Zoom.

I had the interview, it wasn't my favorite. They asked questions that I didn't feel prepared for (I am typically very good at interviews and spend hours preparing) because the original job posting was so vague and the position had developed since they had posted it, so I wasn't basing my prep off of what had changed. The hotel wifi wasn't strong enough to support video, so that was also a bummer and detracted from the quality of the interview. I emailed the contact a few days after their notification timeframe and got a response that 'our team did not select you for further consideration.' But no further explanation; I thanked her and didn't request feedback on what could have improved my performance. This was end of August 2022.

My predicament: this is a position I know I have the qualifications for even though I am younger and perhaps slightly less experienced but I feel confident that I could do, but I didn't have a great interview for it. It's also a position which would be a step in the right direction for for young career which puts more emphasis on why I want it. The job posting is still ‚Äòactively recruiting‚Äô on the university career site, and based on how quickly they got in touch with me and how long it has been posted I have a feeling that they are struggling to find qualified applicants. **Question: could I email the interviewer and ask to be interviewed again? Or to be reconsidered?** I have no clue if this is an option, if it is uncouth, or if anyone has any recommendations for if or how I should go about pursuing this."

666,2022-09-19,"On Thursday, my boss asked if I could reschedule getting my marriage certificate for ""the needs of the business""",u/Cinemairwaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xif396/on_thursday_my_boss_asked_if_i_could_reschedule/,jobs,"I'm in full scorched Earth, ""fuck this place"" mode now, so I don't care about identifying information about myself or anything like that.

I work at a major tech company that's large and blue. I applied for a mainframe test technician apprenticeship in 2020, and started the job in April of 2021. Before that, I worked in radio for 10 years. I went to school for radio, I was on my college station for close to 3 years, and spent the rest of the time working at a local station. I started off producing commercials, imaging, anything that was needed to fill out the sound of the station, I did it. Eventually, I got the evening shift.

The reason I tell you this is because despite there being bad times, and there were plenty of them, the pay being shit, and there not being insurance with the position, I was still doing what I went to school for. I was doing what I was good at, and what I enjoyed doing.

Covid happens, my hours get cut down to 5 a week (just enough to record my show and go home), and eventually this isn't sustainable anymore. So I applied and got the job here, thinking ""this is a stable, well known company, it has benefits, the pay will be better, and I'll be treated with respect,"" boy was I fucking wrong.

Every end of the quarter (March, June, September &amp; December) are busy. This I know, I prepare for it, and I know that I'll have a lot of overtime and weekend work. It sucks because I enjoy seeing my family and friends, but whatever, comes with the territory.

This past week, my boss sends out an email basically saying we're gonna get slammed with work, all hands on deck needed due to ""needs of the business.""

My fiancee and I are getting married in October, so we're getting our marriage certificate soon. Problem is, the town clerks nearby all close at 3, and my fiancee works until 5 at a place that's an hour and a half away. So there's no way we can go during the week. The town clerk is doing us a favor by coming in this Saturday, and it's the only day she can do it. So that means it's the only day we can get our certificate before the wedding.

I tell my boss this, say that I can definitely be here Sunday, but Saturday I'm getting my marriage certificate. He makes a face like ""oh that's not gonna work for me,"" and says ""well what time is it? Can you come in after?"" ""10 am"" I say, he makes the same face as before. ""Well, can you reschedule it, we really need all hands, needs of the business and all.""

When I tell you I almost blew through the fucking roof, I seriously mean it. I was LIVID. I almost told him to go fuck himself and quit on the spot.

How dare he tell me that the company's business needs are more important than my fucking wedding, something that happens ONCE in a lifetime if you're lucky.

This place has been a miserable shithole from the minute I started here, everyone is either hyper conservative, questioning why I got my vaccine or wear a mask (I'm a diabetic you fucks, and you all are disgusting), coming in saying that Uvalde ""didn't happen,"" Sandy Hook ""didn't happen,"" being just plain fucking rude pieces of shit, and now they have the audacity to tell me that I should postpone getting my marriage certificate for the benefit of this almighty company? Fuck yourselves and this fucking company.

I emailed my boss this morning and told him that I'd work 6 to 9 am on Saturday and Sunday, like I told him last week, and he just says ""oh that's fine."" So my entire fucking weekend spent stressing over this shit BECAUSE OF HIM and now it's fine?

Seriously, if you ever get a job at a place, and you feel uneasy within the first week, quit. Do not stick with it, do not let people tell you it will get better. Go with your gut, because I didn't and I fucking regret it.

I'm really trying to get back into radio because I enjoyed the creativity, and, not to toot my own horn, but I was fucking good at it, I AM fucking good at it. And I have absolutely no interest or care in mainframe production. Couldn't give a single fuck.

Just needed to vent about this. Anyone know of any radio stations hiring full time with benefits in the Western CT/Westchester NY area, lemme know!"

He just started his position. Prior to that, he was a nursing administrator at another care home for 6 months. He got both positions through a small placement company he found through his church network.

He said he‚Äôs the CEO of the hospital and has to hide his age when people ask because he‚Äôs too young to be in that role. He also said he can make $300,000 a year, but he has to build up to it.

He studied physical therapy in an overseas university and was a self-employed trainer until he got the role. I asked around and heard from someone familiar with these church ‚Äúbacked‚Äù placement companies that administrator roles churn every 1-2 years.

Can someone familiar with US hospital administrators tell me if he‚Äôs being realistic?

EDIT: He said he‚Äôs ‚Äúbasically‚Äù the CEO with his responsibilities. He‚Äôs in charge of managing the whole place and turning it around from collapsing."

I have been at a company for about a year and a half now. I was working 7 days a week like a dog for way too damn long. I‚Äôm now Mon-Fri 8-5 but some weekend work. It‚Äôs a start up, I naturally knew things would be fast paced. My main management this entire time has been my boss, who often would look to me for advice on things when this is like‚Ä¶ my first job. I joined when I was about 22/21, I am 23 now. I was never taught managerial skills. I feel like I never even really had a manager myself. 

My team loves me and said I am very helpful and great at training. In the last month I was promoted to a manager because I do my work and I‚Äôm good at what I do (as much as I can be). There is a lot of disorganization at the company, like my boss tells me 50 things to do in a meeting off the fly and I‚Äôm already doing the job of more than one person. I finally got someone to help me, so I manage 2 people and then comanage another team of about 8 people. 

I got grilled by my boss today, and I could tell they were trying to catch me not doing well on my job and some investigating on ‚Äúhow things are going as manager‚Äù. Like trying to catch receipts of me failing or not doing certain things. I can tell they feel like they need to direct me a little on certain things, but they‚Äôre things that I was never told or trained on. I‚Äôve never been a manager before, and the people I manage are my age or older so I try my best to not be too domineering in the team. But it‚Äôs hard to lead a team when things are coming at me sort of as a surprise to add to everyone‚Äôs work load.

But it‚Äôs hard when my boss tells me all these things that I was not under the impression of to start doing or incorporating into the team. Example, my boss and I will be on the same page that we don‚Äôt have coverage on certain things on the weekend. But randomly today, they act like this was never discussed and I need to find someone to cover certain things on the weekend. But it‚Äôs confusing, because my boss has said we need to move slow with adding more responsibilities of things to other people. 

Or that I need to really be checking xyz, which adds to the mountain of things that simply not everything can be done. Even with delegating. There‚Äôs just constant moving parts. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this doesn‚Äôt make sense but I‚Äôm trying to keep my job details more private. 

Any advice? I already work a bit on weekends that even with that it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm never doing enough. Or that I somehow fall short. The pressure makes me already lose motivation. Even on my vacations I get coerced into work. My sleep and stress levels are not okay."

I received a much better one in every way possible that I intend to accept.

Basically I was connected with this employer through a friend of a friend, and generally considered them to have good judgement. I scheduled what I thought was an informational interview with them, which ended up turning into a surprise job interview for a position I hadn't read about yet, and then a job offer. Thought it was one of those serendipitous job hunt stories you hear about until they told me about salary and job criteria.

They reluctantly agreed to give me time to think it over, sent me the formal letter, and I was genuinely appalled at some of the stuff in it. I'm not super familiar with the Canadian Labour Code, but pretty sure they were breaking some laws with respect to vacation days, vacation pay, sick days, etc. For example, they were offering 10 personal days that could be used as sick days or for personal needs, including bereavement or compassionate care leave. My understanding is that you are entitled to 10 sick days specifically for personal illness/injury and that bereavement leave, personal days, etc. are supposed to be separate things you are entitled to. I could be mistaken but that's what I understood from my research into the Labour Code. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

As I mentioned, I'm not taking the job. But it bugs me that that they are even offering this. Did their current staff read their job offers before signing on? Do they realize that there are potentially some things that go against federal law? Do I reach out to them to look into their contracts in more detail and report it? Do I contact the friend of the friend and ask them if this was their experience or ask how they dealt with it? Do I inform the employer in my declining email that what they offered is unacceptable?

TL;DR - Job offer contained some potentially illegal stuff. Do I say something and, if so, who do I say it to? I don't want to burn bridges, but I don't want to be complicit in people being taken advantage of.

Edit - Still very new to the job hunt (finished grad school 4 months ago), so I'm unsure what is considered proper etiquette or expected in these situations."

I have a wedding I need to plan for and my dogs at home, and just thinking about where I need to take them every week is just another burden on my shoulders again. My partner and I were hoping to start a family soon as well, and having to travel is a burden to us all. 

I was really expecting flexibility with this role in regards to working from home, but it seems like the culture with the group is to be at the office long hours and ‚Äúworking remote‚Äù is for business purposes only. My previous job was remote to where you could show up to the office whenever or work from home. No questions asked. Everyone embraced it and we all still collaborated even better. We hit record numbers while working remote as well. 

Within the first week of starting new role, I was reached out from a company I had interviewed over a month ago, for an opportunity. This company I know is full remote since I have a friend who works there. More PTO but only a 15% salary increase from the first role. 

I‚Äôve spoken to some colleagues, and they said I owe 6 months of work to this new company since I started to not burn bridges and a formality. But now I have this other job opportunity that I really like and wanted that arrived a bit late. 

I guess it‚Äôs not a matter of if I should leave or not, but should I give this company a full 2 weeks, or just a week (or even a couple of days) since I still haven‚Äôt been with the company long enough to benefit them? I‚Äôm scared to bring it up, but it‚Äôs not what I had originally expected the job to be, and I know I don‚Äôt owe them loyalty if I‚Äôm realizing the role is not a fit for me."

Here are things that I am perceiving at my workplace:

- other people mistreat me, telling me to do stuff like ‚Äúgo to the office to adjust the computer camera‚Äù or they give me really simple tasks and say stuff like ‚Äúthis is really easy‚Äù.  I feel like I get treated like an idiot.  I see the other coworkers being chummy with each other but when it comes to me, they treat me differently (I‚Äôll explain at the end). 

- I get completely disregarded in small meetings (what is the point of having me there if I‚Äôm not contributing any bit to the discussion?)

- I try really hard to help my coworkers.  Questions?  I try to answer if I know it.  Assist with stuff.  Meanwhile, I see my coworkers are pretty toxic to each other and people from other departments.   I hate that.  

- my technical lead blatantly ignores me in meetings/chat discussions when I bring up my work and issues thats relevant to my work that he assigns me.  He‚Äôll tell someone else to do the work instead of assigning it to me.  He keeps asking me for updates on the same 1 task and when I give him updates on how I have an issue, he blatantly ignores it.  I have stopped responding to him.  I‚ÄôM DONE!

-  my manager constantly skips out on 1-on-1‚Äôs with me.   Its super frustrating because right now, I am done with my coworkers.  And he doesn‚Äôt know about my frustrations.

Overall, I feel that my coworkers treat me with disrespect and don‚Äôt acknowledge as someone who can meaningfully contribute to the team.  Meanwhile, I see other coworkers who have been at the company for less time than i have and are same job position but they get more important tasks.  I feel that part of their bias is that they think I'm dumb because my degree isn't the same as theirs.  

I've read that a job should be treated as just a job.  But I feel that my situation is too toxic and would require me to suppress my negative emotions in order to reduce my depressive episodes and overall sadness/misery (I've already been depressed and sad MANY times since being at this company) 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated as i'm at my wits end.

EDIT:  I also want to add that I don't want to be toxic like my coworkers.  I genuinely like helping people."

I've been browsing this subreddit and other subreddits like r/retailhell trying to figure out if there is a way to get out of retail jobs as thats the only jobs i've been working since I was 18 and im 23 now with no degree and only a highschool diploma. Most of my coworkers are in school and I live in a college town so thats most peoples ""way out"" to keep them hanging in there, but lately this is all I have going for me. 

I am still currently working a retail job as a sales floor stocker which basically all I do is tell customers where things are, if we have it in stock, how much things cost, organize or pick up after customers make things look pretty and restock the sales floor. I'll back up on register or in other departments at times but thats about the gist of what I do or have done as most retail jobs I've worked at with about a little almost 4 years of experience between all my jobs combined with my current one I've been working almost a year and my previous retail store about 2 years.

It's been overwhelming but I've just grown tired of being in the ""retail trap"" and feel like its really affecting my mental health, a lot of things feel out of my control, my boss doesn't respect my work life balance nor has any of my retail bosses, I get talked down to or dismissed if I bring up any concerns or reasoning why things are not getting done, or even if I finish job task or try to go above and beyond I don't get any satisfaction from my boss and something else just gets cherry picked to scold me about. I feel like I just can't win and I'm damned no matter what I do. On top of that I find myself doing the work of multiple people and getting paid the same rate to do it, if someone quits I just get cross trained and no one gets hired on which adds on to my stress. Lately I also just the fear that this is all I'm ever gonna be or become the managers I hate so much stuck here, or just like the other elderly workers here who didn't even get promoted and still have the rank of entry salesfloor workers. I had a similar experience happening at my last retail job where this was happening with my mental and I basically ended up quitting and going into a dark mental rut where I stayed in bed all day for about 4 months, so I'm also scared I'm gonna go back to that place again soon if this keeps up.

Upon reading around I've read that office admin, book keeping or data entry, as well as receptionist or office clerk are good options to look into but I was wondering if anyone else had any other suggestions as someone who's maybe been in my similar position or looking from the outside?"

I'm in the final stretch of negotiations for a job for the US government. I was given a verbal offer contingent on reference checks. I tried to get a signed letter but they insist on reference checks first. I really want the job so I need to navigate this last process carefully.
My company does not know I am looking to leave.

My current company has a policy where HR can only provide verification of my role and start dates.

The prospective employer intends to contact my HR for this verification. I understand this puts me in a vulnerable position where HR will learn that I am looking around and I won't have a confirmed offer letter yet. I want this new job enough to be okay with that BUT if I can prevent my bosses from finding out before I'm ready to resign, that would be best.

For those in this position, did you warn your HR to expect a call or just let it happen? Did HR end up telling your supervisor? Should I bite the bullet and tell both HR and my supervisor about this reference check? Maybe just HR?

TL;DR do I warn HR about a workplace verification call from my prospective employer or no?"

It certainly doesn't help that I'm rather competitive by nature and graduated at the top of my class (so the expectations were high). 

But now I actually feel stuck in my career and $50,000/year job. I'm a graphic/web designer/content writer with 5 1/2 years of marketing experience at an agency that works with a few prominent clients in the area. 

I'm in the process of looking for a higher-paying job, but it's been difficult so far. I interviewed and got offered a new job recently only to find out in the end that the salary is the same as my current job. So I sadly had to turn it down since they absolutely didn't have the budget to pay more. 

My partner makes 4x-5x the money that I do in a year (he's in the medical field). I'm kind of crying inside thinking maybe I chose the wrong career. I'm good at what I do and have always been, but at the same time, I've always wanted a job that brings in lots of money. My dream since I started taking this career path has been to be a creative director of a large company, perhaps a Fortune 500 company. 

Also, we move around because of his job and opportunities, but I don't think the locations we've been at are ideal for my job. So I kind of feel stuck in a crisis and feel like I'm just ""tagging along"". 

Has anyone ever felt this way and how did you come out of it? Any general advice so that I can keep my hopes up? Thank you."

3,2022-09-19,Put Up For Promotion and Then...,u/CalligrapherRecent36,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xir5l0/put_up_for_promotion_and_then/,jobs,"Bear with me this is a long story and thank you in advance for reading! ..

I started at my company April 2021 with the title ending ""associate analyst"" taking a 7k paycut from my previous job was Data Analyst. I had been referred by a friend and I was really desperate to start working again because I lost my job due to covid in March 2020. Anyways I liked the team and the work seemed good too but, my manager gets a better opportunity 4 months into me being there and my peer (been there 1 year before me) ends up becoming my manager. At first I'm skeptical cause he's never managed anyone before and of course who wants someone your own age to manage you? He ends up being super relatable, flexible with work hours, and overall very supportive, so I like him. Our team is being built out by the VP over 2021 and 2 new analysts get added to the team - one of which has the same job responsibilities and same title (associate analyst). The other is an analyst working on something different. I have my review in April '22 and my manager says I'm exceeding expectations and that my promotion cycle is coming up in July so he will put in a promotion for me. The associate analyst who is my equal quits in April '22 and I take back all her work (which I did before she started). 

I didn't think much of the ""associate"" title until May 2022 when we add another person to our team who starts as an analyst (also doing something different). Around the same time, I thought I'd be promoted to Sr Analyst since I am clearly capable for that role. My manager tells me the next level for me is Analyst. At the same time this is happening, the VP quits and my team ends up changing so I get pulled to a subteam with my manager and the new analyst, and the other sub team is another manager from a different department and the analyst who started in 2021. The new director of our team pulls up an org chart and I am the only ""associate"" analyst who has been here the longest and has the technical skills (salesforce report building, looker, sql). I feel as if I can be a Sr Analyst, but my manager told me jumping 2 levels from associate to senior would be hard, I said to give me a senior analyst description so I can compare the expectations. Of course that takes ages even though I follow up twice, so it's not even an option at this point. The analyst who started in 2021 and I are now supposed to be equals/counterparts according to the director - we would be Data Analyst and Associate Data Analyst, respectively. Doing the same work I was handling, except splitting up the teams we provide reporting for. If we are equals, then I should be able to change my title to Data Analyst? And I also found out the Data Analyst makes 20k more than me, so I suggested our salaries to be matched for a promotion. My manager says that he will put a promotion in for me because he received great feedback from teams I worked with, and says the usually increase is 2-3% but I ""put in a significant increase but I can't tell you because I'm not sure if it will be approved"". 

Of course, at the same time I'm tired of doing all the work and then other people getting the easy way so I had been applying to other roles. All of the above had been happening from May to August (and since my promotion cycle started in July 1, they said Sept 15th paycheck would be with retroactive till then), so by Aug I'm like why haven't we heard jack shit about whether promotions are approved or when we expect it to be communicated?? I end up getting a job offer from a different company and it did not seem feasible for my company to match the salary, so I accepted. I tell my boss I accepted a job and he asked how much so he could see if he could expedite the promotion. He said I made the right move and said that he wanted mine and the other Data Analysts salary to be matched (which meant a 20k raise), which is what he put in for my promotion. I send in my resignation at the end of August which was more than 2 weeks notice because I was going on vacation that was planned way before, and I didn't want to give my notice while on vacation cause that seems rude. Even though I planned to leave, I still wanted that retroactive pay because it would. I was about to leave for vacation that was planned way before this and when I came back for my last 2 days of work, I saw an email of everyone who got promoted and guess who wasn't on there? Me!! But who did get promoted? My manager, the director, and my managers counterpart. Not that he doesn't deserve it, but my manager became Sr even though they all said to me a Sr Analyst description wasn't firm and that no one would be getting that title this year. Also why did no one tell me when this shit got approved or not approved? Obviously, I did not get extra money in that last paycheck either. So I have a word with my manager and he said ""I believe they took you off the list because they saw you resigned."" I literally put it in 3 days before it was approved so of course I'm pissed I lost out on $$$. I talked to HR, my director, and my manager and they basically said what my manager told me, and that the approval process took longer than expected to BS. HR also said that it's NOT impossible to be promoted 2 levels, only if there is a need for a senior analyst on the team. What the hell does that even mean? It's just so unfair they base this off of a couple days of resignation instead of rewarding me for the good work I've done in the past 1.5 years. 

My boss told me I should've waited for the promotion to be approved which ended up being 2+ months after the promotion cycle started, but I was on a timeline to accept the job offer and there's no way they would've waited 2 weeks for that. I'm not sure if there's anything else I can do now but open to advice. Thank you again for reading this novel!"

Last month, in a moment of rage after a meeting where I was openly insulted, I submitted my resignation. I quoted work/Life balance as the reason and honestly I didn‚Äôt have a job lined up. My manager accepted at that time but had a conversation with me a couple of days later asking me to reconsider. I was already panicking at the thought of not having a paycheck and agreed to stay.
Well, about 2 weeks back I got a call for one of the positions that I applied to during that time and got through all 4 rounds pretty quickly and actually got a solid offer‚Ä¶which I accepted today. I haven‚Äôt told my manager yet and I‚Äôm dreading the conversation. I need to quit by tomorrow. Ultimately, the new job is best for me if I think rationally but I feel like I‚Äôm betraying my manager.

2,2022-09-19,"Job is ""considering"" changing me from exempt to non-exempt, am I getting screwed over/what can I do?",u/DwindlingOptimism,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xitm5y/job_is_considering_changing_me_from_exempt_to/,jobs,"I just started a new admin job at a university at the end of August, so it's just about week 3 for me. Base salary of 48k.

HR gives me an email today asking to chat, and during the said call, they said that they are considering switching me from exempt to non-exempt on the basis that my job description is unclear as to whether I'm managerial/independent in nature or more assistive. They asked what I thought; it was hard for me to say as I'm still training but I mentioned the expectation was for me to be more independent as I settled in. The notice comes from higher up than them and apparently my boss nor department head knows that they are considering this; HR must meet with them and have them fill out paperwork of some sort.

The reclassification would mean I am now paid hourly (eligible for overtime but according to colleagues and through my interview process, we work overtime maybe 1 or 2 weeks out of the year). HR did not explicitly tell me my hourly rate, or if I still get paid on school holidays (roughly 14 days where offices are closed, and offices additionally close early the day prior to breaks).

I would also go from 20 vacation days a year to 10, and my retirement match bonus is lowered from 5 or 6% to 2 or 3%. In other words, the net effect is that  I am making overtime one week out of the year, and in exchange, I have a fairly hefty chunk of benefits, and possibly money taken from me.

This job was such a godsend as I'd been hunting for well over 18 months prior, so I know I'm lucky to have it. However, I can't help but feel like I got hit with a huge bait-and-switch, as my job offer sheet explicitly says exempt and salaried, and it was a fairly large reason why I chose the job.

I'm wondering if they are truly considering the option or if the writing is on the wall for the reclassification. Considering they must also talk with my boss later this week, I'm wondering if it's appropriate to also sit down with them and express that this is hugely upsetting and the expectations I had when I accepted this position. HR mentioned that a re-re classification is possible, but I'm also wondering if that is nearly impossible to force or initiated.

At the end of the day, I'm unsure if I am overreacting and overthinking, but my gut tells me that this university is kinda scummy for this, and I'd consider going back into job searching following a reclassification."

I love everything about the team and the work. However, one month ago my company said that all employees are expected to return back to the office 3 days a week. I currently very much value being remote as I was planning to move closer to family. Once they made the announcement, I started responding to recruiters who messaged me on LinkedIn as a backup plan in case my manager could not negotiate with management to get me remote status.

I started interviewing with a couple other companies while my manager was in the approval process. Last week, my manager said that I was approved to go remote. Today, I just got an offer for $20k more, higher bonus, and equity. I was blown away by this company's offer, but feel absolutely horrible for leaving my company only 2 months after getting my internal transfer promotion especially after my manager worked so hard to get me able to be remote (which was the whole reason I started looking in the first place). Additionally, several people on my team have left within the past couple of weeks. Does anyone have any experience with this? I am very concerned that this will look bad to future employers, and will leave a bad last impression of me on my current employer."

I originally wanted to give 30 days notice, but was convinced by my boss to stay longer to allow them more time to identify a replacement and help train the eventual new hire and my colleagues in transition.

I am leaving because:
* I dislike my job (as in what I do, I don‚Äôt plan to stay in this field), 
* have poor work boundaries (I am a people pleaser and have a hard time saying no or asking for help, but I‚Äôm working on it lol), 
* feel burnt out and depressed, 
* have a long commute (I am in my car a minimum of two hours each day), and 
* am underpaid‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve also learned that they are advertising my job as two jobs, go figure. 

In the time that remains, my boss wants me to create a training guide with a timeline of every step that needs to be completed with step by step instructions for the whole year, while also training my colleagues in case they don‚Äôt find a replacement in time, as well as completing all my usual projects and assignments. So if it felt busy before‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

In addition, despite compromising by extending my departure date from one month to two, my boss has repeatedly made comments to make me feel guilty, such as ‚Äúyou clearly don‚Äôt care‚Äù or ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt understand the pressure you‚Äôve put on me‚Äù or ‚Äúwhoever comes in won‚Äôt have the benefit of being trained like you were‚Äù (to clarify my predecessor retired and gave a 7-month notice). They also don‚Äôt want me sharing that I‚Äôm leaving, so outside of our office no one is allowed to know. 

This job has been nothing but stressful and filled with anxiety since I first took it on, and I‚Äôm glad that I‚Äôve finally taken a step to remove myself from an environment that has felt toxic this last year. My friends and family have been extremely supportive of my taking this step, but I could still use some advice on how to deal with the last six weeks. Despite the guilt trip and sometimes accusatory remarks, I don‚Äôt want to leave my colleagues, the office, or even my boss in the lurch. This job has taught me a lot and helped me grow in ways I never would have imagined, but I‚Äôm also not willing to extend my time further. There are days when that light at the end of the tunnel is the only thing getting me through the work day. 

I know this post is a bit long and vague, but I would appreciate any advice to help me endure the last six weeks. Thank you.

Edit: fixed two typos, there may be more, but it‚Äôs late lol"

Yesterday a woman asked me a personal question about a decision and I said I didn't want to talk about my options at work because people take hear-say as truth and it would be damaging, so she screamed at me it was because I couldn't make a decision because I was useless and weak and then stormed out of the office for an hour to cool down.  This  woman is being let off in a couple of weeks because she doesn't do work.  

And today another woman locked the office door while she laughed at the fact that I was stuck there and called me stupid and useless.  And then proceeded to try and get the office to laugh at me because I was stupid.  She also illegally gave my personal number out to a new colleague falsely advising her I was lazy and hadn't filled out my timesheet and it was my colleague's job to be the boss of me.  She knew I was on sick leave at the time, and it was her job to fill it out.  But she took advantage of the situation.

The other is continuously rude and demeaning to people with intent and always approaches everyone with rants about how powerful she is.  I've never proceeded with a bullying complaint because I always try to reconcile, however I do want to move forward with this.  Has anyone successfully got someone fired for a bullying complaint who can offer advice? There is a high level of bullying in this environment and its tolerated because the other staff are ethnic minorities who are used to being kicked around.  Does removal of a bully reset the workplace?"

I have been given a week before my trial day. I will be shadowing the manager at another of the owner's stores and deciding whether or not this was a company I wanted to work for. Honestly... even if I found something wrong with it I'd still go for this just for the pay BUT I promised him I would think hard about this position and come to him with any questions/concerns. He wants to make sure we are absolutely certain about me working here so he wants to communicate as much as possible before we pull the plug on my other job.

The position would be store manager of a pet supply store. The nitty gritty of it is that the last store manager fucked shit up, the employees are unmotivated and resentful and sales have plummeted. I have my work cut out for me but I like it that way. This was EXACTLY what I was looking for.

But what should I be keeping an eye out for? What should I be thorough about? What questions would impress him? Thanks in advance!"

So Tuesday of the following week I called them back and asked about the status of my interview, they said they had a few more that day and would let me know, same thing never did. 

What do I do?, I feel crazy I really want the job it's perfect, good hours, overtime if need be and room for advancement. 

I've looked into other companies in my area and really there are three big ones, the one I'm at, the one I applied for and another that people claim they don't pay enough.

 I would work for a slightly smaller company but in my line of work most smaller companies are contract work

Am I crazy if I just keep calling every couple of weeks?, Can I go to their office and ask them again about a job?. I feel like a crazy stalker.

 I know that the answer is obvious but I am **not trying to make a long-lasting career**, I just want a decent job that can help me save money and open a business.

I went for an interview for a trainee positing after graduating from university. The HR team told me they had a team of people who specialised in my field. I thought it was a great opportunity.

Turns out they only had one person who could teach me the very basics of that field, and they never have the time of day to teach me any of the things they promised in the interview. So I've had to teach everything myself, whilst having stupidly tight deadlines.

To make it even worse, other employees seem to get mad at me when I don't quite understand something. And throw around the line ""we'll you tell me, you're the expert"" despite telling them I'm an intern/trainee.

This job has made me not want to pursue a career in this field, and I want to leave.

However, I've been applying to so many different places and jobs to get something better and currently I haven't had many offers. The offers I do get are for jobs I know I will hate.

It's having a toll on my mental health and I feel like I'm just wasting my life. I'm not sure what I can do. I've been applying to many places but I haven't heard back from the majority of them

I've also tried reaching out to a careers expert, but haven't heard from them either.

40,2022-09-20,Should I give in two-weeks notice or just quit? Feeling conflicted.,u/antizoilist,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xj7nim/should_i_give_in_twoweeks_notice_or_just_quit/,jobs,"Hi all. I need some advice on this because I can‚Äôt stand my job anymore, and want out. 

I have been working as a caregiver at a homecare agency for 3 years, and it‚Äôs been an okay experience, but not the best. Upon hiring me, they threw me onto a case without telling me the plan of care, without telling me the conditions of my client, and other important details. That was a red flag to me, but I let it go. From then on, they put me on client to client, paying $12.50/hr. 

This client I currently have, a woman in her 70s, is insufferable. And I‚Äôm the only one working this case with my client so it feels as though all her care is completely up to me. And while I have a high level of patience and compassion for the job and for my clients, I feel like I‚Äôm at my wits end here. 

My client has told me, ‚ÄúIf you leave me, I‚Äôll be devastated,‚Äù and has made comments about not wanting me to go on vacation or me picking up more hours. This is all while she has been very rude and sometimes nasty to me when she‚Äôs in a bad mood. I feel drained every time I come home from work. 

I just want to leave. Should I put in a two-weeks notice, or just quit?"
2,2022-09-20,Stressed out all the time,u/Calvin_Hobbes1430,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xj7q1l/stressed_out_all_the_time/,jobs,"I started a new job last December and thought it would be a good fit and something I would enjoy. As time has gone on I've realized they weren't entirely truthful about the duties of the job and now I'm overwhelmed and working OT all the time. When I've brought this up to my manager he acts dumbfounded that with only two projects I'm feeling this way (they've been been giving me small projects then started to bring on more and more complex one's along with more projects period). Problem is the training wasn't the best, the job itself is more complex than they let on and everyone I talk to is working OT all the time and even logging on during the weekends to get work done. This is not what I expected at all and I even said in the interview that I consider work/life balance high on my priority list. I'm getting nervous that I'm not going to be able to handle this job and that they'll let me go. I can feel myself having anxiety all the time and this morning I felt the familiar pangs of queasiness knowing all the work I have to do (I had a job in the past that turned into a nightmare).   
This company expects you to get the job done and projects should not stall because of anything on our part. Which makes sense as to why people are working a LOT of OT. I've started applying to other positions and even had an interview late last week. But this isn't helping my fears that my boss will feel I can't do the job and let me go before then. It's impacting my sleep and life and I'm lost as to what to do. Anyone else been in this position and how did you handle it?"

So then I went to his office and told him I'm out, I'll stay till he founds someone else (although I could just fuck off and let him deal with it) but this isn't working. I basically feel like I've been so discouraged that I've lost all my confidence. I told him I feel like I do everything wrong, he said I'm not, I'm doing well.

I would be fine financially if I had to take job for a year, but I am not sure if I should roll the die. What is the best thing to do?"

All this to say, I'm not really sure how to go about it from here. Do I just go in for my shift today and hope my store manager is here so I can tell her? Do I have to tell my store manager specifically or can it just be the MOD and they'll pass it on? Idk, help please lol."

Back on the upswing now, but I‚Äôm considering moving out before getting a job because I don‚Äôt think the situation I‚Äôm in right now is very good for me or my mental health. I want to re-enter the nonprofit field (i have a few year volunteer experience) but I‚Äôm getting more &amp; more worried that after I move out I‚Äôll get stuck waiting to hear back and run out of money (I have $17k saved up but I‚Äôd ideally like to not lose it all). 

One family member thinks that this is what I need to do to get back to working, the other thinks I‚Äôm an idiot and will fail, and has told me over &amp; over how stupid I am for considering this. I‚Äôm honestly getting too anxious over the consequences of either choice, so I‚Äôm here on Reddit to get advice &amp; anecdotes from the internet.

**edit #1:** i should‚Äôve been more clear, I‚Äôm considering get an hourly job somewhere like at target when I first move to provide proof of employment to a landlord &amp; continue applying to the field I want from there. I‚Äôm staying in an Airbnb the first month I move out so I can also view apartments as I‚Äôm moving to a different city. Also, I do have others who can co-sign for me &amp; I‚Äôm looking at getting roommates.

**edit #2:** this will likely be my last edit, I‚Äôve been thinking on some of the issues brought up in the comments, especially the possibility of running out of money, and I‚Äôve reworked my plan a bit. I‚Äôm considering giving the attempted move 2-3 months in an airbnb, and if I really don‚Äôt hear back on anything, I‚Äôll move back in with family &amp; reconsider my plan &amp; expectations. Also, I called another family member about the issue &amp; told them there‚Äôs a real possibility that I‚Äôll fail, but they ended up scolding me a bit and telling me to stop doubting myself. They brought up that, while I was in college, several of my friends died, some in front of me &amp; by their own hand, and this family member reminded me that in the aftermath of those events, I still ran the clubs, the volunteer events, and the petition/rallying work while being in school full time &amp; working part time on the side. There were other obstacles as well, but they brought this up to help remind me of the type of worker I am, and even if my job is being a full time job hunter, I‚Äôm going to do everything in my power to make it work. 

I know this isn‚Äôt the update people wanted to hear, and I‚Äôll try to provide another in the future letting all of you know how it turned out, but I‚Äôm going to give it a shot, even though it probably is a terrible idea. 

Thanks to everyone who commented, they did factor in to my decision and help me think through the possible outcomes &amp; talk them over with others. Hope everyone has a good day/night, and wishing you guys all the best."

I interviewed at places much closer to me, but was rejected.

I have a good car, but it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs great in the snow, so winters have me worried. Also the traffic could be a nightmare‚Ä¶

But I have this gut feeling I should take it.

Advice?",u/DarlingDarklord,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xjgq1k/i_messed_up_my_life_but_i_want_to_fix_it_advice/,jobs,"Okay so this is my first post. I doubt anyone will see it but its worth a shot! So I 20(F) have had a rocky relationship with school and work. A little backstory: I dropped out of high school at 16 and went to get my GED in a college setting, after obtaining my GED I thought I knew what I wanted to do in life so I tried to go to college for a two-year degree. This ended horribly because this wasn't the path I wanted to take for a lifelong career but it was too late to change my educational path... so out of stress and being 16 at the time, I dropped out and started working. I have worked in fast food and restaurant settings along with retail since I was 16. It has taken a large toll and I suffer with back issues which makes it even more difficult to complete day-to-day tasks. I always think that there's a better opportunity out there and so i chase that, which has led to many failed attempts and me quiting my fair share of jobs some of which i regret leaving now. Truthfully I'm tired, all I want is a stable career at an office or desk but without a degree of some sort to show I have the education necessary to get a career i feel like this is an impossible task.. Instead  I'm left working dead in jobs that make me feel depressed and take a horrible toll on me physically. It's not that im lazy either, these jobs just take every ounce of energy out of me and make me feel stagnant in my life. Almost a sense of ""if I don't fix it now I'll never be able to fix it"" which has led to an insane amount of stress and pressure to take any job that offers more money or slightly better benefits. Now with all of the backstory and knowing how I feel about my situation, here is the question that I want to ask.. how can I possibly change my career without having a college degree? What steps can I take to pursue a desk job or an office job? How do I find a career that isn't a dead end for me? A path that motivates me instead of making me anxious and depressed.I know that I'm young and the possibility of going back to school is not out of the question but right now financially I can't afford to pay off debt and maintain bills at the same time. I'm looking for some easy steps that could possibly lead me in a more paperwork oriented job without having the experience?Any advice is truly appreciated if anybody is even seeing this post !!"

My past managing job I was the general manager and the place was very abusive. Now today I‚Äôve been terminated from a new job after 6 months.

1,2022-09-20,don't think I'm being paranoid... Webstaurant Store,u/AtlasDrugged-,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xjhlke/dont_think_im_being_paranoid_webstaurant_store/,jobs,"Hey there,

A few weeks back I applied for a remote photo editor job at Webstaurant Store, an online retailer that sells supplies to restaurants. The pay was good, the benefits were good, and I could be at home. Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for.  
I was invited to interview via Wire, a chat program that I had never heard of, and from here on out there were flags of all different colors throughout my interactions.

First of all, it was less of an interview and more of a Q and A. My ""interviewer"" Tyler was responding in strange ways, repeating whole phrases, and asked me to complete my answers to his questions with ""DONE.""  
I did this, and then made a correction/edit to an answer and let him know in the chat - and I got no response. I suspect this was a bot and was meant to respond to certain keywords and when I followed up ""DONE"" with another sentence that threw it off.  
Anyway, I had to go to a doctor appointment which I had made clear before our ""Meeting"" and had to leave, emailing their ""recruiter"" apologizing profusely.  
Later that day I talked to ""Tyler"" again and asked if we could reschedule and he couldn't seem to understand.   
Anyway, the next day the rest of the ""interview"" went fine and the following week I received an offer which I signed, and a direct deposit sheet, which I also filled out. Then I was told I would need a separate phone for this job. Fine no problem, that makes sense. They told me a specific model that they wanted ME to buy, and said they had a vendor that they needed me to send the money to via zelle to get the phone at a better deal. The email they wanted me to send the money to was not associated with their company, a gmail, not an @ webstaurantstore or anything like that.

I was feeling more guarded now, and almost as soon as I entered the zelle info into my bank account I got locked out. No specifics were given, but I went to my local branch today and they said tons of red flags were present for fraud, including that gmail address that was given to me.

Long story short, I closed all my bank accounts, will not be pursuing this job any further, and possibly reporting them.  
Anyone have similar experiences, with this company or not?"

I HATE THIS JOB.  Ready to resign. 6 years working here. 

Job includes medical and great benefits. 

Family owns a business. I want to jump ship and take over and run the business. Successful btw. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and character. Working for someone else doesn‚Äôt satisfy me whatsoever. I work mon-fri 7-12pm and Saturday‚Äôs at family business. Sundays off 

Girl friend doesn‚Äôt want me to resign. At least just yet. She said to wait a year. She has a corporate job. Great career ahead of her. She also has her benefits and all other good stuff. 

I still want to work but not for this entity. I want to work for myself and family. 

How can I make her understand that I am no longer capable of working there for another year. I simply hate my current situation. F*** the 20k raise screw the benefits and all that bs. Life is too short to be miserable. I want to be happy. I‚Äôm heavily invested into the stock market as well. I‚Äôm up in my investments.

I work in the tax department for a big software company. The company has completed a restructuring and the new management has given 3 weeks notice for RTO 5 days a week. 

I am not opposed to a hybrid model or popping in and out of the office occasionally during the week, but Mon-Fri seems overkill. I am not far from the office so the commute doesn‚Äôt worry me that much. As a salary employee who has been able to work at home with such flexible hours, why the hell would I want to commit to 9-5 and then go home with my WFH office still set up? Do they expect me to still be available to work after hours too after committing 8 hours in the office? I am losing such flexibility and balance at home with the expectation to commit the time during normal working hours. 

I have just been in this position for 1 year and still have a lot to learn, but I am not sure if I have learned enough to apply for another similar job (or something different entirely) without taking a paycut. I am not sure if I should stick it out and see how it all unfolds as there may be some disgruntled employees or test the waters and go elsewhere.

Any advice or experiences are much appreciated."

Can a startup usually recover from cutting staff to reduce burn rate ? Or is the beginning of the end for most startups ?

I‚Äôm just considering if I should keep working long hours with an understaffed team or if I should just move on and find another successful place to work ?

If the management made already the rational decision of cutting their staff to reduce burn rate, they will likely not have enough money to grow the team and give me a pay rise for the next 6-7 months or 1-2 yrs if I decide to invest more time in them.

Essentially I will be financing their startup by sacrificing time and money with the risk of being part of a failed project.

My position is in high demand in the current market and I‚Äôm receiving offers that will pay over 30% more than my current role.

Should I just leave immediately ?
Is it rational to stay in a failing startup ?

My motivation is extremely low and most of my colleagues are looking for another job too."
4,2022-09-20,Would you take a pay cut?,u/peneloperobinson,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xjjqsn/would_you_take_a_pay_cut/,jobs,"Today, I was offered a job at a place I really wanted to work for. The job sounded fun, a bit demanding, but good solid work. There is next to no commute, the people are really nice, and there would be some benefits - they didn't say what the benefits were.

The only problem is the pay. They want to give me $35k a year. I last made $45k as a nanny, until I quit in August. I live alone with my cat, so I'm the sole breadwinner, and I really want to buy a house and be able to live comfortably and that kind of money would make it feel like I did when I worked in daycare and basically lived paycheck to paycheck. They did say they would talk to budgeting and see if they could raise the pay a bit, but they wouldn't be able to match my current salary.

I just feel bad because I do want to work there - and I hate making it about the money. Especially this late in the game, but they never brought up pay and we're taught as interviewees not to ask until you get an offer.

I do have other interviews and people I've talked to, but no other offers as of yet.

I currently make about 49k a year. I really like my current job work in IT for the local government, I like my boss, coworkers and the benefits are super nice (22 days PTO). Its also insanely low stress most days, no OT or weekends.

I currently live with my wife, and my parents which allowed us to save a lot of money, we pay $1000 in rent plus have car payments of $500 a month, with no other debt. Its also become uncomfortable living with my parents and we think its time to move out. 

With the new position we would have to relocate, which my wife and I are excited for. We would only need to have 1 car too since I can just take the train to work. Rent is going to be around $2000 a month. My wife also works, she makes around 50k.

The salary isn't the biggest jump in the world, but my current job has become stagnate, I've been here for over 4 years, I started at 43k and now make 49k. There's barely any room for growth, everyone stays until retirement. I've gotten passed on jobs because even though I have 4 years of experience, its not with any current technologies.

I've been exploring new job opportunities and a recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn with a seemingly great mid-level position in my field, but some of the prerequisites feel super invasive for this early in the process.

First, after an inital chat with the recuiter, they wanted me to fill out this long intake survey that asked a lot of really specific details about how I feel about work-life balance, my ideal job, etc. I didn't think anything of it, but it was kind of annoying that I had to spend like 30 minutes on it.

Next, they required a video meeting before they would even share the full job description. Again, a red flag but I went with it. During the meeting, the recuiter continued with a line of very specific questions with a heavy focus on work location (remote/hybrid/in-person). 

By this point I knew something was off, but when the recuter followed up and said they would have to contact a reference and verify my education before the first interview with the company I decided that was far enough.

1,2022-09-20,Do I need an internship if I'm employed at a small company?,u/weirdladyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xjku62/do_i_need_an_internship_if_im_employed_at_a_small/,jobs,"Hello. I'm currently an undergraduate student at Berkeley majoring in Cognitive Science. I initially chose this major because I knew that I wanted to work with something involving technology and science. My main goal has been to become a UX designer, but I'm also open to other areas.

I'm a transfer student, so I just started at Berkeley and have two years ahead of me. As soon as I transferred, my Data Science professor recruited me to start working at their SEO (search engine optimization)/web development company. There, I work part-time and get paid almost double what I was making as a tutor at my community college, and I can ""choose"" what areas I want to focus on: data, web development, design, etc.

My question here is about the importance of also getting an internship. I'm really feeling the pressure of having to attend career fairs etc (which I have) but it feels so weird that I'd need an internship considering that I have a job. I'm really paranoid about these things, so I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.

My professor seems to want me to continue working at his company. They even gave me a $5 raise out of nowhere.

My fears:

* If I eventually decide to leave the company in the future or if the company shuts down, will not having had an internship during school hurt my chances of getting a full-time job?
* If I want to work with UX, will having a job in a similar field help? I create ""intuitive"" designs, but I don't conduct interviews with users or anything like that.
* I worry that I'm getting paranoid. I'm a recent immigrant to the US so I'm always feeling like I have to be two steps ahead of everyone in order to actually have a ""life"".

Truthfully, they ghosted me for \~4 months after I accepted the offer back in May and never responded to any messages or emails I sent, so I figured I was one of those who had their offer rescinded, started the job hunt again, and am now working at another company. The first company finally reached out the week of my start date to try and rush my backgrounding and onboarding with no reason for the ghosting or delays.

Because of the entire experience, I'm a little unsure about working for them. I told them that due to ""personal reasons"" (i.e., the ghosting), I would no longer be taking the offer but thanked them for the opportunity and asked to be considered for future positions. They came back this week saying they wanted to accommodate me and asked when I'd be available to start or if anything was keeping me from joining any time soon that they could inform my prospective team about. I'm not sure how to respond. To be honest, the pay is double what I'm currently making, and the company's pretty well-known, but I don't want to be burned by relocating and leaving my current job only to get ghosted again.

Does this mean they're open for negotiation? Should I negotiate a start date further out? If so, how do I go about this process? If not, how do I respectfully decline the olive branch?

**TLDR:** Told the company that I wouldn't be taking their offer anymore, and they came back wanting to accommodate me about later start dates or personal issues keeping me from coming back, so now I don't know what to do."

I‚Äôve been in my position for a little over a year now. I‚Äôm considering looking for a new position largely because of my boss. 

It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a toxic or unprofessional relationship. It‚Äôs just he is a very absent manager. I‚Äôve learned a little from him, but he‚Äôs not much of a mentor or trainer. Feedback is rare, and I‚Äôll sometimes go a week or so without any communication. We work in the same office. Sure he might come by and chat for a couple mins rarely. 

For example, we discussed my goals not too long ago. Not really much guidance, advice, or anything related to it. His theme is ‚Äúhere is a vague task we haven‚Äôt discussed or trained on, give it a whirl.‚Äù He‚Äôs not big on communicating how he wants to see data. I just do something and he might say it‚Äôs wrong or nothing at all (no news is good news). 

I think we had probably two or three one on one meetings this entire year.

Anyone else had a similar experience?"
2,2022-09-20,New job is a total bait and switch,u/vacationingalone1234,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xjohzw/new_job_is_a_total_bait_and_switch/,jobs,"I have been working in digital marketing for 9 years, agency side. I‚Äôve been an account &amp; project manager, sales lead and analyst over those years but my entire career has been centered around digital marketing and client relationships within the media space.

Digital marketing can be a rough industry. Layoffs, client churn, etc and a lot of agencies kinda suck. The bait and switch is common to a degree, especially since Covid - a lot of agencies have lean budgets and more violative client relationships so things shift last minute.

I left my last agency after a little over a year because everybody around me was quitting and the agency tried to force me into a role I didn‚Äôt want at allllll because they needed somebody skilled to do it but they didn‚Äôt want to pay me more money. This role was in a department that paid their employees at least 20k more and their way around paying me more was to give me a title demotion?? No thanks. So I left.

I got a more senior job at another agency and I was so excited to start. 

I‚Äôm a sucker. Within the first week, I found out they did a layoff before I started. The two people that were going to work under me quit. The clients I was working on shifted and now I‚Äôm working on banner creation requests and really low level design projects and my new client is AWFUL. The only other person on this account with me has openly told me she cant train me and isn't my manager but my actual manager doesn't know anything about this account‚Ä¶ this is horrendous. i don't know anything so I'm making small mistakes and this person on the account with me is flagging them and being really cold and unhelpful.

Then the president of the company quit, alongside 3 other senior managers.

I bounced around over Covid so my resume doesn‚Äôt look amazing in terms of tenure‚Ä¶ but this is awful. I can‚Äôt stay here? I start each day with a sense of dread.

I‚Äôm applying for jobs. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice on how to stomach this until I find something else. I hate that this is happening because I was so excited for this role.

 
TLDR: how to stay in toxic job long enough to find something else. Similar stories/experienced are welcome &amp; appreciated"

2,2022-09-20,Final Interview Waiting/Panicking,u/unnamedindv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xjozd6/final_interview_waitingpanicking/,jobs,"Hi all!

So I recently had an interview process for an internal consulting role at a financial firm, and now I'm waiting for feedback three business days later after the final round after 5 total interviews, and naturally I'm irrationally freaking out and overanalyzing unimportant minutiae. 

Speaking of, within those 5 interviews, I seemed to vibe very well with the HR screening guy, the hiring manager, an AVP on the team, and the department head.

The thing is, I didn't vibe as well with the last person, a VP who's apparently not on the hiring team itself but was there to meet me, collect data, etctera. I MAY have accidentally come off a bit arrogant with her, though it's not concrete. 

The question is, have any of you had a situation where you don't vibe with specifically one of the interview team? If so, did you still get the role, and if not, did you think that one not as great conversation played a factor in the rejection?"

These companies are small and mid-tier level, as a candidate, I am interviewing at several companies but I feel the whole process is broken and time-consuming. They are conducting 5 rounds of interviews with one assessment and they take one week to get back if I am selected for the next round of interviews.

I got an offer from one unpaid internship (let's say Company A) after 2 rounds of interviews (each an hour long). I am interviewing for another company (Company B) which is a paid full-time position and I want that rather than working for an unpaid internship. But the problem is this company B is taking way too long with the whole process of 5 rounds, one round every week. I just cleared round 2 now I am waiting for the date and time of round 3 which will be next week. 

So my question if I mention the offer I already got from company A and try to leverage it to expedite the process in company B, will it affect their hiring decision for me (without mentioning the unpaid part)? Anyone was in a similar situation, how did it work out for you?

P.S. - I have a tight deadline to inform my college that I have received a full-time job or internship in my field."

My salary is going to more than double and I'm going to be able to work from home permanently (my current department is going back to the office on a hybrid schedule soon). WFH means a great deal to me and it's why I looked for a new job in the first place, despite the fact that I really like my coworkers and am comfortable in the job.

But I feel like I've made a mistake for these reasons:

- It's a corporate role. I've worked for a corporation before and it was the worst job I've ever had. It was micromanagey, inflexible, cold, and clinical, with completely fake company culture. From what I understand this position is quite flexible for a corporate role and I will not be micromanaged, but it's hard to not be haunted by past experience.

- I interviewed my would-be boss and his boss during this process, and I didn't like either of them. The would-be boss struck me as cynical and jaded, totally no-nonsense (my current boss can be no-nonsense when needed, but she's fun and understanding, and great to talk with). His boss struck me as nervous and aloof. I want to be comfortable with my coworkers and bosses -- I knew right away that my current coworkers would be great when I interviewed with them.

- The boss's boss described this company as a ""sort of a start-up, even though we've been around for two decades"" -- they're expanding operations and trying new things, hence why they're hiring for many new positions. To me this sounds like ""if it's not working, we'll lay off a whole division if needed"".

I don't know. When I got the offer I should have felt excited, but I just felt my heart sink. I'm a very anxious person by default and always assume the worst. I was very nervous about my current role, too, and it ended up being great. Should I be listening to my gut here? Are these legit warning signs?"

So I'm 19 and I currently work in customer service as a chat rep. It's great pay, great benefits, and great that I can stay off the phone (mostly), but the constant talking to customers who are mean, not the brightest or unwilling to listen to me is really taking its toll on my mental health. I just find that I hate my life now and would give anything to not work with customers. (For the record, my job is a cell phone company with a demographic of like 50-60+ so they were mostly either rude or having no clue what I'm talking about).

Anyway, I'm out job-hunting now but I know I have a lot of criteria I need to meet. I can't drive so I'm looking at exclusive WFH stuff which I figure it easier nowadays from Covid. I also have a year of job experience so I assume I'll only be accepted in no experience positions. I basically just need something to pay the bills, I've been looking at positions minimum $17/hour.

So as I'm looking, I just see things that sound awesome but need exp, things that sound difficult and not worth the pay which would lead to similarly hating my life, or more customer service. I've seen things like transcriptionists but those need exp, QA testers which sounds great but not great pay as far as I've seen, and like I said, more customer service.

Any fields anyone can suggest to help me out would be insanely appreciated, and like I said at the start, I'm aware that it might be a lost cause."

I want to know if anyone else has felt or currently feels like there‚Äôs a point in your career where you either stick with something and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to do for the rest of your life or you branch out and try something else. For me I feel stuck, I haven‚Äôt experienced much and I do want to see what other opportunities await me. But then again I get a decent salary at the moment and I have a chance to work my way up and make a honest living doing this in the long run. 
 

I would love to hear any advice someone has or any stories from people who either stuck with it or jumped into something entirely new.

Thanks in advance!"

I left school in 2018 and afterwards had a gap year. however Covid 19 hit and its been 4 years and i have not gotten employment. due to where i currently live. i have to travel to in order to get employment as there are little opportunity for work in my town. i honestly feel i have wasted 4 years of my life doing little to nothing but doing short courses that go nowhere. such as warehousing, white card (a card in my country that allows you to be present on job sites) and first aid. I know people my age who have careers and some have homes. i feel I'm lagging behind them.

I have no clue where to go. as i got a certificate in Warehousing from a short course. I feel that I should go and try and find a pick-packing job. however my lack of experience in both warehousing and that i never held a job before has hurt my chances. i am wondering. should I go and find a typical starter job or should I try and get a pick-packing job.

But today i do admit that there are perks and comfort of my role.

I've been working part-time 30% for the six years it took to complete my masters, and I graduated with top results. School was certainly challenging, especially while working, but the full schedule and proper time management made it possible.

Now I'm working as a business guy surrounded by tech people in a massive organization, and I understand literally nothing. For the record, this is the same organization I worked part-time in during my studies, and things are infinitely more complex than I initially thought. I feel demotivated to work in this field as I never found tech interesting when drilling into it. Everything is super complex, I feel like I'm lagging behind and I don't know when I'll start seeing some actual progress. I've largely been left to myself after about a month at work, and I'm really struggling filling up my calendar as I don't know where, when, how, who, or what to do/accomplish/speak to.

I feel like I'm way too old to be feeling this way and struggling with my schedule. I've had a lot of fun in college, but I thought I was ready to grow up and attack real life. At the moment, I just feel completely worthless, and struggle to see the point of it all. The onboarding was really bad, and it sucks being left to myself to go ""figure things out"" when I barely understand how system A talks to system B. I've tried talking to loads of different people, but the amount of systems we use is so overwhelming I can barely grasp anything. It all feels so excruciatingly lonely.

Thanks for letting me vent. Dunno if this is suited better for a different sub."

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have had a meltdown. I graduated 5 years ago from a top university in Colombia from Economics. I didn't work in a large corporation, I worked in a startup and a small family-owned owned enterprise as a Data Scientist. I feel I have no job experience, I'm 30 and all of my friends are finishing their MBA' s and working in top companies or working for the government I just gathered GCP certifications. They tried recruiting me for BCG and for IBM but I completely failed in their interview, in IBM it was with their test and in BCG it was with their case study.

I feel I never gave myself the chance to work in a company I could grow, I just quit my job to pursue a gradue degree in the Netherlands but I went into a very harsh reality check and will go back to Colombia to reevaluate my life.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I gain relevant experience, I need to get into a company that helps me grow. I think I want to explore a more business side of my life. ¬øWhat would you recommend? I think, eventually I'll do an MBA."

I‚Äôve done:

Fast food - do I even need to explain why I wouldn‚Äôt go back to this as an adult?

Serving - amazing money and somewhat flexible with hours, just never felt passionate in doing so

Retail - I hated it and the pay/hours were never good enough. 

Office work - I was again, paid poorly but the hours were great. 

Medical Assistant - again, great hours, horrible pay. I know nursing would be better with pay but I just don‚Äôt have the time or money to go back to school. The work was super rewarding though. 

Sales (timeshare) - money was great, but it was very hard being in such a high-pressure sales environment when I wasn‚Äôt too passionate about what I was selling. 

Fitness - realized I‚Äôm not quite good enough yet for the industry, but this is where I am the most passionate 

Management - money is not enough for the work I do and I have never had such an awful work-life balance.

I can‚Äôt afford to move to a better area, can‚Äôt afford to go back to school and need a more flexible schedule to do so, and I just really don‚Äôt know what else I should try.

My other option is a corporate job which is really appealing to me in this current economic stage (maybe safer, better salary, cool office and cool benefits, hybrid work). The only thing is that i‚Äôm still at the begining of recruitment, but i have a good feeling about this.

I am not sure how to build a stronger relationship with her. It‚Äôs a fast paced, performance driven company so I don‚Äôt have a lot of time to just sit in her office and get to know her. She doesn‚Äôt give me any validation when I have a concern, and leaves important information out required for me to get the job done. When it gets sent back to me with corrections, I get scolded for it- and she does nothing to back me up. 

I just don‚Äôt get it. I mean am I being too sensitive? It‚Äôs not that I need reassurance or a pat on the back, I just need her to idk- be a leader? Am I being crazy? Because I feel crazy at this point. 

Lastly, yes, this is her personality towards everyone- but everyone else has been here for at least a year and she became a manager of the center about 6 months ago."

130,2022-09-21,Missed two meetings as an intern and I feel so bad,u/0106lonenyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xk4xfm/missed_two_meetings_as_an_intern_and_i_feel_so_bad/,jobs,"So, I come from Europe and I'm currently interning in NYC. It's a big opportunity that could open lots of doors. It's with an international organisation that won't hire me after the end of the contract but is still a massive boost to my CV (and they pay me).

I do my best, but lately I have been a bit of a mess. The stress of being away from home, in NYC, not having holidays, being so busy with work and having to search for a job on top of that has taken a toll on me. I have been unproductive and inconsistent. Last week I overslept one morning, didn't hear the alarm and missed a meeting we had at 8 AM (I usually start at 9 but we work in different timezones). I apologised and said I had missed the alarm and I knew it sounded lame but it was true. My boss laughed it off and said sh_t happens. 

But then it happened again today. This time I didn't miss any alarm, I just literally did not write down that I had a meeting. Usually Outlook reminds me but only if it's already open. I nearly cried when I saw the notification at 9 AM. I immediately called my boss and told him that I was mortified, and this is not how I do things, and this is not gonna happen again. He said it's fine, but now I'm terrified he's gonna start thinking I am not interested in this job and he's gonna leave me a bad review for future references. I crossed the ocean to come here and the last thing I want is for people to think I don't care and I'm unprofessional and unreliable. My boss has been amazing so far and I genuinely like him a lot, so for him to think bad of me would be soul crushing."
2,2022-09-21,Quitting a part time job,u/Smooth_Antelope1010,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xk56eu/quitting_a_part_time_job/,jobs,"In August I quit a part time job that I was commuting to for almost 2 hours a day (including babysitting drop off). With gas prices and the rate of pay it just wasn‚Äôt making sense and I was practically paying to fill up my tank (driving about 60 miles a day). 

When I told my boss I was giving him notice and that it wasn‚Äôt working out for me, his first response to me was if my husband got a new job. Literally the first question out of his mouth. I found this to be incredibly disrespectful and rude. And then, he said he thought hiring me because of the distance was going to be a problem and that ‚Äúhe was right.‚Äù 

I have expressed the gas issue to him in the past because there have been many weekends when he has asked me to help him out/run an errand to an attorney office to pick up paperwork &amp; end up driving and spending more than I need to. I make an incredibly small commission for doing these extra jobs but I do not see it right away until deals are closes and finalized so it can be months. What I thought was him trying to offer to help on the gas issue was him saying that sometimes he will fill up other employees tanks if they are going out to help him out with a deal‚Ä¶. Well months and months later he still has never taken me to a gas station (not that it would really help!) but it just goes to kind of show he has always come up short‚Ä¶ the girl I replaced said that when she quit she expressed she wasn‚Äôt making enough to cover her new home &amp; living and he said he would ‚Äúget her a raise‚Äù ‚Ä¶and he never did. 

It is now the middle of September and I am still working remotely for him until he finds a replacement. I don‚Äôt know how much longer he could really need to find a replacement as it‚Äôs been well over a month. If I felt like I was respected and treated well at the job I would help him as long as he needed, but he doesn‚Äôt even say thank you or appreciate really anything that anyone does for him."

I‚Äôve heard back from the other role now, and they said yes too, but I told them I‚Äôd like to consider the offer for a few days which they obliged with. After consideration, I think I would like to go for the first job as it‚Äôs better suited to my long term goals.

Do you think it‚Äôs acceptable if I sent an email to the recruiter and confirm that I accept the role and am excited to start, and that I can start in the coming weeks? Or should I wait until I get the formal confirmation instead of sending an email in between?"

1,2022-09-21,Third Party Recruiter Process,u/Don___Draper,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xk6bwf/third_party_recruiter_process/,jobs,"Hello, 

I am currently in the process of interviewing for a director level position with a municipality. 

The municipality has engaged a third-party firm to recruit for the position (Odgers Berndtson). 

To date, I have had two interviews with the recruiting firm and am now scheduled for a panel interview with 6 (seems like a lot?) senior staff with the municipality plus the recruiter. 

This is the first time I have worked this closely with a recruiting firm and I have a couple of questions that I am hoping somebody with experience in this process can help with: 

1. Generally speaking, has anyone worked with Odgers before? Is there a standard process that they follow for recruiting? 
1.  I was originally told there would be two rounds of interviews with the municipality, however I am a little taken back by the number of individuals included on the interview panel - these are six of the organization's most senior staffers. Is it just me or is it odd there are this many people on the panel? Perhaps they are condensing the interview process? Thoughts on this? 
3. How might this panel process play out and what type of questions should I be preparing for in this interview? I am slightly thrown off simply by the number of individuals on the panel. 
4. The recruiter is still involved in this interview. I assume this is a good thing. I have been told by others that at some point in the process, the recruiter often changes perspective from the employers side to being an advocate for the candidate with the employer. Truth?
4. With respect to questions that I would ask the employer, it is my understanding that this position is open due to the retirement of the current person holding the position. I intend on asking questions about their transition plans - is this appropriate? Other suggestions on questions I should be asking (it has been quite some time since I have interviewed with another large organization)
4. The interview is being done virtually. Any general tips for this? I have not done a virtual interview during covid until now. 

Thank you,"

About a year ago he got a promotion, and now he's ready to leave. The issue is this is the *only* place he's ever actually worked. So when he's been looking at applications and filling out work history, he's submitting the two positions (pre and post promo. I mean) as two separate work terms of employment, which basically looks to me as though he's only been working at his last job (his current position) for only a year, when ofc it's been much longer.

That said, I don't know if he's doing it correctly or not, neither of us have any idea how it looks to a recruiter or someone in HR (or whoever checks the application). He tells me he's been listing in the first job that when discussing job responsibilities, he didn't quit or leave but that he was promoted. How does one fill that out correctly, or is the way he's doing it actually the right way?"

1,2022-09-21,How to ask for a promotion?,u/ParkwayAlex,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xk90ai/how_to_ask_for_a_promotion/,jobs,"Hello community,

so I've been employed for over 12 years in a company that sells energy (electricity and gas). It's a company that is largely owned by the local government so it's not always easy to stand out like in a pure private company because my boss has a boss and his/her boss has a boss etc... Nevertheless lots of co-workers, even in my own department have a better classification than I have, yet we do the same tasks in regards of importance and responsibility. I got a promotion this year but I am still one level below most of my direct colleagues. I always get told how well I do my job by my superiors and my clients are nearly always satisfied so there is really no objective reason for me to be below my colleagues. I'd like to point that out to my boss, especially because I could really need the extra money. So, stating the facts and standing up for myself was never a problem for me but the thing is that we recently switched bosses so my actual boss knows me as a person but didn't have the chance to work directly with me yet as we continue to work with my old boss because we have to finish some stuff which who knows how long it will take... So would you suggest to bring my cause up to my actual boss even if he is new? He is new as my boss but he's been working in the company for over 20 years probably so he knows the dynamics and politics of the company. I'm really not pretending anything less than I deserve imo, not asking for the impossible, just the right compensation for the work I do. Any advice how to approach this?"

I live in Texas but I live in the Rio Grande so not much opportunity here both my sister's got full licenses to be nurses but one couldn't find a job and the other has to move up north all the time. So and that's all I don't know what job I would like because I don't have that many interests or passions.
Just something that takes less than 2 years to learn and education doesn't cost too much."

1,2022-09-21,Struggling with fulfilling career,u/GiveMeTheYeetBoys,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xkcnir/struggling_with_fulfilling_career/,jobs,"Hey folks, I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.

I'm 27 years old and don't know what I want to do for a career. When I was a teenager, I used to ""work"" summers at my uncle's law firm. At the time, I was pretty certain I wanted to study international business at university and then go to law school and join his firm. However, I quickly realized I had zero passion for that once I started college.

I changed my major several times (biology, social work, and psychology). I ended up graduating with a bio major with the intent of going to medical school but decided that was a big commitment considering I wasn't even sure if I wanted to do that.

I bounced around for a while and ended up going to grad school for psychology and earned a PsyD. While attending graduate school, I worked part time at a funeral home and loved that. I started attending mortuary school, working towards a BS in funeral home management but the school ended up closing before I could finish and I just kind of lost interest.

I have since worked as a child psychologist in residential treatment facilities and now work in an administrative capacity. I don't mind the work, but I don't have any true passion for it. I am now at the point where I regret not going to medical school but don't really have the ability to go back to school for that long anymore - especially since most of my undergraduate STEM courses are out of date and I'd need to retake them.

I am now considering earning a BSN so I can eventually go to CRNA school. However, that is also a big commitment and I'm hesitant because I've been so flippant with my other studies. On the plus side, my wife is very supportive and, as a physician, is able to financially support us while I do go back to school.

How do I figure out what I want to do? While my wife is able to financially support us while I attend school, it's not something I want her to do long term - especially if I will be taking on a decent amount of debt for school."

Are they actively seeking out these metrics or do they ask their manager or something? Also I'm a first time job seeker(recently graduated with a BS in CS) with school and personal projects how do I generate metrics for these kinds of projects?

I was so excited and the first two months were great, but management changed. Right before I started, the business had been purchased, and so we knew that the office manager would be changing, but everything seemed to be running exactly as it had ever been according to the staff who were there before me. But once the official office manager retired and the new one took over entirely, things have been a mess. The new parent company really doesn't care about us as people, we've never even met the actual owner, just the CEO, and the new office manager is just useless. She's so wildly incompetent and she's not retaining anything. She's constantly asking us three front office people for help, which is annoying because one girl has been there 8 years, but the other person and I are equally new! We're really annoyed that we're training her and but getting compensated for it and it's painful how much she just can't do.

The whole atmosphere has been frustrating. There has been so much that was just not shared in my interview or even at my start date, and now management is just a joke. I was ignoring it and ignoring it but I finally snapped. I applied for a similar role elsewhere that's paying more and explained that I'm looking for a new job so soon because of changes in management that I am uncomfortable with, and I've got an interview with them on Friday. I don't know what's going to happen or where things will fall. Maybe I'm making much ado about nothing, maybe I'll end up staying where I am. But if I can get better pay, more vacation time, more holiday time, and a better work environment elsewhere, I guess I shouldn't feel too guilty."

She has something negative to say about nearly everyone, claiming that no one knows what they're doing, as if everyone is nothing more than a disappointment to her. She has no qualms about completely tearing someone down behind their back, effectively ruining their reputation to anyone who will listen. She criticizes the way that other teams operate, even though she has no idea what it takes to do their jobs. She even brings up past employees, saying that things are a mess because of them. Her mindset is, if one tiny thing doesn't meet her standards, she throws the baby out with the bathwater.

If you're on a Zoom call with her and you can't answer a question, she will literally turn away from the camera and start doing something else on her other monitor, completely dismissing you as if you're not even worth her time. She measures everyone in this way - whether or not you ""know the answers"" - so god help you if you're new or at a lower level, because she doesn't even regard you as human.

In our manager meetings, she consistently trash-talks our lower-level staff and other people throughout the company, to where personal details are shared and these people are laughed at.

I am to the point where I feel so uncomfortable working with her, because I know how she speaks about (and to) others and I'm sure the same is being done behind my back. And the quickness with which she writes people off is disturbing and abnormal. Not sure what to do."

I replied the same day, accepting of course. 
During the interview they mentioned I would have to work full time for the first two weeks but they could work around it if I couldn‚Äôt, I can‚Äôt work one of the afternoons each week so I put that in my email to the recruiter. (Maybe this is why they‚Äôre not replying??) 

Anyway, I then didn‚Äôt hear anything back so I rang the company today, this is 6 days after the email and two weeks after my interview. The recruiter was busy so I passed a message on that could she could email me (rather than call) as I‚Äôd be going out. 

She hasn‚Äôt emailed and that phone call was at midday. 
I don‚Äôt know what else to do, do I email the recruiter or is it going to look bad? 

Tl;dr 
Offered a job then ghosted by recruiter. What do I do?"

Got a new offer and gonna start working next week. I told my manager I'm leaving for a new job and thanks for the opportunity for the 1 month. He was asking if I can stay Thurs and Fri to help out. I basically gave them no notice I'm leaving and told them out of the blue today. Should I stick out for the rest of the week or just leave altogether today. Would it even be worth staying as I most likely won't be getting a reference from them as I only stayed one month and leaving on such short notice. The people are really nice and I would stay longer if I didn't receive a much better offer with higher compensation

0,2022-09-21,Do I need to give 2 weeks notice for a job I‚Äôve worked less than 2 months?,u/avocado4321,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xkhztn/do_i_need_to_give_2_weeks_notice_for_a_job_ive/,jobs,"Background:
I (22F) currently work as a spa coordinator/receptionist. I started this job thinking it would be great as experience for when I finish school in April, as I am in school for esthetics and spa management. 

My managers and coworkers love me. They carelessly hired receptionists prior to me that we‚Äôre not a great fit and ended up doing a god awful job before quitting. They make jokes saying ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt leave us‚Äù. Now I feel awful that I simply cannot continue to work. I‚Äôm a full time student, college 5 days a week, a single mom, and have been working two 8 hour shifts a week (which is still too much for me to handle). 

My mental health has been slipping again, I have severe anxiety and ptsd-this was my first job since being abducted in 2017. I was sick at work last Friday, texted my manager and she said I couldn‚Äôt leave because nobody else could work. We only have one person working front at a time. This was triggering for me as I felt trapped. I was still sick, asked someone to cover for me (they said no) so I informed the manager day before and was told I should come in anyways. I reiterated that I cannot and she guilted me that she would have to pick up my shift. 

After talking to my psych she thinks it‚Äôs best that I quit. I‚Äôm so unhappy having no time to spend with my daughter, my boyfriend, and then having the 30 min commute. 

My issue is that I am struggling so badly with daily panic attacks at the moment and I know once I give my notice it will be worse knowing I am going into work and they know I am leaving. I am so torn.

TLDR: I have to quit due to mental health. Do I give 2 weeks notice and suck it up/suffer through my shifts and possibly bail on them last minute or do I just say I‚Äôm thankful for the opportunity but no longer able to work due to health issues? Is that allowed? Would I then need a doctors note so they don‚Äôt shade me to future employers? Will the reference even MATTER if I was only there for 2 months? TIA."

2,2022-09-21,What's your experience of workplace bullying?,u/woodenship,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xki3c9/whats_your_experience_of_workplace_bullying/,jobs,"Bullying in the workplace seems to happen all too often and as I've been a victim myself, I'd like to hear the experiences of Redditors (if you're happy to share of course). 

I'd be interested in knowing things like who did/is doing the bullying (manager, colleague, team leader etc), whether it's an individual or group doing it, what kind of behaviours are involved (discrimination, micromanagement, excluding etc), how it's affected you inside and outside of work and whether anything has been done to help you or prevent the bullying from recurring. If you're happy to share what sector you work in I'd also be curious about this as it could be the case that certain types of job roles have higher rates of corporate bullying than others. 

Here's my story: 

I felt victimised by my manager and a senior member of our team in a job I recently left. I don't know what I ever did to them, but they seemed to be working together to create a hostile environment for me. 

My manager had a reputation in the organisation for being a micromananger who had made life difficult for people who worked under her before. She would never acknowledge my achievements or areas I'd improved in; she'd only pick at negatives and emphasise them, even though these were mostly trivial and in general I felt I was performing to a good standard with the positive relationships I formed and good feedback I received from others. 

The senior team member acted the same as her, bringing up the tiniest of errors and making me feel like I'd done something catastrophic despite the fact they made these errors themselves. It was also put down in a probationary report that I was unprofessional for dropping a small microphone (completely by accident) whilst out doing a filming project with the senior team member, which was demoralising as this is a mistake anybody can make. I feel that some information about me was also exaggerated deliberately and false claims were made to make me look like an inefficient worker. 

There was already enough pressure to meet deadlines, and all the negativity drove me to doubting myself and taking time off work with anxiety and depression. 

I am no longer in the role, but I tried my best to fight it and make others in the organisation aware of the behaviour of these vindictive people so that they don't make anyone feel like I did ever again. The workplace union also now has more evidence to add to their already existing record of this manager's unfair treatment of other employees."

For Capital One, I got an offer into their Analyst Development Program for any of their 3 main offices while I got an analyst offer at Deloitte's New York office. From my conversations with both companies, the work I would do is fairly similar (business/data analytics consulting).

The reasons why I need help making a decision:

* Capital One is offering a base salary over $20k (before tax) higher than Deloitte
   * Though it appears that Capital One's annual bonus is lower in the long-term?
* I have friends in New York, but none (that I know of) at Capital One's Virginia offices
* From what I've heard, Capital One has a better-work life balance and company culture but Deloitte seems to have better benefits?
* Deloitte seems to have a better onboarding process and more interesting work

I'm not sure what my long-term goals are right now, so I would prefer a company that has both good exit ops as well as room for career growth in case I enjoy the company enough to stay for a while. Thanks!"

I've worked for the same family owned company for most of my time driving. They've always treated me well. Decent pay, and the job isn't terribly hard. I have nothing bad to say about them, which is rare in this industry. Lately I've noticed a significant decline my physical and mental health, that I am attributing to my job. 

I used to love going to the gym, even talked about doing some amateur strong man competition stuff with guys that also used my gym. I had a healthy social life and was always a very laid back and generally happy guy.

I have no life outside of work. My time off on the weekends consist primarily of getting ready to go back to work next week.

I believe my job is a major factor in the recent changes to my personality and health. However, this is the best money I can make in my small town community. I've thought about working part time and going back to school, but am so unsure about what I should do."

What do YOU do?",u/The_Phreak,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xko0ds/if_getting_hired_is_simply_a_numbers_game_how_am/,jobs,"I worked on COVID-19 for the past two years during the thick of the emergency until June this year. To be honest I got a lot of experience doing A LOT of different things for public health, but since I was a contractor and city budgets being what they are, I did not get an extension. So here I am, slogging through the job hunts. 

That said, I rapid fired about two dozens applications via Indeed without bothering with a cover letter and am still getting rejections in multiple chunks on a daily or weekly basis. Some of these rejections came quick. Some of these were jobs that I had a pretty solid amount of experience in. Some of these jobs sent me messages asking me to apply, but I still got corny-ass automated rejection emails as if a human hadn't even bothered looking at my application. 

At the very top of my resume is my very recent COVID-19 health worker experience, and given that I had been at the front lines during some the worst times during the pandemic, I felt pretty good about my chances. Guess I might have been overconfident. 

Whatever.

Moving on to my point: am I supposed to write an actual cover letter for every job I apply to online or can I just scoot by using a really spruced up resume? Are you simply submitting your resume and that's that? Or are you crafting a cover letter on the regular? And if you're submitting a letter for EVERY job, what's your trick?

Because if I am supposed to take time and effort to write a carefully constructed cover letter for every job, it's not going to work. It doesn't make sense from an efficiency point of view, nor does it seem logical that one should spend all that effort on something that is already half-way into the rejection pile before you even hit the ""SUBMIT"" button."

Example: They ask you ""How's work?!"". You explain it's going fine with some delays and then laughingly they respond ""Are you complaining now?!"".

Overall, I like to just get my job done and not engage in such chats as they are often cringe but this person is like my boss in a way. How do I put up with them? A chat with them often feels like they doubt my competence or are interviewing me yet again.

Recently, they scheduled some meetings but strangely cancelled them after just two occurrences and they never texted me to tell me why the meetings were cancelled. These specific meetings felt like further interviews so I'm not sure if this isn't a clue I'll be fired soon.

What's my way out of this?"

Fast forward, my husband got a job offer in a different country and I decided to follow him. I thought at the time maybe it‚Äôs time to slow down and took a retail job.

Hello! Seeking some direction and opinions.

During my job search I was offered a position with Company A and Company B. Company A offered $9k less than Company B but was a remote position with a company I‚Äôm familiar with and already have an established name in. Company B offered $9k more, was not remote, but was an opportunity to grow with a similar company that was very very interested in me.

I accepted the offer from Company A. Now, 3 months later, I‚Äôm kicking ass at Company A and I‚Äôm happy with work! However, Company B was so impressed by me (and I have really strong personal connections there) that they immediately thought of me for a new opening with the same position but a bit further away. They‚Äôre offering an additional $10k from their original offer, so $19k more than my current position‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm only 3 months in, but can I ask for a raise? If so, how do I go about it? I don‚Äôt want the position with Company B, but the money is hard to pass up especially right now with my current finances."

1,2022-09-21,Contract job is a mess,u/lcallag,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xkpdex/contract_job_is_a_mess/,jobs,"Hi all! 
I‚Äôm looking for some advice here. It‚Äôs a little long so please bare with me. 
3 months ago I accepted a contract position after being stuck on a toxic work environment. The contract was pretty straight forward, I was placed with a large company and pretty good salary. However in the contract specified my position, 401K, health benefits at 90 days, 6 paid holidays and a guaranteed conversion to FT at 6 months. Everything was great and I completed the first 3 days of onboarding. After the 3 days I met with my manager and she started to talk about my position and how it was mostly data analytics (position I accepted was Product Manager). When I expressed my confusion as this was nowhere mentioned neither in the interview process or in the offer letter, she apologized and said that they ‚Äúforgot to mention it‚Äù in interviews and I would still have the Product Manager title just doing Data Analytics. This was pretty disappointing as I have never done data analytics. I asked if I could get training in SQL and they said no because I‚Äôm a contractor. I reached out to my staffing agency and they said they never heard that was a data analytics position and they were going to ‚Äúcheck with them‚Äù. 
Well, I have been doing the data analytics plus product management and kind of going with the flow until last week when I received my check and it was short. I reached out to my staffing agency to see what happened since I was supposed to get paid for Labor Day. They replied that unfortunately since they used a 3rd party to onboard me because they don‚Äôt hire in my state, I‚Äôm not eligible to be paid for holidays. This is very upsetting as it was specified in the contract I signed. Is this considered breach of contract? Do I have any legal recourse in both the pay and the lack of clarity in the position?"

During my first one I was complimented a lot because I really cared about my work and I made sure to deliver everything as soon as possible and as good as I could and everyone liked me.

However, during this second one I'm doing it seems like meeting the deadlines and delivering nice work by the deadlines is not nearly good enough. I'm expected to even way before the deadlines not mess it up and it's just suffocating. I always like to ask my bosses for their opinions on certain aspects of my work before the final delivery so that I can make sure I don't miss any detail but the problem is I'm being criticized for mistakes I'm making even when I'm just asking for opinions, way before the deadlines. It's like I can't even breathe. 

It's not exactly micro-managing because he's not trying to figure out what I'm doing all the time but it's like every time I ask his opinion he finds something wrong with what I did and criticizes it as though I was making a terrible mistake when the main reason why I'm asking him is so I don't make my final delivery with those mistakes.

I also get criticized on communication and that's even okay to an extent but I receive complaints in a really rude manner when it's basically really simple things that can easily be corrected and nothing major to anyone's productivity and it's as though I was wasting everyone's time."

At first I enjoyed the job, I was given a lot of responsibility early on, which was nice becsuse I got to go straight into feeling like a real engineer. This has changed drastically in the past 2 months.

I feel like leadership allows customers to just step all over us, so on top of the insane workload the timelines and expectations are insane. In order to keep up we keep having to take shortcuts which later bite us in the ass because we are never doing things correctly.

What is really killing me is that because I dont have the time to do things right, there are a lot of failures that just destroy my already low confidence and just make the timelines even more insane. I feel like leadership sometimes thinks I dont do anything menwhile theres a new job for me to do every otber day. Currently I am working on a system that has 100+ components, i have to build, design/modify, and make drawings for each of the 50 manufactured items, as well as work with a contracted machinist to make sure the parts are built right. I dont have anyo e to check my work or help me manage the project. My boss keeps telling customers that their systems are 90% comolete when in reality I havenf even started buding them because I just finally finished making the drawings for machining. I have been rushing through everything to keep on schedule so every time the machinist calls me about a typo I feel like such a piece of shit. I am also very afraid of a typo or 2 going unseen, and tgen it will ve my fault that the system is delayed again

I dont know what exactly the point of posting this is, part of me just wants to rant, but the other part is curious if someone else has similar experiences."

I consider this job my first ""adult/professional"" job. However, I have my upcoming performance evaluation next month. This week during my weekly meeting with supervisor this week brought up an incident couple weeks of ago, in one of my project where my lack of attention to details was clearly demonstrated; meaning that one of my colleagues had to fix my mistakes for a good couple of hours. 

It should be mentioned that my supervisor did affirmed in the meeting, that I am not getting fired, but my supervisor did commented that they wanted to avoid getting the performance plan phase (which essentially I view that as being on job probation) for me. My supervisor wants to see progress/improvement in my ""areas of growth."" Which I did offer during my meeting ways I can try to address such as writing notes, asking more questions etc.Which for quick note, I have been transparent with my supervisor that my weakness is my lack of attention to detail issue is reoccurring issue for me. It has been communicated to me that my supervisor will follow up with this conversation in exactly one month.

I need some advice on how to handle negative feedback with grace? And how can show my supervisor within a month an improvement in my lack of attention to detail to my work?  I really like the job that I am doing, and I don't want to get fired.

My anxiety and negative thoughts that I am experiencing is that 1) No matter how much I try to improve, it's not going to make a difference and that I will get fired regardless from my position. 2) What if this is the beginning of the end for my position?"

Im thinking of just taking the paycut and going into simpler part time jobs that have a good schedule so i can go back to school. Maybe as a fedex package handler or distribution warehouse. I just dont want to manage people, dont want to deal with shoplifters anymore, drug addicts threatening to kill me or set me on fire, trying to upsell credit cards, getting yelled at for shit beyond my control. I just want a job I can go to, work and shut up for 8 hours then go home.

To put into perspective I only make 22 an hour and while im looking for jobs that pay more it seems like everything im qualified for is more customer service jobs which i dont want to do or warehouse jobs which im willing to do but only temporary. Im at the point of just taking 3-4 dollar an hour paycuts and getting something that has the schedule I want while I go back to school and get something better."

My intention for a new job was to do it for a few months (could be 3 - 12months+), before upskilling to a better position in a different company - I am working towards certification in IT. However, that being said, I do not know when a position such as described will become available.

I have many contacts in this new place and I am optimistic that I will be able to join the company. Should I let the recruiter know that I may be called away for a different job in a few months, and set more reasonable expectations for this recruiter?"

The hours have been longer than I anticipated, as I often work with international teams in other time zones that necessitate meetings into the evenings. My boss often says things have been crazier than normal recently, and as I have no other point of reference, I basically take her at her word for it.

The nature of my role has been great for personal and professional development so far, even if it has made me uncomfortable almost every day due to being a new industry and new job scope. I also realize that being ""uncomfortable"" is good for growth to an extent, and I can't let the bouts of imposter syndrome get to me. Especially as an introvert with social anxiety. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice and/or experiences from others, on how you kept the doubt at bay and didn't let it affect your learning and performance? I know I'm good at what I do, I just don't feel that way yet on the job given how processes and ways of working are so different here. It has also been a ""hit the ground running"" experience, which hasn't helped with giving me time to breathe just yet, so to speak. 

Have been so focused on trying to learn as much as I can, as quickly as I can. I just want to be able to put it into perspective, and establish work-life balance once I settle in too."

I have a co-worker (A) who also kind of is my superviser ! We have a good relationship and he trust me ... But here's the thing he's holding the access to databases, he doesn't want the other team(Y) to have access to it because he thinks that if they do so, he will lose his job... 
Yesterday i had a conversation with one of the collegues(B)  that came from the other team(Y) to make the work smooth between both teams, and from what he was explaining to me ! He told me that he sees issue related to work in the other team(Y) that can have solutions provided by our team(X), let's say making work automate with the dabases for example.. The conversation came within a discussion that i had with collegue(B) about my career development within the organization... So i belive that he was suggesting me a valuable project.... For myself since i joined the organization recently this is an opportunity that can help me take a lead on a project within the organization and therefore help me secure a better contract and second it can make the work fatser for everyone...
The problem is my co-worker(A) who can block the process because the solution is related to giving access to databases and it can also break the trust that he has in me... 
Should i talk to the collegue(B) from the other team(Y) suggesting to send collegue (A) to meet team(Y) in person it can maybe help him see thing from another angle and see potential in providing solutions rather than feeling threatned ? How should i tackle the issue so that nobody loses his job and i can also create opportunities for my self because i want to grow where i am now. And i realy don't want to be the person who's kicking off his career on peoples back .... or by stabbing others... i am affaird that's what collegue (A) can think...

The panel got broken up into two days, because schedules, first day it went super great. One of the people who was interviewing me did say ‚ÄúI hope you get this job, you did a stellar interview.‚Äù

The second day I left feeling less confident but not dejected‚ÄîI always get this feeling after a final interview.

I sent my thanks and HR said hiring manager would not have any update or feedback until Friday since he‚Äôs OOO.

Now my issue is, today I saw the person who interviewed me on the second day posting about the job on LinkedIn. He‚Äôs not the hiring manager but it makes me think he wasn‚Äôt impressed.

To add, during this ordeal I got laid off (alongside 50% of my former company) and my former manager actually sent in a recommendation, unprompted, to the hiring manager‚Äîwhich he appreciated.


Should I be worried? Is this normal? Is it just in case I say no? Am I overthinking?"

I wasn't able to submit the skills assessment on the said deadline due to a personal emergency, hence, I called to decline my job application with them.

Currently, a recruiter from their company called me again to ask if I am still interested in the position. I answered, ""yes"". Days after, I was emailed that I was considered for the role and we're now at the ""job offer"" phase. 

I am a bit shocked since I think there's an error with their system. They called me, thanked them for considering me and I asked if I still need to answer a skill assessment for them to properly assess me as a good fit for the role. 

I am still somewhat new to processes like these since I am a fresh graduate. Is this a normal thing for other companies, too?"

I'm a software developer and recently joined a new company a couple of weeks ago. I had been working for a little over one year at another company before this. Unfortunately a little after starting I found out that they what they told me during the interview process wasn't true and that I would be working on a different tech stack and mainly on frontend, which isn't something I am interested in.

Now I'm thinking of applying to other jobs but am unsure on how to handle the situation. Should I include it in my resume and just explain the situation to the recruiter? Or should I leave it off and leave my previous job as current employer?

I wouldn't want recruiters to think I'm currently not working.

Of course if I leave I would at least want an offer with the same salary I am currently making."

This year I began actively job hunting with the intent of changing careers (I just got a new higher degree and was seeking a fresh start). I‚Äôve been at my current job for 16 years and am in a leadership role.

My job hunt has not been successful though I‚Äôve interviewed here and there and nothing became solid employment. Fast forward to now and I‚Äôm faced with a family situation that might warrant me staying at home to care for my kids. This would be the most logical and practical decision to spare my husband and I from running around getting multiple kids to different schools at various times during the day. We would save the money we now pay for childcare and I could probably take a part-time or off shift job to make up the difference in take home money. Money would not be an immediate issue if I stayed home.

I would love to be a full time Mom at home for my kids! I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have any problem with this transition. My problem lies in how guilty I‚Äôd feel to leave my job. We‚Äôre a small tight-knit group and I enjoy what I do for the most part. I‚Äôm surprised at myself that I would consider choosing the hard way to keep my job. The hard way would equal getting one child to a daycare across town and getting my other kids to school and arranging alternate pick-up arrangements for everyone. I‚Äôm not mentioning having to race home to prepare dinner for everyone every day as well. Why is it so hard for me to just give my employer notice due to the hardship I‚Äôd have at home?? Just to note, we had a nanny and she just gave her notice due to family issues. I really don‚Äôt want to find a new nanny and have to go through all of that again (current nanny has been with us for years). 

What would you do: give notice or suck it up and try to find alternatives?"

I've been unemployed since the start of the Pandemic

At the time I was also taking care of mother who had stage 4 cancer, being the only person available to care for her.

I would ideally like to find a job as a field engineer, doing measurements, tests, logs, etc.

Or any job that is willing to accept someone as green as me with no work experience

My friend got me an interview at a company that‚Äôs better in every way. Should I take it?

Hello, I wanted to get some advice on how I should proceed on a career change such as this.

Over the past few months, I have been facing financial insecurity as a grad student hopping between internships for experience with no consistent income that didn‚Äôt last longer than 3 months. Last month, I was reaching the end of my final internship and decided that I should try to find full time employment while I wait to start at one of the companies I interned with (Focusing on finishing my Master‚Äôs first). I‚Äôm very cautious when it comes to my finances and get uncomfortable when I don‚Äôt have a set financial plan 2-3 months out, so not having a confirmed job made me very anxious.

I interviewed at several places, including the one job on working at now, and out of all of them, the one I chose was at the bottom of my list. The only reason I accepted their offer was because they gave me an offer the same day as the interview (which in hindsight I should have recognized as a red flag) and the fact that the pay they offered met my requirements. I wasn‚Äôt looking for a specific job, I just needed that solace knowing I had income to financially plan with.

The first month here has just been me going day by day trying to rationalize my decision. The company I work at feels lifeless with no real culture to speak of. I read reviews on Glassdoor about this place and what I read wasn‚Äôt very good, but I thought I‚Äôd see for myself. The industry I‚Äôm in makes working from home very possible (accounting), and all of my previous jobs made it very easy for me to work a hybrid schedule. But this has no infrastructure for it and a lot of the software they use feels very outdated. I‚Äôve had to explain to my higher ups several times how to do simple tasks on commonly used software like pdf readers and Microsoft Office which makes me constantly wonder how this department has functioned this long. I‚Äôm a pretty outgoing person who can make friends wherever I go, but I know absolutely no one here aside from a handful of people that I work with. It‚Äôs been pretty lonely, but hey, work is work so I‚Äôm not going to complain. Along with everything else, the benefits and time off here are barely up to par. Expensive health care that doesn‚Äôt provide much relief, no PTO abilities until 6 months in, and only then is it just one week of vacation and a couple days of sick/personal time combined. The companies I interned at before this were offering 2-3-4 weeks of vacation, high quality health care, and had much more flexibility with time off.

The point is, this company feels like one of those that see their employees as corporate slaves and will do the bare minimum to take care of them.

The real problems started this week when work started to pile up. Up to this point, everything‚Äôs been pretty eased into since I‚Äôm new, but all at once they just dropped a load on me expecting me to handle it all. Everyday this week I have been miserable and it shows no sign of stopping. My manager, who up to this point had been really nice, just started getting really mean out of nowhere and made me anxious on several occasions when I really needed help and asked for guidance. The worst part is that it will be a monthly occurrence and it is‚Äôt going to get any better. 

My friend before this, who I have known for years and trust very dearly, started a new job around the same time as me. We were out to lunch last week and we were talking about our new jobs and I felt quickly ashamed of mine by comparison. His job sounds like everything I wanted but never got: High paying, good benefits, work life balance, work from home options, good team, etc. He said his team is looking for another staff member and I should consider applying if my current job doesn‚Äôt pan out.

I asked him on Tuesday after things got really bad if the position was still open and he said it was and he would put a good word in for me. I put in an application and he told me that HR would reach out shortly for in an interview.

In the off chance that I receive an offer, do you think I should leave my current job? I know it seems unprofessional since they spent all this time training me, but I just don‚Äôt see myself doing this long term and being happy.

Thanks in advance.

Edit: Thanks for the advice and reaffirming my decision. I‚Äôll update if something does happen, but I‚Äôm going to look at other jobs in the meantime. And to the person who asked why I care about culture at a throwaway job, I don‚Äôt really care all that much. It‚Äôs more that grad school already stresses me enough as is, so I would prefer to have a work environment that doesn‚Äôt just make things even worse for me than things already are, lol."

Finding a space to rant, LinkedIn is so freakin fake,  tired of all those polished ""professional BS'.

Brief background here, I graduated with my BA &amp; MA in Anthropology this May. 

I've done many research studies while in school and an internship experience in a Ad/marketing firm as a Qual researcher.

With this, I've been trying to break into the research industry in the tech field. Specifically with UX Research or Qualitative Research.

I was darn proud of myself for getting my degrees both in 5 years. Worked during school and graduated debt free.  I thought I was in good shape.

But the past 5 months have been just so discouraging. with constant rejections and countless interviews with no follow-ups. Kept getting told I have no relevant experiences or skills to prove my qualifications... I feel so small and helpless. 

At this point, I'm just so discouraged and frustrated. I feel like I've done all I can: networking, resume edits, portfolios, etc...  

I've been looked for probono opps but didn't have any lead... 

Perhaps this is ""the real world"" I'm experiencing. 

Thanks for reading this far...."

Management at my current company is very poor and work full time but have no benefits because I‚Äôm considered ‚Äútemporary‚Äù. I was offered a similar position somewhere else doing the same type of work for the same pay, except with good benefits and I liked the manager much better. 

I put in my 2 weeks notice last week and my current boss tried to convince me to stay, to which I said (via email) I would if I could get a *guarantee* that within X timeline I‚Äôd be promoted to full time and get my benefits I need. He never responded to my email, and then a week later was surprised I was still leaving. He said - through a phone call, nothing written - that sure, he could guarantee it, but at that point it was a little too late for me to turn back since I was fully setup ready to start the new job. 

Today was our last meeting, and he asked where I was going. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing it but did anyways since he would find that information easily by looking up my LinkedIn. He said the company I‚Äôm going to is not good. I know I‚Äôm taking a risk - there‚Äôs always a risk with going for a new job.

Did I make a mistake here? How would you have handled this situation?"

I‚Äôm originally from Germany but got a job in Austria. It was a similar job than the one I had abroad and I was so happy I found something the same level as I thought I‚Äôd have to start working my way up again in a new country. However, I arrived and got depressive very quickly. I felt like I was neither closer to my family nor abroad. Everything seemed overwhelming as I had a new home, new job and a lot of cultural changes/new country to adjust to all at once. I didn‚Äôt have any energy and just got out of bed for my job, the weekends I would barely make it out of the house, crying every day. A few weeks later I felt so emotionally drained and mentally unstable that I quit after my Dad even said you need to get yourself out of this situation, come home and start over. My first impulse was to go abroad again to a different country. I always dreamed of another working holiday year thinking maybe that was why Austria just wouldn‚Äôt work for me as I deep down wanted something different. But I have a lot of anxiety as work and travel usually means back to entry level positions, shared rooms, etc. so I also think about applying for jobs back home. A few months have passed, I‚Äôm deeply regretting that I left the new job and realized it was such a great career chance that wont come along anymore. I would have had financial security, my own place, and so much flexibility and independence within the new job. I seem to be in this cycle of negative thoughts. I went to psychologists but nothing seems to help. I can‚Äôt stop thinking of how I ruined my career and lost my independence while I should focus on moving forward. The longer I am without a job the harder it gets the worse the resume looks. Does anyone have any advice how to get yourself out of this depressive thinking? Would you recommend following what I always thought was my dream and do work and travel again despite my fears or look to settle down with a job here? I‚Äôm also not getting any younger‚Ä¶:/"

After applying, I did some research and found virtually nothing on bartending positions at Lifetime Fitness. At first I figured it was a juice bar, but according to the application, alcohol certifications are required and alcohol is served. 

This was rather odd to me as lifetime fitness promotes healthy lifestyles and having a bar inside the location is a tiny bit strange to me. 

The following day I received a request for an interview on site. 

Anyone familiar with or have any details at all on the position? All answers are appreciated! Thanks."

To be honest, I saw several red flags. It was an extremely new company, they didn't have a website, no logo, nothing. I met the founder; he was an okay guy but didn't seem to have any leadership experience. Still, the job paid very well, so I was happy when I got the offer. 

Right after receiving the offer letter, I emailed the founder and asked if I could meet with him and the line manager for this role. I still had some questions, which I think is completely valid seeing as they are a super new company and I wanted to meet my potential manager. After I emailed him, he replied a few days later and said he was rescinding my offer at this time. 

He said: 

""I understand that you‚Äôd prefer to have your additional questions answered before you accept the offer, however, we‚Äôre on a timeline that requires quite a bit of content to be delivered so we need to fill this role soon, which means I‚Äôll have to rescind the offer for now.

We could reschedule a meeting in the near future if you‚Äôre still interested and available then. In the meantime perhaps we could explore working together on a freelance basis if that is something that you‚Äôd be more comfortable with.""

I feel extremely upset and feel this was unfair. There is nothing wrong with doing due diligence before joining a very NEW company.

The other job I would make more and it seems like a nice place to work, I wouldn't hate it, but it does not align as closely with my interests, and it's also farther away. So I don't hear back from the 1st job til next week but I would hear back from the 2nd by tomorrow. I want to be working as soon as possible. I need money to pay my rent. If I were to be offered the 2nd job tomorrow, I don't know what I should say. Or should I then reach out to the 1st job and say I have a job offer and would like to know sooner?"

Turn over rate is very high for a professional job and instead of filling the roles of the people who have left, they add more work to current employees. Management is not actively trying to hire people, which is what I thought management was supposed to do. 

Honestly, it‚Äôs really depressing thinking about working here for a couple more months. The people who have been here a long time show that it‚Äôs never going to change and you just have to put up with it.

Should I try to stick out a year at this job or can I start looking/applying? Will it hurt me to professionally to leave a job in less than a year?"

Under normal situations, I would fill his responsibilities as the producer as I am the senior member of the team (I have one coworker). However, he did not delegate responsibilities and expects me and my coworker to ‚Äúfigure it out.‚Äù 

For context, I have been on probation for the past 4 weeks due to taking time off for some mental health issues. My coworker has also expressed that they have lost trust in me and that I don‚Äôt respect our supervisor‚Äôs authority. 

Keeping these two things in mind, I have kept myself to doing only what my supervisor has asked or delegated to me. I‚Äôve been very careful to not usurp or undermine his authority. However, if this event crashes and burns, I will be held responsible. At the same time, if I take the lead and perform the producer‚Äôs responsibilities, I‚Äôll get in trouble for acting superior and outside my ‚Äúzone‚Äù. In the initial discussion, I asked my supervisor to clarify responsibilities but he merely replied that we should just make sure everything gets done. 

What do I do? I‚Äôm not going to take the fall for something I have no control over. Feels like a play to get me fired or have disciplinary action taken against me."

Any help?",u/bluemajolica,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xlgciu/i_found_something_i_enjoy_doing_but_im_not_sure/,jobs,"I currently work as a CNC machinist at a machine shop. It's a very small business (like 8 employees) which gives me a lot of freedom to come up with ideas and manage myself, but we are endlessly understaffed (I'm currently one of two machinists), so we tend to change our processes and procedures on a weekly basis.

This leads to a lot of inconsistency in how we operate. It helps us meet deadlines, but causes a ton of headaches for everyone in the long term.

In my years there, I've worked on some side projects in my spare time, trying to streamline things, eliminate problem areas, and enhance the employee experience.

Here's some of the projects I've worked on:

Redesigning our inspection forms, trying to make them easier to use and less time consuming while still containing all the info we need.

Creating a production checklist. Trying to make the production process less cumbersome for the machinist, and more efficient for the shop as a whole.

Building a workstation template. Defining what's included at every work station, and how it's organized. Eliminating the need to ask 5 different people ""have you seen that thing?""

Building a tool library for our programming software. Haven't had the chance to work on this cause it's extremely time consuming, but I have the vision. Again the idea being ease of use.

I wrote in one performace review: ""The elements of my job that interest me the most are improved workflow and systems. Tasks I've undertaken such as trying to make the inspection process more efficient, and trying to make the operator's checklist more contained so that everything is remembered to be done every time.Also making programs more efficient and easier to decipher, while still producing good parts and being easy to run.""

I've discovered I really like figuring out ways to make things easier for people. Creating efficiency. But creating that efficiency with people in mind, the personal experience. Not production or profits.

I've had it in the back of my head that maybe there's a career I could dig into this kind of stuff further. Just a curiosity, any insight is appreciated. Thanks for reading."

1,2022-09-22,Career suicide?,u/Affectionate_Rice471,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xlhp83/career_suicide/,jobs,"Hello fine people of Reddit! I‚Äôm looking for some advice.

I have always been a type-A achiever. Worked at fancy companies, went to a fancy business school, etc. Most importantly, have largely been considered very good at my job. 

During the pandemic, I was out of a job and had to take a job at a decidedly less fancy place - but consoled myself with the fact that I would still have a chance to learn new things. That job turned out to be an admin role scheduling meetings (not billed as such and frankly could have been a much cheaper role for the company). I then landed what appeared to be the dream job. Not a name-brand company, but very very well paid and a Director level role that was a clear step up. Since I‚Äôve joined, the company (and my role/team) has seen several changes, a failed acquisition and is now being acquired by a private equity firm (read: we‚Äôre literally lame ducks waiting for layoffs to happen once the deal closes). The real issue, however, is that I genuinely suck at my job and have no motivation whatsoever to do even the bare minimum. Looking back, I honestly don‚Äôt know why my boss hired me given that I have little to no experience in the kind of work the role requires. My guess is they got distracted by the shiny names on my resume and overlooked that. 

To boot, I know my team feels my lack of motivation and poor fitness for the job and that is the absolute worst feeling in the world. I had even paid $5k for a fancy executive coach when I started because I wanted to do everything I could to be a great manager. Fast forward like 8 months and I couldn‚Äôt want to manage a team less. Most days I‚Äôm just praying to get fired so I can be put out of my misery. 

I am surrounded by similarly type-A achievers in my personal life and being told it‚Äôs insane to want to take a step back to a lower position in another company. Is that true or just a reflection of my network? Would it really be the end of my career to move somewhere else to an IC role that allows me to do work I actually feel good at?

TLDR: former type-a achiever in a job I suck at, wanting to take a step backwards in career to recover confidence and motivation."

27,2022-09-22,Gave my two weeks -- coworker mentioned that my boss might be preparing a WFH counteroffer to keep me on. How to approach?,u/DJAsphodel,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xli91r/gave_my_two_weeks_coworker_mentioned_that_my_boss/,jobs,"I've been posting on this sub frequently lately, haha.

So I gave my two weeks notice earlier this week because my employer is ending WFH. I am getting a nice boost in salary at my new fully remote job, but the salary is only a partial consideration -- if I could have kept WFH at my present job, I'd have stayed.

A coworker informed me that my boss is looking to see if I would be willing to stay on if they let me WFH permanently. This meeting has not happened yet and it's entirely possible that it never will.

In the event that it does, my first thought is that I would say yes. My boss told me on the day I gave my notice that they wouldn't be able to come close to giving a convincing salary counteroffer, so I wouldn't be looking for a raise in order to keep me on. This is a great job that I'm only leaving because they want us in the office despite our expectation that our WFH arrangements would be permanent. And I was told straight-up that I would be difficult to replace and that their resources would be stretched thin for a while to compensate for the void I'll leave. I am leaving on good terms with the team.

Is there a risk to my saying ""yes"" and just staying where I am? I've read that employees who accept salary-based counteroffers run the risk of getting fired pretty quickly because they've been deemed a flight risk. Would that be the case here, too?"

I work in a very competitive environment and I‚Äôm having a hard time navigating.,u/Get_off_my_wifi,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xllzn7/how_do_you_handle_work_relationships_when_you/,jobs,"I‚Äôve been working commission based retail jobs on and off for 11 years now. I‚Äôm 30 years old. I am extremely motivated and I work with people from all walks of life. I would like to think people find me likable. 

I work for a department store where we sell luxury clothing and goods.  The department I am in has the highest traffic and my team makes probably a minimum of $100,000 a year putting together outfits and selling them. 

I have a coworker that is a challenge for me because she consistently knit picks me. (I‚Äôll start by giving you the back story) 

Today I was supposed to get off of work at 7pm, as I was cleaning up and getting ready to end my shift and a customer I have helped a few times and most recently exchanged numbers with came in with his two friends. He was wearing the $4,000 outfit I had sold him yesterday so I went up to him said hello and complimented his outfit. I let the client know I do have to leave shortly but if there‚Äôs anything he needs he can let me know!

I started was walking and talking to him and his friends asking how their prior night went. My client told me it‚Äôs his friends birthday and he needs a pair of jeans. I asked what color he was thinking and pulled his size. The third friend also liked a pair of jeans that I had pulled. My client didn‚Äôt end up getting anything because his friend bought the jeans he wanted. 

After I wrapped up the transaction my coworker asked to speak to me. I said of course and she basically asked me if I thought it was respectful that I stayed past 7pm to help a customer. I told her the client was in yesterday I would consider him a client. He let me know it was his friends birthday and he needed jeans to go with his outfit. 

She disagreed and said I should have passed off the sale to someone else and her and another girl we work with were both very annoyed. She told me she heard me tell the client I had to leave shortly, which I did say before 7pm. I replied to her I felt as if he wanted me to help his friends so I stayed to help build my relationship with my client. 

She was upset because over the weekend she had helped one of the other guys that bought the jeans and the other girl who was irritated helped the other guy yesterday. I apologized and said I didn‚Äôt stay later to be disrespectful. 

If a customer you frequently help comes in with their friends and you have 10 minutes before your shift ends do you help provide the best customer service and make the sale or would you pass off a sale to a team member?

(Side note) I see people do this all the time. Her included. The jeans they bought I made probably $300 commission off of. 

I felt very attacked because I don‚Äôt ever approach any coworkers on when they should leave or how many clients they should take at once. I stick to myself and mind my business

I would also like to add the women who was upset with me was speaking with another coworker who was also annoyed, they stood behind the register talking about me selling. The other girl said ‚Äúwe know your circumstances which is why you move the way you do‚Äù (I‚Äôm a single mother) she looked at the women who scolded me and said that ‚Äúgod will bless us in other ways‚Äù

I only apologized because I don‚Äôt want any animosity. However I don‚Äôt believe I am wrong."

My boss accused me of stealing money, lying about what I purchased, and falsifying records.  They claimed the prices on the receipt could not be accurate and that I purchased unauthorized items. For example, gas cost $75 rountrip. Boss accused me of purchasing non gas items at the gas station and claiming it was.  Boss did the same thing for the hotel room - accused me of purchasing alcohol and gift store items. However,  ALL of the  receipts were  itemized. Plus I was instructed on what/ how to purchase things and followed all budgets and protocols. They then told me that they would not reimburse for any of the business trip (completely work related, no leisure) because of the price.  I refused.

I went to school for communications hoping to pivot into the public relations field. I started applying to a bunch of jobs in July/August and after countless rejections I was able to recently accept three internships. I do one remote (unpaid), one MWF in person which is paid and a T&amp;TH which is in person, unpaid. All of my internships are directly correlated to marketing/public relations. I've been working my Tuesday and Thursday internship for a few weeks now and I really grew fond of it, and even though its my first week at the MWF everyone has been super nice but I can already tell there is no room to grow much here other than maybe networking opportunities.

Anyways, I just got offered a big trainee opportunity with a big sports team that I think would be a great networking and starting point in my career (at least it would probably look good on a resume). The only issue is that it's not directly in the field I hope to work in (PR/Marketing). And to accept it means to quit my other internships as this is a full-time position (I'd be working all throughout the week plus any home games and events) with a possible extended offer at the end. Is taking this job the right decision even though it's not directly in my field?

I started a new job about 1.5 months ago and realized something odd about the team dynamics. Thanks in advance for reading. 

The company is overall great - friendly ppl and good company culture. However my team is always the one staying late til the whole office left. My directors would send out messages at 9pm and my coworker would respond immediately and work until they go to bed, even for non urgent cases. For my previous experience, I came from an agency with toxic hours (10-11 hrs daily average without proper lunch break) so I strongly want to get a work/life balance in my new job. So I‚Äôm super anxious when I found out my teammates are all a bit workaholic. 

I think working outside of normal hours means a lack of time management skill. Plus the work our team delivered were no better than other teams who typical live a 9-5 life. But at the same time, if I‚Äôm not following the same workflow, my directors might think I‚Äôm not a hard worker. What should I do as a newbie? Any advice will be appreciated!"

The rest of us will get assigned the easy, mundane, unimportant jobs - the kind of job you could train a monkey to do.

So even though we're supposed to all be equals - we all have the same job title and the same pay rate - the supervisors don't seem to treat us as equals.

I'd love to practice doing the more challenging and fun tasks, but literally every shift, I'm told by whoever my supervisor is that they already chose someone else to do that job, and they need me to do this other job instead.

I'll never grow as an employee, get a promotion or make any career progress if I just do the same things every shift...

Sat down with the owner of my company at his request today. Small construction firm less that 10 employees. Im in the office as a manager.

He feels Im not fully bought into the company as they see huge growth ahead in 12-18 months.

He asked me if I like it there and if Im stying there. I responded yes. He wants us to meet again in a few days to see how he can motivate me and get me more bought into the company.

Been there almost 2 years. However over the previous year they have
-‚Äúrestructured‚Äù my agreed bonus and havent given me the terms yet
-was 4 months late paying my first year bonus

-gave a company truck to a new hire immediately when I waited the typical 3 month probation period

-my truck was 3 months late arriving and I needed to use my personal vehicle

-higher a new manager that was supposed to be my boss. No experience. Was not announced he was my boss until it showed up in his email signature. Asks basic questions to me that a person in his position should be well equipped to answer.

-my boss and the owner are good buddies and likely why he was hired and also feel alienated as Im not in their inner circle 

So do I push the issue and drop alot of bombs on Monday or not make waves and hunt around and see whats out there"

I just really hate what I do, and i hate having to drive 45 minutes in the morning to be there, 1hr-1 1/2hr home.

They pay me well, and I basically spend 80% of my time reading wikipedia articles about neolithic anatolia or whatever. But still I hate my job, and I know I shouldn‚Äôt but I still do. I‚Äôm salary, and my boss‚Äôs are cool enough to let me work whatever hours I want as long as I get my work done, but it‚Äôs still soul-sucking. I guess I just need encouragement, because the only problem
is I could do 90% of my job from
home, but they don‚Äôt offer that, I just wish I felt better about having such a great deal,
because I realize I‚Äôm basically set, but I still hate it."

2,2022-09-23,Found the Post for my Job,u/Gwenbyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xlt03b/found_the_post_for_my_job/,jobs,"I've been working at this company for almost 2 years. In that time they have treated me like a piece of furniture. For the first year+ I worked in the office pretty much alone due to COVID. I was the only person in the entire company that couldn't work from home. I didn't mind as my house was 3 minutes from the office. I was never really trained and had to figure it out for myself. My supervisor wouldn't answer my emails and pretty much ignored me for the first 3 months. No one communicates with me or lets me know what is going on and I work the front desk.  Overall it's the weirdest company I've ever worked for.

I have gotten the feeling over the past months that they were quietly firing me. Fact is they were looking for an office mom that would make them feel all warm and comfy and I am NOT that person. I was there to work, but that they did not offer that. I've been looking for months. I've had interviews but so far nothing.

This week I was so excited. Two interviews today! One job I really wanted as it would have been a great fit. The other job includes being a personal assistant and I'm not thrilled with having to be available after hours and weekends, but it's a job.

Well, last night I get a message from the job I really wanted to cancel the ""meeting"". No message to reschedule, so pretty much I was told no thanks. Then as I'm looking through the job postings online I come across a job in my town. Great! I start reading it, and something feels really familiar about the job description. I look up the company and it's for recruiting. It's my job posted. 

I find it ironic that they are posting for roles that they have refused to allow me to do for 2 years.  I never knew what happened because no one said a word to me. I got no feedback, no follow up, and essentially no communication. I'll admit that given that I sit there day after day withering away and having my soul sucked out, that I've checked out more and more.  I've even taken all my stuff home because I didn't know if I could bring myself to go back. 

I'm posting this and sending it into the ether to vent. I'll confess that I'm a bit scared if I don't get this job today.  I just don't know what the fuck happened to my life. 2 years ago I had a good job, a shot at real retirement, and today it's all gone to shit. I'm older so that doesn't help, but still too young to retire. If I don't get the job I'll have to wait for them to finally fire me so I can at least collect unemployment. 

The thing is that I know they covered up an illegal sexual harassment. The person that was harassed even had to quit because they would not fire the person that was committing the act. Why? well she is best friends with one of the principals wife and an ex drinking buddy with another one. There is also that one of the principals I believe retaliated against me because I wouldn't pad project billing. Am I really supposed to put a task to a project if it only took my 5 minutes?  The reason this is relevant is that they rely on federal contracts. I'm pretty sure the federal government wouldn't be pleased to find out they are trying to pad bills let alone that they covered up an illegal act. I'll wait and see how aggressive they get with me, but it's really bothered me that I am working with people that would allow someone to sexually harass an employee to the point that they almost lost their marriage. 

So that is my story of woe. I'll either have another job by the end of the day or I'll have to fake next week at work and just wait for them to fire me. I'd love to quit but I need the back up of unemployment. One thing I know for sure, I'm really sick and tired with people being able to mess with my life and there isn't shit I can do about it."

I graduated, sat the Bar in the UK, completed it, and am still losing out on every legal role i can find - and that includes jobs that a second year law student could do. Not to toot my own horn but objectively speaking, I'm overqualified for a lot of jobs I'm not getting (and I know people that are overqualified in these lower-level jobs trying to work their way up). I don't think it helped that I graduated in the peak of covid and the job i was lined up for fell through, so I went straight into the Bar and so haven't had a job for a long time.

I guess I don't quite know what to do. I've been put forward to a mentor but I don't quite know what to say to that person because I'm just so down now. I just need  a job before the gap in my CV gets too big.

Just feel like I needed to vent a little here, I don't know anyone in my close circle that's going through the same thing, or was going through the same thing."

3,2022-09-23,New job - tough decision,u/OptionsGuru24,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xlv3b6/new_job_tough_decision/,jobs,"I was recently laid off from a company after starting there at a senior manager role. I made several valuable connections and have plenty of higher ranking internal connections in my network. A new position has opened up that is fully remote, however, it is a manager role with a lower pay range but I have been assured my salary will remain the same. The new role is fully remote versus my previous hybrid (3 in office, 2 wfh) and it has been positioned to me as a holding pattern until a larger role comes up. As we approach (or are already in) a recession, I have noticed the job market is slowing up for higher level (VP or Director) roles. Looking for some advice as to whether being a loyal company man for the sake of advancement is worth a lateral move or should I just be patient, enjoy my time off and search furiously for a new role. 

The role will be relatively easy as I am very familiar with the work, but my fear is working at a lower level will be seen as a negative on my resume for future opportunities and I will be kicking myself if something internal or external comes up in a couple months that will be higher paying. 

Thanks!"

( looong rant ) .,u/FuturePalpitation885,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xlxv4s/chickfila_bs_or_legit_looong_rant/,jobs,"My son is 17 and works at Chick. He‚Äôs always been responsible and helps out by taking other shifts when needed. Yesterday he was sick with a cold yet when asked ,stayed 4 hrs longer than his shift  just to help. He got worse during the night with a fever so I called early this AM to let his shift leader know and that‚Äôs when shit hit the fan.

His manager asked me what was ‚Äúwrong with him‚Äù when I didn‚Äôt give her any details . First off , that‚Äôs none of their business. He‚Äôs sick and he‚Äôs not coming in is all they‚Äôre required to know but I told her anyway. Next , she said he would be written up if he didn‚Äôt bring in a Drs note because ‚Äúwe all go to the ER or Dr when we‚Äôre sick‚Äù(that‚Äôs what she said ) For one day? No ,WE Don‚Äôt . ER visits with my co-pay are$ 300 and Drs visits have co-pays too when almost always all that‚Äôs needed is to stay in bed for a day to rest and recover not to mention he‚Äôs 17 with a PT job with NO benefits so this day is not paid. 

She then proceeds to tell me that HE needs to find coverage for his shift because it‚Äôs not fair to them to have to scramble to find coverage. (I called 4 hrs ahead) I‚Äôm starting to get upset at all this back and forth because who TF can give 24-48hrs heads up when they get sick ? I tell her that i‚Äôm not going to get my son who‚Äôs sick and has a fever to try and find you coverage. That‚Äôs  YOUR job. She then continues to tell me that NO other parent has EVER called to complain about any of these ‚Äúpolicies‚Äù (I guess i‚Äôm the troublemaker ) and that my son should have been responsible enough to call out himself . 

I‚Äôm  still trying to keep calm and not lose my patience and tell her  AGAIN that my son can barely talk which is why i‚Äôm calling and ask if I can speak to someone above her because I need to know if any of these policies are in the  employee manual in writing and not just shit that her store is implementing verbally. She literally tells me ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs home sleeping .He doesn‚Äôt come in until later. I‚Äôm the one in charge and he‚Äôs going to tell you the same thing ‚Äú. 

Ok , so at this point i‚Äôm really fucking angry because she doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúinterrupt‚Äù her boss  who‚Äôs sleeping yet wanted  MY son to get up and find coverage when he‚Äôs laying in bed sick AF. So after more time spent back and forth, she tells me that she‚Äôs not going to write him up this time but that our conversation is going to go in his file for future reference if this happens again . (gotta love the implied threat ).

I don‚Äôt want to cause problems for my son  because he needs a job but he‚Äôs also not a damn slave and has rights as an employee. I‚Äôm considering calling corporate to find out if what she said is company policy and legit or not but honestly  , fuck you -Fil-A 

EDIT: To those of you who keep on commenting on WHY my son didn‚Äôt call himself and had his ‚Äúmommy‚Äù call. He woke up with 101 fever and a sore throat where he could barely speak in a whisper so he asked me to call in and not text in  case they didn‚Äôt get the message in time. That‚Äôs him being responsible and i‚Äôm proud of him for that . Imagine if he‚Äôd been the one to call and this manager put him through all the BS she did me .It boggles my mind that out of everything in my post some people just choose to grab on to that to insult my parenting .I‚Äôll keep on protecting him and be here for him in every way and whenever he asks regardless if he‚Äôs 17 or 70 ."

Fast forward to today i am at a different job and currently applying to a new one. They called me for an interview and sent me an application to complete before the interview. On the application it asks if ive ever been dismissed or asked to resign in lieu of dismissal. 
I have terrible anxiety and i feel like what happened 2 years ago is going to hurt my chances of getting this job i feel like im a good fit for. I cant explain why they let me go. All my file says is ‚Äúreleased from probationary period‚Äù and to a hiring manager that might look bad.

1,2022-09-23,How to best resign,u/northerngasgirl,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xm2ukg/how_to_best_resign/,jobs,"So how would you resign...I'm currently out on medical leave from my job. The reason I'm currently out is due to postponing my surgery at the convenience of my employer. I initially requested to have my procedure in May, but we are so short staffed they told me no and to schedule in September. Yes, I'm aware they cannot do this, but I have a great relationship with my boss and my surgery was not an emergency, and delaying surgery did not change my outcome. During the summer, I completed my doctorate, which opened up many doors for me. Over the past two months, I have interviewed for several jobs and now have two job offers that are in my field with amazing offers.
At the same time, I was passed over for a promotion at my current job, despite receiving a perfect 5.0 evaluation since starting with the company four years ago. I believe my boss was tipped off to my other job interviews/offers because she called me while on medical leave which is frowned upon by the organization.   She told me she was afraid I would leave and that when I returned to work, she would develop a position to use my new skills. She did not know what that new job would be as she needed to create it and did not know how to cover my clinical hours. I have little faith that she will develop a job that will actually use my skills and take me out of clinical since we have a vacancy rate of 20% in my department.  So I must now decide what job to take and how to resign from my current position. I must give four weeks' notice to my current employer, or I am not eligible for rehire. I don't want to burn any bridges because they are the largest employer in my field in the area. The issue is that I cannot return to work for six more weeks due to surgery. So I would take a terminal medical leave, which they would not pay me for because you cannot use leave for your last four weeks. I could start my new job and give notice four weeks before my return to work and have an income from my new job as one option. I want to stay on as a per diem employee at my current job (I'm in healthcare), so I don't want to jeopardize this by not executing this precisely. Advice????"

For context, i have only been working there for 3 weeks when I was promoted to supervisor postion. (This is a high end cafe) I have never been in a position where im supervising people and they just basically told me that I am supervisor, no training or anything. 

I am good at math so never mess up any of the money counts, reports, or cash deposits. They are perfect every time I do them. 

However, the other day the owner told me to ask one of the clerks to clean something. I said sure, I asked the person and watched them go clean it. 5 days had passed and now the owner is extremely upset with me asking why it was never cleaned. I told him my coworker did, and now he says we will have to have a chat because of this. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, I closed that same night. While I count all the cash, an employee is to clean the espresso machine and I WATCH him do it (not to mention hes been an employee there for a full year). 

The next day, the other supervisor writes in the report (which goes to all the execs and owner) that the espresso machine was in fact not cleaned. (Rude of her not to just text me but ok)

I understand that its my job to make sure people are cleaning things correctly. I should have checked over their work but as this is my first time managing people I am just learning these things. Now I have a pit in my stomach that I am going to get fired over two of my coworkers half ass cleaning jobs. 

What should I do???"

I do have a good relationship with my coworkers, and my manager is more or less ok. It is the long hours that get to me, and even when I‚Äôm off I get called in for someone else. The work is too repetitive for me to enjoy. I‚Äôm currently looking for other work, but I wanted to know if there is any real consequences if you just stopped showing up to work. I learned a lot about responsibility and good communication, and wanted to try it in a new environment, and importantly set boundaries so I won‚Äôt have to constantly meet up with the ‚Äúyour so reliable‚Äù expectations.

What am I supposed to do?? I‚Äôm highly considering quitting at this point, I was already planning to do so in like 4 months but I might just do it now"
2,2022-09-23,Is a 1.5 hour commute (3 hour round trip) worth it for my job?,u/ygros,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xm5zit/is_a_15_hour_commute_3_hour_round_trip_worth_it/,jobs,"My job just recently announced that they'd be calling employees back to the office, but only on a 3 day a week basis. The problem is, during COVID, I moved back to my hometown to be closer to my family.

My hometown is about 80 miles from the city proper where my work is, so it's about a 1.5 hour drive, or 3 hours altogether.

I lived in the city before COVID, and hated it, which is why I moved back to my hometown. However I'm not sure if it'll be worth the drive.

Some additional details, plus benefits. My work doesn't require me to be there the full 8 hours (they actually didn't state a minimum time present, just that we had to be there atleast for a portion of the day). I even know a few of my coworkers who will go in just for a 2 hour meeting, or do 2 hours of desk work then leave at off rush hour times to avoid traffic. A lot of our work involves being on the phone or in meetings, so a lot of it can be done on the road as well thankfully, if planned appropriately.

I also make about $86K at the job, so I don't believe gas would be an issue.

To be honest maybe I'm just trying to justify it to myself at this point!!

I recently started a marketing &amp; communications job and started smack dab in the middle of the busiest time of year for the company. In the interview process I told them I learn best by doing and hands-on work (possibly my mistake) so I was thrown right into the work with minimal training or supervision from my direct manager. Some screw-ups here and there but I thought I was doing alright.

Fast forward 7 months, the busy season is done, and I have a meeting with my direct manager where they had a list recorded of every mistake I've made in the past 7 months (from big ones like renewing an annual subscription for software when the company only wanted it back for a few months  - when I hit renew I didn't know they used to pay annually - to small mistakes like spelling errors in an E-Blast). Some were out of my control but I know it will make me look worse to come up with excuses. I was a little blindsided that they kept a record of them. Kind of seems like they're keeping everything on file for grounds to fire? 

Anyways, we have a follow-up meeting next week and I have no clue what to expect. As I said above, I've never really been bad at my job before, so I'm not sure how to handle this. Or what I'm supposed to say in the meeting besides, ""I know I made mistakes, I'll try not to next time."""

They are fairly big and well known in their niche. When I was talking to the recruiter he read off the job description, couldn't answer most of the questions I had, and just seemed to be going through the motions. In the middle of the interview he asked if I had any questions. I asked 4 of them and then asked him if he had any more questions for me. He proceeded to say that he was not finished with his part of the interview. Then there were several moments of awkward pauses from the recruiter.

In the past I did not encounter recruiters like this but now I've run into this in four interviews. What can I do on my end to ensure that the recruiter leads the interview? Or at least ensure that they do not feel that I am trying to take up all the time on the call?"

I am in high school right now, and I have been thinking a lot lately about what career I want to pursue, but I cannot seem to find one that matches everything I want. My ideas are:

1. Astronomer

I have loved astronomy for a very long time, and I think it's a fascinating field. I often stay up all night to observe galaxies, stars, etc. However, most astronomers have a PhD, and as far as I know, obtaining a PhD is a very stressful and time consuming task, and I tend to panic under extreme stress and deadlines. Also, I absolutely hate the idea of sitting at a desk, working on a computer all day, which I know is what the majority of astronomers do most of the time.

2. Environmental Science

I also think this is a very interesting and relevant field. I want to have a job that makes a positive difference in the world, and I think this would. Also, I love being out in nature, and I know some environmental science jobs have a lot of fieldwork involved. However, I know that many have hardly any fieldwork.

3. Librarian

This is one that I haven't thought about much yet, but it still is one of my options so far. I love reading, and I would happily spend all or most of my free time doing just that. I want to share that love. Also, a librarian is one of the least stressful jobs according to some rankings, and that would work well with me, I think.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any advice on how to I can reach clarity regarding which path is best for me? How can I find out more about what day-to-day life is like in each one? Thank you."

What should I do?,u/spookiki96,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xmeq2m/my_company_is_trying_to_cheat_me_out_of_severance/,jobs,"I had a meeting today with my supervisor and head director. We discussed how I haven't been meeting their expectations. My supervisor has been extremely demanding and unpredictable mood-wise. They also have been scheduling meetings outside of my schedule (6am) because of the time difference (remote job) and getting mad at me for not showing up. I've been stressed out for a whole year and decided that, yeah, this is probably just not a good fit. It would be best if I'm let go peacefully.

At the end of the meeting, my director said that I can either resign or have a performance plan but they clearly emphasized that things were not working and wanted me to leave. I said I would take my time to think about it. Honestly, I'm shocked that after all I've done for them, they aren't even going to offer me severance pay. I feel like they are hoping I don't know better.

I'm looking for any advice on how to move forward. Do I even have to put in my two weeks anymore knowing how shady and disrespectful they have been towards to me?

Edit: I am in California and the company's main office is in New York."

When the Q&amp;A session came I made an absolute embarrassment of myself since I couldn't answer most of the questions. I nervously whipped up answers that made no sense and proceeded to see the second-hand embarrassment on everyone's faces. This may have been my cringiest interview.

I've given this talk multiple times before, but I wasn't expecting the questions they threw at me today.

As part of round 3, I have one-to-one interviews next week with the hiring team. Of course, I am too embarrassed to show face. Did I sabotage my interview already by being unable to answer the questions? Is it worth withdrawing at this point?"

Most of it is because my supervisor is a literal walking HR nightmare. This lady has called/texted me on my personal phone during my off hours and harassed/threatened me on multiple occasions‚Ä¶and not just me. We actually did try to report her on 3 separate occasions but HR basically laughed it off. 

While I want to get out of doing lab work, I majored in bio and have little work experience to show otherwise. Majority of my college life was dedicated to gaining clinical hours for PA school. I decided a week after graduation that it isn‚Äôt for me nor am I rly doing it for myself. From there I applied to over 300 jobs before landing the one I‚Äôm working at right now. 

I‚Äôm looking for jobs again but it‚Äôs hard to find a job that isn‚Äôt a lab position because of my background. The more pressing matter atm is to get out of my current workplace, but I don‚Äôt want to set myself up to fully launch a career in science. 

I‚Äôve been considering dropping everything and going full time for an MBA since I‚Äôd rly like to get into project management. My parents were the ones who suggested this to not only help with a career switch but to also get away from this job that is evidently messing with me mentally. I told them I don‚Äôt want to do that because it doesn‚Äôt guarantee me finding a job if I don‚Äôt have prior experience. But after months of rejections again and my supervisor getting crazier by the day, maybe they‚Äôre right.

I‚Äôm desperate and a little afraid for my future now. Is an MBA even worth it?"

35,2022-09-23,Missing in action co-worker,u/LifeisbutAdream1791,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xmhhss/missing_in_action_coworker/,jobs,"I started a 100% remote job 3 months ago with a great salary, excellent benefits and a phenomenal manager who has a human side to her.  Our job is split by regions.  The regions under my manager has me paired with a guy on my team.  Since we share a region he is the designated person to train me and show me the ropes.  I‚Äôm not in 100 % in training mode, but I have the basic function of the job and as different scenarios arise he is responsible to train me. The problem is he is missing in action 80% of the time.  He shared with me he is a functioning alcoholic, a pothead and he does these activities during work hours.  I guess he was a little tipsy when he told me and he thought it was something I‚Äôd be impressed by.

Whatever he does isn‚Äôt my business or concern to me, but here‚Äôs my biggest issue.  When I have an issue and I ping him in Teams either I never get an answer the entire day or he‚Äôll pop up towards the end of the day asking can we revisit the issue the next day because he had to take care of something.  I know he‚Äôs logged into Teams and email on his phone because there are times he‚Äôll respond to my question instead of sharing his screen.  When he is at home and not in the streets running free, I know because he will have me share my screen and assist me- this is few and far between lately.

In a 5-day work week I‚Äôm lucky if he‚Äôs home &amp; working a good 2-days.  I‚Äôve learned his pattern- he works Monday &amp; Tuesday, by Wednesday I‚Äôm lucky if he responds to my pings and Thursday and Friday you can forget it. I know this one time he called me on Teams on his phone, but the dead giveaway was when he said, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that on my windshield‚Äù. When he‚Äôs available I‚Äôm getting what I need to be successful in my job and when he‚Äôs not I‚Äôm just frustrated and angry this behavior that‚Äôs blatantly obvious to me has never been addressed by management.  During the day a large majority of the time he‚Äôs either idle on Teams(yellow) or he puts himself as busy(red)until he goes to idle.  I picked up on when he puts himself on busy in Teams because you stay in ‚Äúbusy‚Äù mode longer while doing nothing before it goes to idle(yellow).

Just from talking with him I know he thinks he‚Äôs smarter than everyone else and pulling the wool over everyone‚Äôs eyes. The problem I have is he‚Äôs hindering me from successfully learning my job because he‚Äôs a selfish piece of garbage.  Every 2 weeks my manager has a 1-on-1 with everyone on her team and my next meeting I intend to address with her about his lack of availability to effectively train me minus the part about him being a functioning alcoholic and pothead.   I need suggestions on how to properly address this without looking like the complaining new girl.

Back to the offer, I did counter reply to negotiate the salary but then the head of that staffing called me and mentioned that I wasn‚Äôt professional for wasting their time and not accepting the offer in the first place. Im pretty sure I did well in my interview cause the panel really like how i story tell my skillset and experience.

I am a 23 year old male that is now working fulltime for 1.5 years at my company. I started to work there after I finished school at got my degree. Regarding the job itself I absolutely like working there. Got awesome co workers and the company is just good for its employees in general. 

However, sometimes I still meet my old classmates and then things like salary is a topic sometimes. And I really find that a difficult one. I never even share my own salary, because I think it‚Äôs private and I don‚Äôt really want to feel ashamed for what I get or make others feel bad. I don‚Äôt really have a bad salary. I think compared to my old classmates (that shared their salary) it‚Äôs around average, but I have some old classmates that really earn a lot more then more. Some even 500$/month. I would lie it I wouldn‚Äôt be affected by this. I get a bit jealous and disappointed in myself and my own career because of it. I just cannot get in my mind that some of them earn to much more when I can do the exact same things and have the exact same qualities as them. 

I was really enjoying my job and I though I had a decent salary. I even got a bonus and an increase because they wanted to reward me for delivering good work. I was very excited to hear that till I heard that even with my new salary it wasn‚Äôt as high as those other old classmates. and now yea I still enjoy my job but idk about my salary anymore. 

It really makes me doubt the career path I have chosen for now, because if they can earn to much more then me with the same degree am I doing something wrong? 
Now I am in the work field I am also a bit struggling with starting at zero. And yes I know everybody starts at zero somewhere in their career. But do you guys get what I am trying to say? I‚Äôm afraid that if I ever take a next step that for me it‚Äôs much larger then my old classmates because I come from lower."

Apologies if I used the wrong flair too.

*Fresh grad, no knowledge in the world of work, first job, probationary*.

I nicely talked to my TL that I want to resign ***immediately***. I obliged when he asked for a medical proof about the health I'm using for the reason of leaving the company. After submitting the letter, I didn't show up anymore.

It was my fault I don't regularly open my accounts. FB, Messenger, Gmail, Yahoo, name it all. 2 months after my leave (which is May), I decided to open my Gmail only to see they sent me a letter. It was about them sending a RTWO letter to my house in April, failure to report back to work thus leading to my termination. To be honest all throughout from March until May, not even a shadow of notice letter from them came in the mailbox except electric and water bills.

I decided not to show up anymore since the 5 days grace period they gave has passed already.

6 months have passed since that and I badly ***need*** a job now but FEAR IS EATING ME. If I put my past exp, the HR will find my misconduct. If I don't, they still have a chance to discover the discrepancy between the CV I submitter from my work records.

So I have some questions:

1. **Can I still do my clearance for CoE** (it's been 5 months since my termination in April)
2. **Do I still have a right to get my backpay**
3. **What is the difference of backpay from bond**
4. **Won't I get a fine from NCNS** (I read smwh, AWOL-ing made someone pay for it)
5. **Is NCNS same with AWOL**
6. **Can I opt not to include the previous job if I decided to settle with the CoE**
7. **Will the HR from prev comp tell I got terminated if the HR of the comp I'm applying calls them**
8. **Can I ask for a copy of the signed contract**  
the previous company didn't let us have a chance to read those papers we signed that was so like a book lol, just left a copy of one paper which only contains the hourly rate
9. **Unspoken** **DOs and DONTs** (if there are)  
some said I should say ""no"" when asked in interview if I have a plan to go abroad or go back to school and is recommended to ask about the job's benefits + terms in interview

**PH/Filipino members:**  
will the HR if the com I'm applying to discover my previous job/employment by checking my SSS?

This is really long in order to give the bigger picture and context. For those who made it here, thank you for the patience. (***Guys, I badly need help and advices please.)***"

I work at an animal shelter as a receptionist. It's the only job that took me from filling out an application alone and not needing my resume after applying to literally hundreds of jobs.

I have been there for a few weeks. The front desk girls are incredibly cliquey but most are nice enough!

When I started I felt pretty at ease. Now I dread my shifts and I'm only part time. (Apparently it's incredibly difficult to get bumped up to full. Didn't know that until recently. But okay. No big deal.)

I'll be completely honest. At first I was like ""im helping animals find homes, I'm not in it for the money!"" Now im like ""animals finding homes is incredibly important to me, but fuck I wish I was getting paid enough to live."" I still want to stay in the realm of helping animals. I'm passionate about them, all furbabies deserve loving homes, but it's also incredibly draining work. And I feel my depression sky rocketing from the shit I've seen so far. I'm fully aware that it's a shelter and that's to be expected I just didn't expect to deal with heavy, borderline violent owners in a months time.

Is there anyway to still work with animals (heavy on animals. Not so much receptionist work) and finding homes while being paid a somewhat decent wage? I don't know where my path lies in a career but I want animals to be a part of it."

I worked here for a year and a half in a (basically junior level of a) quality engineering role before COVID lay-offs. I have two Bachelor's degrees: Systems Engineering and Economics. This year, I tried to get back with the company in an actual quality engineering role. I had a 35 year employee directly recommend me for the position, as well as my previous mentor text me out of nowhere advising me that the role was open. I didn't get the job, but the kid who DID get it (and who also works with the same engine programs that I worked on but I got paid about $10k a year less) insisted on meeting me one day because he heard I was working on the shop floor and he had seen my name on a lot of successful work that I had completed in in my previous role. The quality engineer hired before him literally worked FOR me as an intern in root cause analyses before I was laid-off. There is another engineer who avoided lay-offs who was an intern when I started.

Now I work in NDI (Non-Destructive Inspection). My two colleagues and myself have been through two class sessions, three written exams, and an on-the-job practical exam to obtain a Level I certification, but only one of us has received a pay raise. Granted, this employee worked here for seven years, but that was five years ago, and we are currently holding the same position. There is a current opening for my same position and the job description states that pay increases are based on attaining these certifications. I'm frustrated now. I feel like this place doesn't respect me. I went to one of the best engineering schools in my home state, but it doesn't seem like they even care to understand that down here. I reached out to a former supervisor-type person and was recommended for this current role, but I wasn't recommended for an engineering role because of dress policy. Dress policy? Because my hair and beard are too long for a guy? Guarantee I had the most expensive polos in that office. There is an opening for an engineering job on the site right now that I'm tempted to apply for (although I supposedly can't move positions for two years from my hire date), but the job title and the job summary aren't for the same position. Go figure.

Maybe this is a rant, but I've been thinking too much on it and it's making me resent that place every day I show up on time and do my job to the best of my abilities.

What should I do? Thanks in advance for any advice. Just ugh."

3,2022-09-24,Why is it taking so long for them to fire me?,u/razor823,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xmvqh4/why_is_it_taking_so_long_for_them_to_fire_me/,jobs,"I think I‚Äôm going to get fired, but it feels like it is taking an unnecessarily long time for them to do it.

I‚Äôve been with this company for 8 years now. I‚Äôve never had any issues with my work performance before. My previous 4 managers always seemed to enjoy having me on their team. They‚Äôve always recommended me for work projects, and I‚Äôve always received good work performance reviews: I was always meeting or exceeding my metrics and performance reviews. 

My current manager was promoted earlier this year to a management position. They were previously part of our QI department, but it just feels like they are being way overly critical of my work and micromanaging too much, when my previous managers weren‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt agree with the performance reviews I‚Äôve received from my new manager, but that‚Äôs not really the point.

I‚Äôm currently on 30 day probation after receiving a 30 day write up in July. Basically my manager said I could get fired at any point now, but that my 30 day probation ends in October.

My question is, why is this process taking so long? If my performance is as bad as they are claiming, why are they not just cutting their losses and letting me go? My suspicion is that they are hoping I get another job and quit so they don‚Äôt have to pay me severance or any benefits if they fire me. I‚Äôve been applying for other jobs, but I‚Äôm not getting any responses. I‚Äôve never been fired before and I‚Äôve never been written up at any job, so I have no idea if this is the normal process.

Everyone keeps telling me I‚Äôm being paranoid, and that everything will be fine, but I‚Äôm not sure. 

So do you think I‚Äôm correct in that they want me to quit instead of firing me? Or do you think I‚Äôm overthinking it?

TL;DR: I think my job wants to fire me, but they keep dragging out the process and I‚Äôm not sure why."

Would Costco be a good outlet for that? If I apply there would they accommodate the hours I can work? Or would they want me to work other hours as well?

Is this something that I could go and ask customer service to talk to a manager and just ask if they're hiring for those shifts?

I come to you with a somewhat different problem. Like some of you, I graduated during the pandemic and have been on the job hunt for [insert number] of months. For context, I have 3+ years of work experience in my field before I went back for my master's. I've always suffered from depression on and off. But lately, the stress and overall uncertainty for the future have weirdly manifested into regular bouts of eye twitching. I notice it happens most often when I'm on LinkedIn, or in general thinking about the whole recruitment process. I worry my sub-conscience is desperately trying to tell me something and I can't understand it. 

I'm not seeking validation or reassurance that everything will be okay, but rather for any job searching perspectives or stories that can help me reframe my shitty outlook.

Please and thank you!

31 years old. Engineer.

Got surprise-fired today after working my ass off for this company for 5 years.

Obivously feel devastated, and guilty towards my wife/kids. Like, I let them down kinda guilt.

Trying to look forward I feel I need to reassess my goals and future. Things I wish to do:

First, take a break after all the stress of the last year and process my feelings. Stay with family a bit, maybe go somewhere, meet an old pal in another city. Maybe get a therapist.

Second, start working on some skills related to my branch and solidify my skillset.

Third, explore new skills such as entrepreneurship, business and marketing.

Fourth, meet new people working in various businesses. To understand how things work and how people get their projects to run.

&amp;#x200B;

All this can take up some time. What worries me it will produce a large gap in resume.

Not sure would you guys advise to take advantage for the free time I got now to refresh and broaden my skills, discover new things in life.

Or better not risk it - just find a new job ASAP to ensure professional security by avoiding a large gap.

(I do have enough money for several years of non-work.)"

How can I ever take my 2 vacation weeks if I don‚Äôt accrue them until the last week of December and there is no roll over ? Asking because I might need to take the 2 full weeks around April next year and just stay with sick days the rest of the year. In this case is it possible for me to do that?

I was interviewing for an internship  at a design company let call it Cosmic designs. Anyway when I told the recruiter that I worked at Wallyworld he said he heard some bad stuff about it. I just told him about my experience. Another thing to take note this was not a very professional interview. I liked how cool he was and the place seemed like a great place to learn and work. However it was not very professional that for the interview he was dressed like he was going to to go for a jog. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love causal work places but he could have done better. Also his kid was in the room during the interview, he interrupted the interview to deal with his kid. I didn‚Äôt get the internship. I did check back but because of covid he said he could take anyone on so I going to call them Monday. Should I have said anything negative about my job  even though he thinks it‚Äôs a bad place to work?"

Most of the time, this has not been a problem for me as I usually leave the job on good terms and have no reason to just walk out.

However, three times in my life I've been fired with no notice at all. On two of these occasions the company was suffering from poor management (in my opinion) and the manager went on a firing spree, sacking at least one other person besides myself.

With this in mind, I've begun to seriously question whether two weeks notice is still a moral issue. If it's an inconvenience to the employer if I suddenly quit, is it not a much greater inconvenience to me to suddenly have no job and no income? Do I really owe them this simple courtesy when they will not do the same for me?

Let's ignore practical concerns such as having a good reference. I would just like to have some good discussion on the moral/philosophical aspect of the issue."

I didn‚Äôt feel ready at the time. Three months after that I asked for a meeting with my boss and asked for a promotion and raised, giving excellent reasons for why I deserve both. My boss agreed, but the company policy is that raises and promotions are only given at the start of the new year. Looking into the average salary for someone in my field and experience, I should be making $65k minimum, although, I highly doubt my company will offer that, given the senior in my role, having been there for nine years, is only making $79k (and he is an absolute genius). Provided my company offers me a number lower than I am hoping for, how do I negotiate up to at minimum $65k?"

I gave him my resume and he forwarded it on. My thinking at the time was that I'd ""suss it out."" 

A week later (after an interview) and I've been offered the position. 

I'm torn about accepting it or not? I currently work at a call centre in quality assurance. The job is boring but pays okay (55k a year). The only downside is that it's not a permanent position and I get a 6 month contract to do it each time (which has been extended twice) and my current contract is due to end in 3 weeks (waiting to hear if it will be extended again). 

If the contract isn't extended then I go back onto the phones and I lose out on pay. Which isn't too much, but I'll be on at least 47k with potential to get 52k a year. 

This receptionist/admin job pays 46.7k a year and I'll have to study a certificate (they can't tell me what it is I'll be studying, but it'd be something along admin work). 

I have been job hunting very recently. But I'm not sure if I should accept this job? It sounds boring (just greeting clients and answering phones) and the pay is slightly less. The certificate isn't a make or break deal for me either as my current workplace offers certificates. 

I almost want to say no but worry my thoughts are clouded with the anxiety of changing jobs and the idea that I might be too picky. What are your thoughts?"

I don't have any regular job that I can list in my work history on a resume. I have a background interest and some education in IT, so I'm considering going into that field if possible.

I have a two year degree from 2015 in Electronic Engineering Technology. I also have some CompTIA certificates in security and networking. They're old but they're grandfathered in and don't expire.

At the time I was interested in security. That's still my first choice today but I also know a little about networking and programming, and I'm not very picky about which field I start out in.

So now I have two questions. First, am I starting from scratch in terms of my qualifications? It seems like with no work experience, old certifications, and not having a four year degree, I can hardly distinguish myself from any other person just starting out, is that basically true?

Second, do you think my age and lack of experience will make it unreasonable for me to start a career in IT? I know I can theoretically get a low-paying, entry-level job in the field, but I'm asking about the career aspect of it. Could I be making say $70,000+ annually sometime in the next few years after I get some experience, or am I looking at a much longer period for that? Or is it more likely I'll never reach that level at this point?

I should also mention that I'm not really in a financial position to finish my four year degree or get any new certifications right now. I still appreciate any advice on how it might affect me if I did.

51,2022-09-25,What am I doing wrong?,u/Many-Ad8419,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xnqwdc/what_am_i_doing_wrong/,jobs,"Hello. In 2020, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in English, Concentration in Technical and Professional writing. Since then, I have applied for hundreds of jobs online, but not gotten nearly as many interviews. I believe that this may signify that there is something wrong with my process, so I would like a critique.

My process is as follows: Every day, I go onto Indeed, Linkedin, and Glassdoor and search their job board with the keyword ""writer"". I apply the filters so that I only see entry level jobs in my home state of Ohio. I look at the results and apply for the positions that match my qualifications. Once I have done this on all three sites, I again search for entry level jobs with the keyword ""writer"", but this time I do not limit the results to the state of Ohio, but instead search only for remote positions. Once again, I apply for the positions that match my qualifications. Overall, this process usually takes about two hours to complete. 

As you can see, I have elected for a scattershot approach, hoping to find something through sheer quantity of submissions. However, as I mentioned above, my ratio of job interviews to job applications is very low, which is something I would like to work on. I welcome any criticism of my methods and advice on how to get more interviews. Please leave a comment describing your recommendations or clarifications you would need in order to provide proper direction."

Lauren is the Account Service SME at a global digital commerce marketing company. She manages a team of 7 people, while also managing her own client accounts (globally-recognized CPG brands) and owns management, training, and process development for the company's project management software.She's been in this role for 2.5 years.  Lauren suffers from Bipolar Disorder and ADHD (not to mention Rheumatoid Arthritis which causes both physical pain and mental fatigue). She was diagnosed a decade ago and has been in treatment/on medication since. Within the last year, her bipolar disorder led to an 8 day hospitalization after months of experiencing extreme depression, as well as psychosis and hallucinations.

She is now stable and thriving in life and work, but obviously her mental health challenges have made professional life more difficult. Despite this her organizational influence has grown and after months of focusing mostly on stabilizing her mental health, she is now consistently exceeding expectations and receiving recognition in her organization.Lauren will be answering your questions during this AMA. She would love to address questions about managing mental illness while developing a successful career. Lauren is also happy to discuss how to effectively manage teams while being mindful of their mental health.

Join Lauren live on **the 30th of September 2022 starting at 17:00 CST (15:00 PST| 18:00 EST | 22:00 UTC)**!  She'll be available until 19:00 CST ( 16:00 PST | 20:00 EST| 00:00 UTC)."

I have been waiting for my sales manager to retire so I could take over his role. I made this apparent about 6 mos ago and was told i would be prepared to take over the role. Well, my sales manager put in his notice 9 mos before retirement, shocking us all. One would think a notification about the job opening would have been posted the next day, but I cant find, nor received, any kind of notification about the opening. The position was filled on 9/19, while I was on vacation.

Today, my store manager said he was ""shocked"" I didnt apply, which I said I didnt know I needed to since its been apparent that i was interested for several mos now. He replied that he sent an email out to our whole market, but I didnt receive any kind of email or notification in our in-house communication app. He said he has seen great improvement and that he wants to set up a development plan (he already said this 2ish mos ago, but never did anything) and that he wants to get me promoted within the next 6-12mos. He said my coworker was the only one who applied.

I asked the person who got promoted (we have an outstanding relationship) and she said she was kinda told she was going to be interviewed. I am BEYOND livid, but I dont know how to approach this. I want to call him out professionally, and I dont want to leave my job or get fired, but how can I trust my store manager after this?

I also asked another coworker if they got the email, they said they did and forwarded it to me. All of our stores in our market's group emails were on it except our store's. Only our store's managers email was included, which I am not included in that group. 

What should I do? Should I reach out to HR? Should I have a sit-down? Or should I just start looking for another job?

Any advice helps, thanks in advance üôÇ"

I advanced quickly through an interview process for a remote job and was offered position on Friday. Pay is a little less than what I was making, took a pay-cut for prior position bc of Covid. I countered back, they immediately countered with their final. I asked for a copy of benefit package and advised I‚Äôd be in touch Monday. I finally went over benefit package and wholly Batman! Husband is self-employed so I carry benefits, we are mid 40 - 50 in age with 1 going to college. 

Bad - small pay-cut, benefit premium almost triples, deductible &amp; co-insurance awful, 401k plan is ok and PTO plan stinks

Good - seems like a good company, although you never really know, more income than unemployment (I cringe at being that person to take a job out of convenience), can justify some pay-cut with less gas, wear &amp; tear on car, our dog is 17 and is loving me home, no office drama, traffic‚Ä¶..

I‚Äôm super conflicted!!!!

Edit - pulled application up, I clearly stated salary requirements. Offer on Friday was quite lower and I got them to come up a little. After reviewing benefits, which I asked for before making decision, it just rubs me the wrong way."

Do a great job in your role, and get told ""good work, keep it up, by the way here's some more work. xo""

I'm at a job that I genuinely really enjoy and being in a team that's genuinely full of great people, including my boss who is a very caring, supportive, and diplomatic manager.

But recently I've noticed a shift in his attitude. Whilst previously quite relaxed and focused, is now something of a helicopter manager. 

We've had a few members of the team who have very amicably handed in their notice and some of their roles have yet to be filled for in excess of six months. I have stepped up and taken more of a role in many of the admin/day-to-day/ events planning aspect side of things. I told him that for now, this is okay but have repeatedly been at capacity. However, after telling him this, I am quite often sent a message on teams sometimes only a few minutes later about another job to take on. I tell him again and he says he understands but then asks me to get it done. Rinse and repeat for the last few months. 

He has frequently become visibly more anxious and on-edge, emailing me on AL, on weekends, out of hours, or even texting me about work, which I've ignored until work-hours and even then made the excuse that I'm not checking work channels for work-related items. Many of these not even being big, urgent tasks but more minutate. After talking to the team, many of them feel similar even though I am his only direct-report.

The crescendo comes recently.

I am balls to the wall planning this big project which needs to be presented this week, it is not in my job-spec but I took it on knowing that it needed to be done. I have a million and one things to organise and a week until the big presentation to some big clients, day before the weekend, he books in a Senior Managers Meeting with six different agenda points, all of which have my name next to them, to report and update on, all having not been even started due to the project taking up all my work capacity - which he is well aware of.  Furthermore, it's the day before the big presentation that I'm sure he is well aware-of. 

I was clenching my fists and angrily walking back and forth across my apartment. It felt like a complete lack of respect for my work and additionally my time. I'm fed up with saying ""I'm at capacity"", only for him to dump more work on my desk and call it a priority whilst also I juggle two roles precariously and have communicated repeatedly that this is not a tangible nor sustainable solution. This has been the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back and want to say something that is diplomatic yet assertive about how to correct this. 

All thoughts welcome."

How the hell do I tell them that I am sick, right after finishing my vacations AND that Im about to quit in 3-4 days?. Without looking like a complete asshole after working there for an entire year?

Should I just go even for a day or two if I am okay later in the week? Or I should just end it over the phone tomorrow?"

What can I do?,u/fanatic1123,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xnyg7e/my_company_lied_about_my_salary_during_the_hiring/,jobs,"I'm a junior salesperson at a company in NYC. I've been there for 10 months. When I was interviewing, the recruiter told me I would be making a base salary and a bonus of up to 40% of my salary based on my metrics. This turned out to be false. 

Bonuses are paid once a year in July. When the time came this year, I expected a nice sized bonus since my metrics were great but I actually got (what I consider to be) an extremely small bonus of $3k. 

I brought this up to my manager who told me that the recruiter should not have told me I was getting a bonus and that was never the plan. Basically, he gave me the 3k as a nice gesture, not because it was required. Obviously I was still upset but wasn't sure what else I could say or do so I left it there. 

And I'm still unsure on what I can do. HR is 1 person and I really don't think going to them would make a difference, but I feel like I have to do something. I still have the email thread with the recruiter - you can see me asking them to confirm the details of my pay structure (since the offer letter did not mention a bonus), but I didn't save the email where they actually confirm it. So I don't have real proof myself but I'm sure the company has the entire email thread somewhere.


 Any advice? Sorry for keeping things vague."

By taking only 9 credits next semester, I'll graduate community college with an AS in Computer Programming with 0 debt. I'm waffling between continuing my education and pursuing a BS in Computer Information Systems, or just entering the workforce immediately.

Right now I'm leaning towards continuing my education. My plan would be to attend Chico State, which is one of the most affordable universities in the country. I'd likely graduate with minimal student loan debt, considering the cheap tuition and the financial aid I'm receiving. I also just enjoy school and learning, while I cannot say the same thing about working.

I'm also concerned that an AS in Computer Programming won't be enough to get my foot in the door with all of these chucklefuck companies wanting a BS at minimum for entry-level work.

I guess I should rephrase the title of my post; is there any reason I *shouldn't* go to university to continue my education?"

So I had an old job which I absolutely loved, it was fully remote, I had a great team,
I got promoted to a senior but after two years the contract I was working on was renewed with a different company and I felt like I had learnt everything that I needed to learn and progressed as much as I could and wanted to push myself to do something new and different. This was a government program by the way. 

I therefore started a new job on the 13th of September at a creative agency working in recruitment. I essentially work with a few accounts of their clients, and partner with businesses to recruit for their teams. I was already hesitant about this job because it is more corporate than I have ever done before (I have normally done either charity sector or public sector) but I wanted to go in with a positive mindset, push myself, and take all that I can from the corporate world and if I was to go back into charity one day it would be very sought-after experience. 

Now, the company that I am now working with on the whole is a very great company. There is nothing that I can fault them on for example they allow dogs in the office, hybrid working, great incentives such as free holidays, open bar on socials every week and a casual vibe. However, I don‚Äôt get on with my manager, I feel like they has been rude to me and I feel micromanaged.  I‚Äôm not sure whether this is just because I‚Äôve just started but I feel like they do this with all of the team, however they are so used to it that it‚Äôs not a problem to them, plus she isn‚Äôt the worst I‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs just I‚Äôve just come from a great background of excellent managers. 

I cried every single day on my first week because I was made to feel small by them as they were quite dismissive in the way they spoke to me and in front of the team so now I‚Äôve already have seen some red flags. I also feel like I can‚Äôt fully relax and I‚Äôm on edge. I feel like if I‚Äôm on my phone for longer than a minute or if I chat for longer than a minute then I‚Äôll be told off like a child. It‚Äôs not that I have yet as I‚Äôm being on my best behaviour and I understand i‚Äôm there to work, however it‚Äôs nice to feel like you can have a break from the computer for five minutes every now and then. Yet I don‚Äôt feel like i can here and from what I‚Äôve seen towards others and the energy I‚Äôm getting, I feel like it‚Äôs very work hard and play hard but I‚Äôm not sure that this is for me. 

Besides the fact that I‚Äôve already cried every single day, I hate the job in general, I don‚Äôt feel like recruitment is for me, where it‚Äôs very high-pressure to meet targets and you‚Äôre on the phone all day every day. I absolutely dread going in as I have to go in every single day for the first month but I hate the thought of going to work and I haven‚Äôt felt this way in a few years. 

So now i messaged my old manager because I was so sick of crying and I asked if there were any jobs so I could go back back at my old job. Luckily there was,  I interviewed and got offered the role! it is the same sort of role I had before but with a different company. However, they are offering to pay me less than my current salary and less than what I was on when I used to work for them because of the company changeover. 

The issue : I don‚Äôt know whether to take a pay cut and continue looking for jobs in the meantime as I don‚Äôt feel like I can stay living on that salary for a long time, so I would have to continue looking for jobs in a few months. OR just try my best to slug it out at my current job that I hate and give it time ? I know my mental health is most important, for example I have lost 3 kg in the two weeks I started.  however I have goals and aspirations and I‚Äôm not sure whether I just need to man up and get on with it as it will be way more money because of the uncapped commission. I also don‚Äôt know whether going backwards is a good idea and whether I should accept a job that are essentially offering me lower than my worth. 

Do I take the job offer at my old place or stay at my current place and see how long I can go for and probably look for a new job next year (because either way I will still look for a new job in the New Year). I‚Äôm also worried if I hand In my notice to this current place it will look bad to employers that I‚Äôve only stayed somewhere for a short amount of time and I would really like to include the skills I‚Äôve learnt in this new role. Any help would be great!"

I need some advice. I was interviewing for the same position for 2 different companies and both in tech- both jobs required the same experience and are very very similar responsibilities. Benefits are also comparable overall. Here's where I messed up:

For Company A, I asked for a salary of 80K (mistake, I know) and the recruiter let me know they would come in at 90k during the initial screening. Knowing this, when I had my phone screening for Company B I asked for 90-100K and the recruiter let me know they would come in at 123K. My job is a relatively newer function and there's not a ton of accurate info out there on salary yet, which made it hard to determine what I should be asking for. For context I'm currently doing the same thing and making 60K and know I'm underpaid which is why I started looking for new work.

Company A has extended me the offer for 90k, while Company B is still needing to schedule 2 more rounds of interviews. I love Company A and it's definitely my top choice, but is there any way for me to negotiate my base comp or a sign-on bonus? Or did I really just shoot myself in the foot? Is it fair to let the recruiter know I'm interviewing with another company and they're offering 123K for the same role- and ask what can be done to move the needle closer to that number? I am actually happy with the offer of 90k but can't help but feel like I undervalued myself and know how important it is to negotiate. Please help, I need to sign the offer from Company A by Tuesday!"

I‚Äôm (27 F) feeling angry and sad and would appreciate any advice. 

(TLDR: I just found out that what took me years to make, others just hired are making the same) 

I started working as an account manager at a manufacturing-related company right before covid (Minneapolis). I had had internships in college and worked for 2 years in customer success where I made 40k. 

I started this job at 45K (was told it was the high end of the range) and was promptly bumped a bit. Someone left the company and I was ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù to taking all of their markets as well and got a $10k raise.

As the top performer on my team, I‚Äôve gotten lots of pats on the back and pay bumps and was raised to $70K. 

A few months ago I learned that someone hired in 2019 in my role started at $100k. I mostly brushed it off because she was way more qualified than me, although she was fired after just a few months. 

I did lots of research on salary/negotiation and found that my market value was closer to $103k so I asked for that and was told I could have $80K now and that there‚Äôs an opportunity for more when the formal review cycle happens EOY. 

I‚Äôve always been happy at the company and have stretched myself to take on new projects, teach myself tools &amp; exceed metrics. 

Cut to this week when I had a chat with some brand new people in my exact role who are getting $80K. 

So what took me almost 3 years - they earned immediately. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I really don‚Äôt want to shop for another offer for them to match or find a new job; I just want to be paid fairly at this job that I‚Äôve always enjoyed."

EDIT1 - for those asking, I do have student loan payments of minimum per month around $1300 so that is also a factor here.

EDIT2 - the jobs themselves are similar in nature, it‚Äôs the industry that is subjectively cooler/more interesting to me. Also, the 90k job is in Manhattan and I would either have to move to the city or commute an hour each way every day via train. Benefits are the same except PTO and stock options. PTO in the non NY company is unlimited and they offer stocks. The other is standard two weeks, etc. Promotion prospects is tough to gauge. The NY role is more traditional for those asking."

1,2022-09-25,How do I stall while weighing options between a promotion and job offer?,u/Cerealboi13,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xo5vzx/how_do_i_stall_while_weighing_options_between_a/,jobs,"For at least 9 months my job has had a position open directly above my current position. I wasn‚Äôt qualified for it 9 months ago but am extremely qualified for it now and have been pushing for consideration for the past month. I‚Äôve practically been filling this position for a while now and don‚Äôt plan to stay with the company without being promoted. This essentially amounts to a title change with a few more responsibilities and presumably a significant pay raise. I submitted a formal application 2-3 weeks ago, was immediately contacted by a talent acquisition rep who agreed I was qualified, and that they would submit my application for an interview. That hasn‚Äôt happened and I‚Äôve since confirmed that the ball is in my manager‚Äôs court, and he appears to be stalling it. 

In the meantime I‚Äôve applied for other jobs, and found one I‚Äôm very interested in. Initially I wasn‚Äôt too interested in it because it seemed like a lateral move (same position, different company) but after interviewing the position is much different than I expected and a very good opportunity with a company and manager that I think I‚Äôll like working for much more than my current one. It would also come with up to a $9/hr raise and better insurance. Based on the interview I feel I have a great chance at getting an offer I will accept. That interview was Friday so hopefully I will hear from them this week, though due to the differences in the position compared to my expectations I have a few more questions that need answered, so it might be a week or two before I can accept. 

In the meantime, if I was going to be approached about a promotion at my job, this would be the week. I travel most of the time for work, so I‚Äôm rarely in the office or interacting face to face with my manager, but this week I‚Äôm working locally, so the opportunity is there. I also did particularly good work last week. Given how informally my job does things, and how familiar my boss is with the quality of my work, my assumption is i won‚Äôt get an actual interview, more along the lines of a conversation ending in a job offer and statement of terms. My current inclination is that unless my current job absolutely blows away the other companies job offer I‚Äôll be moving on. I hate it here and can‚Äôt imagine spending more than a couple more months working here. 

Again, my current feeling is that I won‚Äôt be offered a promotion until I tell them I‚Äôm quitting, but just in case I get offered the promotion before I hear back from the other company, how do I stall with them without raising any red flags while I wait to see what my options are?"

I got interested in it when I started doing PLC programming in college classes.   I can't devote enough time to college at the moment to pursue a degree right now, I started CS50 from Harvard and am looking at other things to learn when I can. 
What should I look at...finishing my journeyman path or look at software engineering more seriously?

There‚Äôs no job called ‚Äòeconomist‚Äô really or ‚Äòmathematician‚Äô. These are just titles people give themselves. So I‚Äôve branched out to jobs I think are fairly specific like finance, business, and some not so specific like marketing.

I got a message back from a company for unpaid internships. It‚Äôs to do with marketing. It‚Äôs for an events company. It‚Äôs got 3.3 stars as a place to work at out of 7,000 reviews. They claim there‚Äôs stuff to do with creating advertisements and copywriting. Reality is it‚Äôs probably just helping people set up markets for a day with a company shirt.

Is it worth taking? Thoughts?"

On the other hand, I'm here, after almost a year jobless after finishing my degree, and after a few months at two different agencies that I never liked and that I can't stay in more than a few weeks.

I feel such a failure, all of my friends with their beautiful LinkedIn resumes, and my family saying that at my age they had kids to raise and couldn't afford chasing between having or not having a job, I everybody seems to look at me and just see someone that doesn't want to work.

But I can't help it, I've felt insufferable in those companies, and I was coming home with terrible anxiety and dread everyday.   
I never felt like a mattered, and no one was ever supportive of my and my ideas, my craft, no-one ever told me my rights, nobody made me feel like a human, they made me feel miserable even when I was just asking to go home because I was feeling very much sick.  
I should feel free now that I've resigned to this studio I was in, but I feel the pressure to always have something to do, otherwise I will be useless and seen as a waste of time.

this is just a rant, sorry but I had to push it out.  
I wonder if this happens to someone else too, because I swear, there's not ONE single classmate that's not settled down happily right now, and I feel like I'm the only one being always wrong and lacking something.  
What do I lack? why am I the only one like this?

I feel like my life is literally ending today and I feel like I have to accomplish everything now because 23 is already too old to be successful, or even just happy."

Long story short: for some years I was really into digital marketing I even got a masters degree on this and recently I got promoted in my current digital Marketing position.

However, I was looking that in order to get some decent money i need to work for really big companies. E.g. - digital marketing salary barely reaches 50k, whereas IT 50K is a junior level in many companies.

Then IT enters in the game. My bachelors is in IT, but I never actually worked in an IT position. Although it is something always involved with work.

I like both areas, but I see that marketing is always an effort of thousands of ppl and IT usually is much less people involved.

I am really thinking about move towards IT (precisely cloud area)

Please I need some advices."

700,2022-09-26,fired from Walgreens for reporting sexual harassment,u/Low_Royal_7292,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xoldly/fired_from_walgreens_for_reporting_sexual/,jobs,"Sorry for the length of the post, tried to keep it short but complete.

On Tuesday I was fired from Walgreens after 8.5yrs with the company. Not sure what to do now as I live in one state and work in another and a lot of stuff is in the air for me currently and the manager knew this and tried to time it right to hurt me the most. Advice??

When I first transferred to a new store out of state, it became evident quite quickly that one of the shift managers was a giant pervert and how he was able to keep his job as long as he had was beyond my understanding. The store manager was nice, but she lacked the ability to control the store, set expectations, and especially discipline staff and make sure they followed rules. 

The shift lead 45-50yo pervert would constantly make crude and inappropriate jokes towards the highschool females, young customers, and any woman he would see as pretty. They had given up at reporting it to their peers and management as nothing would happen. The assistant manager also made no attempt to correct or discipline this behavior. This escalated to the point his advances and touches of a customer during a passport photo were too much and her boyfriend stormed into the store that same day after hearing what happened. Unfortunately, it happened right after that shift leader left for the day. Myself and the other asst manager on duty had him write a statement and we informed the store manager what happened. We also gave her the statement with contact info for both the woman that it happened to and her boyfriend. NOTHING WAS DONE and it was swept under the rug. 

Fast forward a couple months and the advances towards the 18yo recent highschool grad escalated a lot. She went to the store manager for help, for changes to the schedule, and nothing happened. She went to me to make a report and I asked if she wanted me to escalate it after I helped adjust the schedule so she wouldn't have to work with him alone. At that point I used our reporting portal and issued a report. It once again was swept under the rug. That shift manager not long after physically cornered the 18yo coworker in the stockroom so she couldn't get away and pushed himself onto her trying to kiss her. After hearing of this I reported it again and had to make several waves and he was finally given the option to quit or have an investigation take place. He decided to quit. It was made apparent to me by the other employees at the store that I was the first one and the only one in the management chain at the store to actually care about the safety of employees and to be the only one to actually help fix the problems. 

This then happened again months later with two completely different employees. Once again, it was with one employee having unwanted advances from her supervisor, a shift lead. I asked her if she wanted me to report it and also offered her the info of how to report it herself, whichever option she felt most comfortable with and ensured her I was available at anytime to help with this. The store manager made herself unavailable to this employee in a time of need and ignored the concerns.

The 17yo then sent a text to the store manager again illustrating she didn't feel safe at work working with ________ and how she could no longer work there if they would be scheduled alone together going forward. This text was ignored for several days and was never responded to until I confronted the store manager asking why she didn't reply to the message as it clearly said ""read"" next to it. Her response was, ""oh, I thought it was from _______, so I didn't respond to it."" So in her mind, apparently someone not feeling safe at work only matters if they are one employee, but not another. She ignored the request and kept them on the schedule together. 

As a solution, I volunteered to take one of the cashier's shifts when she was scheduled to work with the man making advances after the store manager refused to change the schedule. This upset the store manager. 

Ever since both of those events, the store manager held a grudge against me. She would constantly gossip about me to other managers in the district, make up things, and attempted to paint me as a villian while painting herself as a victim. She would even stalk me on social media, often sending screenshots to her company computer/email account of private posts I made, sometimes within a minute of me posting. Some of the posts also looked edited as if she was trying to frame me for violating company policy. The environment was quite toxic and she decided showing favoritism towards all other employees while denying me requests that she granted to everyone else. 

Then a couple weeks ago came a bogus written warning for me not doing her job when it came to an early store closing. I followed company policy/SOP exactly as written but since there was no oversight to the writeup, it stayed on my file and could never be addressed by HR prior to her firing me. I was on vacation for a week and during that time I was told by other employees that our store manager was spending hours and hours each day looking through the cameras. It turns out she was watching my every move. After back from vacation, one night I closed alone as the cashier needed to leave right at 10. This was never a problem and was encouraged by the store manager if we still had more work to do, if we felt comfortable doing so, and as long as we didn't leave with bags when leaving alone. 

So Tuesday came around and she called me into the office with another store manager present and notified me they were terminating me for closing the store alone (something everyone did) and for allegedly not punching out for a 15min break while leaving the store. Never once asking me ahead of time why I left and if I forgot to clock out if appropriate depending where I went and why.  Sidenote, most days we wouldn't get our lunch breaks or paid 15min breaks, so the allegation for a paid break off company property didn't sound right, and it wasn't. 

Our store is now upset, morale is killed, and shock overtook everyone that she stooped this low and actually did this as retaliation. Corporate HR has since received countless complaints from my coworkers informing them this was retaliation that was planned for a long time. She just simply waited to find enough tiny BS to justify a termination while also waiting for me to empty my PTO on a vacation to make it harder to land on my feet. 

She was enraged the staff respected me more than her but could never figure out why. These are the types of people that now run the Walgreens stores as most of the good people have left. The company would rather drive away the hardworking employees that aren't afraid to make waves for what is moral, and instead would rather have a company of snakes and ""yes-wo/men.‚Äù"

142,2022-09-26,Gave my two weeks because WFH was ending. Today my employer announced those who want to keep WFH can do so indefinitely. Should I stay or commit to leaving?,u/DJAsphodel,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xolqc5/gave_my_two_weeks_because_wfh_was_ending_today_my/,jobs,"I've posted here a few times already, so apologies if people are getting tired of hearing from me, lol. Genuinely appreciate all of the comments I've gotten.

Basically, my employer announced a few months ago that we were returning to the office by the end of the year. After waiting to see if they would reconsider after quite a few people resigned, I determined that leadership wasn't going to change their minds about this, so I started applied for fully-remote jobs. I landed one last week and gave my two-weeks to my boss. This was not easy because I genuinely enjoy working here. The return-to-office policy is the only reason I went through with this. I am leaving on good terms.

The new job pays more than double my salary and is in the same field, but I've been nervous about it. It's corporate, and I have only had bad experiences in the corporate world. The new role is geared more toward my weaknesses (planning, strategy, coordination between departments) than my strengths (coding, design, technical work). Apparently it's a layoff-prone company. I've been feeling that I was too hasty in accepting the first offer made to me in this job search. But, again: fully remote and pays more than double what I'm making now.

Today my employer announced that those who want to return to office can, those who want to work hybrid can, and those who want to be fully remote can. The sole reason for my departure no longer applies. Had I known this, I would not have taken the job offer. This feels like an indirect counter-offer, so I'm approaching with caution.

**Should I forge ahead with the new job or stay now that my sole reason for leaving no longer applies?**

I know it's not as easy as me going ""well, nevermind, then, I'm staying!"" If I stayed, my boss -- who I get along with very well and was very supportive of my decision -- would see me as a flight risk. They would know I've been looking to jump ship. I would look prone to making panic decisions (which I am, but I try to post a hundred threads asking for help on Reddit first). I would be settling for a lower salary.

But if I leave, I could end up in a job that isn't right for me. I'm already getting bad vibes from it. If it doesn't work out, my current job might not take me back.

What would you do in this situation?

**UPDATE:** Employer clarified that this is *temporary* and they will still require to come back to the office full time at an indeterminate date. Think my mind is made up on leaving at this point."

I am researching the correlation between one's occupation and their sense of belonging. Our occupation(s), especially here in the United States, are a major part of our lives and therefore tend to become a part of who we are. There are thousands of occupations we can choose from, which means there are also thousands that we do not choose. Each occupation is unique in its own way, but does this uniqueness create attitudes towards other occupations that may affect the way that it is viewed? That is what my study aims to find: whether one's feelings of belonging are influenced or afflicted by one's occupation. Anyone can partake in this survey. It may include questions seen as ""personal"". Every response is greatly appreciated, thank you!

Food service is really wearing me down mentally and physically. The hours I'm working really don't allow me to go back to school but I'd definitely like to. My issue is that I cant afford to take a pay cut.

I don't know where I can go where I'll make the same or more money but I can't keep jeopardizing my health by working insane hours and making no advancement to where I'd actually like to be in my life.

It has been a few days and I still haven‚Äôt called and I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll think I‚Äôm bad at my job and that I‚Äôm slacking because they told me to do that a few days ago already. 

On top of that, this Saturday I sent a follow-up email asking what‚Äôs going on with the creation of my account, and my boss had to say to accounting to ignore my email, because he had *already* sent me the initial instructions the day before. Basically I didn‚Äôt see it. So another reason for them to think I‚Äôm bad at my job. 


Any advice?"

1,2022-09-26,Negotiation Tips (Tech Early Career),u/Bridge-Working,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xopmu3/negotiation_tips_tech_early_career/,jobs,"Hi all,

Curious what some of the best tips are when negotiating, specifically for early career roles (1-3 YOE)? What‚Äôs easiest to negotiate when looking at overall TC + benefits, a sign-on bonus?

I know one obvious tip is having multiple job offers to leverage off one another.

I have one potential offer that would boost my base salary by 50-60% and overall TC by about 50% (huge for me!), yet there‚Äôs no equity since it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmore junior role‚Äù with this company. Recruiter did reference a 15% discount ESPP.

However, I do have unvested RSUs at my current company + role. Could I potentially leverage these RSUs from current company as a sign-on bonus for the new company during negotiation stage? 

Base salary + 10% annual bonus would still offer a massive increase in TC, but curious what advice others have since there IS equity/ money left behind from current role.

Any and all tips are appreciated - still pretty new to the negotiation side, want to make sure I don‚Äôt leave too much still on the table nor always automatically accept the first offer given."

23,2022-09-26,How to withdraw from an application process when I don't feel qualified for the position anymore?,u/HeartFullONeutrality,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xoqtbi/how_to_withdraw_from_an_application_process_when/,jobs,"Hello.
I recently found about an interesting company I thought I could be a good fit for during a career fair. I went to their website and they only had senior positions open. The job description was vague enough to make me feel like I was probably qualified for the job. I got a first call with a recruiter and we talked about my skills and previous experience, but from the conversations with him, I got the impression I would need to perform tasks way beyond my level of expertise for skills I only have at a basic level. I didn't hear again from him for the better part of three weeks, so I thought that was that.

However, I recently got a follow up email saying they were interested in setting up an interview with the hiring manager for the position. I feel like I would make a fool of myself at a more technical interview for this job. So I don't really want to keep pursuing this particular position. Is there a way to gracefully withdraw without burning any bridges? This company is large enough and does so many things that I'm sure they sometimes get open positions that align much better with my skills. So I don't want to get barred from ever applying there again.

Some additional information: in the time it took to hear from them, another company contacted me and I have been interviewing with them. This second company has a position that is a much better fit for me and my interests, and I feel I am more than qualified for it; of course, their application process is long and I don't have any guarantees that I will get hired by them.

Edit/Update in case anyone cares: thank you all for telling me not to withdraw. I actually had a very pleasant interview! The interviewer was very nice and was working with me to better understand how I fit into the company, and said he would talk to his manager about me, so it seemed he was willing to find other positions for me even if that one weren't the best for me. Even if I don't get a job in this company, the interview greatly boosted my confidence! I'm so glad I did it!"

Then two weeks later, a headhunter contacted me saying that there's this great job for me and the salary range is 72-80K US/100-110K CAD and I'm superqualified for the job (which I am with those requirements). The headhunter then realized that I had applied directly and said that they couldn't represent me. 

So the company contacted me and I had the 1st round interview. For compensation, I gave the above range because that's what the headhunter gave (which is way more than I make right now). Job done onto 2nd round. But in researching, I noticed that the headhunter reposted the job with slightly more experienced credentials and a salary base of 80-95K USD/110-130K CAD (which from Glassdoor is the range the Employer gave). Even with the updated credentials, I still qualify, admittedly on the mid-lower end of the spectrum. 

When I asked the headhunter casually about the reposting and salary increase, they said they were looking for more senior candidates. But I still qualify for the reposting... 

Now I feel like I'm in a bind because clearly I underbid on myself but I feel awkward to say ""actually I want more money because the salary grade of the reposting that you gave to the headhunter is this""...

Not sure what I should do?"

I could use some advice on how to handle this situation. I work a 9-5 for a finance company. We have a report that needs to go out on a daily basis &amp; for whatever reason this report isn't finalized until 6 or 7 pm. Up until today, I would prepare the majority of the report and then inform my boss/my boss' boss when the draft was ready. They would then continue to prepare &amp; send out the finalized report later in the day. When my boss' boss got me involved in the process, he assured me that I would only be a backup for him and my boss (especially because I am only an associate and this report goes out to very senior managers). Today, my boss' boss requested that I take over sending this report out on a daily basis - meaning he is now expecting me to stay on until 6 or 7 pm every day without overtime (I am exempt). I am not comfortable with this request as I value a healthy work-life balance and certainly do not make enough money to work an extra 10 hours a week without any extra pay. How should I best handle this situation?"

Everyone has kids and no one does obvious slacking off things like hang around, on the phone, etc. This is probably because we all need to feed our kids and feel we need the paycheck instead of just want it. That being said I feel like supervisors give criticism nonetheless. I feel like the supervisor do this because they feel like they have to because it's  ""part of their job"". That being said they're giving out negative feedback that isn't even there. This behavior kinda gets in my head because I'm constantly trying to get on top of criticism that isn't even actually there. It's psychologically damning. I'll also even hear back from middle management something reported to the owner and it never makes any sense at all. I work with a lot of people who work with their relatives and on top of this supervisors who have relatives directly beneath them do not report any criticism on relatives just non relatives.

I never know how to rise above this. Do you do with this? Is my perception wrong?"

So background - I got my first office job a couple months ago after working retail for most of my adult life, and I am so lost with all the social rules and obligations. In all my other jobs and grad school, people were relatively private, but now I'm in an office with about 25 people who all seem decently close. The last person before me to be hired came in about 2 years ago. They range from 6 years older than me to 30 years older. 

This week, one of my coworkers' parents passed away. The funeral is on Thursday (and I already fucked up by asking about a normal event on Thursdays, which is of course canceled cause many of my coworkers are going to the funeral). At first, I assumed I wouldn't go, having only met this coworker once in person (mostly remote office). But the internet is saying I should go to the viewing part as support? 

Another piece of relevant info: I am autistic (no one knows this), and I don't feel any attachment to my family. When my parents die, I would never want coworkers at the funeral because then I would feel pressured to act a certain way and express sadness I wouldn't be actually feeling. So that's why I assumed she wouldn't want basically a stranger (me) there, cause I would think coworkers = pressure to act professional, but maybe I'm wrong? Please help!"

He respects my time, is open to my ideas, and I‚Äôm just generally convinced he‚Äôs a good person. I value this working relationship. 

That being said, I‚Äôve come to realize that I do not want to be in this position anymore. I‚Äôm in a junior position where I can‚Äôt make my own decisions (I‚Äôm just an extension of my boss instead of being able to operate on my own terms and although I speak for him, I obviously can‚Äôt read his mind), where I am the lowest on the totem pole and therefore information is communicated to me last, if at all, so I‚Äôm operating from a place of ignorance (my boss tries to keep me looped- he really does, but there are things he inevitably forgets to tell me), and even though my boss respects my input, the opportunities for input rarely arise because I‚Äôm stuck with a heavy pile of logistical work that takes most if not all of my time. 

I have my 6-month review with my boss coming up this week, but the thing is, I think many of my qualms about the position are much less about my boss and more about the nature of the position. I doubt a conversation will change that. At this point, I know that I could switch industries and thrive, and I want to explore those options. 

How do I tell my boss that I want to leave without burning this bridge? 

Tbh, the job does aggravate me a lot and there are a lot of negative emotions I have tied to it, but again, I‚Äôve determined that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs holding me back from my potential, not because my boss is bad in any way."

Business law/administration degree. Worked a low wage job for about 9 months just to get by. It didn‚Äôt require a degree and doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with my degree. Quit that job to tend to family matters. Luckily I saved up a good bit of money while working there. 

Have been looking for a job for the past 2-3 months. I‚Äôve been applying to paralegal, accounting and analyst jobs. I‚Äôm located in a big city with a lot of these types of jobs. I‚Äôve applied to close to 100 jobs in these past few months. A few recruiters have reached out to me but they always seem to never get back to me. 

I‚Äôve had 2 interviews. 1 was a phone interview for a big bank. They were supposed to let me know about a follow up in person interview but never got back to me. The other interview was for accounting at a grocery store. Turns out it wasn‚Äôt an actual accounting position. I‚Äôm just supposed to count the cash from registers from the previous night and then work a register for the rest of the day. Pay is very low and the hours seem poor. 

I have about another months expenses saved but don‚Äôt know what to do. If I had to I could try and get a general labor job with a construction company or a job with a landscaping company to pay the bills.

Just don‚Äôt know what to do. Any advice?"

I was hired on as an autobody apprentice, but I‚Äôve been detailing since there wasn‚Äôt a detailer when I started.  But in a month or less I will begin my actual apprenticeship, and my pay is concerning the tech that I will be learning from and myself. We get along well, but both of us do not want to get screwed over in a sense. He talks about he was underpaid making just a bit more than I do right now, and that was years ago. Which causes me to panic because I do not want to be under paid, but I do not know where to start discussing with him on the matter. Since he will be meeting with management over it soon I need to figure out a solid rate of pay.  

So that leaves me to asking for a raise in my hourly pay throughout my apprenticeship, or asking for a cut in the hours I complete while maintaining the same hourly rate.  But then I am left wondering if I ask for a smaller raise (~$1 - $1.50) and then something like 10% of the hours I complete every week. Because in the beginning I may not be able to complete a lot of hours, which then might affect the tech training me, but then he gets a large majority of my hours while I still get my hourly rate from the company. But then as I get further along I will make a bit more and so will he.

Sorry to anyone who reads all of this, it is late and I am exhausted. I just do not want to put my career off to a bad start since I am young and have a decent understanding of what I‚Äôm doing. 
I would appreciate any help, ideas or new perspectives. And thank you to anyone in advance!"

I did a summer internship but the company wasn't hiring so since late August I have been applying for full time positions using LinkedIn/Indeed/etc. I live in a very big city, willing to commute, and with tech jobs being the rise theoretically I have a lot of options. So far I have applied to a lot of positions and have only been rejected or given no response so far. I'm no crazy computer science coding wiz but I do have transferable skills and some experience that should help me get a programming job. A ton of entry level job listing say they need 3-5 years of professional experience so browsing and applying can easily get frustrating fast.

I am starting to feel the pressure of still being unemployed and just staying home everyday. I've always been a driven person so not having school or a job rn is making me feel lost. My parents, siblings, and family members have started asking about how the job search is going and seem surprised that I haven't gotten anything yet. A lot of my friends from college already are in full time positions. As a result I have been staying to myself a lot and avoiding certain people in my life to dodge the questions and judgment. 

I just wanted a moral boost from posting this to see if anybody has had similar experiences. I knew getting a job wouldn't be easy (especially as a woman in CS) but seeing others around me getting jobs makes me feel shitty about myself as much as I am genuinely happy to see them succeed.

Some unfortunate circumstances arose this week where I am now on horrible terms with a past employer that I had put on my resume initially. 

To give more background, my employer was an extremely close family friend. This job was when I was a minor, and I wasn‚Äôt even paid enough to be taxed, so I was paid in cash and once by a check. This was extremely part time I probably worked less than 20 hours over the course of 2 years. This business is ran out of a tiny warehouse, and he only had three employees which I did not interact with at all. I initially put it on my resume because a lot of the organizational responsibilities I had translated over to the job I now currently have. I was transparent with the staff on what this job was like during the interview, and they didn‚Äôt ask me any questions about it. 

He and my mother got into a huge argument last week, and without knowing what happened, I contacted him regarding this employment verification, and he cussed me out and told me to never ask for anything from him ever again. 

I‚Äôm trying to weigh my options here, but so far I‚Äôm thinking to saying no when asked if they can contact him and just explain the situation. I have no proof that I worked there other than one text from him saying he gave my check to mother. All of my other past employers are perfect, it‚Äôs just this one.

I was offered a job in a unheard crypto exchange company which its website seems legitimate(?) and employees seem legitimate(?) on LinkedIn. I was offered a job in my related field but with some new roles unfamiliar to me with non-crazy pay bump from my currently salary but there is a need to relocate for several months for training in Dubai. And I am super concerned with having to relocate to Dubai (will be my first time relocating).

Some of the red flags I could gather were:

1. The profiles of HR manager &amp; hiring manager (2 stages interview): (HR manager's profile was created 4 months ago with total working experience listed 3 years+, hiring manager did not list down experience in prestigious company which he mentioned in interview). 
2. It's a 6 days work role. Hiring manager wasn't too impressed with my resume as he said I have lack of experience. I wasn't able to converse very well during the interview as well as hiring manager was testing my 2nd language (not mandatory but nice to have requirement). 
3. Require to attend training in Dubai once I start the job.
4. No physical office in my country of residence. Plan was to receive training in Dubai and to open an office in my original country of residence. 

Any advice is appreciated."

During the interview they mentioned that it could turn into a full time job. I received the contract today and it looks pretty standard however, there‚Äôs no mention of the possibility of conversion into a full time gig.  My question is: will this in anyway be a bad thing for my resume/job profile? Will I only get consulting gigs from now on?"

I like the people and the culture there a lot and I was making decent money but I didn‚Äôt feel like an important part of the team. I interviewed for other jobs because I wanted to make more money and make a bigger impact. My boss wanted me to stay and offered to bump up my salary and give me a bigger title but I refused. I have lost sleep over the past couple days feeling did I make the right call? I have enjoyed working there and I am not sure if I should leave. Please help me with your opinion."

I have never done sales before so i was nervous about starting something new. The person who hired me (sales manager) said something that made me feel a little more comfortable about it tho. He said ‚Äúthe only dumb questions are the ones you don‚Äôt ask, so never hesitate to ask.‚Äù That made me feel so comfortable and confident to start something i had never done before. But now every time when i actually have questions or need help i feel like a kid bothering the adults for help too much:/ i don‚Äôt even ask that many questions, i just ask clarifying things to make sure i‚Äôm responding in an appropriate manner and whatnot. I just don‚Äôt vibe with not being comfortable asking for help. 

We have weekly meetings on Friday mornings with all the sales people as well as the managers. We have our goal chart and when i first started I set a high goal for myself. Or high to me, at least. My goal was 10 for my first month cause i have to sell that many to get commission. Last weeks meeting I was at 3.5 and the general manager said i need to work harder on meeting my goal. Of course he was going around telling everyone to sell more but i felt annoyed he said that cause I had only been there 3 weeks at that point, and the dealership is in a really small town so it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs tons of opportunities anyways. 

Basically, I just don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm being dramatic or having valid feelings. I came to this job to make more money and when you average it out my base pay is less than $12 per hour."

Just throwing a question out there to see if anyone has gone through something similar. I followed up with the hiring team a little less than a week after a final interview to find out if there were any updates on next steps. The recruiter got back right away saying that they're interviewing other candidates but they should have a decision by end of week. Another tidbit, I received an OOO alert from the main hiring manager after I sent my follow up.

For those that may have been in a similar situation, or perhaps hiring managers/recruiters that have offered up that same line about ""other candidates"", what was the outcome? For context, here's how the process has gone so far:

8/31 - Recuiter screener call

9/2 - Screen call with recruiter and hiring team

9/16 - Hour long in person interview

9/21 - Half hour final interview (Zoom because I couldn't break away from current job, and they accommodated)

9/26 - My follow up to hiring team

Appreciate any feedback!"

2,2022-09-27,Difficult situation with new manager,u/thehockeyfan247365,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xpia97/difficult_situation_with_new_manager/,jobs,"I'd like to provide some context before I begin.  I took a job that is beneath my level of experience at a company that I really wanted to get my foot in the door with.  It's a rather large MNC, so I figured there'd be a lot of room to move up eventually.  The job is relatively easy for me, and most of the time I look like a superstar.  The biggest challenge has been learning their systems, data, and processes, but that comes with any new job.

Recently, the director who hired me on left for a role outside of the company.  I got shifted to a new manager.  She seems pleasant enough as a human, but I'm slowly beginning to dislike her management style.  From the get go, she mentioned something to me that stuck out; that she's been informed in the past that she can be overbearing and to just let her know.  Okay, sure, whatever. Well, that's all starting to show up in bits and pieces.  She acts like she appreciates my feedback and taking ownership over processes, but then essentially tells me exactly how she would like to see it done.  Yesterday, she gave me the task of working out a process with an internal team we work with, which I did over a phone call with that individual.  She then went around my back and over my head last night asking that team for all the specifics for the new process.

I have a young face, but I'm approaching mid-career status at this point in my life, and it feels like I'm being treated like a noob who's fresh out of college.  I know that I'm new to the company, but I am fully capable of overseeing these tasks and projects without her handholding.  

I've read all the articles on dealing with a micromanager and some of its useful.  But I feel like I need to nip this in the bud and firmly lay down some boundaries.  Outside of ""managing up"" and ""proving your trust"", what are ways that you have successfully confronted a manager to allow you to be a grownup, career professional who can do their job without handholding?

**Tl;dr**: I'm a mid-career professional who is being micromanaged by my new manager and I want to put a stop to this ASAP without getting myself on the *hit list."

I am a recent college graduate with a degree in animal science. At first, wanted to go to vet school, but realized that wasn't for me. Now, a year after college, I am applying for nursing school. I am not sure this is the perfect fit for me either, but it allows me to have more free time usually, (4 days off) make a pretty good living, and allows me to work with people and meet people. I think I am looking for a good work life balance, but don't necessarily want to be stuck behind a computer all day as I really am a social person. On the other hand, my friend just told me I should look into coding or something. A very lucrative job and can save myself the trouble of going to an accelerated nursing program (which is relatively difficult and not very cheap). Overall, I am not really sure what direction I am going in, I just really would like to be financially stable so I can do more of the things I want to do and not have to work 80 hours a week to do them. I also am relatively smart and enjoy learning, so I do think more schooling isn't a major concern for me. Just as long as I am interested in it.

Long story LONG! Just wanted to know if any people out there have some advice, recommendations, if you are a nurse or do work in IT, or even have a different option that you think is a good fit too. Really open to anything! Thank you everyone :)"

Applied for numerous positions but did not hear back from anyone except for a few that ghosted me after interviews. However, I couldn't take the toxic environment at the job I was working at and quit before managing to secure another one. 

Fast forward to today, and I am still applying for work and going through a couple interviews, all of which rejected me, even some which I felt went really well. I do have accounts on headhunter sites (not Linkedin tho) purely for employment purposes and have e-mailed my resume to the HR departments of various companies.

My mother noticed my failed attempts and keeps saying that it's because my social media isn't public (I keep posts about my personal life private); that is, recruiters won't be able to look me up and gauge the kind of person I am. Now, I don't know if this is true and if recruiters take into account whether or not people actively post on social media, which is why I'd like to ask here. My mother insists that not publicising my life (celebrations, my face, my friends, etc.) will make companies think I'm antisocial and ""not normal"", therefore suspicious of hiring me. My work experience doesn't revolve around sales or marketing or any field that requires extensive networking really (purely office work) so her opinion confuses me.

His pitch to me was that it is an improvement on what I am currently working on.

I think it is not true as I no longer have any analysis work to do. I want to build my career in data analytics, not data engineering. Besides, I am not working on database design so it is a basic data engineering job.

Previously when the big bosses wanted me to do data science, my bosses turned down the opportunity.

Should I even bother telling my boss that I want to do analysis work too? Or should I just leave?"

I have recently been offered a great position. However, I cannot verify my first job back in 2011. First, the company shut down and was bought by another one. The new one told me my record was not seen and to call the manager. However, he has not responded to my phone call. Second, I do not have any copies of my W2s, first and last paystubs, or the 1099s.

Following is a list of acceptable documents by their background check outsourced company,

So given the above, what is the most practical way to obtain the fastest document, ideally within a day or two?

I look forward to your suggestions as I have no knowledge in this regard.

Thank you very much"

No big deal, I knew I‚Äôd pass it. But I took it on 9/19 (it was a urine test), and they said they‚Äôd call me back when they received the results within 1-2 business days, and it‚Äôs been a week now. I hear horror stories of people getting ‚Äúhired‚Äù and then the company ghosts them, and I‚Äôm getting a little nervous. I had already put in my notice at my job now because they seemed very eager to start me as soon as they could. They gave me an estimated start date, and this week is my last week at my current job. 

 So my question is, has anyone witnessed a urine drug test take this long to come back? Should I contact the HR manager and ask them if they received the results or does that seem too pushy?

Edit: I ended up sending an email to the HR manager, basically was an error in communication from their end but I still have my job and start next week! Thank you everyone for your advice!"

Too often, STARs are held back by the paper ceiling. The paper ceiling represents barriers like degree screens, biased algorithms, stereotypes, and exclusive professional networking. Despite all these barriers, there are 4 million STARs who are succeeding in high-wage positions, and 32 million STARs who have the skills to transition into higher-wage work. This paper ceiling is not only hiring red tape ‚Äì it‚Äôs harmful: it hurts employers, it hurts STARs and it hurts our economy.

I‚Äôve since worked across the private sector, policy, and technology (from consulting for Fortune 500 companies to serving as the Deputy Director of the National Economic Council in the Obama administration). It became clear - our labor market is broken and NOT working. This is a problem we can solve.

50 leading organizations have committed to supporting the #TearthePaperCeiling campaign, which aims to change the perception that no degree equals no skill. Tearing the paper ceiling is about bringing in talent based on skills, not degrees, performance, not pedigree, and inclusion, not exclusion. STARs are 50% of U.S. workers. Employers, if you don‚Äôt have a STARs talent strategy, you only have half a talent strategy.

When I feel like I am working very efficiently and making good progress and quickly comprehend the problem I am given then the job feels awesome but most of the time its not like that.

I find it really stressful when I keep getting given tasks on new systems frequently and having a deadline in the back of my mind whilst I have no idea what I am doing has stressed me out to the point of a mental breakdown more than once.

I feel miserable, every workday when I wake up I feel anxious about having to take accountability on what progress I've made on my tasks in meetings.

I'm working and studying part time and I have a lot of freedom in deciding my schedule, its a really good opportunity to learn and grow which is why I feel stuck and like I can't quit just yet even though I am miserable. I was thinking of at least giving it 2 years and then deciding wheter to stay or try to get a different job in the same field or maybe looking at alternatives that would be more suited to the person I am but I'm not sure if I could really find anything that would be better.

Has anyone been in a similar situation and can maybe give some advice on how I could move forwards?"

On day 3 of the school year, I was transferred to a different school (same admin) due to a higher staffing need, and having no seniority. Despite most of my colleagues being nice and admin being hands-off (or barely there anyway), I have very minimal functional workspace, and the new school site is a larger learning curve than I anticipated. My district is extremely short-staffed of employees and space, and many of us are frustrated. As a result, I feel like I'm not doing the best work I can do to the lack of space and resources. The feelings of inadequacy and feeling like a failure are also really negatively impacting me, even though I know I can't control the lack of space I have. I constantly have anxiety and trouble sleeping now. Admin is aware of the challenges, but can't do much to improve space beyond construction needed, at this point. Union is aware too, but isn't doing much to help either.

Although I feel bad potentially leaving my job mid-year, I'm starting to look for other jobs. I need to provide a minimum of 30 days notice, if I leave, so I still have a while to endure this job.

Does anyone have any tips to survive a nightmare job? I've worked in tough places before, but this is on another level of chaos and ridiculoous ness now."

My current workplace had a management change is entirely toxic(went from 98 employees to about 32 now in the 2 years I've been here while the higher-ups are buying new super cars every month, without getting into it too much). So i've been looking to switch from Industrial design to product management, and was promoted ahead of my coworkers to the head of product development after working my ass off for 2 years....only to find that it's more difficult to find new positions now? Even entry-level product development management positions I'm qualified for, won't get me an interview like I did in the past as an ID. Is there a way to remedy that? Say, list a lower position in management on my resume? Also, is it because they expect my pay to be too high, or think that I would jump ship since it's been a bit under 2 years to get to that position? Either way, it's stressing me out far too much due to my company not caring about giving raises with living costs going way up as I commute 3 hours every day, so i'm a bit desperate to get out. Thanks!"

I made a few mistakes during the process where I didnt ask the salary range beforehand. And also frlm the company's end the whole recuritment was being handled by an intern. They told me they are expanding so they will decide towards the end of the interview

Now they offered me x amount and I tried to increase it by 10%. After a few days they came back to me saying that even X didnt get approve and now they are offering me 15% less than X. This is a golden oppurtunity for me in terms of moving out. They have however lowballed me and kept showing unprofessional, what should I do? I have no clarity on who is the hiring manager for this job so that I can reach out to them. 

I also asked if my salary will be up to reconsideration after 6 months of performance and they said they cant promise anything. On the other hand there are no bonuses etc. Just my base salary and medical insurance. What should I do? They will bear the relocation expense so I wont be able to switch before a year. I am planning to bluff or say that unless they go back to X I can't accept the offer but there is a risk they will ask me to drop it.

I got the offer about a week and a half ago, with an expiration date of mid October. As such, I planned to sit on the offer for a bit as I interview other companies.

I get contacted asking why I haven‚Äôt accepted, and asked to negotiate salary as other companies in the area offer a higher salary, however, this company said they offered me the maximum amount (which is fine). Thus, I mentioned I‚Äôd need a bit more time to think.

I get contacted again today by the hiring manager, asking why I haven‚Äôt accepted yet. I mentioned the expiration date of the offer was mid October and asked if he needed a decision now, he said no. I then get another text a few hours later stating they wanted me to sign the offer now.

In 6 months, I‚Äôll be 2 years with the company. During that time, I will ask my boss for my salary to be raised so that it will be within the average. 

I have handled a lot of responsibilities that weren‚Äôt on my job description when I started. 

I got a raise on my 6th month. No more raises after that. 

I have two ways on how I plan to have this conversation with my boss and wanted to ask what you guys think is the better approach üôè


APPROACH 1
Do a lot of work, accomplish tasks, be proactive and initiate helping the boss more. In 6 months, I‚Äôll tell my boss all the extra things I‚Äôve done and use those as leverage when asking for the raise. This is like, ‚ÄúHere are all the things I‚Äôve accomplished and all the additional work I‚Äôve done even without asking for anything extra. These accomplishments contributed a lot to the growth of the company and now I wanted to have my salary raised so as to reflect the work and accomplishments I‚Äôve done for the company.

*Personally this is the approach I‚Äôm leaning towards because it has the element of surprise. I can do all the work in the background and theatrically present this to my boss. This way he‚Äôll be like ‚ÄúWoah yes you‚Äôve done and contributed a lot. You deserve to get what you‚Äôre asking‚Äù.


APPROACH 2
Have the conversation with my boss now, enumerate all the things and initiatives I plan to accomplish in 6 months and tell my boss that if I accomplish them in 6 months, he‚Äôll have to raise my salary then.

*This approach for me will put a lot of pressure. Making sure my promises are met on top of doing the existing work I have.

As an ops manager, I oversee production, 7 supervisors, 180 indirect hourly reports. All facets of safety, food safety, and productivity. I have been point on customer trials, frequently interact with all departments (supply chain, MX, safety, quality). Cover my own hiring, firing, and everything in between. 

I‚Äôve been job searching and not much is open in my area in my field which leads me to be open to jumping to a different field. What else can I go for? Any suggestions or feedback is much appreciated."

I‚Äôm (28f) here asking for insight/guidance/advice on career options for myself. I‚Äôve been in the work force long enough to be able to understand what works/doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôm currently going through, I guess u could call, a ‚Äúdevelopmental crisis‚Äù. I am very open to going back to school, just need to make sure I‚Äôm going back w a strong purpose and goal. Here are some things I‚Äôve learned works and doesn‚Äôt work for me in a job setting:

What doesn‚Äôt work:
- Sales
- Too much team work/client communication
- Rigid set schedule
- Mundane work
- Rigid hierarchy 
- No recognition for job well done
- Lack of organization
- Lack of communication 
- unrealistic expectations
- Untimely deadline
- Lack of initiative from coworkers
- No room for improvement or pay
- Lack of diversity 

What Works:
- Flexibility
- Collaboration 
- Work/life balance
- Occasional team work
- Work from home option
- Space to grow
- Proper training if necessary 
- Organization/Structure
- Genuine/Friendly/Supportive work environment
- Use of creativity
- Helping others mostly indirectly 

Some words that have been used to describe me from coworkers/bosses:
- Inquisitive 
- Kind
- Helpful
- Creative
- Quiet confidence
- Humble
- Clean
- Organized
- Talented (most my jobs have required dexterity)
- Laid back
- Good communicator
- Deep
- Empathetic 
- Aware
- Focused

Some negative patterns I‚Äôve noticed in myself:
- Can be unreliable if no work/life balance i.e calling out often
- Middleman in situations that don‚Äôt involve me bc ppl feel comfortable talking to me abt their work drama
- If work is too mundane, I bore easily and aim to quit
- Require a lot of alone time while working (not so much a negative trait for me but in a work place that require a lot of interaction, it can be)

My previous jobs include:
- Hairstylist specifically braiding hair i.e. box braids, cornrows. (4 yrs)
- Landscaper/Fine Gardener(3 yrs)
- Sales associate (2 yrs)
- Daycare assistant (1.5 yrs)

Extra info:

-I‚Äôm very dexterous. My work and hobbies include some form of detailed work i.e small braids, wire wrapping, beading. 

-I‚Äôve had leadership positions both officially and unofficially. Never chosen for myself, just seems to find its way to me. 

-Unfortunately I find I struggle with being a self starter. That in no way is a reflection on my work ethic. Im a very hard worker. I‚Äôve noticed when I‚Äôm given a well instructed task to do myself, I do a great job vs. given too much freedom to complete a task, I‚Äôll procrastinate and more likely to doubt my abilities. This may be helpful info to the right person.

Based on the information I‚Äôve given, I hope someone can help me narrow down which career path would suit me best. I have a few ideas but would also like to hear from other possibly more experienced people. If you have any questions or would like clarification, let me know. Thank you in advanced!"

I already have that story up. About a week ago I got fired. The position was a ""Apprenticeship"" lasting 12 months, but I was still an employee. At the 6 month mark they let me go. They did give me a warning which I did listen to it. How long do you have to wait before applying to that same company that let you go? I looked up on the company website to attempt to find some policies but there was none of what I was looking for. I was a really good worker as the person who was teaching me during the apprenticeship was telling me that constantly. 

Anyways, my question being am I rehire-able (probably should look deeper on the company website) and how long should I wait before I reapply?"

I got sick three days before the start of my vacation. I ended up 3 of the 5 days I was scheduled to work. I ended up missing the last 2 days of work due to me being sick. Well the 2nd day of me being out my supervisor messages me and demands I give her a doctor note by the end of the day or else. I messaged my supervisor that I can get her one but it will be Monday due to the required testing for them to see me at my doctor office.

She didn‚Äôt like that answer so I went Hr after she demanded that I need to see a different doctor. Hr actually informed me that i don‚Äôt need a doctor note because I haven‚Äôt been out for 3 days. That when they require the note. So they got ahold of my supervisor and told her that I‚Äôm good and dont need a note. So 4 days go by and my brother get sick. He also works there. My supervisor got mad and forced a time change on the both of us as a punishment for him not showing up and me going on vacation. I told her that I can‚Äôt do the time change because of prior complaints on me and outside of work issues. Then she got mad and refuse to discuss the issue with me any further until I came back. So the next day I came up to work on my vacation and spoke with Hr. They said they will find out what‚Äôs going on. Well I never hear back from them and later that day I get a message from my supervisor asking what day I needed to work my old shift. I sent her my days and I never hear back.

Monday comes around and she starts demanding what time I came in. I tell her I came in my regular shift. She instantly starts scolding me threw text sayin her word is final. So I go to Hr to explain what‚Äôs going. That I never heard back. They said there‚Äôs going. To sit us both down and settle this. So Hr wasn‚Äôt there today. So my supervisor caught me at the time clock. She held me after work and proceeded to jump on to me for going to Hr on her and saying I have Zero respect for her, that I should of talk. To her. Before Turning her in to Hr. I told her that I had no choice that my job is on the. Line and she said I‚Äôll be lucky to had a job then told me that I won‚Äôt be going to Hr anymore that she.

1,2022-09-27,More Responsibilities = Raise?,u/picklesforbrkfst,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xq0foq/more_responsibilities_raise/,jobs,"My question for my fellow Redditors: if you're asked to take on additional responsibilities, is it typical for the boss to offer a raise/bonus/perk? Or is this something that you only get if you ask for it? 

Some context... 

I've been working at my current company for \~15 mos. My role is project management: I'll work with a client, their team, and our internal teams to execute a project. Training other team members is not a part of my job description - this is my boss's job. I don't like my boss.  

My boss hired a new project manager and asked me to work alongside her and ""offer guidance"" while the new hire led her first project. The boss said that she needed me to sit in on all meetings, be CC'd on all emails, and review the new hire's work. I agreed, and shadowed the new hire for 4 mos. 

That project has ended, but I've been asked to ""support"" this new hire again on another project. The new hire is underperforming (not showing much critical thinking; submitting documents that are riddled with spelling/grammar mistakes). My boss and I have brainstormed ways to challenge the new hire to step it up. 

I'm a little annoyed that this wasn't offered - but want to check myself. My company pays above the industry average and I'm not actively job-searching, so I don't feel that I'm in a position to ask for more money."

I already have the interview rejection email typed up but I‚Äôm having trouble sending it because I‚Äôve never done this before and I‚Äôm not trying to burn bridges (I‚Äôve made a point to still being open to connect in my email tho).

Today is day 3 since I realized I want to quit my job asap. But I can't for a while. Longer story below, I appreciate your advice on what to do, but also welcome your jokes or fun ideas.

So, I am a mechanical engineer in a not-so-shithole-but-still-a-shithole Eastern European country. I got my bachelors degree 1.5 year ago, but I have been working at my company for 3 years now, as a trainee before my degree. I came here with 1 year of experience as trainee already. Currently, I am doing my Masters while working full time here. My thesis is connected to the company, so if I want to get my degree as scheduled, I cannot quit for another 6-8 month.

But. My salary was sh*t starting out, but I hoped I will get a raise soon enough. In the meantime, inflation hit hard in my country (over 15%), and currently, my wage is about 60% of what an average mechanical engineer with ~3 years of experience earns where I live (as of today, my hourly wage after taxes is about 4$, lol). I could use some more money, for we are planning a wedding and renovating a home with my SO. Work itself here was not too interesting or fun since the beginning, but they really helped me as an intern with my education, and it was invaluable at the time. But now, help is not that essential anymore, work is still not too much fun, and my wage is still baaad. 

Monday, I finally got enough courage to go to the big boss and ask for a payraise, telling him I own 60% of the average, and that is too low. He said he can't raise right now, but we will talk about it in january. No further talk, he ended our conversation right there, and I don't feel like he wants to promise or give anything. So, I decided to quit as soon as possible, but that still means at least 6 months, sadly. Of course, my motivation is way low now, I have trouble even getting up in the morning... Unfortunately, pretending to work and doing something else does not work, my little boss has a clear view of my monitor from his place and sees if I'm working or not :(

Soo, what would you do in my place? Any survival advice, or similar experience? Any funny ideas of getting along?

Cheers, and have a better day at work than I do :P"

I just received a job offer for senior software engineer from a US healthcare company. Without a negotiation they just offered the job with a salary. It is good but it's slightly less than I was expecting. When I went back and asked if it's negotiable or fixed, the answer I received was it's fixed. So I was wondering if I could still go back and ask my expectations? This is the first offer and I'm in the process of another interview. If I happen to clear that I would be offered a higher role with slightly higher salary. 

I'm in dilemma if I should go back to the first hr for negotiation? Job sounds okay. It's a new team and it's a startup recently went public and has been acquired by a gaint. Acquisition is still pending and it'd be completed in another year or so. 

Any input is appreciated"

I have worked many physical jobs but had never had an interview like the one they require so I didn't think of it as a possibility. How would you go about asking them to do a zoom interview or to maybe wait until I can lift again? Or is that even a good idea?

I'm too scared to aim for companies if I don't know their background. 

With recruiters that's hard because the companies are all hidden, with the only hints of names being ""the client"", ""we're partnering with a client"", or ""this mid-sized Chicago based software start up is seeking a \[position\] candidate."" 

I was just wondering, how do you do research on a company if you don't know who they are? Do you take the risk? Is it okay to reach out to the recruiter to just ask about the posting/company? 

What are the steps to answering an external recruiter's job posting vs one set up by an internal recruiter or the company's actual HR department?"

The main problems are that the commute is way too long (3 hours round trip some days) the work doesn't feel meaningful or appreciated or interesting at all (I spent many years getting an advanced degree, so feeling like my work is worth a damn matters to me), and my supervisor doesn't know how to supervise. Other than that, the job isn't too stressful or difficult, but it does feel like a poor fit. 
I'm gonna need to leave. My skills and interests are pretty niche, so I think it'll take a few months, maybe more than a few, to find what I really really want. Its out there, but rare and will take some creativity on part. The other option is to take a job that's good enough, but still not what I really want. I'm hesitant to do that, because I've done it before and am afraid it'll become a pattern of continuing to settle just to escape a bad situation. 
The other option is to just quit with no new job. I have savings and other income from consulting gigs and savings that will last me awhile, but I'd prefer not to do this because it won't be ideal financially, and may make finding a bee job a challenge.

She‚Äôs 52 years old and currently works in a care home, but I think she‚Äôs quickly becoming frustrated and unhappy with her work due to too many things. However, I know that COVID in particular has made her dislike her job as it is still heavily impacting the care industry and her future in the job due to instability. She has recently expressed her interest in looking outside the care industry and she usually looks to me when she is looking and applying for jobs. I just want to make sure that she has a good job and is able to support herself without having to constantly worry about money and don‚Äôt want her to end up in a dead end job where she‚Äôs unhappy. I don‚Äôt think this is something I‚Äôm being too idealistic about but given the current state of the world, I know that most people are struggling in the same way.

So, this year i finished high school and im gonna turn 20yo (19-20yo counting by a year and depending on type of high school is age of hs graduate in my country, in eastern europe btw), currently living with parents. I had summer jobs through my family before, but nothing serious. Im feeling like theres just no hope... 

I am propably on autism spectrum, but its not confirmed. My big 5 profile is:
-VERY HIGH introversion
-very high openness
-high neuroticism 
-low conscientiousness
-average agreeableness

Preety much a very bad combo, but thats just theory. I have a very hard time doing preety much anything  for the first time, im afraid of looking like a fool, not knowing what to say, where to go, where to stand etc. 

I have many hobbies, history, philosophy, psychology, to small extend politics, gaming, sports and many more, but i dont have any specific proffesion  that i would like to dedicate my whole life into. I know tiny bits about preety much everything, since why many people think that im smart, which is not the case. 

When i look at different job offers, they all look difficult, even the most simple ones. I just fell overwhelmed, i imagine specific scenarios where i would be ""exposed"" for being myself, having to do something  in front of people an failing. Preety much any job that involves working in a team is no go, same with dealing with clients. Even for good money, its just not worth the stress.

It would be nice if i was good at maths and other stem subjects but in fact, i am terrible at them. In school i was preety decent in english (which is foreign language to me) and my own language, aka writing essays and comprechension of texts. I would asume that my iq is around average, with verbal part being above average. I have some basics of german, which i could enhance to decent level in few months (i think al least lol) 

I cant think of any job that i could be good at, it feels like theres just nothing i could do, maybe except collecting trash but that involves some level of teamwork if you know what i mean...


I might try to go to uni next year or in winter (if winter recrutation will be an option) but idk if i could succed  there for variety of reasons, not only studying itself, but also social ones...

Thank you"

I submitted both a resume and cover letter tailored towards this position.

I used ZipRecruiter to apply for the job and they give status updates as to when the application gets viewed (this is something new to me). The company said on their job listing that we will be notified within 2 weeks after submitting our application whether or not they will move forward with our submission. Aside from that, an associate from the company let me know that the recruiters view applications thoroughly and will be in touch once the process is complete. Well it's been 2 weeks, but my application hasn't even been viewed yet. Does it ever happen where an application never gets looked at? Or is it normal to expect an application to be viewed eventually?

I know I may sound too fixated, but I feel antsy because I'm so used to submitting an application blindly without knowing the current status on it so it's easier for me to move on if need be. The fact that my application hasn't even been looked at is making me feel a bit discouraged, especially because of the effort I put towards it. Even if I don't get selected, I'd hope it would at least get looked at."

I was there till May when they had to end my contract due to lack of clients. The contract structure was not something I loved and the commute was long (45 mins-1 hr), but I genuinely loved the people and the management was always clear, and gave me a raise without me asking within a few months. 

I found a job within a month at a gymnastics center, lower level management for their youngest division, seeming to align with my degree (in dance education), 30hrs a week but with a slightly higher hourly and more benefits. There are 3 locations all between a 15-25min commute. 

The summer was supposed to be training, but turned into me just working at their summer camp. Fine but not something I care much about. HR kept dropping the ball and it took over 2 months to get a quote for healthcare or to be added to the 401k (which I only found out about by word of mouth from coworkers). I teach and do some administrative work but have been given piecemeal training for both. They hired me talking about all the growth they wanted for the department and now that I am asking to collaborate on how to grow it, the owner and management have just told me to copy and paste old plans and make it work. I have been contacted at absurd hours over minor details, had my work timing switched on me mid shift, and felt disrespected in other ways repeatedly for 3 months. 

My schedule is getting changed again because two people have quit in the last month. I‚Äôve been applying to jobs for half of my time there and am feeling more and more strongly that I cannot stay for long. Today my old job posted a studio assistant role. It doesn‚Äôt explicitly say, but I believe from their phrasing that it would be full term, not contracted work. My old position was in fabrication and this would be a mix of administrative and other work. I have been applying to similar jobs and know I want to work in a more admin related job but I also know I would have an element of this job that would also be hands on at a company that respects me and my time and boundaries. 

I was so excited when I started my current position but have now realized I do not want to work with other peoples kids full time, and that this company is poorly run and I cannot see myself staying for too long. I can‚Äôt tell if trying to get this job with my old place of work is a good move or if I should keep sticking out my search to find something closer to home. All that being said, it would be possible for my SO and I to move closer to the job next summer, if I got it. Advice appreciated."
2,2022-09-28,Should i be sketched out by a us companies onboarding teams pratices?,u/ThrowRApar,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xqmit0/should_i_be_sketched_out_by_a_us_companies/,jobs,"I need to preface this by saying im really sorry if this somehow comes across as racist. Im really not trying to he its just this entire thing seems incredibly sketchy.

So back in the first week of july I did an interview with an IT company working remote. It was a thing where i recorded myself answering questions and it was all very simple. A month and change go by and I assume I don't get a call for a real interview so I assume I didn't get it. I'm then called and told I am hired by a very nice and patient lady sometime just before noon (i remember because i had to ask her to call back when I went on break in a few minutes). 15 an hour for 3 months then pending review bumped to 32k a year with benefits. It was better than the 12 i made now with no benefits so I took it. 

I'm sent an email thats supposed to have a forum for both a background check and a thing for me to sign to accept the offer. Only the offer comes through so I email about the background check. I get a response at 1am in very broken english via email with no punctuation that says I did receive the background check forum but not the offer letter. I wake up, read it, am deeply confused, and send back an email making sure to explain it clearer but asking for the same thing. I received a different response with near perfect english and with good punctuation at 9:30am my time that apologized for the misunderstanding and sent on the form. I shrug it off and continue. Its worth noting as well at this point this is from a company email that has the picture of the woman im emailing pasted on and its a white woman with a generic irish name.

I'm asked about my equipment preferences and what size shirt I am via email again at 11 pm my time. I answer and ask for a specific option I was offered (I wanted a one ear headset as opposed to the two and in the email it said ""you can request headset A which is 2 eared or headset B which has one"") and I wait and receive the equipment and shirt. Its all kosher except the headset which was incorrect but usable and I set it up this morning only to find out the laptop is password locked and that I was never given the password. Concerned as i'm supposed to have thing ready to go for monday I email the onboarding specialist I was working with before and ask for the password. I then get a response this morning at 4am with bad english but alright punctuation saying I had already received my equipment. I confirmed I had but explained the password situation again. I was then given the password for our LDAP but that didnt work and it wasnt what I asked for so I ask again and am now given a well written response that again apologizes for the inconvenience in almost the exact same wording as the first apology and gives me the password. This last email was at around 10 am.

This set me off so I went to go write down the name of the person who I had been speaking too so I could say something only to realize while the name and number is the same the picture us now of a black woman with dreads. I, rather confused, go back and check the previous emails and while the first have the white woman with straight hair under the same name the one for the equipment was of a middle eastern looking woman and all the ones from today had been the black woman. All the same generic irish name, all the same number, email, and title and all supposedly living in my time zone but all the bad responses are at times when the office is closed (8am to 5pm). It hit me then that this has gotta be out sourced and judging by the time i think its india but whose the pictures of then? I download the pictures and check with tin eye and its all just random folks facebooks profile picture and none of them are the generic irish name.

I'm rather alarmed by this honestly. It feels scummy and unprofessional and like a red flag that this is going on. Am i being stupid or am I right that somethings off? Also  what should I do about it? I know the company is real as ive seen their local office and they have good review on indeed and i know its a thing for indian support staff to use western names so people arnt shitty to them but something about the stolen pictures and the lack of transparency makes me really worried."

I also started the Google Professional Certificate program when someone recommended moving to IT, but haven't finished them.  I'm in grad school for my MBA.  I'm basically going around without a clear goal as to what to do, meanwhile still working at a call center. 

What kind of jobs do I qualify for with these qualifications?  Preferably, I would want a remote position that is not a call center/customer service.

The only job I've had that I was good at and didn't completely hate was when I processed digital paperwork for cases and quality reviewed others' cases.

In my last job I was in Michigan they paid me 16/hr + perdiem + accommodation + car + gas, I know, also kind of low for controls engineer as well. Anyway I had to leave this job due to personal reasons so I'm back at the job search. 

Now, I'm applying for a position as controls engineer that could be either in MI or in NJ, for which I had the 2nd interview today. When the interviewer asked about my expectations I said that for my next job I'm looking for something around 90k but he said that it was too much for someone with less than 5 years of experience, that the most he can offer for someone with two years of experience is 70k (still not sure what other benefits they have).

To be honest I really don't want to be unemployed much longer, but I'm also kind of tired of taking shitty offers. So, for a single person (no wife, no kids), how bad is 70k in NJ or MI? And also, do you think it makes sense and it's accurate to take 70k as controls engineer with 2 years of experience?"

Recently applied for a position at a Tesla service center and they are offering ¬£6.5k-7.5k a year base salary increase from my current job, and also a DSU plan which is basically being paid in company stock on top of the base pay, worth around 2-4k per year. I currently invest heavily in Tesla also.

Long story short, who would and who would not consider this position due to the commute time? effectively 2 hours a day compared to about 35mins. I am passionate for Tesla but I don't want the commute to break me. I really do enjoy driving and roads aren't just completely boring. Any input is appreciated."

5,2022-09-28,How long should I really hold out before quitting?,u/Forketbro,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xqpcij/how_long_should_i_really_hold_out_before_quitting/,jobs,"This is in the US, at will state. 

I just got a pretty terrible performance review. To be completely honest, my current employer is toxic to the bone and I cannot be bothered to let the claims get to me. 

I know ""toxic"" has been a buzzword to describe most employers these days, but over half of a department doesn't quit for nothing. All of my teammates have quit over the last year and I'm the only person left on a team that is supposed to be a team of 5 (another entire team quit in the department recently, too). My boss has tried to hire 2 new people in the last year, and they both quit within 2 weeks of starting. Due to my employer being understaffed, I have been just absolutely swamped with work to pick up the slack, and therefore my performance in other areas has suffered. I just can't do 100% of everything constantly. I am just one person. I make mistakes and I quickly own up to them and make resolutions, but as all of my other departed teammates mentioned before quitting, our boss will micromanage us before doing their own work and will gaslight us on multiple things. My boss will see any mistake as a huge problem and it makes me uncomfortable owning up to my mistakes or even doing work that could result in a mistake. She will be passive aggressive and is a ""keyboard warrior"". No amount of positive customer reviews or accomplishment of tasks will suffice. My old coworkers still reach out to me to make sure I am okay because they know what I am experiencing. I am a good worker and my clients mean the world to me, but my boss would rather have me believe I am doing terribly for some reason, and, at this point, I struggle with knowing if my performance is truly as bad as my boss says, if they‚Äôre giving me these poor reviews to scare me into compliance, or both. I‚Äôm exhausted with having to try and figure it out. 

All of this to say: Yes- I got a bad performance review. Yes- I have been making mistakes and my performance has been slipping. But, I am utterly burned out from my supervisor's management style, the department's understaffing, and find it hard to see any long term growth potential here anymore.

With all of that being said, I am actively getting my ducks in a row to quit in January. I have been working full time while studying for my Master's degree full time over the last two years and now I am getting to a point in my studies where the time commitment will be too demanding to have a full time job for the next couple semesters. 

I have stayed as an employee here in spite of the mass resignation at this department because I like the benefits while I am in school. They pay for a few of my graduate courses every year and I get plentiful time off. 

As of January, I will no longer need those benefits. At the end of October, my tuition waiver eligibility will be fulfilled and I will not have to pay it back. Additionally, over the next 15ish weeks until January, I have carefully coordinated 6 of those weeks fully or partially off of work. I will use up all of my remaining sick leave over the next few months and then be paid the remaining portion of my vacation leave when I resign. 

The thing is, and this is where the question in my title comes in, how long should I really hold on to my job here? 

Scenario 1 is that I continue on my plan to resign in January. I could make it to January, but it would risk being fired (although I kinda doubt they‚Äôd fire me rn with no one else). 

Scenario 2 is that I get fired and can collect unemployment. The problem with this is that on the write up it is implying I have ‚Äúpersonal conduct‚Äù issues and therefore I am unsure if that disqualifies me from unemployment. (The personal conduct issue is that apparently I don‚Äôt answer my phone - I DO - but ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù is complaining that I don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt defend myself bc I don‚Äôt know who is saying it, but I do, in fact, answer my phone). 

Scenario 3 is that I quit at the end of October when I don‚Äôt have to pay my tuition waiver back. Getting a job is not a problem for me. I am pursuing a very marketable degree and have had no lack of interview requests in my tests of the market over the last few months. 

I know this was a super long post but I need to know, how long should I hold out before I leave?"

After 7 days of part time training I'm already being sent to work alone and it's become stressful. 

I have to make tea, tapioca balls, ingredients, and do dishes on my own on top of serving customers in reasonable time. It's difficult because I wasn't taught how to do half the stuff I need to do. I'm also getting paid less than minimum wage until I take a test.

1,2022-09-28,Anxiety over nothing!!,u/merrymadhatter,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xqq0pa/anxiety_over_nothing/,jobs,"I just need to get this out because I think I've finally lost it. :)

I work at a really nice hospital in a really nice research lab (i'm not bragging just hold on), in a position that is often used as a stepping stone to graduate school. So, we need letters of recommendation from our bosses when we apply and I got EXTREMELY lucky with mine. They're two moms who emphasize that this is just a job and that everyone is human, etc etc. 

Seems perfect, right? Well, here are a couple of issues. The reason I am at this job is because at my last research job (which was supposed to be The Job before grad school), my boss was satan reincarnate. She purposefully gave me impossible tasks just so she could gloat when I failed, insulted me in every way you could imagine, and nearly fired me on a daily basis. So, at this new job, I am hyper vigilant about every mistake I make. I have NEVER received a single criticism from my nice ""mom"" bosses, but every time I make even a tiny mistake, I profusely apologize and write it down everywhere so I never do it again.

As an example, one boss asked me if I had been completing a task for months that I had actually never been assigned. Instead of saying that to her, I immediately second guessed myself and assumed I was just an idiot and forgot, then apologized. Another example is me emailing someone to tell them to schedule a kid for an evaluation when the kid was already scheduled. And for my latest mistake, I sent out a scheduling poll which had a default time zone of Switzerland (we are in EST lol), and had to correct it after someone pointed out that we probably shouldn't have a meeting at 3am. 

I also have long COVID and partially blame these minor issues on the intense fatigue, but I also think I overlook some things because of my inSANE anxiety to please authority figures. It doesn't help that I am fully aware of how lucky I am to have this job (the job market in my field is pretty competitive), and I constantly worry about my bosses not giving me rec letters because my old boss also held that over my head. Does anyone have any tips on how to, for lack of a better term, chill the fuck out?"

I recently got offered a great role at a company, but generally employees come into the office 4 days a week. 

I started my current position remote and in the transition to back to office, my company has been very flexible. I‚Äôm able to come in 2-3x a week and with flex hours (10:30am and leave 3:30/4pm) because I have a dog at home that needs a late afternoon walk. 

I really appreciated this flex time because I don‚Äôt like walking my dog when it‚Äôs dark out (live in NYC and am a girl in her twenties). I want to negotiate down to 3 days a week and ideally with flexible hours (is that asking too much?). I was thinking of saying something like this:

I am excited for the chance to work with XYZ in this role. 

I do want to discuss the in office requirements. In my current role, I go into the office about 2-3 days a week and I understand in this role it would be 4 times a week. 

I would like to negotiate coming into the office 3 days a week as I live about 45 minutes from the office.  In addition, I want to negotiate flexibility to be able to leave the office between 3:30-4:30pm depending on the season since I have a dog that requires late afternoon walks and with the days getting shorter, I don‚Äôt walk in the dark for safety. 

I will always put in my best work in the office, and when working remotely. Having less time commuting would allow me to give my absolute best into the role. 

If 3 days in the office with flexible hours can work or something similar can be negotiated, I am fully prepared to accept the offer. 

Thoughts, edits? Too much?"

I recently got a job offer with a start date on 11/01/2022 for a much better wage at a more reputable organization. I'm wondering what is the best way to handle leaving my company. I have a 1-week vacation planned for 10/22-10/29. My company has ""Accrued PTO"" and ""Floating PTO"" where at the end of the month I will have 45 and 32 hours respectively. After reading company guidelines I realized that ""after the termination of employment"" I do not have the ability to get paid for my ""Floating PTO"" and I forfeit it but have the ability to get reimbursed for my ""Accrued PTO"". So it seems I have a few options...

Option 1: Give notice on 10/07, leaving two weeks before my vacation. This could potentially mean I forfeit my ""Floating PTO"", use my ""Accrued PTO"" for vacation, and am left with no additional PTO payout.

Option 2: Give notice on 10/11, leaving 9 business days before my vacation and 1 business day after, and 1 day before my new job. Is this shady or considered acceptable?

Option 3 (most improbable): Due to the positive relationship with my manager I can explain the situation and even offer longer notice. Do you think he will be understanding, or better yet his superiors, of the fact that I'm trying to maximize the pay I receive?

I really don't know the best course of action but this decision is worth over $1000 so I don't want to take it lightly. Please share any advice or feedback."

I (22F) recently fell into some money from a settlement. I had been looking into real estate classes previously, and a portion of this money is enough to pay for the classes that I need for real estate licensure in my state, however the money could also be used elsewhere. 

I‚Äôve been interested in real estate for about the past two years, but the main problem that‚Äôs been in my way has been the money for the classes. Now that I actually can write the check, I‚Äôm unsure of whether I should or not. 

Im an EMT and I have 2 24 hour shifts, which means if there is part time or freelance work for agents available, I have flexible enough of a schedule to do it as a part time gig. If it does work out, I would have the availability to transition into full time real estate and work per diem in EMS if I still wanted to. The real big barrier here to fully making the transition is the fact that I have a family and I need a stable income, which isn‚Äôt guaranteed as a real estate agent until you get the ball rolling. 

I know that real estate and EMS are two completely different environments. I know that real estate agents have the facets of managing their schedule, attempting to match their client to the home (and meet certain parameters), as well as more financial and paperwork aspects of it. From my understanding of the job, I‚Äôd be eager to learn and excited to work it. I guess I‚Äôm kind of just still afraid that I won‚Äôt have the people skills that I need to have a successful career, or that I won‚Äôt actually like the job in practice. 

I guess the newness and differentness of the job is the majority of the reason for the appeal and for me to be afraid that it won‚Äôt work out. 

The big catch for me is that I really honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll like it until I try it. I remember feeling the same way before I dived into EMS too, and I was equally as worried. 

Any advice from you guys? Should I obtain my license and go from there? Suggestions on starting out as a full time vs. part time agent?

Thank you for your input!"

3,2022-09-28,Advice wanted for English major with library experience who needs to increase earnings,u/Shelverman,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xqwbho/advice_wanted_for_english_major_with_library/,jobs,"I'm seeking advice for a friend who needs to increase her earnings to support herself, but has limited options for doing so.

**Professional info:**

* bachelor's degree in English
* 10 years' experience as a library aide
* located in eastern United States

Higher-paying jobs in libraries are rare and *highly* competitive. It's very difficult to get one without a master's degree in library science. She's spent a few years applying, but nothing seems to be working out in the library field, and her current job can't pay her bills long-term.

**Personal info:**

* needs to support herself on a single income
* struggles with depression and anxiety, which closes the door to many jobs (e.g. sales and supervisory roles)
* doesn't have the time, money, or energy for an expensive/intensive degree (e.g. a master's in library science)

For a person in her situation, what are feasible strategies (both short-term and long-term) to earn enough that she'll be stable on her own (and able to buy a modest house one day)?

For example, is there another career she could pursue that would only require a short period of vocational retraining (rather than going back to school full-time)?"

One organization's Manager is another's Director, is another's Senior, is another's VP. Normally depending on the size of the company and other factors. My question is won't jobs try to low ball if you don't have that current job title. For example if you're a project coordinator but have the duties of a project manager. That doesn't mean you're going to get a PM SALARY. They are going to only see you as a PC. ¬† Or let's say a support analyst doing business analyst roles. Would it be ok to not put my official job title and to just put the title that shows my actual duties? During a background check, do they verify job titles or just dates worked?"

I've worked here for 4 years, and make about $50k, which isn't a lot but my wife and I are in a LCOL, currently live with my parents and only pay 1k in rent, and only 1 car payment and my student loans.

The gov job is super cushy, I work maybe 2-4 hours a day, I never work OT or weekends, its 10mins from my house, its extremely low stress, my boss and coworkers are great, hours are flexible. Benefits are amazing, I get 3k deposited into an HSA account every year, and I get 22 days PTO and a pension as well. Most people just stay until they retire, after 15 years you get 36 days of PTO and your pension gets really good.

The biggest con is the low pay, in 4 years I went from 43k to 50k, and we're onsite only atm. My boss has told me that once my manager retires I will get his position, which I'm not sure when thats happening.

I recently got an offer for $70k, my wife and I would have to move to a higher cost of living area, where our rent would be around 2k, the benefits aren't great, I only get about 17 days PTO and their health insurance isn't amazing. This role would be hybrid as well, and I think will allow me to grow a lot in my career.

I'm still not sure if its worth it the extra 20k. Things like a nice pension and a HSA are things I have to consider into the package as well. What would you all do?"

When I put in my two weeks, initially my boss was happy for me‚Ä¶ but the more he  thought about me leaving and the fact it‚Äôd conflict with his upcoming schedule of doctors appointments and my coworkers vacations, he became more and more annoyed about me leaving. I know he is also going through a lot of personal stuff, but I think he started taking me resigning as personal too.
He started nitpicking every little thing I did and I started getting anxiety around him. I was walking on eggshells because I‚Äôd never seen this moody and irritable side of him.
The first Friday of my last two weeks, my coworker left and he started reaming about all of the mistakes I made in the past and told me he could‚Äôve written me up to the point of termination. I was never insubordinate, truly just forgetful about something things, and those things he claimed he could write me up for. 
Finally today, a week before my last day, he started chewing me out about forgetting to order something (which everyone forgets to order these items) and he went on about it for about five minutes.
He finally said ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt put up with this at your new job. But what do I know? Right?? Right??‚Äù Trying to antagonize me to answer.
I was so fed up and have felt like a personal punching bag, that when he left for a few hours for an appointment, I called my husband and he was fed up. 
So I walked out. 
I feel so anxious that he will contact my new employers and them this, and even though I have already inquired to start sooner, I am nervous he will screw me over because I as done taking his bs.

I'm a Front Office manager and a Business Manager, and last week I went to Munich to work there with my colleagues (I'm from Portugal) and I saw one of them working with Power Apps. I'm thinking last months of changing jobs and one of my future colleagues recommend me power bi, but I'm more interested in Power Apps tbh.

Right now I find myself doing Shane Young and Pragmatic Works training, but I would like to do an even more complete one. Or is this all I need?

This is because I have seen someone here say that from here when we know everything from powerapps we can move on to other programming languages to complete everything we know.

Another thing I would like to know is: after I feel comfortable can I apply for what kind of jobs? And what is the average European salary?

Do you recommend me to take any other courses that will help to complement these?"
2,2022-09-29,Job Interview Question,u/bambinacarlina,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xr2r3x/job_interview_question/,jobs,"For the last 9 years, I‚Äôve worked for the same department. I started with one program that I was with for 8.5 years and then in January I started my current position. However, in that time I was asked my department leadership to continue my old role (part-time) until they hired someone. I agreed to do this for a few months, but did not realize I would not be compensated for it.  I was promised an even better promotion, so I decided not to jeopardize that opportunity for a few measly hours of work. 

Fast forward to August, they still hadn‚Äôt hired someone to fill my position and I was still doing work which no equates to about 15 hours which I did off the clock (I had my actual job to do during my 40 hrs). I complained to my direct manager and we agreed that the two coordinators of the program I used to work for could handle the things I was doing. We passed it off to them after some drama. I started refusing to do work for them when they emailed and told people to email the two coordinators. Long story short, I now feel like I‚Äôm being retaliated against by my direct manager.  (This is all a story for another day). 

Anyways, I applied for a position similar to my current position for a different department entirely. I have a phone screen with HR but I‚Äôm wonder how to explain why I‚Äôm wanting to leave after 9 months. I can‚Äôt very well say it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre all assholes who take advantage of people illegally. Would it be odd to say I‚Äôm looking for a better work culture if it‚Äôs still the same institution?"

looking for advice. 
I recently started working as a programmer, after completing a CS school. I was always unsure during school, whether programming or tech in general would be something, i would actually be interested in. 
The company I started working for is really awesome, but I just dont know, if Im the type of person to just sit in an office all day. I want to interact with people not work at a computer all day. Whenever I get home, im excited to just work with my hands, whether it be painting 
or reflooring my room or woodworking or anything but sitting in front of my PC. I kinda feel trapped in an office job. Or is it just a feeling I have, because I just got started?

I am really unsure what to do, any advice is appreciated, thanks in advance :)"

I asked to push back the start date by a week to Monday 10/3, which the new company agreed to, so they sent me a revised offer letter with that date and I signed. So my official start date has not happened yet. 

This is my first salaried job and I will get paid on the 15th and 30th each month. 

I just received a direct deposit for the full amount of a two weeks pay period into my checking account from the new company payroll. 

Should I notify the new company and try to give the money back? Do I contact HR? Is this just something that's not unusual for a salaried position or something? 

I don't want to get off on the wrong foot with the new company. Any advice would be appreciated."

(For some context, I have applied for their company before, but couldn‚Äôt find the time to make the interview because I had many appointments the week they were interviewing). After the interview, both of them admitted that they would need to talk about where they want to put me, but that they were really happy about all my answers and they were even more excited to have me on board. Fast forward to this week, I met with one of the interviewers again and she said they needed extra help leading up to the holiday season and that they wanted to create this new role  for me in a one year contract to start. I was disappointed. While this company has many opportunities to growth and hire internally, it feels to me like this is a role that isn‚Äôt very secure at all since they never tried it out and it feels like this role is kind of disposable. Even though I know job security can never be 100%, it is one of the most important things to me since I was abruptly dismissed from my last job. They are currently working on a final offer. While I have other companies that also want to hire me, this still feels to me like it‚Äôs the best company for me, but I don‚Äôt feel secure in the role that want me in. Any advice? Is ‚Äúnew role‚Äù a red flag?"

She will be paying me $15/hr, which is the very least I'd take. My current job i work as a retail makeup artist, $18/hr, 11-8 random days of the week and I only have 1 weekend off a month. So it's inconsistent and draining, but overall an easy job. It has way better health benefits and PTO starting in February for me, but it has nothing to do with my degree though.

I have an Associates Degree in Accounting that I got in 2014 with a 3.8 GPA. I recently interviewed for an entry level accounting position through a temp agency and the interview went really well but afterwards they had me do some tests and I realized I hadn't retained as much information from my schooling and I thought I would. I did not get the job.

My question is should I go back to school to get my bachelor's in accounting or should I go to school for another field? Or should I try and brush up on my skills and continue trying to go for accounting jobs?  I have some interest in the medical billing and coding line of work as well."

I am unsure if I just ungrateful, have super high-standards, etc. I feel like a imposter and/or a loser. **I would like to know how to establish a career when I cannot identify a clear path**

**Graduate Position**

I graduated from a top tier business school and landed a management consultant role with a focus on digital transformation. During my 5 year stint, I was mostly on the bench but when I was placed on project, I always got positive feedback when on projects. At some point, I felt like I was useless and learnt nothing so quit my role on a whim to take a sabbatical.

**Sabbatical**

During my 1 year sabbatical, I learnt to code and built my own automated stock trading system. It was very profitable until my strategy / algo was no longer competitive. I decided I should look for roles.

**Start-up**

After my sabbatical, I landed a sweet role at a FinTech which doubled my pay. I had no experience for the role but line manager said they saw potential in me. Spent 1.5 years there and probably worked 8-16 hours a week. During my downtime, I'd read a lot (News, Coding materials..etc) but I learnt nothing on the job. I was laid off recently when the market started doing bad.

**Start-up 2**

Immediately after getting laid off, I got hired at another start-up that up-ed my pay. Now, I am in business development which I have no experience for. When I asked the CEO, they said they saw potential in my and wanted me in the team. Been working here for 6 months and I see no value-add on my behalf but I am told they are happy with my work."

Last December, I finished my bachelor's and master's degree in computer science. As an international student, I had trouble getting an internship during school due to a visa issue. Since it's an unranked local school, none of the big companies that can provide sponsorship attended the career fair, and my resume used to be rejected all the time online and offline.

To deal with the situation, I focused on campus life and did a few things. During undergrad, I worked as a programming tutor for a semester and worked as a research assistant for two years during graduate school. Also, I graduated with 2 publications and got 2 awards from school for outstanding research. My GPA was close to 4.0 for both undergrad and graduate school (I know they're not that important), but still having trouble securing my first IT job. Fortunately, the green card status got approved so I could get a work permit this June, but no luck yet. Submitted 100+ applications but most of them instantly rejects my application and missed 3-4 opportunities by failing the coding assessment. I thought my resume might have some issues so hired a professional resume writer from Fiverr, but he said my resume is already conveying my duties well, so he just slightly elaborated it, that's all.

Now it's still fine as I'm a fresh grad within a year of graduation, but I was told that there will be a lot of trouble from next year with a year gap, and also the economy is getting worse due to war and inflation. Many of my friends working for their companies are saying they had layoffs recently as well. I'm studying leetcode every day and applying to companies, but 0 industry work experience hurts a lot. Kinda feel like I'm wasting my life in my room looking at the monitor. Keep studying and applying, but saving is running low, won't hold that long.

Based on my situation, there are three options I can choose now, I guess.

1. Join consulting companies providing Bootcamp + job contract
2. Just keep studying and applying the same as usual
3. Do whatever and start making money

Any advice will be appreciated."

As the title suggest, about 2 or so years ago, I had an interview for a role that I was turned down for. I have now I applied to a different company but now have found out that its going to be the same hiring manager who will be interviewing me.


I felt in my previous interview, the person used unfair tactics (asking questions unrelated to the role), used lots of gotcha questions, it felt racially charged overall got bad vibes. I understand this person is new to this role. Should I even bother going forward with this interview? 


I like the company, and the people I have met so far, this hiring manager would be bosses' boss. So not a direct report. 


Any insight would be appreciated 


Thanks,

Is this usually what's expected from an administrative assistant role? I just finished a 4 minute phone interview w/ them that seemed to be mainly about screening me to see if I knew how to talk professionally on the phone. It was mostly the recruiter talking to me about they do, I expected it to be more in-depth with more questions asked of me about what I could contribute to the role."

1,2022-09-29,Hourly pay negotiation,u/hail_satinpolyblend,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xrfdq9/hourly_pay_negotiation/,jobs,"I'm sorry this is so long!

I have worked in a corporate job for just over 6 years. I make $5 more than when I started but have moved up through different teams and titles within the same general department. I have a bachelor's degree in Fine Arts and a master's degree in teaching. Not directly related to my job but in a way, I use the skills I learned in both. 

I have embraced a variety of different tasks that were directly related to my title, as well as others that were assigned to me temporarily. During the temporary ‚Äúteam lead‚Äù type role I was in there was no additional compensation but the work involved created the most stressful months of my life. When I brought it up to management they happily told me they had chosen an employee to permanently fill the role so I would no longer have those tasks but they were grateful for me. 

Fast forward, I have been in my current title for two years now. I enjoy the work, it‚Äôs a lot of critical thinking and research. I‚Äôm a one-person team that essentially sets up and maintains the benefits for a health insurance company. Due to some corporate restructuring 9 months ago I was assigned a manager. This manager has almost no knowledge of how my particular role is handled. She has been with the company for nearly 2 decades though in a similar position. However, she has made my job a walking nightmare. I‚Äôm not used to being so micromanaged by someone with a critical attitude. I have spoken with my supervisor (who trained me) since a lot of the work she says is done incorrectly was how I was taught and isn‚Äôt incorrect, just different than how she handled her role. 

I also told my supervisor I‚Äôve been taking classes in Ethics and Logic-based philosophy and I feel like it‚Äôs steered the research I do in a very positive direction and is a valuable skill I have. I expressed how this job is now going in a different direction than what I had envisioned my tasks are now limited and I‚Äôm treated like I‚Äôm in training. She talked about how valuable I am to the team and that I just need to wait it out. 

I was approached by a different department in the same company who is interested in the knowledge I have to offer. I did tell my supervisor that I was looking into other positions because I didn‚Äôt feel my role was proper for me long term. I‚Äôm not sure she took me seriously though. 

I don‚Äôt want to overshoot and ask for an unreasonable amount of pay but as is I am barely able to pay my bills living very simply. I‚Äôm disappointed in this after being there for the number of years I have. I honestly have stuck it out because I enjoyed the work until recently. In the end, whether I take a different position will likely come down to the offered pay since the other role sounds very interesting to me also. I‚Äôm not sure how to approach asking for more money from either department. I‚Äôve been given what they called a ‚Äúsubstantial 8% raise‚Äù before but that was only a little over a dollar an hour. Would you guys suggest going to this other department with a list of skills I have and how I use them or would that be unnecessary?"

Long story short, I applied for a job way back in May 2022 and today, the company messaged me saying:

First of all, I am no longer interested in the job, but not a single HR from that company has reached out nor on my email or my phone.

I went through every email with the company and have not seen one. And I checked all the phone numbers that I did not pick up, but there was one number that constantly called me, but it was just ISP provider that was calling to say ""we have a deal for you."" I feel like someone just forgot to call and decided to put the blame on me... Should I bother to email them and justify myself or just ignore?"

I'm currently self employed, I have my own business. Been doing it for 4 years. Money is okay, enough for me to pay rent/bills/food and save up. Sometimes there are not so good months, but I manage to make that money back. I also love this job. I made a lot of connections, reputation and my customers love me.
I got a new job offer to work for a company, it's bigger pay, more benefits, room to grow, make more connections, a lot more responsabilities which I'm not sure I can handle mentally. The job itself is not directly tied to the industry I'm in at the moment, but there are some parallels. It's a really good opportunity, but in 20-30 years I don't see myself doing that job. 
I'm very passionate about my business and I built it from scratch so I take a lot of pride in that. On top of that it's my dream job. I would have to throw that away for a new job and I'm not sure if I can do it. I've been stressed about this and crying for 2 days straight. It's a first time I had to make such big decission in my carieer and I don't know what to do. Any advice helps thanks"

I'm working as a digital marketer in California with around 3 years of work experience. I'm currently under my work visa and on the way to get my green card (can't get a new job until my green card gets finalized). I started this job last year with 33K(the job listing was presenting low salary because it was an internship level job and I wanted to move to the states from my hometown country). I accepted the low salary because the first main reason was to move to the states and then gradually get higher salary. Also I didn't expect too much of work load either. However, the management, including CEO, already knew my previous work experience (plus I showed my enthusiasm enough working as if it's my own business) and they abused my skills badly in many different fields. I was hired as a digital marketer but they asked me to do so many other stuff; asking me to manage a team and even train new employees. I was exhausted as hell getting paid 33K and working so much (worked almost until 9\~10pm everyday) and decided to go back to my hometown after talking to my parents. I came up with this idea of quitting to CEO and he finally told me that he'll give me a raise. I got a raise and my 2022 salary is now 45K. I know it's still low. It's September and around end of this year, I'm pretty sure there'll be a conversation of salary negotiation for 2023. I was wondering if I can come up with around 65K to the management considering my all work responsibilities and tasks I'm dealing with. My part-time coworker who's mainly dealing with social media contents, receives double my hourly wage. He/she is a US citizen. Should I just yield to this low-paying job unless I have the ability to get a new job right now? Please advise. Thank you."

I start next week. 

It was a long interview process, four interviews over a month. It was a sort of vague process, I signed some NDAs, they weren‚Äôt super clear about everything at the beginning. Essentially the job is managing the bosses schedule,  taking care of his home, keeping inventory, running errands, and the big one- traveling with him, including two, two month long overseas trips.

The offer I accepted stated that I would be a full-time excempt employee- which I guess means I am not eligible for overtime pay. It also did not specify a max amount of hours I would work each week, so hypothetically they could have me working 100 hours a week with no overtime. My biweekly paycheck would come out to be around $1950 with all taxes taken out, so less than $1000 a week. While this is great compared to what I‚Äôve made in the past, I wouldn‚Äôt want to work 100 hours a week for the same pay as 40 hours. I think that‚Äôs ridiculous.

At 40 hours a week, I would be making around 30/hr, which is great for me and a huge step up from other jobs I‚Äôve had.
I got my schedule for the next month and at the very least, they have me scheduled for 60 hours a week. This would make my hourly pay 20/hr, which is way lower than I would like. 

I feel like I made a huge mistake not negotiating or clarifying before I signed the offer. The no overtime thing is crazy to me. I would be okay working 40 hours for $975 a week, with overtime pay for anything over that. But being an exempt employee, I feel like they will be able to take advantage of me big time.

My plan is to work for a month and then reevaluate. If I‚Äôm being taken advantage of, I will talk to them or quit and find something else. But I‚Äôm wondering if it would be worth it to try to speak with them earlier to see if I can negotiate overtime pay? I already signed the offer so I‚Äôm feeling like that ship may have already sailed. 

Is this just something that everyone deals with? I am only 21 and this is my first salaried position, so I‚Äôm not really sure."

I was recently a dishwasher and even when i would just have to walk thru the dining room to go to the bathroom, the sheer amount of people existing near me would almost send me into a panic attack, so i just stopped going to the bathroom at work and would hold it. Ive also been a hostess before so it‚Äôs not like i haven‚Äôt tried working with people, but anything customer service related it out. I‚Äôm fine working with coworkers unless it‚Äôs a super busy place with people everywhere constantly moving.

2b. When i was a cook, if there were too many orders i would have a panic attack and break down and 70% of my shifts ended up like that and it was incredibly hard to not go kms in the bathroom with their shitty knives. I only did it for a month because it was too painful on my body and brain. No one‚Äôs job should drive them to suicide almost every single shift. 

3. I have bad scoliosis so i can‚Äôt be on my feet for more than 5 hours. No one wants to hire someone who can‚Äôt work a full shift. I have tried to work thru it but the pain gets so bad i want to rip my spin out and have debated offing myself multiple times to stop the pain because it‚Äôs THAT excruciating. I have ended up taking so many pain meds in my life because my body and back hurt so bad from working that i have kidney damage now so it‚Äôs not realistic to just take pain meds about it. 

4. I am a weak girl, 5‚Äô2 and 21yo. You can prob guess i‚Äôm not buff, i am very small and weak and most stocking jobs require frequent lifting of at least 30 pounds. 

5. I don‚Äôt have a computer so I can‚Äôt do any computer jobs, and grew up poor without computers so never learned anything like excel that could help with qualifications. So basically no computer skills and can‚Äôt get any unless they‚Äôre going to train me which most places don‚Äôt like the extra cost of training their workers. 

6. I would try any type of delivery job, doordash, amazon, whatever but i have been cursed with some of the worst eyesight known to man and for some reason when i start driving my eyes go extra blurry, and i can‚Äôt drive unless it‚Äôs like DAY not even sunset because my astigmatism is so bad all i can see are giant stars.

7. I know a lot of my issues can be fixed with many doctors visits, but i‚Äôm poor and just got done being homeless so i‚Äôm really not in a situation where any appointment is affordable. It feels like i‚Äôm too poor to be able to work. also, when i say i just got done being homeless it‚Äôs not like i made enough money to get out of it. One of my bfs family members heard about our situation and is nice enough to rent us a room in the basement for cheap after it gets cleaned up a lot so rn we just sleep on the sofa and don‚Äôt have to pay rent. Getting an apartment requires having a lot of money at that moment, anywhere near where i live rent is minimum $1.2k and they require you to make 3x that a month. Even if we did qualify, apartments are very scammy and our money would end up wasted on application fees and turned away for no true reason. (keeps happening to my homies in this state)

8. I have tattoos and piercings (from way before we got really poor so no use telling me i shouldn‚Äôt have gotten them especially bc i did most of them myself) (haven‚Äôt been a problem with the type of jobs ive had so far)

9. Anything that requires schooling is too expensive so no trades or anything.

10. I would try to go on disability because of my physical problems and super long list of mental problems, but because i‚Äôm not missing both legs that‚Äôs super hard in america. They want you to go to doctors and get medicated until it works and if it doesn‚Äôt work try another medication, and i‚Äôm too poor for even just one appointment. 

11. I tried and failed to get unemployment a while ago but i can‚Äôt live off that forever even if it had worked.

They say in america everyone has an equal opportunity for success but if you‚Äôre born anything except for rich, white, or a man (typically a combo) then it‚Äôs such a lie. If i had been born into money i could be medicated and work fine. 

But yeah if anyone knows something i‚Äôm capable of doing please let me know. I even tried onlyfans and failed despite having 10k followers on insta. Def would have worked better if i hadn‚Äôt had to live in my car and had props and a camera and could make more and better content but it was only enough to help out, nowhere near enough to live off of even tho it was doing decent ."

I found a decent position and applied, signed an offer letter, and was just sent a file to give consent to a background check and begin pre-employment paperwork and everything. 

Now, today, I spoke to my scheduling manager at my primary job about how this would be affecting my hours/availability and he told me he could give me more hours of overtime no problem, which would earn me enough that splitting my time between there and the new job wouldn't be necessary, it would be comparable. 

I told my manager I'd think about it, but I intend to let him know that if he can promise me 50 hours, which I know he can do easily, then I'll stay there alone. This leaves me stressed out about how to properly let the hiring rep I've been in contact with the last few days know about my situation, and my loss of interest in the position. 

Any wisdom of how to respectfully and effectively contact them would be incredibly appreciated."

I got along with the owner of the company and he got my number (even though he wasn‚Äôt allowed too, since they have an agreement with the agency)

When he told me this, he explained to me that he himself had to take a 35% pay cut to keep the company running.

Today was the day I finally decided to bring to my manager‚Äôs attention what has been going on.  I told her it had been going on since month 2 and I did not want to address an issue that wasn‚Äôt potentially an issue, but it continued to get worse.  I didn‚Äôt mention anything regarding what I know for a fact and what I believe- I stuck to the main issue of feeling like I have to chase him down for help, his lack of availability and how I fear it‚Äôs going to hinder my ability to successfully be able to perform my job.  I made sure I let her know him &amp; I get along very well, but this issue is a source of concern for me.  

Even though I feel like his behavior is hard to miss  for a blind person I was not prepared to hear from her, ‚ÄúI know what I‚Äôm about to say will stay between us, but what I‚Äôm hearing from you is not something I wasn‚Äôt aware of‚Äù.  Apparently he is one of her low performers that she has had issues with in the past, but she‚Äôs worked with him and though he‚Äôs gotten better there are still continuous issues.  Though she did not say this, it seems she has done everything in her power not to see him lose his job while he just takes her kindness for stupidity.

Getting that burden/worry lifted off my chest made me breathe a lot easier.  If anything,  I regret not saying anything sooner.  The plan moving forward is to pair me with someone else and for her to say tell him to alleviate his workload she‚Äôs having ‚ÄúLiza‚Äù assist in training me.

Though I don‚Äôt think it will fix the ongoing issue with him, at least it will alleviate my stress.  Thank you all for all of your helpful advice."

1,2022-09-29,‚ÄúDischarged‚Äù on Day 4,u/munchkinSam,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xropdd/discharged_on_day_4/,jobs,"I genuinely need to vent this out. 

In May I graduated with a BS for Actuarial Science(it‚Äôs a combination of Business &amp; Mathematics). I have applied to SO many places and haven‚Äôt received an offer for any type of interview or anything. 

At the end of August, I finally got a phone interview! It went well and I was pushed through to an in-person interview. The position was going to be a new role- a financial analyst position. They were completely aware that I had no experience, just a degree, and this was something they were excited about! They wanted someone who could learn their company and give insight. I was told there were about 30 applicants and there were a few more interviews after me- that I would hear back in a week. 

I let my current employer(retail pharmacy) in on the whole process, as I liked that job- it just didn‚Äôt adhere to my degree. A week passed, they called and I got the job! The call was on September 7. They respected that I wanted to work a two-week notice and had my start date set on September 26.

So I started this past Monday. For reference, the industry is Logistics and the company has a headcount of 500-1000 people(using LinkedIn numbers as to not be pinned for confidential information). There is 10 locations, but I was working at headquarters. On Monday, I had various orientations and meetings for over half the day. I got to see my boss for about 15 minutes- to note, the finance department for this company was literally my Boss, me, and a data analytics intern. My boss told me he would be out of the office for the next three days and to just do whatever and try to learn about the companies and the various software. I wasn‚Äôt given any structured projects. I was scheduled a couple meetings in the accounting department though. 

Tuesday, Wednesday, &amp; Thursday(today) were all spent doing orientation, shadowing, and meetings for about half the time. The other half the time, I was at my space trying to self-learn the software. I was also pulling various reports and even created a miniature month end financial packet. 

About 10 minutes before my shift was to end today, the head of HR pulls me in the office and tells me they are letting me go. 
Clearly I was in shock &amp; my emotions began to flood. I composed myself as much as I could and asked why? They told me that I didn‚Äôt have a passionate answer when asked what I had learned so far(this was asked each day during orientation). This was translated as negativity that affected my performance and therefore I was being let go. Mind you, I have been given zero tasks to measure and my boss has been out of office. 

It has been a few hours and I have realized a lot of red flags from day one. When I arrived to my area, I had no name plate- but the others who started that day did. I remember having conversations with various trainers or hr people and getting a lot of smiles with sympathy in their eyes. While being discharged, I was told the decision was made last night- but my parking garage key that I got never worked. Also while being discharged, I was encouraged to apply again in the future for any role that may fit my skills. One of the people in the room was visually upset to see me upset and the other person couldn‚Äôt look me in the eye. 

There was a whole section in one of the lectures about what would have you immediately terminated. Things like workplace harassment and domestic violence- they specifically went over how you wouldn‚Äôt be let go for performance until after it has been addressed and some plan has been made to mediate it. It‚Äôs day 4- obviously no one has said anything to me. I made sure to ask if termination was the only solution or if there were any other options. 


If you made it this far, thank you. I am so frustrated &amp; upset- but I just have this gut feeling that this decision had nothing to do with me. I feel like something happened in the period between when I signed the contract for the job and when I started- whether it be budget constraints, realizing there was no need for this new role, or finding someone better. But maybe I am wrong- maybe I did something, I am not sure. 

Have you or someone you know gone through something like this? What did you/them do to cope with the disappointment?

Any suggestions or feedback on how I can make the most of this is so appreciated."

2,2022-09-29,Am I getting taken advantage of again?,u/motochoop,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/xrp9sf/am_i_getting_taken_advantage_of_again/,jobs,"To add some pre story, I am a mom to a 4 year old and this year I decided to start looking for jobs that correspond with that.

A few months ago an acquaintance offered me a work from home job at her company that she started a few months prior from what I could tell. To make a really long story short, after about a month and two missed paychecks it turned out she was apparently a fraud and everything was made up. I filed a claim for missed wages and never saw the money.
It ended up being a really bad experience because this person was at one point my friend and I was so excited about this job and everything seemed really legit until we started digging. Two months later strangers still contact me asking about this person and saying that they have been stolen from or defrauded.

This brings me to now.
My kid is now in pre k so I decided to look for work that allows me to work for a few hours during the week to supplement income and make me feel better about myself.
I found a cleaning company that cleans new construction homes. It's hard work but I love moving around and the owner said it was really flexible hours built around moms with school schedules to attend to. We are supposed to get paid every week. I was told to send my logged hours every friday and by sunday the money should transfer into my account (she uses paypal and similar apps). 
Sunday came and went and I didn't get a transfer. Two days ago I asked about it and the owner apologized and said that the house builder had accidentally mailed the check instead of providing it in person like they normally do. It is now day 4 of missed paycheck and I have not even heard from her today where I am supposed to work tomorrow. 
I don't know if I am just paranoid from my last experience or if I am being taken advantage of again. I am currently in Texas if that matters at all. We are due to move back to my home country in Europe next year (I have a greencard) and I was really hoping to make some extra money for the move which is expensive. 

I think I need help how to react to this? 

Thank you for any input."

Make fine money. I got promoted to a manager position (I‚Äôm in marketing) at a startup. I‚Äôm 23. I also run my own online shop on the side. In addition, I work as a contractor (not an employee, but they of course pay for my work) at a company a relative helped me get a while back ago. My relative doesn‚Äôt work there any more because her mental health also. They really pushed her to her limit. This side gig is the thing giving me problems.

My gig with them is pretty good in the sense I don‚Äôt ever have to meet with anyone really. However, it is so mind-numbing. Think going through individual fields in a spreadsheet, filling in new data but 10,000+ times. 

Out of the blue they started hounding me with deadlines. Like, deadlines that are not at all feasible. Even if it was my full time gig. I panic every time I get an email asking for updates. I haven‚Äôt been able to meet these deadlines, and I‚Äôm about to not make the next one. 

The worst part is it‚Äôs only 18/hr. My main job pays SIGNIFICANTLY more than this. But it is the pressure of letting someone down and I don‚Äôt want to burn bridges by just telling them I can‚Äôt do it anymore. They know I have another job but it‚Äôs like they want me to be a robot.

Please help. I have no idea what to do. I feel so unprofessional but at the same time these projects they give me don‚Äôt even really need a deadline. Because this is data that constantly has to be updated. It‚Äôs like a never ending project. 

The boss emails me at 10pm often asking for updates. I used to be super on top of this, but at this point I have pushed myself so hard I‚Äôm all out of momentum. 

I‚Äôm starting to cope with alcohol because of the pressure. I‚Äôm up from 6-7 am and don‚Äôt go to bed until 12-1. My weekends are full of work."

So the first interview (Monday, September 19th) was fairly simple, with the interviewer simply getting to know me and taking notes. My second interview (Monday, September 26th) was logic questions and riddles, which I practiced and did very well on; she even clapped and said I did well. I am still waiting for email confirmation for my third round, which my friend said I should have gotten yesterday or today. My anxiety is through the roof because the little voice in my head is telling me I was rejected, but my friend assures me that I got the job.

I have 3.5 years of experience in 2 companies and I have been quite successful. My job is to mainly open new accounts/negotiate contracts and manage the relationship with our clients (my Japanese is Business level)

At the age of 25 I consider myself very ambitious and so I‚Äôve kind of felt that I can do more with my career than recruitment. Things are stable at my current company but I know this isn‚Äôt my passion and feeling a little stagnant. 

Recently a European boutique IT consulting company  approached me for a ‚ÄòHead of Sales‚Äô position to build out the Japan clientele.

I went through the interviews and I passed. The company sounds great, the people are great, and the opportunity is definitely a step up career wise, salary wise and a good chance to pivot away from recruitment. The offer and compensation is also great but it‚Äôs not about that.

I feel frozen - I‚Äôm having the offer meeting this week and I‚Äôm afraid of making the wrong choice. It‚Äôs rare for someone my age in Japan to be given this opportunity (especially in sales as a non native Japanese speaker), so I feel like it would be a great challenge, however I grew up in a very financially unstable household thus I lean towards stability which is what I get from my current company (fortune 500). 

The role at the start up will be very exciting for me but also very challenging. I will be expected to build out their business in Japan + hire and grow a team + manage the team. While deep down I know I can do it, I‚Äôm getting imposter syndrome and feeling unsure of myself. I feel like I may be biting off more than I can chew? And if things dont work out, it will look bad on my CV that I have three companies within 4 years. 

If shit hits the fan, I dont have family to rely on because of their financial stability. 

I still need to think a lot but what do you think and how would you navigate this situation?

I get pretty disappointed looking through job boards and what's with these job titles they all either the exact same company to company ""Senior Office Management assistant to"" .  For me 75% of the jobs are ""management +what ever field"".  So you then go to read the details of the position. Well they definitely always go in detail of what they want or require.  On the other hand is rarely any reason given to why I need to know this or that besides perhaps a obvious skill for a specific task.  IE medical training for medical personnel  
I know I have a lot of positives employers want and negatives as well.  But I feel lost in today's jobs market I've pretty gave up.  I work at Amazon, own a tiny house and an electric motorcycle.  My bills are near nothing.

Every job posting I see asks for a CV and a cover letter and if you're like me, you'll take at least 1h customizing and triple-checking everything to make sure it looks ""perfect and relevant"".

For every 10 resumes I send, I get an average of 1-2 replies for an interview. During most interviews, I can tell the recruiter spent no more than 5 seconds skimming through my carefully constructed cv and probably ignored my cover letter. After that, it's either radio silence or a generic message saying ""I'm sorry, you were great but we decided to go for someone with more experience"".

The one time I actually got far was when instead of sending a CV a company asked me to complete a test on some platform to measure job skills and to see if my values aligned with the company's culture. I asked the recruiter why they don't use CVs and he gave me 5 reasons:

* People lie on their CVs. Everyone will ""stretch"" the truth to get the job;
* Recruiters barely look at resumes, or just look at 50 and ditch the rest (as expected);
* If people have pictures on their CVs, unconscious bias and prejudice will creep in so it's easier to be transparent without resumes;
* A lot of companies use systems to track keywords and universities, if you don't have those keywords on your resume, you'll get ignored (this concept sounds stupid and unfair);
* ""**just because someone has 10 years of experience on paper, doesn't mean they are top performers or better than someone with 2 years of experience with actual ""thirst"" for improving**"" (this blew my mind)

They ended up going for someone who outperformed me on the take-home assignment but they were super transparent and proved amazing points on why CVs are completely outdated and also unfair to candidates. Now I'm actively looking for companies that share this mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

Would like to hear some opinions on what you think about CVs and the points this recruiter made on why they're just trash."

I told my boss this and he let out a big sigh in frustration and told me I should cancel and show my face. And he‚Äôs really insisting I come, which is really making me not want to come.

So I'm wondering if I should ask what the interview is going to be like and what will be expected out of me during the job. However, I don't want to sound dumb and make it seem like I'm unaware about things, that's why I'm hesitating. 

Should I message the employee? Do i ask stuff directly or is there a way of networking better?

My girlfriend's and my life goal is to eventually end up in either Virginia or Massachusetts. The competition in both states is obviously *WAY* higher than rural Pennsylvania.

I initially only received 1 interview for a role I'd be happy with but wasn't my ideal one, I did the interview, was very happy to be offered the role, and I accepted it and I'm now going through the onboarding process. 

I've now since then ended up with 4 interviews, and 2 of them are for my ideal roles that I think best suit my skillset.

I explained I was sorry about the noise, but I live in a small apartment and don‚Äôt control when the property manager mows the grass.  Then they said they heard some other small background noise like someone was nearby.  I told them my husband was in the other room, and again my apartment is small.  The conversation ended with me being told I should consider a quieter, distraction free place for virtual interviews. 

Sure, I‚Äôll just move to another apartment with my non-existent money. LOL, what kind of feedback even is that?"

I'm not graduated. I don't have any special skills people want to pay for. Now I'm in Kyrgyzstan, I have my last money(about 1000$). One week before Putin started the mobilization, I started to learn how to code(css,js) and really enjoyed it. My friend told me I need 6-12 months to spent for monetize my new IT skills. So I don't have that much time. I found a job in Spain. They need animators in hotels. But unfortunately I don't have EU passport.

I had a masters and doctorate in health admin from school A. I just finished another masters in health informatics admin from school B and passed the RHIA certification all in September. I have been struggling finding jobs even in the hospital corporation that I work for a minimum wage. Should I drop the education from A in my resume and just focus on the B? I am also thinking about taking GED exam. A job I applied that was asking for high school diploma and RHIA certification with no experience rejected my application claiming other applicants were qualified than me. It's frustrating from one rejection to the for the past 10 years. And yet employers don't want you to lie on your resume.

I used to think that I just wanted a 9-5 job where I went to work and then home, and I never had to bring my work home with me.  But after getting a job that fits that description and being in this position for a year I realize I want more than just a job where I sit at a desk all day.  I want to enjoy what I do because this is where I will be spending 40 hours of my week.

I need some help finding jobs that fit my skills, interests, etc.  I like doing things behind the scenes.  I like organizing, data entry (although like I said I can't sit all day), planning and setting things up.  I am introverted and it takes me awhile to warm up to people.  I'm okay working with a small group of coworkers but I don't want to deal with the general public face to face or over the phone.  Although I could handle dealing with people over email or dm.

I have a bachelor's degree and I just need to support myself.

After about 18 months in this role, I could see that I needed to move on, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I took a job as an analyst with a really interesting and successful company, though I feel I am significantly underperforming and out of place. I'm not really enjoying what I do, and the stress of the role is having a negative impact on my mental health. 
I'm struggling to see my way forwards (putting this down somewhat to depression and stress) and am unsure of what I can do instead. I have a strong education (BSc in Physics), years of work experience (I've worked in hospitality alongside my education since I was 13), and have other talents outside of my work and experience (I am a semi-professional artist, working on ad-hoc comissioned pieces) however I can't see a way to connect them. 
My dream is to become a watchmaker, which I am studying in my own time, though unfortunately I am not in a position to be able to afford to study it full time. I've applied endlessly to apprenticeships and reached out to many boutique watchmaking and repair shops, though I've had no response (probably due to a lack of formal qualifications). Pivoting to a career in horology is currently not viable for me, so I keep this on the back burner for when I can afford to fully throw myself into it.
I'm feeling a bit lost, and would appreciate any advice, or suggestions.

When you apply for a job on a LinkedIn and then notice that the job poster has viewed your profile but you don't hear anything from them. You start having self doubt and your self esteem goes down.

Why don't these job posters hide themselves on LinkedIn so you cannot see they have looked at your profile? Same with recruiters on the platform.

They should really put themselves in our shoes and understand how it would feel if they experienced this."

While I had a feeling I was rejected, I would have never officially known if my other supervisor didn't make a comment about a new hire during our team meeting. I feel this was very unprofessional and I'm pissed."
