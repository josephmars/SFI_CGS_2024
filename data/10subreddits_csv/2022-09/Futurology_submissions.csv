I was watching a podcast with John Carmack and Lex Friedman and I started to have an idea about how the brain works, perhaps my insight could prove useful to someone developing AGI.

There seems to be two parts that are critical to AGI problem/solution domain, and intrinsic to human intelligence, those two parts are recursion, and reflection, which I will cover in more detail.

So reflection has a human interpretation and a computer science (CS) interpretation. The human interpretation is that we reflect on ideas, we have ideas about ideas, and this creates a structure for increasingly advanced concepts to be formed, each with new levels of abstraction.

The CS interpretation is that in programming languages like Java, we have meta programming constructs to abstract objects in the problem/solution domain, we can look up objects at runtime, and find objects that model that objects model, it's very interesting, and I believe it could be abstracted with multiple neural nets. I would like to get feedback from software developers with experience in AI development on this issue of abstracting the reflection process with neural nets.

The second part that I want to cover is recursion, recursion is the process of feeding the output of some function back to the input, this can be repeated to solve all sorts of problems such as sorting, path finding, and searching.

I imagine recursion, reflection and neural networks can be used to solve all sorts of problems, but I would like to get feedback on how far we can get to AGI with these three alone.

Additionally I see awareness to be a process of recursion, reflection, and a learning network (neural network) with some unknown characteristics. When we are aware, we are practicing mindfulness, which is essentially taking our input from the world, modeling it (recursion), making a model about the model (reflection), and simulating this model (neural network learning).

I am just brain storming with these concepts, and I hope that it could stimulate a thoughtful discussion on how AGI and awareness, can be implemented with recursive reflection. And also if recursive reflection is well defined it could help in AGI developments. Perhaps someone could define ""recursive reflection"" better than I can in this thread to assist in AGI research.

Let me know what you guys think, thank you!"

I have chaired [London Futurists](https://londonfuturists.com/) since 2008, and am the author or leadeeditor of [11 books about the future](https://deltawisdom.com/books/), including [Vital Foresight](https://transpolitica.org/projects/vital-foresight/), [Smartphones and Beyond](https://smartphonesandbeyond.com/), [The Abolition of Aging](https://theabolitionofaging.com/), [Sustainable Superabundance](https://transpolitica.org/projects/abundance-manifesto/), [Transcending Politics](https://transpolitica.org/projects/transcending-politics/), and, most recently, [The Singularity Principles](https://transpolitica.org/projects/the-singularity-principles/).

[The Singularity Principles](https://transpolitica.org/projects/the-singularity-principles/) makes the case that

1. The pace of change of AI capabilities is poised to increase,
2. This brings both huge opportunities and huge risks,
3. Various frequently-proposed “obvious” solutions to handling fast-changing AI are all likely to fail,
4. Therefore a “whole system” approach is needed, and
5. That approach will be hard, but is nevertheless feasible, by following the 21 “singularity principles” (or something like them) that I set out in the book
6. This entire topic deserves *much more attention* than it generally receives.

I'll be answering questions here from 9pm UK time today, and I will return to the site several times later this week to pick up any comments posted later."

Convince me that we will be able to consistently charge/power every electric vehicle when they need to be.

Convince me that lithium isn’t endgame, and that soon enough we will find a sustainable alternative - that it won’t become the new “oil”, a natural resource we overwhelmingly strip from the planet.

Convince me electric cars will be made to last, and the batteries too. Ford Model Ts are still driven around. I mean seriously, I see them all the time.

Convince me that we aren’t being tricked into thinking it’s the solution. I know, but don’t write it off just yet. After all, once we go electric, people will feel more of an urge to “upgrade” more often as the technology advances, similar to how many treat smartphones. Why not put the time and effort into developing a good compressed-air powered solution? We know they can work, albeit they do need more research.

Convince me that electric vehicles are the solution.
If this future is coming to us sooner than later, and seemingly forced upon, convince me this is the right way forward. 

I’m not an EV hater by any means, I too want a viable alternative to I.C, but I am very skeptical, and I am currently not convinced that EV is the proper thought-out solution."

As recent events in Russia show, shutting down even a single oil pipeline can devastate economies from thousands of miles away, soaring inflation, and even cause economic recession.

The fact is that we have too many computer chips making complex decisions, they're buying and selling commodities, they're manipulating the price of stocks, they're replacing jobs in the factories and they're swindling the average Joe out of making a living.

I don't know about you, but I for one, don't want to receive a computer from Elon Musk and implant it into my brain so he can gain control of my mind.

I don't want to live in a pod and receive my news media through an algorithm instead of from a fellow human being.

And I don't want all of these noxious chemicals spewing forth from distasteful factories, poisoning our children and our dogs, making them become transgendered, misgendered, cisgendered, and so forth.

The fact is that flame, is not the only thing that 'flame retardants' 'retard'. Read that again. Read that frontwards and backwards for me. Until it sinks in.

That's why we need to give the land back to the people and return to a more natural and holistic way of life."

* The breaking of the Doomsday glacier, causing immediate sea level rise and genocide for island and coastal cultures around the world.
* Proliferation of fungal infections, which we have few remedies for. Also, proliferation of fungal infections among plants and wildlife, which disrupt/threaten food webs and many species' abilities to survive.
* The collapse of the Mediterranean sea ecosystem due to ocean trawling and hotter conditions —&gt; *dead fish floating to shore, waters and beaches becoming toxic/unsafe to swim in for humans?*
* The inescapability of PFAS, which is now found in rain samples all around the world.
* Increasing intensity of storms and extreme weather events, unlike what we've seen before. Hail storms that penetrate house walls. Lightning storms that fry all the electrical appliances and systems in your house.
* The inter-relation of heat, violence, social collapse, rape, domination by force, collapse of human rights norms and collapse of political systems
* Mass migration, combined with a lack of reception policies, leading to social tensions, poverty, and mass injustices

This question comes as OP explores narratives/stories (e.g. short films, songs, imagery) which could impart these impending experiences to people — to inform people of what's happening all around us (as the media is silent), and jar people to demand immediate + urgent emergency action. *If you're interested in collaborating on stories/narratives about these scenarios, mention it in a reply or send a DM — looking for collaborators!*

Scenarios can be any scale/scope — global (sea level rise), regional (droughts across Somalia), local (the consequences of a dried up lake/river in a place), and tragedies / scenarios that affect species and cultures at an even more local level (e.g. Walruses falling off cliffs en masse [due to lack of sea ice](https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/439241-walruses-are-jumping-off-cliffs-to-their-deaths-yes-because-of/))"

0,2022-09-17,Karma Calculator,u/Ambitious-Toe4162,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/xgnjbk/karma_calculator/,Futurology,"Hello everyone!

I was wondering would it be possible to eventually create a karma calculator for calculating if an action causes positive or negative karma?

I'm just speculating, but I think the idea is interesting and would prove very useful.

For example, let's say there's a candy bar in a nearby store, and there's a homeless person starving, you can give him money or buy him a candy bar. The homeless person might have a drug addiction and might spend money on drugs instead of food, but you don't know that, so you do your calculation and you find the action which has the best karmic outcome.

Additionally you could find when a person has become reformed from a correctional facility by checking the karma associated with the action of releasing the person or not.

The way the calculation is done could be numeric, or it could be a simple good/bad flag on the action. You might be able to use some software program or a simple algorithm in your head that takes into account certain variables, the point is to have some technique that maximizes the potential for good of a certain action.

I think it's possible that as you observe karmic potentialities the good or bad choice might change according to your interpretation of the data. For example you might gain knowledge that something would be against your own interest, and so you recompute the karma of the decision and have a change of plans.

It's possible that the input to the algorithm, and the algorithm itself might be simple enough that you can get the answer using some simple heuristics about the situation. Or it might be complicated enough that you need a device with you, additionally there might be a visual or audio based interface.

I'm curious how long it would take for humanity to come up with such a technique to determine the quality of an action. What kind of technology would need to be developed to make it possible? 

Let me know what you think, thank you!"

The gun rattling in my grip. Infront of my stood Ronold Mcdonald. I knew what what I had to do. I raised my arm, and pulled the trigger. (ALSO READ: 30 tell-all confessions of Bollywood's worst husbands)

What followed was something that was both breathtaking and nerve-racking. I did know what I was doing. I watched my first-born limp away to his own quiet cemetery. And I fell to my knees. Did all my dreams vanish into thin air, did all the dreams of my other two children die with him? Did I, too, become a tragic parent? It didn't take me long to realise that they, too, were slowly dying without their father, their hero.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I cried like a broken-hearted child, not because my child was dead, but because of the dreams I had that died with him.

What haunted me most was my one-and-only son. I was beyond heartbroken and shattered. He used to be the one who brought me happiness. He would run his fingers through my hair, ask me questions and make me laugh like no one else. I thought I'd have my child with me all my life, he was my little miracle, and all this heartache and grief had robbed me of the brightest hope I had in the world.

Life, sadly, is unfair. It was by sheer serendipity that my son came back to me. My workmates – after making me cry and desperately promise me that it would all be okay – had decided to celebrate the boy's death by having a little party, and we started going to a nursing home to dance with our dead sons. They could be like us, they could feel pain. It was a sadistically funny idea, to celebrate a life cut short so cruelly. But there I was, dancing with a nurse-come-dancer. This little experiment only made me feel sadder and more horrible. It was just the natural expression of my grief and pain. But dancing, did it make it all better? My shattered dreams? That hardly seemed to be the case.

After that incident, and many more in the years that followed, my son has been my constant companion. We get each other through every heartbreak and loss, our entire lives. Our bond was so tight, I realised that he was really a person inside my body. But, when I went to court for my son's wedding, that's when the pain started. My parents were ecstatic to see their son getting married. But when I tried to sit in the wedding hall, the irony of my situation hit me hard. There I was, half a year away from being declared as the mother of a dead boy, only to be seated beside his bride. He was our day. I watched in disgust as he slowly touched my shoulder and thanked me for attending his wedding. I wanted to smack him. He had the audacity to thank me for going to a family gathering that he hadn't bothered to make any effort to attend in our lifetime. I watched in wonder as he jumped around with his mother. I wanted to tell her to stop looking at her happy daughter-in-law as if she had found an angel. It was like the feeling I'd had when I watched my son, lifeless, dragged to his own funeral. I wanted to tell her to stop giving me the warm fuzzies.

I watched him bathe his bride with tears rolling down his cheeks. He was a man now. But the second his mother-in-law saw me, she started crying. That, more than anything else, made me know he had chosen me as his mother. But I was there because my son made me that way, he made me believe that life would never let me down. As I walked back home that night, I looked at my neighbours' homes. Everyone was still asleep. I walked to the window to watch the night. I looked out and saw a man standing at the end of our street. My son had found his true love. I watched as he stood at the end of the street and went into her house. He had a family now. A home. That made me smile. He didn't have to dance anymore, because life had given him that.

I didn't leave my home for weeks after that. Every time my son and I entered the house, we smiled. He asked me if I wanted to cook. Yes, I did. I asked him if I could buy some peanuts. Yes, I could. I asked him if he wanted me to drive him to the bazaar for flowers. Yes, he did. I am alive because my son had made me that way. He made me believe that life would never let me down."
