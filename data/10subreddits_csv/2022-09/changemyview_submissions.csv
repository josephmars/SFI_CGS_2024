38,2022-08-31,CMV: Senior citizens should recieve even more love from people in Western culture,u/thesapphicowl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x2tftg/cmv_senior_citizens_should_recieve_even_more_love/,changemyview,"Let me start with this: This is by no means a ""end all be all"" situation, every older person is a case by case basis. However, this is an issue I have with our general culture (mainly the US) that I think needs to be addressed. 

For decades we have mocked the idea of old people in all types of media, decided older features are ""ugly"" and generally cast them aside. The general public seems indifferent at best to seniors to downright abusive. Greedy for their money in wills, willing to target their homes for robbery- even outright inciting violence against seniors. From The Simpson's Grandpa Abe to Family Guy's Herbert, we also end up treating them as creepy or just a drag to listen to (not to knock those shows, I love em myself).

I think we need to treat older people with more respect, because after all they were once our age. They once ran marathons, fought wars... They have so many stories to share and HISTORY to contribute. To treat them as second class is downright awful. I'm not arguing every old person is a saint, but I can't get over that someone as sweet as my own great grandma is the target of harassment and scams. That she's seen as ugly just for being 83. We're so eager to cut their programs and go ""Cut grandpa's life support, he's not gonna live long anyways""."

2,2022-08-31,CMV: Yelling some variation of ‘I can’t hear you’ to a crowd is annoying and achieves the opposite of the intended effect,u/idrinkkombucha,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x2vbyb/cmv_yelling_some_variation_of_i_cant_hear_you_to/,changemyview,"At a concert or presentation or rally or wherever, a singer or speaker usually opens by saying some variation of ‘goes everyone doing tonight?’ Which is met with cheers or a general ‘good’, and often the speaker then says ‘what was that?? I couldn’t hear you! I said HOW’S EVERYONE DOING TONIGHT?!’

This is, in my opinion, so annoying and achieves the opposite effect. Rather than energizing me, it pisses me off and makes me feel grumpy as I muster up the effort to respond in a louder voice. Because basically what the speaker is insinuating is that my energy is not good enough and I have to be LOUDER and ENERGETIC, and maybe I’m just a pissed off old fogey who doesn’t know how to have a good time, but don’t force me to shout an answer to prove that I’m having fun. Plus, if I’m not having fun, it’s probably the fault of the speaker, anyway. But now you’re pinning your incompetence on me and blaming me for my, in your eyes, inadequate response to your rather lame question.

Think about if we did in this in our day-to-day interactions. You go to the grocery store and the checkout clerk asks how your day has been. You respond, ‘oh fine’. Then the clerk says, ‘oh come on! HOW HAS YOUR DAY BEEN?!’

It is irritating, presumptuous, and overbearing. It achieves the opposite effect, so that it lowers energy rather than heightening it."

EDIT: I've really appreciated the discussion so far. My replies have slowed overnight and so far today due to work, but I intend to respond to as many people as I can.  Thanks!

*************

I believe that parents are our first and most significant teachers in life. They also have a profound impact on shaping their children's worldview from religious views, morality, and even political beliefs. 

I believe that influence needs to be checked by a strong public education with curricula determined by people educated in their respective fields, not parental whims. Kids deserve, and society benefits from, a public education that promotes critical thinking and challenges held beliefs. 

This thought occurred to me due to several recent discussions on Reddit about various laws to ban certain types of books or manga, etc. from public schools. I live in Missouri, where we've recently passed such a law under the auspices of ""preventing teachers of spreading porn to kids.""

Now, I'm not here to debate whether the law is any good. But it got me thinking...

-""Intelligent design"" being pushed alongside evolution in science.

- Conservative movements to ban ""CRT"" from history and social studies classes. 

- Florida passing a ""parental rights in Education"" law that is silencing any mention of LGBT existence in state classrooms. 

My view is that these efforts to assert parental authority in the public curriculum are based on fear rather than a basis in literary merit, scientific study, historical fidelity, or acceptance of different ways of life. 

Fear that one's children might turn away from God, or have their worldview challenged. Fear that one's way of life is being lost and the only way to hang on is to literally conceal information that might lead to further change. 

These are not good reasons to sue schools or threaten teachers with prison time for sharing a graphic novel that includes some adult content. Kids need to be prepared for the adult world and they need to learn to see the world as it is, not as their parents want them to see it. 

I understand age-appropriateness, but I have not found any evidence of school sanctioned material being taught or made available that wasn't, including human sexuality in health class (and even that comes with a parental opt out).

If your worldview is so fragile that it can be shattered by 6 hours a day of public education, time to reconsider the merits of your worldview or at the very least, pay for private school where they can indoctrinate your kids however you want. 

I realize I'm laying out a fairly cynical assessment of parental challenges to school curricula, but it's how I currently see things. Help me broaden my understanding.

People offer thoughts and prayers but won’t go out and help a cause. They’ll complain about wages and how big corporate are ruining everything.

However I think it would be the best thing ever, to be clear I'm talking about being rich *and* famous together, and I'm assuming that I'd be famous for something non-criminal so I wouldn't be behind bars, with that said there would be many benefits to being rich and famous.

&amp;#x200B;

**Everyone wants to know what your opinion on everything is**

WHen you're famous people really care and want to know what your opinion on things are, when you're not famous nobody really gaf about your opinions, but if you're famous you suddenly have a much bigger platform to push your beliefs and opinions, and having people care aboiut what you think would be very empowering imo.

&amp;#x200B;

**You can do whatever you want**

This is more of a ""rich"" thing but if you're rich and famous you can do near anything, if you want 5 star meals every day of the week, go for it. Do you want to go to Hawaii just 'cause. Book that flight (in first class too). You can just do whatever whenever because you don't need to work to get by, if you don't want to do something you have FU money to get out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Everything becomes an adventure**

Being famous means that every outing and minor errard suddenly has the chance to be an exciting adventure. Someone at the Walmart or the Applebees or wherever may recognize you and you'd be able to sign their autograph or have an impromtu interview, that sounds amazing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**You still have privacy**

And if you want some private time, just get some DoorDash and draw the curtains. Unless someone is hanging out in your closet then you'll have all the privacy you want, in any case it's not like you really have privacy outside your house irl (unless you live in rural areas where you're like 5mi away from the next house) so really it's no change.

&amp;#x200B;

I admit that this isn't the most thought out view ever but I can't shake this feeling that being rich and famou would be the best thing ever and a total blast. CMV.

The Republican party has shown time and again a flagrant disregard for the rule of law, and democracy.From the overturning of Roe v. Wade, to the Capitol insurrection, to support republicans is to support fascist. It was once said that if you see a table with five nazis and you sit down with them, its a table with six nazis. I believe the same applies here. If you continue to knowingly spend time with those who openly support fascism, then you are complicit in the actions of those people, and are making it clear that you don't find fascist ideals particularily distasteful.

Additionally, I believe that doing this might convince some less rabid conservatives to give up their ideals, as a small subset of them might value their families over their politicians. I make exceptions for workplace interactions and other strictly professional settings, so long as you never progress the relationship further than that. Many will think this policy harsh, after all, grandma's pretty sweet aside from thinking the world would be better if the government deported all the brown people. But ask yourself, do you really want to be around someone who has such terrible views, even family? I personally don't."

1797,2022-09-01,CMV: There is absolutely no reason to trust that the Roman Catholic Church is being honest about it's overall financial state.,u/MouzeRat,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x3buro/cmv_there_is_absolutely_no_reason_to_trust_that/,changemyview,"The Holy Roman Catholic Church is one of the oldest financial institutions in the world, and by that I mean to say is that they have a managed a steady cash flow, both inbound and outbound, continuously for longer than almost any other organization or agency in the world.

In an annual disclosure from 2021, the Vatican claims that it took in €46.9 million and that it spent €65.3 million.^[[1]](https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/it/info/2022/06/16/obolo-di-san-pietro---annual-disclosure-2021.html) But that disclosure was never confirmed by outside auditing bodies, the disclosure provides no supporting transactional data, and only discloses income from donations despite the fact that that other sources of income exist.

To expand more on other sources of income outside of donations, the Vatican (the church's sovereign capital) also has a thriving tourism industry, a diverse international stock portfolio, and runs it's own private bank.^[[2]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030613/secret-finances-vatican-economy.asp) The bank itself manages funds in the amount of €5 billion according to it's own disclosures^[[3]](http://www.ior.va/content/ior/en/cos-e-lo-ior.html) but has been the subject of MULTIPLE financial criminal scandals^[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Works_of_Religion#Controversies) due to the nature of it's location being in sovereign church jurisdiction that makes outside regulation difficult if not outright impossible. In it's own financial disclosure the church bank states:

&gt; [T]he laws and other regulations issued by the Italian Republic are observed as supplementary, subject to prior approval by the competent Vatican authority. They are adopted on the condition that they do not conflict with the doctrine of Divine Law

Meaning that they really only follow Italian laws and regulations when they want to.

A disclosure from the ASAP (Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See - the an accounts management branch of the church) listed gross assets around €2.2 billion in 2021 and net assets (minus all liabilities) at a little less than €1.3 billion with most of the equity being listed as real estate assets.^[[5]](https://www.americamagazine.org/sites/default/files/attachments/Communication%20Bilancio%202020.pdf) however CBC News estimates the church's holdings in Canada to be, at it's most impossibly conservative estimate, to be around CDN $160 billion (or €122.2 billion or USD $121.4 billion).^[[6]](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/vatican-assets-residential-school-compensation-1.6404280) Additionally, Australian based Fairfax Media estimates the church's Australian real estate holdings to be worth nearly AUD $30 billion (or €20.4 billion or USD $20.3 billion).^[[7]](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-12/catholic-church-worth-$30-billion-investigation-finds/9422246) 

Now, I will concede that I did not double check the findings of either Fairfax or CBC News myself. However, both parties used publicly available information to reach these findings and I would presume that if there was evidence to the contrary that someone would have disputed these findings. I will not change my view if someone merely tries to say ""yeah but didn't check the findings yourself, Hitchen's Razor, you need to see the evidence with your own eyes"". I will need to see some tangible tabulated evidence of the contrary which I realize shifts the burden of proof in an unfair way but I really just don't want to have to do all of that work fact-checking on my own. If you want to compile records of Australian or Canadian real estate holdings of the church available through public information to prove me wrong then PLEASE DO, I invite it. But please show your work and cite your sources because I am not going to do that research.

In conclusion, the church has been caught undervaluing their assets by multiple sources and refuses to be completely transparent with all of their accounting records. Conservative estimates from outside investigations put their valuations in the range of hundreds of billions of US dollars despite their insistence that they have less than that. I do not believe that the Roman Catholic Church's financial disclosures can be trusted and that they are being distinctly and intentionally dishonest in their representations."

Society should only design transportation for cars when absolutely necessary. Whenever governments can, they should choose to design systems for more efficient and safe forms of transportation, even if that means building housing and businesses in different places.**

# Reason 1: death

Private car transportation kills far more people than buses, trains, bicycles, walking, skateboarding, or flying. [\[source\]](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/safety-topics/deaths-by-transportation-mode/) While any transportation always carries a risk of death, car travel is so much higher that it's barely comparable. Cars have a high risk of killing people not in cars, with 20% of vehicle deaths being pedestrian or bicycle crashes. \[[source](https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/ped_bike/)\] Pedestrians don't sign up to be killed by cars.

Morally speaking, we should want to reduce violent death as much as possible. Especially violent death of young people -- vehicle death is the #1 cause of death for teenagers. \[[source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db37.htm)\] This alone should make us prefer other, safer modes of transportation over cars.

# Reason 2: traffic and capacity

But cars are fast, right? In fact, this is only an illusion.

While cars are faster than bikes and trains in terms of raw speed along a path between two points, cars are very slow when interacting with other cars. [Here is a nice breakdown](https://therapidtransient.wordpress.com/2021/02/06/off-the-rails-comparing-the-capacity-of-trains-buses-cars-and-more/) of the speed of moving people by different transportation types.

The advantage of mass transportation is that you can fit more people in the same ""car."" This allows you to operate with more efficiency as traffic gets worse. Cars remain single-occupancy even during rush hour, while trains regularly fill to capacity.

Cars are only faster than transit when cars are given far far far more space to use. What if trains were given the kind of comprehensive network that cars are given? In New York City, trains have far less space allotted to them than cars, but still manage to be faster than cars in many cases during rush hour.

# Reason 3: space

Cars take up far more space than other forms of transportation. This is self-defeating: cities must be spread further apart to make room for all the space cars take up, which makes travel take longer. If we took away space from cars, destinations wouldn't need to be so far apart, and less time could be spent on transportation.

Cars need wide roads to make lanes for everybody, and also turn lanes, intersections, wide shoulders for safety, and wide clear zones, curved entrance and exit ramps, and huge interchanges. The worst culprit of all is *parking.* [There are 8 parking spots per car in the US.](https://www.fastcompany.com/90645900/america-has-eight-parking-spaces-for-every-car-heres-how-cities-are-rethinking-that-land)

Space is precious everywhere. Why do we waste so much of it on transportation when we have more efficient alternatives?

# Reason 4: pollution

This might be the most important reason. Cars pollute like crazy. They are the largest, heaviest machines used regularly by the majority of people. Hopefully I don't have to convince anyone here that climate change is bad and that emissions need to decrease and it needs to happen 10 years ago.

In a world where we need desperate climate solutions as fast as possible, we should be looking at culling cars along with all the other solutions we are inventing. We already have the tools to do it. We have tried and tested replacements. We just need to decide to make it happen.

Pollution also directly effects the local population. [Living near a major road is awful for your health](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-11/documents/420f14044_0.pdf).

# Reason 5: Cost

Cars are ridiculously expensive. Most people don't really account for the full cost of transportation in their lives, only accounting for fuel costs and maybe their monthly payment. But [owning a car costs more than owning a house](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2022/02/04/lifetime-cost-of-small-car-689000-society-subsidises-this-ownership-with-275000/?sh=548e3c4c6398) over your lifetime. Other forms of transit are so much cheaper it's almost laughable. [Car transportation systems are stupidly more expensive](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/8/17/in-transportation-costs-its-the-system-stupid) than mass transit or biking. This cost is paid by both the individual and by society. Don't forget that accidents and lawsuits cost money too, and cars cause these in high numbers.

# Reason 6: Freedom

Cars are seen as the ultimate sign of freedom. But like many things touted as freedom, they actually take away freedom from everything else. Because they take up so much space and they endanger anybody who comes near them, they remove transportation options from everyone else.

Streets without cars can be used for almost anything -- a lemonade stand, skateboarding, bicycling, sidewalk chalk. Take a look at car-free streets around the world and this is what you see.

But streets with cars can only be used for one thing: driving.

Which is more free?

Here is a list of people who can't drive: children, blind people, people with certain mental disabilities, people with certain physical impairments, poor people (can't afford a car), drunk people, and people who just aren't able to pass a driving test. Don't these people deserve transportation too? Cars take space from these people. But transit can be accessible to almost everyone. Which is more free?

# Conclusion

Cars are necessary in some environments. When you need to access a place that's far away from other people and you need to do it fast, a car is the way. But it's still extremely dangerous and expensive, and the pollution is still there. So society should still be looking for ways to reduce these trips even when they seem necessary.

We should be looking for ways to create transit between small towns, bike routes through suburbs, and car-free plazas replacing streets in our city centers. We should have high-speed rail between cities. In every place we can, we should strategize on how to replace cars with something safer and more efficient. We should use [Transit Oriented Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit-oriented_development) to build our environments to make transit work.

People will always need to live on farms and use individualized transit. That's all fine. But most people don't want to and frankly can't. Most people want to be near conveniences. We should let them! We should build enough housing close to amenities so that driving isn't necessary for anyone who doesn't want it.

Because of all the problems cars carry with them, society should be looking to aggressively restrict them and replace them everywhere necessary.

I understand moral values are relative and vary greatly across cultures of the world. 

When I say muslims are patriarchal I’m not trying to shame them but just calling it for what it is. Because reading the verses in the Quran I can’t see how a Muslim can support gender equality *and* support the Quran at the same time.

My view probably won’t change with the argument that most muslims aren’t patriarchal in their actions or private lives because I would counter that they’ve completely ignored the blatant patriarchy in those verses.

My view may change if someone can explain a sensible contrary interpretation of those verses.

*Men are the managers of the affairs of women for that God has preferred in bounty one of them over another, and for that they have expended of their property. Righteous women are therefore obedient, guarding the secret for God's guarding. And those you fear may be rebellious admonish; banish them to their couches, and beat them. If they then obey you, look not for any way against them; God is All-high, All-great.* 4:34 - Quran

*The smallest reward for the people of Heaven is an abode where there are eighty thousand servants and seventy-two houri, over which stands a dome decorated with pearls, aquamarine, and ruby, as wide as the distance from al-Jabiyyah to San'a* - Hadith

Houris: women with beautiful eyes described as a reward for the faithful Muslim believers in Paradise.

games are ultimately entertainment, why overly stress? you shouldn't throw of course, but if you find yourself frustrated i think its pretty invalid.

some say this is bad thinking too cuz subjective feelings must be respected but i mean, other priorities are simply more legit to be stressful about.

I do have a few friends who are but it has never interested me.

I think that pup hoods get too much shit. People always say ""think of the children"" when they talk about pup hoods. Do you think the children, after seeing pup hoods, are going to suddenly become fetishistic perverts and partake in kink underage? When i was a kid, i saw lots of different kinks and learned about them, that didn't make me do them. Do you think that, as a child, i had the money to buy a pup hood?? Are you worried a kid will ask what it is? All you have to say is that its a mask. Most fursuit makers turn away minors anyway, so what is the difference in excuses of not to have one? You aren't required to tell your child the full history of pup masks from beginning to end. And usually they dont care enough to ask anyway. Theyll probably be enamored by how cool you look!

Pup hoods are literally just masks to me. Sure puppy play is a kink, but literally anything can be a kink. Being a furry can be a kink, but we don't single out every furry with a yiff kink and say ""THATS WHAT FURRY IS, NOT FOR CHILDREN, ITS A FETISH."" i am aware that puppy play is also an outside thing, and people who like puppy play dont have to be furries. But even the outsiders have said that they do non-sexual puppy play. Pet regressing is the act of getting into an animalistic headspace for mental comfort due to past or current trauma, or just for fun. Its literally the SAME headspace as if you were to wear a fursuit, just with a different outfit. Obviously if you are out dry humping people in a hotel lobby, then you should get your nuts kicked, but people who wear like, JUST pup hoods and then a cute outfit, and like a collar/harness, doesn't seem bad to me at all. It makes it seem like if they think that way about pet regression then they would think that age regression and ddlg are the same thing. (Speaking of age regression, if you try to say this about ""crinkling"" or wearing a diaper in public, i dont think that its fair to compare a pair of pants meant for shitting in, to an animal mask made of leather.)

While it is clothes sometimes used for sexual purpose, ALL clothes can be that way. I garuntee that 40% of the people you have met today probably had sex in their clothes and didn't wash them immedeately afterwards. I don't see a problem. Its just a few bad people making others uncomfortable thats ruining pup hoods.

I cant really understand why other furries condemn it so much. Im open to changing my viewpoint, or at least becomming more informed."

There always has been and always will be a changing environment of complex problems a society faces as it grows and ages that seem hard if not impossible to solve in the moment. Most of these issues take time and require a more gradual change of view, perception and action as a greater majority comes to a better understanding and common agreement of the best way to handle a problem. Covid is a great recent example on how public opinion shifts in a slow but uniform fashion resulting in a better outcome for all when everyone shares the same concerns about their health and way of life.

Unless you can conquer the opposition there is little point in creating division, enemies, and an us vs them mentality on really any problem when that will only sustain the issue rather than solve it. It takes time but the only way to truly solve some of these tough social problems is by getting everyone on the same team.

It is so much easier to rally against one common enemy where all blame can be shifted and rested upon, it is easier to hate than understand and come together as one greater force. Unfortunately we are headed down a path of division (with the internet being the source) that will inevitably result in a world that is worse for all when it is capable of being so much better when we can agree and find common ground.

Funny, finally a means for the common person to gain more control over their oppressors comes along called the internet. And as quickly as it united the world together through one common means it just as quickly started going backwards with so many falling into the trap of becoming enemies with the same people who are their allies, friends and neighbors in real life."
483,2022-09-02,"CMV: The Drake Equation is not profound in any way, and it makes no sense for that to equation to be credited to someone.",u/fabulousburritos,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x4bf0m/cmv_the_drake_equation_is_not_profound_in_any_way/,changemyview,"RIP Frank Drake of course, but that equation is one of the most pseudo-profound ideas in all of pop-science. Let's break it down a bit.

The Drake Equation attempts to estimate the number of civilizations we could communicate with in our galaxy. To do that, it lays out a probabilistic argument concerning the likelihood that a star gives rise to intelligent, communicable civilizations, and then uses rates of star formations and lifetimes of civilizations to transform that into a total estimate of civilizations. All in all, there are 7 unknown variables that need to be solved for to arrive at our answer.

My issue is that this is a *very* simple argument of probability. You could ask an undergraduate to come up with something like this as a homework assignment, and they could come up with something equally as profound. If you know how to combine probabilities, you're 95% the way there. Additionally, this equation is absolutely useless if you don't have a good estimate of the parameters of the equation, which, surprise, we don't. It *actually* gets us no closer to understanding how many other intelligent civilizations exists, but for some reason has captured the attention of some who think it's profound.

My beef with this equation being named after him is that I think you should come up with a genuinely new and profound idea to be able to slap your name on it. Obvious examples being Newton's laws, or Noether's theorem.

You can change my view if you can convince me that either 1). this equation has something new and profound that I'm missing, and couldn't in fact be derived by your average astronomy undergraduate or 2). there is some other GOOD reason to name this after him that I haven't thought of. I should warn you, I'm a stickler about naming things after yourself, so you might have to go through 1). to convince me of 2). Change my view!

Edit: I conceded my second point - I think there is good reason to put his name on that equation. See below

Edit2: Let me check in real quick and say thanks to y'all who are or did participate in good faith. There seems to be a misunderstanding by what I mean by profound that I should clear up here. I don't mean to say the Drake equation is uninteresting, insignificant in history, or flat out wrong. I also understand its general purpose was not to solve for something outright, but instead was to frame a discussion. As I've said, it's a very sensible starting point. Perhaps my thoughts on it can be better sum up by this snippet of a comment, which addresses the question as to why nobody had thought of it before, if it truly isn't a profound idea:

&gt; The variables used in Drake's equation itself is concerned with the development of stars, planets, life on planets, and technology in civilization. Clearly, if we wind back the clock enough we don't have a good way to think about how long it takes civilizations to unlock radio communications. So we were at a point in history where we had the perspective to understand the development from stars to communicable civilizations. Note, that this understanding was not a product of Drake or SETI, but of the entire history of science. Drake then rolls in and asks the remarkably simple question of how probable this is in terms of the probability of each individual part. This final step in conceiving the Drake equation is trivial. This is what I am trying to say. They could have thrown you in that decade, gave you a university education, and you could have reproduced the same equation when prompted. Yes, you.

It really is about how plainly simple, and therefore devoid of useful insight, the equation is. The fact that it doesn't do anything to further our understanding of the situation is enough for me to label it as ""not profound"".

Edit3: For the record, I regret ever making this post

Edit4: Nothing original has been said in a while, so I’m very likely done dealing with this post. Y’all have convinced me the the equation does deserve his name, but other than that nobody’s been able to change my view. Sorry if you don’t feel like I have your reply a fair shot - I probably just didn’t find that approach convincing (in the end, it’s about MY view anyway). Thanks again y’all, cheers"

I watched 30 minutes of the new Lord of the Rings, Rings of Power and thought it was horrible. It was so boring I just turned it off and went to sleep. 

I am a huge fantasy nerd. When I was a kid I did Warhammer, DnD, everything. Read LotR in the 5th grade and the movies came out when I was in high school and it ruled! Loved em. 

Hobbit movies were not great but I wrote off as maybe they are for kids or something?

Fast forward to last night and I'm pretty stoked for the new TV series. Put it on and it's beautiful but so empty. The writing and character development were really bad. I turned it off. Going side by side with the great writing so far on House of the Dragon just makes it look even worse. 

Go to look on youtube to see what people are saying and see plenty of videos about how bad they are. But a lot of these videos are from same type of angry nerds were were *really mad* that Star Wars had women and non-white people, seem like the kind of people who had strong opinions about Gamer Gate. Use the term Mary Sue constantly. They have barely contained glee that a show that cast black hobbits (sorry harfoots) is bad so they can ""prove"" that ""woke"" stuff is bad. 

So I'm open to having my view changed for two reasons:

1) Rings of Power is actually good and I should continue watching. (I don't care if you spoil it to make your point)

2) Rings of Power is actually bad and I shouldn't let the fact that some of the people who don't like it are idiots affect my judgement."

By ""contemporary works of philosophers of science"", I do not mean *philosophy of science as such*, many philosophers use the excuse that ""scientists are always doing philosophy"" to defend *their works*. I find this insufficient because, yes scientists are most likely ""doing philosophy"" whatever that means according to them, but scientists are not influenced by *contemporary works of philosophers* and usually philosophers of science don't contribute directly to the works of scientists. I mean this very strictly, in three parts:

1. There are a specialized professional community called ""philosophy of science"" which are part of philosophy departments, or independent workers, dedicated to discussing ""philosophy of science"" while ""contemporary scientists"" are all those who deal with first-order problems in science (I reluctantly put ""engineers"" as part of this community as well). The sciences are natural sciences (all branches of physics, biology, chemistry, geology,...) and social sciences (economics, sociology,
2. The discussions and debates and theories by dedicated philosophers of science simply do not matter to the works of (contemporary) scientists. I do not dispute that (sometimes) it is simply not the goals of philosophers of science to convince scientists of anything or to contribute to any science. I want to reiterate my idea again thus:
3. The w*orks* of c*ontemporary philosophers in the sense indicated* simply do not matter to the *works* of contemporary scientists in the sense indicated, i.e. in the scientific problems they are trying to solve. I add in the ""regularly"" because I recognize that *sometimes* the scientific community will be greatly influenced some philosophers of science at some point (Popper? Uncertain if even he in fact influenced the works of any working scientist at his time). This also means, of course, that I don't count popularizing science as part of scientists' works. I don't count the influence of physicists and astronomers' condemnation of astrology or the Velikovsky affairs: those are not first-order problems of science
4. I restricted the time period to 1980s so you can answer me easier and to avoid having obvious and tired answers (such as ""Karl Popper"" or ""Thomas Kuhn""). However, I don't even believe these philosophers were all that influential.

So let me state my reasons for believing this after having clarified further.

* *Problems* recognized in the philosophy of science don't actually coincide with, and thus contribute to, scientists' *works*.

Two examples:

One of the biggest names in philosophy of science is Bas van Fraassen whose work in philosophy of science is the postulation of constructive empiricism: the view that science doesn't aim at the truth of observables *and* unobservables but only the truth of observables or, put differently, that science aims only at empirically adequate (and true for observable phenomena) theories. This simply did not influence, as far as I know, any real scientific discoveries since then: the discovery of AIDS virus, proposal of cosmic inflation and experimentally confirmed of the accelerated expansion, W and Z bosons discovered,... All of these discoveries simply were ""accepted"" independently from the works of Fraassen. In fact, his works just seem like a scholastic commentary on science. No scientists can learn anything substantive from him. I'd even argue that the majority would disagree with him: either in the instrumentalist sense like Hawking or realist (including its metaphysics) like Roger Penrose. This is an example from ""natural science"".

The other big name is Nancy Cartwright. Her works on economics (""social science"") seem interesting, but ultimately fall on deaf ears for all economists because, as [Lawrence Boland has argued](http://www.sfu.ca/~boland/Cartwright_Review.pdf), her works don't coincide with the model-building activities of economists. My arguments are already presented by Boland so I won't reiterate.

* Scientists don't *need* the help from philosophers (most of the time, especially in the time period I noted).

Again, an example can be gleaned from Boland's review of Cartwright. But for another example, philosophers usually criticize this attitude for phil of sci by scientists by commenting that they ""dispose and criticize the foundations of science"" and such, but practicing scientists are already doing it themselves.

Roger Penrose [criticized string theory](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691119793/fashion-faith-and-fantasy-in-the-new-physics-of-the-universe) (I do know his body of ideas are definitely not of the mainstream and string theory is popular but it is not an uncommon fact that there are scientists working on other theories vs string theory).

The entire sociology profession is literally critical of everyone's works.

Economics despite the relative hegemony is in fact advancing pretty strong positions deviating from ""the mainstream"" all the time (from Stiglitz's works and criticisms of traditional models to [Duflo et al.'](https://economics.mit.edu/files/800) works on ""sharply posed and precisely answered"" problems of development economics to refinements in econometric techniques by [Angrist &amp; Imbens](https://www.nber.org/news/joshua-angrist-david-card-and-guido-imbens-awarded-2021-nobel-prize)). These developments were not due to ""philosophical criticisms/reflections/commentaries"" but by real problems the researchers face in their daily works. The causal-interpretation problems of Angrist and Imbens weren't even spawned by Cartwright's discussion of causality on economics. It was quite independently conducted.

I'll give you only those two reasons for now because you're probably tired of reading already. I've been thinking about this problem for a long time so I wish to make it quick how you can CMV most effectively: you can present evidence from real research influences that flow consistently from philosophy of science discussions to real problem solutions by scientists (for example: Popper's discussion of probability somehow helped quantum-physicists' in their journey or other contemporary significant works) with the views of the philosophers clearly in the works of the researchers. On the last bit, I don't consider that economists' emphasis on falsifiability is a result of reading Popper, but rather an influence from following Paul Samuelson (and Milton Friedman in econometrics)."

There are many people who say that cartoons mocking various religions are fine but often those people are not, religious, themselves, S, o they  don’t have anything to lose, I think that if cartoons mocking race or showing military veterans as cowards, or deriding the intelligence of women were published in the New York Times, those people would change their minds pretty quickly.
I think the next question then would be how do we determine what constitutes an insult, and the best way to do it is to look at the intent behind it because courts judge intent all the time in murder cases, so I don’t see why it would be any different for this although the burden of proof could be very high to prevent those grey areas."

Here are the links if you are unfamiliar with them[https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/03/one-billion-dark-money-2020-electioncycle/](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/03/one-billion-dark-money-2020-electioncycle/)[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/29/billions-in-dark-money-is-influencing-us-politics-we-need-disclosure-laws](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/29/billions-in-dark-money-is-influencing-us-politics-we-need-disclosure-laws)

The second thing is the ""Congress Stock Act"". Again, if I have misunderstood or misinterpreted it, please feel free to correct me. The gist of it means that a member of congress can freely commit securities fraud and if they are caught, they then have a closed-door meeting about it to decide if they are guilty or not. And if found guilty, they pay a $200 fine and move on. A $200 fine seems... pathetic. Especially if ( and again, I may be wrong ) they make $1,000,000 then pay a $200 but get to keep their $999,800 profit. This is compounded on the fact that they are allowed to be board members of publicly traded companies and have an extremely loose policy about disclosing their trades, while also facing virtually no consequences for breaking these rules. This is no better than a police officer investigating himself for a crime and finding that he did nothing wrong or deciding what his own punishment should be.

To me it seems like these are extremely serious issues because both sides in a way have a type of ''assured mutual destruction'' if they were to accuse the other side of these things and try to actually fix the problem. If the people who can fix the problems are the same ones who are benefiting from the problems, they will not fix it.  


**Edit**: The Dark Money stuff isn't so bad. It's bad, but just not all that terrible as one user pointed out. The Democrat supporters here seem to be jumping to the defence of the Democratic party and saying that '' they are trying but the Republicans stop it "". It's a little funny to see people just making excuses for their side and arguing which one is better, but has very little to do with what my post is about. I stated that **because** both sides have corruption, they will not agree to fix certain issues in which they profit. Even if one side is a little less corrupt, that would mean those same people who **are corrupt** within that party would vote against fixing the problem because they are benefiting from it. Calm down, I'm not saying that your favourite politician is worse than the other guy. They just won't be able to pass anything which can fix the problem because they wouldn't have the full support of their own party because corruption exists within it and those corrupt few would side with the opposition party. I get it, you believe your party is bestest party and other party is bad. "

IMO if legal immigrants add value to the country, make an effort to assimilate into the society and culture they should be welcomed into the society. But if there’s a set of people who absolutely don’t want outsiders no matter what, they are not wrong either - it’s their home. They should just direct their intent towards their government and strive for policy making to that end, and not towards legal immigrants who have no say in this matter.

If there is one thing that far right groups across the world are right about, it is this: the ""community"" has been collapsing for the past few decades. In this respect, I'd say they have a point in the culture wars, though I do strongly disagree with the methods of how we restore ""traditional society"", like banning abortions , overly harsh immigration policies, and etc( other far right policies).


No longer do people in Western countries, especially the youth, have a sense of community and purpose anymore.You could see this with the decline in attendance in churches and with the decline in military service, as well. This is also happening at a time where youth and teen depression, anxiety, divorce and suicide rates are only going up. Now, I would not blame this all on the cultural aspects as lack of spirituality, community, or purpose. There are, of course, economic reasons, like the cost of housing, childcare, and education. Simply put, it is quite hard to raise a family; and raising a family is part of living a fulfilling life. Since women tend to go for men who are able to provide for them both emotionally and FINANCIALLY, many average men are being left out in the dating market; and this is leading to the rise of the ""manosphere."" Then, there are also commercial, geographical and technological reasons, like the ease of transportion, the 24/7 access to literal phone computers, mass consumerism and entertainment. I could go on and on and on......


All of this concerning,because while I don't want to attribute all of this to a hot button issue like mass shootings, it does make sense as to why many young men may think about inflicting harm upon others.


Part of what lends credence to the far right's culture wars is the idea that the community has collapsed, and that the youth is falling further into the abyss. Maybe the way to counter this is  for opposition parties around the world to lean into it, and actually prescribe solutions that will  work, instead of what their proposing.


So, what are my proposed solutions of what could be done with the collapse of ""the community"",leading to a rise in mental health issues, loneliness, divorces and mass killings:


1.) Make military service mandatory for every men over 18,or after they graduate high school.


This is to ensure that young men actually become disciplined as a person and gain more confidence in themselves, which is important when it comes to self esteem issues and depression.




2.) Incentivize, in anyway possible, the attendance of churches.


-Though I am an agnostic person myself, I do recognize the extent to which church plays a role in strengthening a community. As someone who did go to church in my younger years , I do recall that going to church is not just about offering prayers and the like. It's also about meeting with new people and bonding with them. This is actually how my parents met for the first time back in the day.




3.) Establish a ""digital social credit economy""



So, there's this public figure named Andrew Yang.He was the presidential candidate in the US 2020 primaries. Although my views of him have soured lately, I do acknowledge how interesting and innovative this kind of idea was when he mentioned it in detail in one of his books "" The War on Normal People."" In his book, he had proposed a Digital Social Credit, which would enable people to take peoples' requests in any way possible for digital social credits; and these credits could actually be converted into real cash. For example, someone who has a passion for art could take a request to engage in some sort of art therapy for someone's depressed child. Or, it could be as simple as some kind of handyman job like fixing the boiler of someone's house. Anyways, his point was that a new kind of humanistic kind of capitalism could be created out of this. Perhaps, non profit, for profit and public/gov't organizations alike could utilize this digital social credit system to foster community engagement and togetherness?


4.) Mandate shorter work hours

-This is so that people simply have more time to spend with those whom they want to further their connection with, whether it be with a friend, relative, or partner. 


5.) Make it so that alimony laws are fair

-Women have more to gain in a divorce than men. I don't agree with banning divorces, but I believe what governments could do is remove any incentives of iniating a no fault divorce in the first place. 

6.) Get government off the backs of marriage contracts and weddings

-Sadly, it is unfortunate that even weddings are even expensive for the average man and woman. Promote the idea that weddings can come in all shapes and sizes, in terms of cost and extravagance.

-Remove the pressure that a ""contract"" induces onto a marriage. When two persons do not feel pressured and know what they actually want from each other and truly love each other while tempering their expectations, that is when things ""work out"" for a lifetime.

0,2022-09-03,CMV: Biden's speech could have been better,u/noobish-hero1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x50017/cmv_bidens_speech_could_have_been_better/,changemyview,"In his most recent speech, Biden rallied his base by calling out the far right extremist views for what they were, a threat to democracy. However, I think he went about it the wrong way. Now I don't think the general idea is wrong, but people always talk about negative reinforcement never working out. Harsher punishments on crime don't reduce crime, reforming criminals in prison does. Hitting your children doesn't make them behave more, it makes them better at hiding their misbehavior or it affects them in some way. Now apply that logic to this speech tonight.

Now before you argue that MAGA extremists shouldn't be accommodated, and I'm almost tempted to agree with you, that's not how we solve this divide in our country. I can already see the /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM comments here but seriously, take a minute and just step out of your own shoes for just a second and think about this issue in our country right now and how we solve it. Attacking the other side isn't making friends and it doesn't give us a chance to start a dialogue about our issues. Does the right do this? Absolutely. Do Democrats have to turn the other cheek? Yes. Why? Because we have to be the party of unity and it is on us to bring this nation together from this brink we are at. Instead, he talked about how we are being held back by MAGA extremists looking at the past while we look to the future and progress. Now step out of your shoes and into a conservative's. Biden's speech was one of a fascist military dictator talking about how people who are just asking questions are a threat to ""democracy"" and God knows what's gonna happen to me! Now this is a ridiculous take and I agree with that, but while I don't have any real numbers at least 30% of Americans would agree with it or at least some of it. We've gone down the route of giving them the finger. I offer the alternative route of ""ignoring"" them.

I have to say that I liked a lot of the speech. The start of the speech gave me chills and potential historic moment vibes. Calling out MAGA implicitly out here I think is fine. I like that he talked about progress and I love that he talked about the things we've accomplished. I love how he talked about creating another century of American prosperity; pax Americana has been the greatest period of human history ever and has seen amazing advancements in science and technology and I want to see that continue. I like that he mentioned that we need to move forward as a nation that values democracy. But I think that's what he should have focused on. By attacking MAGA extremists several times throughout the speech, we have alienated them for a long time and have probably sowed deeper division in our nation.

If instead he focused on what struggles we all face today, regardless of political ideology, he could have delivered a speech that truly brought us together. Yes, I'm using the class card. It should have been a speech where he calls MAGA out by talking about what we could have done or should be doing such as passing stronger labor laws or increasing wages so that people can afford this insane economy. He should have talked about the type of world future generations stand to inherit and what kind of stain we are leaving in this period of history with our pollution and refusal to fix it; what legacy are we leaving behind for our grandchildren? He should have talked more about healthcare and how insane costs can be made affordable for everyone. He should have talked about the things that could have improved life for Americans today instead of pointing fingers and calling them what they are because that doesn't bring nations together. That to me is a better slap to the face of the people who hold our nation back than what he did yesterday. It's the President's job to bring a nation together under his leadership and this is how I think this could have been an even more historic and unifying speech, by using implication instead of direct accusation. Calling out our enemies makes us feel good, but it doesn't make them think twice about their extremist views and it doesn't make them really think about what we should be doing instead of fighting a culture war. I believe it only leads us to breed even more toxic ""thought-germs"" in our circles and continuing to go nowhere fast. Change my view."

There are 3 definitions I've heard people make and I classify them as follows.

1. Inequitable racial outcomes. E.g. ""Few CEOs in S&amp;P 500 companies are black ergo corporate america is racism."" I find this definition absurd on its face and plain for everyone to see. Steelmanning the argument, it could be an indication of a racist system but it is an insufficient requirement.

2. ""Racism in the past means racism now."" It's self-evident that racism happened in the past and continues to happen all over the world. If this is the definition, the world is systemically racist and will always be because you can't change the past.

3. ""If racist people exist in the system, it is systemically racist."" This also exists all over the world and I'd assert the US is among the least racist societies to ever exist. 

Please change my view."

First I should define what I mean by “diverse”: I’m specifically referring to people who have fundamentally different beliefs and goals from you or your “group”. This isn’t a reference to racial or ethnic background. It’s my view people are -biologically- capable of considering almost anybody part of the their in-group so long as they their beliefs align more or less. 

But this is where my main issue lies. In order to maximize our brains efficiency and hence increase our chances for survival it learned to group and generalize the world (including people). 

In our attempts to create a “diverse” society of ideas and cultures I believe the experiment has led to two different outcomes: 

First, we simply replace the old labels for new labels, or simply coalesce with the other person or group. We retain the same amount of sterotypes and generalizations, the specifics are the only real change. 

The second, is when radically different people are forced to live together with no desire for condensing or assimilating belief. Often this simply leads to violence and chaos because human brains weren’t meant to actively retain that much data. 

In short, we need generalizations in order for the world to feel safe enough to interact with, but our brains can only handle so many, forcing us to either simplify the world or force the world to simplify for us."

While having a conversation with some people, someone used the phrase “It separates the boys from the men”. Another person interjected and said “and others”. Confused we asked what they were talking about. They said “other people who are girls or don’t identify either way are also involved so let’s not forget about them.” We respond it with a “uh yeah ok” and awkwardly continued the conversation.

This actually really annoyed me because we understand what the colloquial “Separates the boys from the men” and it’s not offensive so this interjection didn’t add anything to the conversation and just came off as “WHAT ABOUT ME!?”. I can’t think of any other time when doing this would be appropriate. I mean how would you even change the saying to fit that “this separates some people from some people”?

Now this is a person I otherwise like so cmv as to why this was appropriate. The best way to do that would be to explain a situation in which correcting someone, who’s neither wrong nor offensive, would be appropriate in any other situation"

I didn't notice a huge difference because I used the Note like my iPhone. After the 4 years using the Note 8, the LG Phoenix 4, and the Note 10+, I decided to switch back to iPhone 13 max.

I INSTANTLY felt completely handicapped. After years of tweaking and tuning my androids, I had created a phone experience that was practically molded to my hands. Now using my iPhone it's shocking how little control you have. 

Example 1: you can change the keyboard face of an iPhone with a couple tweaks. But on Android you can control every aspect, sometimes down to individual key sizes/placements. Now a majority of the time I press the ""."" key instead of the space bar and there's nothing I can do about it.

Example 2: You can't customize the iPhone control center AT ALL. This is bonkers to me. On the Note you could put any setting on your control center.

Any time I talk to my friends on iPhone they literally don't understand what I mean when I talk about replacing the keyboard, customizing control center, changing your launcher, etc. Sure, I understand the appeal of having a prebuilt experience ready to use out of the box. But I can't possibly see how iPhone would even be considered equal to Android.

tl;dr The only appeal to iPhone is blue text messages

Edit: I know that not everyone is tech savvy enough for that level of customization. But this isn't computer science, it's changing settings. It is well within most people's grasp to use an Android without messing it up

Edit 2: Not gonna lie, everyone has pointed out a lot that I didn't know about iPhone (which is ironic considering I loved tinkering and tweaking my Note 8 and 10). I still like Android more, but I can see more than blue text bubes to iPhone now."

And I made the title of the post kind of incendiary for two reasons: This is somewhat what I genuinely believe, and I want the people who come up here to truly want to defend the site, meaning actual users. But I'm open to people playing devils advocate.

My view is that some of the worst stuff that ever comes out of the internet is related to 4chan, and some of the worst people to come across in the interner are 4chan users. Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook all have their own issues, but the users of this platforms don't seem to reach the levels of insanity from 4chan. I want to clarify, I have never set foot in it, and I have no intention of ever doing so. I didn't knew much about it until recently, when I got interested and started looking up stuff about it. For reference, a big part of what I found was videos from the Internet Historian.

I have to admit that some actually funny things come out of 4chan, there's a reason why so many iconic memes came out of there, but I feel like the overall output of the site is just a bunch of lossers wasting their time trying to waste other peoples times, roleplaying being a psycho combined with some people who are actully close to being psychos. Humour is subjective, so I can't argue that roleplaying a psycho isn't funny, but at the very least I do find it pretty patetic.

I've looked back at stuff they have done in the past that are supposed to be iconic moments of the internet intersecting with the real world, and at times I can barely find what is supposed to be funny, their humour just reminds me of the annoying orange a lot of the times. Just act in the most obnoxious way possible until you find someone who is just a normal person who thinks you are annoying, and then you make them into the bottom of the joke.

I know that a lot of it is supposed to be ironic humour, but at the end they take it to the extreme where it just looks like roleplaying psychos.

And that's not even to talk about the other aspects of 4chan that make it more infamous, but for the sake of really trying to understand what people find appeling about it, I'll ignore all the biggoted stuff and pretend that it really is mostly people being ironic.

But then what would be the good part about it? Isn't it just a cancerous site? Even if you ignore the biggoted stuff what is supposed to be good about it? Most of the internet is cancerous enough, but 4chan somehow manages to stand out in how bad it is.

So, am I being irrational on what I think about 4chan?

Edit: More and more people are making really good points, but I have to eat, so I would stop replying for a while. Afterwards I'll have to start to giving deltas, because I definitely think I have changed my mind in some ways."

Now if it were socially acceptable to go around your daily business dressed up like the Stig, I think it would be more convenient for me. A racing suit like that would provide protection against bites and temperature extremes. The helmet provides more disease protection in addition to a facemask, not to mention its intended purpose of protection from head trauma. Also, I'm not conventionally attractive, so people wouldn't miss much by not seeing my face.

I understand that here in Australia, [ballistic armour is illegal](https://ballistics.com.au/technical/faq/#:~:text=Ballistic%20body%20armour%20is%20classed,the%20security%20industry%20are%20accepted), so I'm not saying that we should break the law and wear ballistic armour. What I am saying is that I won't be weirded out if other people I encounter on the street are covered with head-to-toe protection, looking like the Stig or Master Chief.

Right now, this is just a hypothetical for me:

* A racing suit isn't cheap, and I'll have to maintain and clean it too. 
* I'll also have to invest in Bluetooth communications to converse through my helmet.
* A racing suit will be useless in other parts of my job, such as lab work (also, I'll need to take off the helmet during lab work).
* The point of this post is that I think that it shouldn't be considered weird or stigmatised to go around covered in head-to-toe protection. 
* And before someone inevitably asks ""*but what about the burqa*"", I think it should be legal, but forcing someone to wear it should not be.

58,2022-09-04,CMV: White leftists should be less aggressive in serious discussions about race with other white people,u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x5gbh2/cmv_white_leftists_should_be_less_aggressive_in/,changemyview,"I think aggression is counterproductive in discussions about race. I'll sometimes see a white leftist bragging about how they attacked (verbally hopefully) their Trump supporting uncle at Thanksgiving. My thoughts when I see that are not ""you go girl!"" but ""you just turned a Trump supporter into a die hard Trump supporter.""

Aggression doesn't work in most cases, it makes people dig in their heels or shrink away. Almost nobody enjoys being lit into, and I think many can attest to that. (Personally, when somebody is aggressive towards me I tend to either get more stubborn or I shy away.) 

I think aggression is usually counterproductive no matter who it comes from, but I also recognize that a POC affected by racism cannot easily detach from a conversation about something that has harmed them and it would be unreasonable to expect that from anybody. 

But white leftists who have not been personally affected by racism ( the kind of racism that affects POC at least) are able to distance themselves. They can say ""Ok my racist uncle is going to spew ignorant blather, but I'm going to calmly explain my own point of view and why I think their POV is wrong."" And because they are more easily able to do so, I think they have an obligation to do so. 

That's my view, curious to hear others' views and open to changing my view as always!"

There are some people who want to claim all the positive things done in the name of their country, but firstly why should they be able to take credit for the work of for example scientists and inventors who they’ve never met and had nothing to do with, also they don’t seem to want to claim all the bad things done in the name of their country.
Patriotism just causes rancour and division, and there is nothing that you can get by being a patriot that you can’t get by being just a citizen of the world or an internationalist, by it’s nature patriotism argues to treat people differently based on where they were born.
Now George Orwell made a distinction between patriotism which he said was defensive and nationalism which is offensive, but the problem there is that you’re more likely to view the people who agree with you as patriots and those who disagree with you as nationalists, and there are some people who say that it involves holding your country to account but patriotism doesn’t mandate that and I think it actually makes it more difficult."

Not that there is anything wrong with women but when you go out with women it attracts weirdos and creeps. The past like 7 times I’ve gotten into a fight or almost have gotten into one has been directly or indirectly due to some creep harassing some woman we were with while out. Whenever it’s just me and the guys nothing usually happens because there’s no woman for any creep to try to harass or show off for leading for one of us to have to fight. I’m not saying this in any sexist type of way but it’s way more annoying going out with women because it increases the chance of getting into a fight by a lot.

Especially food. Your body literally needs nutrients to survive and food isn’t free at least as far as I know. Why don’t people complain about that instead? Does this mean that the examples I’ve listed and everything else should be free?? I just don’t get why period products need to be free, because everything comes at a cost.

&gt; It is evil to live in a world without an eternity of identity, self/ego and memories, ergo, in a world without afterlife.
&gt; 
&gt; For without afterlife, to mutually love someone is to expose them to the gnawing fear of inevitable death that will permanently separate you, that may come at any time, regardless of efforts made to live a healthy and safe life (like a truck crashing into your house while you sleep, collapsing it onto you - as happened a few hundred meters from where I live!)
&gt; 
&gt; Each waking moment is filled with dread, each second you spend with someone you love is poisoned with the knowledge it may be the last. When you say good bye as you go to work, it may be the last you see each other. When you say good night as you go to bed - likewise.
&gt; 
&gt; And once they inevitably die, the festering wound that remains will never heal. Nay, it will merely grow necrotic, rotting bits and parts of you, leaving you forever empty, forever lacking, forever at verge of tears when a memory surfaces - never to heal.
&gt; 
&gt; In a world without afterlife, the only moral choice is for each and every person to become a hermit, swear upon anti-natalism and spare future generations of having to suffer in an ephemeral world.
&gt; 
&gt; But in a world with afterlife? There is no such poison, no such necrotic wound. For you know that you will meet again.
&gt; 
&gt; Granted, not all afterlives are made equal. Afterlife where you don't remember anything are as good as non-existent. Sure, your soul lives on - but your mind is torn asunder, your identity scattered.


**Basis of my changeable view:**  
**In Danté's Divine Comedy,** Hell is described as having multiple layers of punishment.  

The First Layer is effectively life on Earth, albeit a bit more dull, a bit more grey - I'd compare it to having chronic depression.   
The Second Layer is much the same, albeit with powerful restless winds buffeting people around.  
The Third Layer is fairly disgusting, with icy rain and disgusting sludge.  
The Fourth Layer is a constant struggle with weights.  
The Fifth Layer is again, no different to being depressed - albeit, in its acute form.  
The Sixth Layer has you trapped within a small room that's on flame  
The Seventh Layer has three circles  
Seventh 1st: Murderers are on fire in a sea of blood  
Seventh 2nd: Those who committed suicide are made physically still as trees, and subject to torture  
Seventh 3rd: Crimes against Nature/God (the layer I'd likely go as LGBT) has people run eternally in circles over burning sand  
The Eight Layer is full of disgusting fluids and physical suffering  
The Final layer is again, full of physical and mental suffering.


However, do note: Nowhere is it mentioned that a person's Individuality is wiped, nowhere is it mentioned that you lose your memories, nowhere is it mentioned that your Identity &amp; Sense of Self is lost.

Indeed, your qualities are incorporated into the world around you, and maintained for eternity.

Compared to the lack of afterlife, even the worst of Hell is infinitely appealling to me.

**From what I know of Hinduism -**

Upon reincarnation, you lose your sense of self and identity, have it twisted and become something completely unlike your previous life. Furthermore, all your memories are lost. You retain individuality, but it's no longer you. Under Hinduism, afterlife in effect does not exist - there is no continuity of sapience.

**From what I know of Buddhism -**

In Buddhism, your ultimate goal is to achieve Nirvanna. To do so, you must completely and utterly eradicate your Identity. You must give upon your memories and your reward is to lose your identity and become part of some hivemind that is the universe.

Should you desire to avoid Nirvanna - that is, pursue Hell as one would in Christianity - you still lose your identity and memories and sense of self as in Hinduism.

**What view I seek changed:**  

- That Hinduism and Buddhism cause the Death of Identity, the Death of Individuality and the Death of Memory and have no continuity of existence. My knowledge of these religions is from western depictions, which to me seem more suited to Horror in terms of Reward than Hell itself.

I am not opposed to the idea of reincarnation, and I have formulations of cosmologies that I would enjoy living within.



**What I consider my ideal afterlife/cosmology:**

&gt; There exists a world where souls inhabit. These souls create worlds through their beliefs and experiences. However, by virtue of these worlds being self-created, they cannot obtain new experiences from them.
&gt; 
&gt; As such, souls will visit one-another's realm of existence/experience. Either based on some past experience (loved ones spending time together), or curiousity.
&gt; 
&gt; Earth is 'dream-world' of one such soul, but one who has imposed limitations on knowledge/gnosis with the soul's full identity locked away, only allowing bits to filter through to drive the meatsuits and guarantee consistency.
&gt; 
&gt; Such are visited for the experience of living in a world with limitations, and to meet souls without filter.
&gt; Technically, the soul behind Earth could ""wake up"" and eject all souls within
&gt; This would be my ideal form of afterlife
&gt; It guarantees eternal identity

**Example of a setting that depicts an afterlife with reincarnation that I actively enjoy:**

&gt; In Forgotten Realms, your identity, individuality, being, memories - they are all subject to which afterlife you go to.
&gt; 
&gt; If you worship Chaotic Good deities, for instance: the Seldarine - the following happens:
&gt; 
&gt; When your soul is new and young, it forms out of nothing and attaches to a newborn body.
&gt; 
&gt; The personality, memories, individuality you build through your first life becomes your soul's personality, memories and individuality.
&gt; 
&gt; When you die and go to arvandor, all of this is preserved - the only change is that your emotions become far more intense, far more tangible.
&gt; 
&gt; Should you get bored of eternity in Arvandor, you petition Sehanine and Corellon to reincarnate you.
&gt; 
&gt; When you are reincarnated, you retain your personality and identity, albeit limited and locked away for your mortal life. To ensure your new life develops similar to old one, you experience frequent dreams where you relive moments from your previous lives - giving you a very, very strong sense of who you are.
&gt; As you grow older, you add to memories in your current life - which you can actually remember in your waking moment too. Upon dying and returning to Arvandor, you regain all your previous lives' memories, and your identity forms an amalgate of your previous ones.


Edit:

**Changed View @ 2 Deltas**:

Christianity has many sects, schisms, churches, teachings - often contradictory, hostile even. There are christian beliefs based upon Judean ones that afterlife is mere oblivion. However, there's also protestant beliefs that are universal heaven, and there's Danté's Inferno. I chose Danté's Inferno as a belief of ""I'll accept even this degree of suffering for sake of Eternity of Self"", knowing as an LGBT ""sodomite"" I'd be condemned horribly.

Therefore, a singular example of a singular branch/teaching/sect of Buddhism and Hinduism satisfies for a changed View.

 /u/DarkMausey demonstrated to me that the Mahayana Teachings of Hinduism provide an **eventual** ability to recollect past lives, past identities while retaining individuality (without becoming merged with the universe in a form of hivemind/water in ocean). This is not immediate, this is not instantenous. However, consistency of belief (that is: taking limit of a single life as ""non-existent"" or ""death"", taking limit of infinity means ""If can happen, will happen.) Since it is a retroactive individual awakening - it satisfies for Hinduism.

Once more,  /u/DarkMausey demonstrated a similar teaching for Buddhism - which actually is the most popular, albeit ""corrupted"" by Westerners trying to secularize it all, not actually believing in the actual spiritual aspect, therefore presenting it wrong. Such is ""Pure Land Buddhism"", where once again, taking the limit of infinity, ""If can happen, will happen."" It likewise satisfies the requirements.

Therefore, new view is:

""Existence under the cosmology of Pure Land Buddhism or Mahayana's teachings of Hinduism is not easy. However, given enough time - you can and WILL be able to reunite with those you love, and thus need not fear death.""

Many people believe that privacy is a positive good akin to recording history. Others view it as stealing profits from copyright owners. Both perspectives are true. However, there are times when a piece of media becomes lost to time either due to the original work being destroyed or a ban prohibiting the spread of such works. When this occurs, a new piece of ""lost media"" is born making legal viewing of such media impossible. In a scenario such as this, it is my view that spreading and viewing copyrighted materials should be legal as long as the work being distributed is truly lost media.

Piracy isn't always a costless job. There are material costs for recording, reproducing, and distributing copyrighted work. Allowing piracy to be legal without any regulation on the cost of pirated works can create an environment of price gouging, where the supply of legally acquirable media has fallen, inflating the costs of illegal media. An easy fix would be to require all pirated works to be free for purchase, but that ignores the material costs. This is why copyrighted works should be sold based on the cost of materials alone. Did the CD used to distribute pirated media cost $0.10? Then a privateer can only sell their bootlegged pirated media for $0.10. Privateers cannot profit from pirated works since they don't hold the copyright. They wouldn't face any criminal prosecution however."

Time and time again, videos and records of police interactions that show a clear retaliation due to someone recording their interaction surface. It's ridiculous that by now in 2022, there are still police officers who don't understand that citizens have a legal right to record public officials on duty.

Even if you are not a fan of being recorded, it doesn't change the fact that citizens are legally allowed to record in public, and that no one, including police officers, has a right to privacy on public land. 

Police officers who show a clear retaliation to the act of recording them in public should be removed from duty until they can demonstrate that they understand civilian rights. This could be through mandatory training, some form of reprimand, etc. If they continue to fail at respecting citizens civil rights, then they should be fired without a chance for reinstatement. 

If a police officer doesn't like being recorded, they shouldn't hold a public position.

One quote I really believe in is ""people make decisions emotionally and defend them logically"" A lot of people have a certain distrust or fear of guns

Despite there being a surge in new gun owners recently, it appears that even that there still appears to be more of a pro gun control attitude among a majority of Americans.

Parsis are a group of Indians whose remote ancestry can be linked back to ancient Persia, prior to the Muslim conquest of Persia. 

By remote, I mean remote. Parsis are the descendents of Persians who sought refuge in India between the 8th and 10th century. 

If you and your ancestors have been living in a country for more than 10 centuries, that qualifies your ethnicity as from that country. 

There are some individuals who think that Parsis can call themselves Indian or Persian, but calling themselves Persian is just wrong, based on what I've described above. 

Their culture is predominantly Mahrashtrian with a mix of their ancient roots in there as well. They speak Gujarati and Hindi, none of them know Persian or Farsi (not including Iranis here). Although the resultant product of their culture is very different than the culture of Zoroastrians in Iran. It's an example of religious syncretism."

Every single government decree should be as clinical and unbiased as possible. Usually the form of ""the government decided X"".

Beholden: obligation.

All ideas, customs, and social behaviour are social constructs, invented and performed by people. Inspiration can come from the shape of tree bark, the sound of water, observing animals in the wild. Everywhere. People share ideas constantly. Ideas spread. 

If a group of people invent or figure out or decide on a way of doing something and it becomes part of their ""culture"", and someone else sees that thing there is no problem at all with them being able to do that same thing if they want to. 

An idea doesn't need to be original for someone to be able to express it. 

In the same way, just because something is seen as ""the way things are done"" in a culture it doesn't mean that everyone in that culture will automatically do that thing. There is no real cultural monolith, even in a very homogeneous group you will find great diversity of thought and practice. 

While there are American cultural stereotypes there is no ""Pure American Culture"" which any one person can claim they possess. Take someone from Texas and someone from Oregon who both say they are true, pure, red blooded Americans, and examine their lives and while they may pledge to the same flag you will find immense differences in their lifestyles, food habits, music preferences, and so on. 

The idea of American Culture means something different to everyone. The same is true of any culture, there will be agreements and consensus but no broad consensus over everything about what that culture really means. 

On a personal level I am born from mixed backgrounds onto British soil. I have Hindu spiritual practices, but also Druidic. I have Christian references and Islamic available to me in my thought process. All things can be absorbed into me and become part of my way of life. I watch Anime and Bollywood, and Hollywood, and Korean movies, and all kinds of other media from other cultures. I listen to classical music and Germanic throat singing. I drink tea and burn incense. I eat all kinds of cuisines from all kinds of origins. My daily life is filled with all kinds of cultural influences at every point, during my daily commute, while working, while enjoying rest and relaxation. 

I think that on a large scale and a small scale this is true for everyone. Not the specifics, but the participation in many cultural practices. Based on the above am I British? American? German? Hindu? These are all labels that may apply in part, but not to the whole. 

On a small tribal level, even an ""uncontacted"" tribe will evolve and adapt their culture based on those around them. If they are very isolated maybe their culture is unchanged for generations but even then there will be divergences on the individual level, so what an anthropologist sees as cultural hemoginy is actually diversity but under broad umbrella labels. 

There are no closed practices unless they are kept secret, which would be very difficult these days. Just because someone had an idea doesn't mean they have a monopoly on that idea. People are free to adapt and remix the world around them, and there are no issues in doing so. 

If someone is being mocking or disrespectful that is its own thing, it's entirely possible for someone to make a mockery via mimicry - but the issue there is in the mockery, not the mimicry. Disrespect doesn't automatically disqualify a cultural practice, it's the disrespect that's the issue. 

Just because one thing has meaning to one person or group doesn't mean that will transfer outside of the signs used to express them. If I like the look of an archbishops hat and want to wear one then it is enough that I like the look of it and want to wear it. I don't need some deep metaphysical explanation for it, but if I say it makes me feel tall then that is also enough justification. No one is being hurt by this. The same is true of any cultural, religious, artistic etc expressive quality. Hair, prayer, language, all are free for anyone to use if they want to. 

Their use will not ""dilute"" the original practice in any way, which is left untouched for those practitioners to perform. It's like music, liking a band before they became mainstream doesn't really win you points, and people who get possessive about it are being silly. Someone else enjoying something you did before shouldn't affect your continued enjoyment, unless you oh liked it because it was different to everyone else, and if that's the criteria just find something else niche and move onto that! 

People are free to do as they please, to derive pleasure, spiritual connection, and behaviours from any source. 

People seeking to control the way other people express themselves culturally, or individually are in the wrong. This includes cultures that dominate their populace, if someone wants to go against the flow there's nothing wrong with that - like a punk rocker in a puritan Christian community. They would be in the wrong for repressing the punks expression. This also includes cultures that look at people outside of them and try and impose on their lives. Realistically I am not beholden to the culture I live around, or any culture that would look to tell me how to live my life from across the world. They have no say in my beliefs and behaviours. 

The example I've given to support this idea is that LGBT culture is at odds with Islamic culture. If one could simply say the other was offensive to it then that would mean changing one or the other to suit the other. Obviously this is unrealistic, and extreme, but apply this to any kind of cultural outrage and you will see the same logic applies. Who is anyone to tell anyone else how to live their life according to their ways? That is cultural imperialism. 


The reason I want to try and change my view is because of some recent discussions on this sub reddit, which have brought me back to the same arguing points, which I have outlined above. Some have argued that cultures do have a claim somehow over certain practice/s, where I feel no such claim could be realistic. In my comment history you will find these discussions, and more insight into why I'd want to see things from the other side, as either I'm missing something, or the people I'm arguing against have deeply flawed logic."

I welcome any and all criticism. I also go off on tangents during this writing.

I'm about to be torn to shreds.

As a 30yo black American born in the US. I believe anyone should be able to think anything they want but say it in a private situation. I would like to note I personally have no dislike against anyone due to their race, religion, culture, or ideas.

Prime example but not limited to: I believe people are allowed to hate me for being black (the color of my skin). I believe the problem comes in when you act on that hate. If someone was to say I don't like black people; I would strongly disagree with them and I would think them incredibly ignorant, and would recommend they don't say that in certain areas, or even out loud, but I believe they have the right to think that.

 I think if they act on those thoughts they should be shunned by society. If they treat someone differently based on their skin color or beliefs. There are people I don't like (prefer strong distaste) (for personal reasons, generally attitude or character) but I am perfectly nice and polite and even helpful towards. Would saying I don't like you because you are black be considered ""acting on that hate""? Perhaps. Many people probably lack the ability to separate their own thoughts from conforming to society.

 I disagree a level of violence should be done against them for their thoughts. In turn if they act on a level of violence, punishment should be handed down. As in if they threaten violence or show the intent of violence they should be dealt with. But even then they would be dealt with on their threats of violence not on their beliefs. 

Of course you can't have blanket statement like that and have a functioning society. For example you can't have a store owner refusing service because someone is black.
But they should freely be able to think that I believe. CMV

Edit: So I've been replying for a few hours and handed out some deltas. I will take a break, I will try to respond more later. Have a great day

Edit: I just think there is more nuance to racism than society likes to act like.

Edit: I'm not advocating for racism. I'm saying there are levels to racism. And silencing peoples voices does not solve the issue of racism, I believe it allows it to grow in a corner. A random guy along the street saying racist things should be ignored. You should not have to deal with racism on your private property, at work, on in certain social situations. Educating racist is the best way to solve racism. I'm not saying John says a racist sentence and you pat him on the back. I am saying if John says a racist sentence figuring out why John says those things and educating him would be better. Of course there is debate is if it's up to you or not. I believe it depends on the situation.

Edit: I'm not saying be friends with racist. But every little racist situation that a person runs into is not the same. I think too much power is given to racism. Many people here have mentioned harassment. I think it's harassment through the racism. People have used religion to perpetuate crime. But you place racism you are failing to get to the root cause. In my experience common day racism is ignorance.

Edit: it's better to have discourse with racism than silence it.
The crux of it

Edit: my mind has been changed. I believe racism should not happen in public. But I believe they should be able to express it in a spot where there can be open discourse."

The guy made some legitimate points about how someone can take someone's artwork, feed it into an AI, and possibly end up out competing that artist in their own style of artwork simply through the sheer processing and output pace that AI is capable of.  I'll grant that AI can be abused, but he went on saying that an AI generated book by definition cannot be good simply because there was no human motivation behind it.

My view is that AI creative works such as art, books, movies, or even AI driven robotic interpretive dancers are perfectly acceptable and even desirable works.  By desirable, I mean that people will not only consume these works, but also want more even knowing that they were developed by AI and maybe even more so in certain ways.  At least for the foreseeable future, I think there will always be something special about human creative works in the same way that if someone makes an object by hand rather than it being made by machine, there is something special about that.  It is just that as with handmade bikes or wooden swings, the non-human versions of those will be faster to produce and consume much of the market.  That isn't something that I believe the world is dreading.

I'm guessing about everyone has seen the AI artwork created by DALL-E.  I feel like it marks an early phase of AI becoming popular in generating creative works.  Right now it is kind of funny to look at, but given some time to improve, I feel really excited about the potential to generate high quality artwork of literally anything you want at the click of a button.  If the same could be done competently for the generation of a short story or even a full novel, I'd be excited for that as well!

To summarize, I really don't think AI creative works are something we need to resist.  We do need to be wary of abuse that can come from it, but if it becomes as prevalent and high quality as mass produced cars, I think we'll be generally happier for it."

But... I feel it's unethical. Humans have demonstrated a clear disregard for Earth. Pollution, little respect for the environment. And while some are working to try to address this, the larger powers that be will always put profits before anything else. I see no hope that humans will not, over the long term, also pollute and ultimately ruin the Moon.

For example, waste that is produced from any habitat on the Moon. How will it be addressed? Lunar landfills? Blast it out into space? And what if our industrialization starts to have impacts on the Moon? What if previously unknown minerals are found on the Moon? Will full-scale mining start?

So CMV on this. I just feel awful thinking that humans seem poised to ruin another celestial body."

My issue with that is that she's stooping down to their level by weaponizing her sexuality, and it's being glorified. I get that they feel empowered doing so, but it's still bottom line, sexualizing women, even if women have co-opted it. It is still contributing to the sexualization of women being portrayed as a positive thing. How are we ever going to take the focus off of women being sexualized by sexualizing them? Society often paints women as only good for sex/being something pretty to look at. We are often likened to works of art, as if we are on display for the world to appreciate, and if we don't like that then we're prudes. On top of that, I feel by making an otherwise competent woman a hypersexualized femme fetal, it's saying that women need to be conventionally attractive in order to trick men so that they can get ahead in certain situations.

Why is there a need to put extra emphasis on sexuality and making her look attractive so the men in the stories don't lose interest or so that she can get her way by deceiving them with her ""feminine wiles""? Why can't she just be a person being competent at something without it revolving around her sex appeal? I'm not saying that that trope didn't have a time or a place but I personally feel like we should probably move away from it, or at least stop glorifying it. Women shouldn't have to rely on the fact that men always underestimate them in order to succeed. What happens if she isn't underestimated then? To me, that's implying that she would lose if she hadn't otherwise tricked/seduced them with her looks, and that just seems so degrading to me...

I'm sorry this is so long, but my main point is that I don't think women should ever have to do that in order to succeed, and I wish it wasn't glorified in the media as much as it is. I'm not saying that women haven't had to do things like that in order to get places at some point in their lives, and I don't think that the fact that they did it was a bad thing. They did what they could/had to at the time, but it's unfortunate that it had to happen to them and it shouldn't have to continue happening in order for women to succeed in life. I don't personally find showing off/using my body in that way to be empowering. I know some women do, but just because they find it empowering doesn't mean that I have to for myself or that I'm slut shaming them if I don't want to show off my body. It's a different viewpoint, but I hate being told I'm hurting feminism with my views when I honestly don't understand how. What am I missing?

────────

For added info: I have personally had to do similar things to an older abuser when I was younger in order to get out of the ""relationship"" and it only made me feel dirty and shameful. I'm not saying that's how everybody will feel, but that was my experience at least. I practically had to act dumb and seductive in order to trick him at times so that he wouldn't try to keep a stronger hold on me. I hated the fact that I had to stoop to those levels just to get out of a bad situation, and I would personally never wish that for anybody. Maybe at the moments things were happening it might have felt somewhat ""empowering"" to be able to ""trick"" him, but as more time passed, I didn't feel empowered at all. I felt gross, and I wished it didn't have to happen at all.

But I would love to hear others point of view on these topics to at least help me better understand if my thoughts on the matter are skewed. Please CMV."

846,2022-09-05,CMV: The LGBT community should not be treated like a monolith.,u/layZwrks,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x6xfdk/cmv_the_lgbt_community_should_not_be_treated_like/,changemyview,"What do I mean by this? That's a reasonable question to ask since on it's face it sounds like they shouldn't be treated the same as everyone else, which is not *necessarily* the point but it sort of is, so I need to articulate a few points before I address it wholly.

No community/ies of minorities have leaders who they answer to, no one speaks for them nor represents them, and none of them are the same within their respective circles. For example, African-Americans are distinctly different from Africans not only because of environmental lifestyle(s) but also through culture, a tribe from the Midwest doesn't share much in common with North/Coastal tribes, and although Catholics share a religion, they are not that similar to the Christian branches.  
The point I am trying to convey through these somewhat loose equivalences is that all-in-all, not one person should be treated as a collective, individuality and agency is stripped if no one can be held to their own account if they are held responsible along with the rest of ""their"" group.  
See it as if somebody is *assumed* to be in a clique because of how they look/dress/talk and they are caught in an accident, the clique they are assumed to be in would also take the blame for the consequences even though they did nothing *sincerely* because they are thought to do the same thing as the person who had the accident.

Another thing about being responsible for one's own self is that like I mentioned before, the community does not and should never answer to one single person. Sounds anarchical but what I mean is that you have the free will to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness guaranteed through both the Constitution and natural (protected) rights, not through the whims and demands of a self-proclaimed authority/speaker *because* they happen to align certain physical attributes/mannerisms/ideologies as you.  
I will elaborate on the former part in a bit since more than a few will find skeptical issue and vent frustration in the section, however, the **main idea** stands that **no one** should be treated as a **representative of a group involuntarily** and neither should be **forcibly lumped into one or many** through the **notion of their unique identity**(ies), they should be free to live their lives as any other human being who does not want no-one to impose arbitrary rules upon them because they *wouldn't want* the same for **anybody** else.

Let me finish on cliff notes, because I happen to expect there to be at least some who object the premise of the Constitution specifically because they may misunderstand certain amendments and the extent of them over time or will bring up isolated court rulings that go beyond what the post focuses in on. Civil Rights have expanded well past the Victorian era and have only increased in protections to the point where the term ""hate crime/speech"" has to be explored and defined thanks to how rare they are to be reported and inspected, this is not the 70s anymore nor are we in the past because we are in the now.

So what is the argument against supposed to be then since no one would want (least hope not anyway) anyone to be forced into a grouping they did not choose to begin with?  
Well, there is the loose equivalences I made as examples, the hypothetical about groupthink I used for assuming someone's position, and also the fact that I didn't make the distinction of Lesbians/Gays/Bisexuals/Transgenders (mostly because doing so is redundant).I would be more than happy to see if anyone disagrees with these takes so we can discuss them in a civil manner because I would like to learn about differing perspectives on the matters of **tribalism** and *polarization.*

So, you see, I've always thought that citations are simply for crediting the author from whom we take the data, and the purpose of inserting a citation in your paper would be basically to allow people to take that citation and search for the paper to check your info is legit.

That's basically the purpose of it, so I wouldn't want to spend a lot of my mental energy on checking every little coma in the citation, and more importantly, I wouldn't want to scroll down torturing my eyes to find the paper I want because APA uses an alphabetical order for bibliography. I'm talking about when I'm writing a paper. I know most sites would have them as clickable links for easier navigation.

Therefore, for optimal use of time and energy, the order in-text should be the same as in bibliography, which is fulfilled by numerical styles like IEEE and Vancouver. And the visual clue of numbers makes the citation much easier to find than if they were just the same order. I honestly fail to see any privilege APA could have over these.

So, if you have any legit reason of why we should keep using APA and the like other than journals wanting that style for their manuscripts, please tell me.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: thank you all, my view has changed. I acknowledge APA citation can actually save time, especially for people more experience in the field.

To be clear by ""reprint"" I don't mean remake them or put them on other systems, I mean them straight up producing more carts for the original system with the original box, etc. There is clearly a massive demand for older Nintendo games to the point where games like Pokemon Emerald or Pokemon Soulsilver are selling for over $100 just for the cart. God forbid if you want to buy the special editions.

This is a market bursting to be exploited, prices for many games has exploded since the Pandemic, as new adults try and rebuy their childhood. Nintendo has already done the hard work of developing the games so I don't see why they shouldn't reprint them, it wouldn't cost much. They could have a ""retro section"" on their website where you could order a variety of their old games for the original retail price. Considering the prices some people are willing to pay random people on ebay just for a loose cart of their favorite childhood games, I think Nintendo could make bank off this, it would be very little work for loads of profit. CMV as to why this would be a bad move for Nintendo.

EDIT: I've changed my view as it's been pointed out that it would be really expensive to get new molds and stuff for the games"

For example, if you're a purple woman, and your partner only watches teal women porn. Or let's say you two are open, and they only introduce teal women into the fold. It suggests, that no matter how hard you try, you can never satisfy their desires for traits you physically don't have and will never have. (My personal belief is that that is okay tbh). 

I bring this up because I am bi and I notice many bi people get immediately offended if other people have these concerns.  

inb4: Well, if you're a woman dating a man and he cheats on you with other women, it's the same. Sort of, but really. If he cheats on me with other men nearly exclusively, it's clear it's because intimacy with men offers/satisfies something for him that I as a woman will never and can never provide. 

I don't want to project, but I even noticed with myself, that when I'm dating a man, my sexual cravings outside of him are almost expressly toward women. And that when I'm dating a woman, my sexual cravings outside of her are almost expressly toward men. I've chatted with many other bi people and they relate to the above. 

**TLDR**: It's similar to a straight person being in a relationship and being tempted by other people of the opposite sex, but it's not 1:1. There's a level of ""huh, I'll never be able to compete with that desire tbh"" that the SO may feel when it comes to the experiences I mention in the title and first paragraph."

I agree that something should be done about it. I am not convinced by what I see as climate change hysteria which goes beyond the science.

So let's be clear about what activists are claiming. They are preaching that we are all doomed, that the world is basically going to end in the next generation or two. I have been beaten with slogens such as ""climate apocalypse"". I hear screaming teenagers talking how we ""destroyed"" the planet (not severly damaged. Destroyed. Total destruction). I could go on but you get the point.

As far as I can tell, there will be serious problems in a minority of places in the world. There wil also be some positive effects but over all there will be a lot of negative effects. But humanity will go on living, dealing with this issue the same way we have dealt with absolute catastrophies in the past.

Our history on this planat has been a severe one from the beginning. Climate change is nothing new. The vast majority of people will continue to live noraml lives.

I am genuniely open to change my mind here but there just seems to be a hge gap between what the science says and what activists are saying. We are simply not doomed. We just have an issue with the climate which we can adapt to.

Picking a tiny tiny monority of people who will suffer severly from this does not warrent prophsying the death or almost total destruction of the whole planet/human race.

Again, not saying it is not a problem. Not saying it is not a significant problem. But the vast majority of people will be ok - which apparently is not the message that climate change activists agree with."

There are several reasons they are comparatively under performing (although still a massive success) that are unrelated to the execution of the movie/tv show. In no particular order:

1. People are primarily remembering how exciting the culmination of phase 3 was and comparing the lack of interconnectedness in phase 4 to it. Phase 1 did not at all feel interconnected and that really didn't start fully coming into focus until Civil War.
2. Marvel blew their load with all the super big name heroes in the infinity saga and of course people are going to be less excited about lesser known characters and/or properties where their beloved characters are passing the mantle to the next generation.
3. The multiverse saga is jumping in pretty much immediately with far more convoluted and ""nerdy"" ideas like the multiverse coming into play in the 2nd property of the entire cycle. The infinity stones didn't actually have any kind of purpose beyond a vague ""we don't want Thanos to get those"" until goddamn Infinity War.  This saga requires a lot more commitment from the viewer. This is an inherent problem with the MCU and comics in general. Nearly EVERYONE reaches a point where it gets too convoluted to stick with it indefinitely.
4. Anti-social-progress buffoons ~~can't~~ need to lash out at anything that is made that doesn't gingerly cradle their fragile egos and shows the perspective of characters that they don't identify with

There really isn't any ambiguity there.

Textualism seems like the correct approach to constitutional interpretation. If every person voting for the constitution intended a rule to be X, but it was written as Y, then the rule is Y.

Will it produce bad results? Yes, but that doesn't change a rule. Is it a violation of checks and balances? Yep, but checks and balances isn't a rule. Is it inconsistent with previous rulings? Yes, but I don't care....bad previous rulings doesn't justify ruling incorrectly.

One note, most people making a constitutional argument do so because they like the constitution and think it supports their positions. I do not like the constitution."

Some of those countries might have been socialist for a time (Soviet Union, China, etc).  But they always become authoritarian because of the power concentration required to implement a socialist revolution.  
I am suggesting a slow change, done methodically over the course of a century or two.  Slowly work on the problems plaguing our country (homelessness, addiction, mental health, climate change) while implementing small regulatory policies on big business/oligopolies.  Wealth would be slowly distributed amongst the population; Eventually leading to worker-owned means of production."

412,2022-09-07,"CMV: ""Pay In 4"" Services are predatory and people who use them only dig themselves a deeper hole",u/ExigoxD,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x804ux/cmv_pay_in_4_services_are_predatory_and_people/,changemyview,"TL;DR: They are like Credit cards but worst. So just use a credit card. 

Background:

I am referring to services like Affirm, Klarna, Etc... AKA Buy Now Pay Later

They allow you to split ""large"" purchases (I think anything above $100) into 4 fixed payments with zero interest. Payments are made every 2 weeks, so essentially 8 weeks total to fully pay something off. This can be used on a variety of things. Even clothing purchases in some stores as well. 

There is also this credit card from Wells Fargo which allows you to split your rent into 2 payments every month (so essentially pay it every 2 weeks) so it is in a similar boat as Pay In 4 services and ill get back to this in a sec.

The issue:

It gives people the wrong impression and makes them have a false sense of comfort when they think they are only paying a 4th of the price every 2 weeks. in reality, this is no different than buying it on a credit card.

Lets not even talk about the cashback, you would be forfeiting by not buying it on your credit card. Lets say your statement closing date on your credit card is the 1st of each month. meaning anything you buy between, say, September 1st to September 31st goes on your September statement. this statement is generally due a week before your next statement. Giving you 3 weeks after statement closing date to pay your statement. 

If you make a purchase on September 1st, you have all of September (4 weeks) plus the 3 week grace period that's 7 weeks to pay it off. 1 week less than PI4 (Pay In 4). (Sometimes but not always, in PI4 you have to also pay a downpayment on the first day)

There is also a group of people who think it is a good option because they get paid every 2 weeks and it helps them pay for things every 2 weeks. This is exactly why these services are outright predatory. 

This kind of thinking is flawed and more often than not comes from people who use debit cards to make purchases and think everything has to come out of their account right away. Affirm is no different than a 0% cashback credit card with zero after-purchase protection as I just explained.

You can pay your credit card every 2 weeks. Nothing is stopping you from setting automatic payments every 2 weeks. 

So instead of using affirm, just use a credit card. Not to mention having the headache of having 50 different transactions every 2 weeks getting deducted from your account instead of one central place to see exactly how much the total amount is and paying it once (or twice) before the due date.

Buy Now Pay Later services only further promote the living paycheck to paycheck idea. You set up your life around every 2 weeks getting something deducted from your account down to the last penny. 

The idea is to break out of having to plan our life around when we get our paycheck. The entire point of saving and making good financial decisions is to not worry ""if I have enough money left over after my next paycheck to pay this installment of affirm"".

This is why the Wells Fargo credit card is also an issue, if paying rent every other week is really what you want, I don't think any landlord is gana have a problem getting half their money 2 weeks sooner. 

If you don't agree with anything I said, that's fine. But agree with this, If you don't have the money to buy something today, you probably shouldn't buy it anyways. It's not like you can pay for necessities with affirm like bills or groceries. Just save for it for 8 weeks and then buy it.

Now tell me I'm wrong :)

It's treated as though it's a prerequisite to all other knowledge. Now, I can concede, for example, that knowing that two countries share a border can be useful in a deeper understanding or the politics of a region, but you can know that without being able to point the countries out on a map. 

  
I'm not saying that people aren't ignorant, just that an ability to point out countries on a map is esoteric knowledge that is so generally useless that I don't blame anyone for not being able to do it. If schools spent a lot more time ensuring that people could do it, I would consider that a waste. It's not always useful information to know what countries border what other countries, or what shape countries have or whether they're landlocked, but when that information is useful, it still doesn't need to take the form of identifying a map. We can talk about israel's relationship to palestine and learn a lot in that discussion, but if you bust out a globe and point to them and say ""See?"" in no way would that deepen the person's understanding of anything at all. If I meet someone from Lithuania, I'm not going to better understand that person by knowing the shape or latitude or longitude of lithuania."

Actual grooming is evil and these recent attacks on sex education as somehow grooming children by acknowledging the existence of sex or basic biology is nonsense. But for this discussion, I'm going as far as to say that these attacks are apart of a long-accepted grooming tradition. Parents bring kids weekly to an institution that's goals are to brain wash reality out of their heads, including the reality of sex. They spend their entire childhoods hiding all evidence of that reality, except maybe to tell them what kinds (such as homosexual) are evil and would make them bad people.

Now we have to hear from people that were so damaged and groomed as kids, that they are now suicidal closeted gays, priests that only release their sexual energy on their sunday class, or just boys that were told to never masturbate and are now obsessed with ending porn and revealing clothes because these guys blame those things for their own desires still existing after all that prayer; about how telling children about sex or sexuality is ""grooming"" them into specific kinds of adults for their own desires. But I'd love to hear a reasoned argument that these cult-followers insisting that the most natural subject be banned from school or ANYWHERE you might find children isn't the actual grooming."

I get really bothered when people start off a public speech by saying something like ""First we must acknowledge we are on stolen land. The (X Native American tribe) people lived in this area, etc but anyway, here's a wedding that you all came for...""

Isn’t all land essentially stolen? How does that have anything to do with us now? 
If you don’t think we should be here, why are you having your wedding here? If you do want to be here, just be an evil transplant like everybody else. No need to act like acknowledging it makes it better. 

We could also start speeches by talking about disastrous modern foreign policies or even climate change and it would be equally true and also irrelevant.

I think giving some history can be interesting but it always sounds like a guilt trip when a lot of us European people didn't arrive until a couple generations ago and had nothing to do with killing Native Americans.

&amp;#x200B;

First let me define a creation as something that is created by some source.

Another important features of creations is that they begin to exist. In other words they don't exist until they are created.

  
So for everything that exists we can either classify it as created or uncreated.

&amp;#x200B;

Now the argument is as follows:

1. There are creations (such as this post).
2. Each creation that exists must ultimately come from some source.
3. Thus, there must be a source of creation.
4. It is impossible for anything to create itself. If you claim that a thing can create itself then you are suggesting that it exists before it exists which is impossible.
5. The ultimate source of each creation was not created by another source otherwise it wouldn't be the ultimate source. This solves the problem of an infinite regression of creators.
6. Thus, the ultimate source of all that exists must be uncreated since it couldn't have created itself nor could it be created by another source."

I believe that the republican party will attempt to overturn the results of the 2024 presidential election if a democrat wins office. I believe this for the following reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1 - The most prominent figure in the republican party, Donald Trump, believes the his loss in 2020 was illegitimate, and has convinced most of the republican base that this is true despite lack of evidence.

2 - Other republicans within the republican party have adjusted their official stances in support of the Big Lie in order to be in-step with the voting base.

3 - The voting base is electing Republicans that agree with Trump that the 2020 election was stolen and should not have been certified.

4- Republican controlled legislatures in swing states are creating and passing legislation that allows them to varying extents more control over the state governments process during federal elections, up to allowing them to throw out votes. 

5- Given this increased control and realignment of beliefs, it can therefore be assumed a republican controlled legislature, given the power to do so, will overturn a democrat win at the presidential level, switching their swing states electoral votes to the losing candidate.

Whether this ultimately succeeds or not is anyone's guess. But I think it's very likely, almost a guarantee this will happen, and it is keeping me up at night. So far, I've yet to hear a compelling counter argument that this won't happen."
0,2022-09-07,"CMV: Vegans should eat wild, carnivorous animals in order to logically remain internally consistent with their philosophy",u/The_Chillosopher,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x8hfb2/cmv_vegans_should_eat_wild_carnivorous_animals_in/,changemyview,"To start off with, I am vegan and I realize this is an extreme view that I am not tied to in any particular way. But it hit me the other day and I wish to have a discussion about it. It's not a talking point I've seen often if at all in the veganism debate.

The main goal of veganism is to minimize and eventually extinguish animal suffering. Animals have a right to life, and we as humans should not take that away from them just for the sake of our own taste buds.

However, looking at it from a utilitarian perspective, is it not morally just to kill and consume an animal that was going to consume two, three, ten other animals in its lifetime? And not kill them painlessly either, but violently and with so much carnage. Carnivorous animals often viciously dismember and rip apart their prey in a way much worse than humans do. If we can kill a lion and eat it to save the lives of tens of gazelles, don't we have an obligation to do so? Why should we just stand idly by, knowing that so many animal lives will be taken away in the wild, and so much needless blood will be shed from animal-on-animal consumption?

I use the utilitarian viewpoint because it is often used as an argument silencer for the plants' rights vs animal rights debate. Whereby we should eat plants directly instead of the animals that eat plants, in order to bypass the middleman and feed more people from the same amount of plants. That is a utilitarian argument, should it not be applied to the carnivorous animal consumption argument as well?

Healthwise, I've heard this countered with the fact that carnivorous animals tend to be unsafe for humans to eat. But I've seen crocodile and snake meat served in restaurants no problem. Why shouldn't we eat croc or snake meat when doing so saves the lives of so many rabbits and fish?

To sum up, it is inconsistent for vegans to want to save as many animal lives as possible and prevent them from needless harm, while simultaneously not halting one of the biggest harmers and killers of animals - other animals. And we should halt them by killing them, instead of herbivorous animals like cows/sheep society does now, and eat them in order to not let the food go to waste. **This applies only to animals in the wild.** We should NOT factory farm them, because it would be inefficient and require the needless death of their feed.

So, change my view!"

Even if there’s no signs it was anything other than the end of an adult relationship like any other people love to focus on the age gap. I’ve even seen where people are looked at as creeps, not because they did anything wrong, but because they had the audacity to date someone significantly younger than them. 

And what makes even less sense is that the same arguments that can be used for the hot subjects of abortion, transgenderism, homosexuality and legalization of sex work could also be applied to these. 

Now people can have their opinions but I think if you’re not accepting of age gap relationships in the same way as those other subjects, then you’re not as progressive as you think because it’s I’m pretty much the same realm"

A carbon tax will also be more effective and efficient than other large-scale projects presented by different governments. While governments can and must play a role in regulating the environment, naturally balancing out the market will allow for more freedom and money raised from carbon taxes can go to offsetting carbon emissions, without requiring higher taxes from other markets/areas.

Edit: Getting China, Russia, and India on board might be difficult, but carbon-based trade tariffs and sanctions could act as incentives.  "

Some people would bitch about having a nation of interns to manage, or frame it as slave labor, or a violation of rights, but plenty of countries do it and it would break so many bad cycles that become generational. (Ex: City kids never being exposed to nature, country kids never understanding the plight of cities, giving kids an opportunity to learn about a trade or industry they may never learn otherwise, breaking cycles of gang violence and poverty, alleviating general feelings of isolation and lack of purpose, etc)

Not to mention it would create a fuck ton of jobs. 

Would it always run perfectly and without incident? No. But would it help improve alot of complex societal problems over time? Provide kids with self-esteem and purpose? Give them skills that transfer to jobs and a better life? Would it humanize Americans of vastly different background and beliefs to one another? Absolutely."

So, by that logic, and because we’re all kin, raising ANY child increases YOUR fitness. I understand, ofc, the effect is diluted, but bear in mind the best you can do is pass HALF of your genes anyway. So you’re already working with water-colors. 

And that’s it. Even “family” is pretty genetically diverse. This is demonstrated through tissue typing. Parents are often poor matches for a child. Siblings are usually great matches, but not always. Often, its a STRANGER that is the donor. It gets pretty messy pretty quickly trying to draw family lineage lines and I think the whole thing is made up quackery that ends up supporting horrible things like dynasty, racism, nationalism, etc.

1462,2022-09-08,CMV: There's nothing controversial about Dr. Oz's remarks on incest and it's important for the left to not attack him on this,u/Yamochao,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x93f10/cmv_theres_nothing_controversial_about_dr_ozs/,changemyview,"First of all, let me say, I'm a leftist who has donated to Dr. Oz's campaign opponent.  I believe he's an evil, out-of-touch, plutocrat who's spent most of his career profiteering off of medical fraud. I would never defend him generally, I'm arguing that it's important to choose our battles and that this is the wrong battle to choose.

&amp;#x200B;

He's getting a lot of flack for [his words](https://www.salon.com/2022/09/07/dr-ozs-2014-interview-resurfaces-incest-not-a-big-problem-if-more-than-a-first-cousin-away_partner/) on an old talk show, and I think it's important to actually consider this objectively.

&amp;#x200B;

* The context here is that Dr. Oz is on a *comedy talk show*, being asked for his *medical opinion* on *controversial medical questions*. This is long before he was running for office.
* The listener asks how big of a problem it is that he's can't stop having sex with his second cousin.
* Dr. Oz explains that

1. A second cousin is sufficiently distant. It's not medically a concern in terms of the recessive trait expression, the issue that would normally arise with inbreeding.
2. The natural mechanism that would normally limit a person's attraction to relatives, [olfactory aversion to inbreeding](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10705351_Possible_olfaction-based_mechanisms_in_human_kin_recognition_and_inbreeding_avoidance), would probably not be expected in a second cousin. (In other words, Oz assures the listener that his feelings are normal, not unusual)

* Oz exemplifies this with personal anecdote, saying that his wife loves his smell but his daughters hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

On both medical points, Oz is not wrong.

* Second cousins share less than 1/32 of your genes
   * only 1 of 8 great grand parents and a ton of genetic shuffling
   * The legal definition of incest does not include second cousins, and my understanding is that having children with second cousins isn't associated with genetic defects or expression of genetic diseases.
   * Within insulated communities (say a small town of 5000 people), and considering average fertility rate, my math says you'd have a &gt;50% chance of choosing someone who's your second cousin if picking an age-eligible, heterosexually paired mate at random. It's probably more common than we think.
* Olfactory aversion to inbreeding has scientific backing
   * I'm not sure if there have been response studies attempting to debunk this, but there definitely is at least one peer reviewed study supporting the hypothesis, it's not fringe science or something he's pulling out of his ass afaict.
   * Him using his family as an example isn't bad, he's not saying  ""The only reason my daughters won't have sex with me is they think I stink,"" he's just saying, ""smell aversion is a real thing that I've observed personally.""

**But what I see in headlines, twitter, reddit, on basically every page of google is ""Dr. Oz says incest is OK, and the only reason he wouldn't have sex with his daughters is because they don't like how he smells""**

&amp;#x200B;

So who cares, right? Dr. Oz is a clearly evil guy, most of what he says is BS, why not twist his words to be inflammatory. Well, I think it matters how we attack people:

* If a voter on the fence sees this media buzz, then reads what he actually said to see for themselves, they'll say, ""huh, what he said isn't really as bad as they're making it sound.  Maybe all the criticism against him is misplaced""
* Conservative media uses this shit as fodder to claim that liberal social media is just overreacting to everything.
* Basically, it makes great clickbait for lefties who already hate him, but has the opposite affect for everyone else
* It waters down the THOUSANDS of legitimate attacks we *should* be making about this guy. He's literally got *years* of recorded video of him lying to Americans about their health to make a profit."

Rather, if a Country decides to nationalize healthcare and operate using a single-payer universal system, healthier citizens should be taxed less than unhealthier individuals. This isn't to say that a yearly physical should determine one's tax bracket, but that government funding for healthcare should come from taxes placed on markets directly related to personal health. This is already partially done in society, although I don't necessarily think it would be bad to expand on it to cover the full cost that certain habits, diets, lifestyles, etc, place on the general population.

Some examples of this:

Cigarettes -  Having a higher sales taxing on products like cigarettes which are directly linked to an increased chance of cancer and heart disease.

Sugar - Taxing unhealthier foods at higher rates than healthier alternatives, perhaps even subsidizing healthier options to make them cheaper than unhealthier foods that contain more sugars or other additives.

Vaccines - Subsidize/Give tax cuts to individuals who are vaccinated.

Workout - Subsidize working out somehow, giving tax cuts to individuals who actively work out.

While I do believe this should definitely apply in a universal healthcare system, I think it is also applicable to societies like the US, as hospital space and health care resources are still limited, and in general an unhealthier citizen cost more to society than a healthy one.

Also, I realize that people are different and that different bodies react to diets and habits in different ways. There are people who could eat a super healthy diet and workout 2 hours a day and still have more health complications than someone who sits on the couch and smokes a pack of cigs all day.  This is why I am framing it much more around people's habits and what they actually put in their bodies, versus how their life actually pans out/what medical complications one may experience.

EDIT: Need to clarify that this centered around an individual's lifestyle more than actual health. If someone lives a statistically ""unhealthier"" lifestyle based on food consumption or other habits, those habits should be taxed. At its most basic form, such a tax would just be a higher sales tax on unhealthy products. There would be no need to track medical records or for the government to need to talk with someone's doctor. Other systems could be enacted that may require more oversight, like subsidizing/tax breaks for working out, where community run groups play a sport/workout and sign off on someone's attendance and participation.   However for the most part this is really just placing higher sales tax on unhealthy products. "
2,2022-09-08,CMV: We live in a decadent society.,u/jfanch42,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x95h0y/cmv_we_live_in_a_decadent_society/,changemyview,"  

More and more these days I feel a certain degree of disappointment with the modern world. It is not any one thing but the culmination of a lot of little things, the endless news cycle, the online outrage amounting to nothing, a deep cynicism that is just sort of taken as normal, technological, and social stagnation. It all feels to me like something has changed. 

I should say upfront that this idea does not originate from me, I am largely basing it on *The Decadent Society* by Ross Douthat. I largely agree with Douthat in the broad strokes but we have very different views on how to resolve the problem(I am a lot less religious for one). While the underlying logic is the same, I had already reached many of the same conclusions on my own, so will be focusing on my own perspective. 

The first point I think is that we are in a period of technological and cultural stagnation. Now some people might say that technology is evolving faster than ever, but that is really only true of digital technology and increasingly not even there. We have not seen good numbers in terms of efficiency growth and what's more, we have not seen the sorts of changes in electro-mechanical and material technology that makes life “feel” more futuristic, the perennial “where is my jetpack?” problem. 

On the cultural front, I think that we have certainly hit a fallow period in creative output. It is not as if nothing creative or revolutionary gets made anymore but we are also not seeing a wellspring of creative endeavor as what was going on during the 60s and 70s, the period from which a lot of modern media draws its source material. The clearest manifestation of this to me is in the world of fashion. In all the decades prior to the 90s, there was a clear and obvious “look”, you can be invited to a 60s, 70s, or 80,s party and know how to dress. The fashions were a reflection of the social forces of the moment and were often seen as radical. These days we have settled into a sort of basic, jeans and t-shirt vibe, without much variation. I am sure people more tuned into the fashion scene than me can point out the details but overall we haven’t seen anything radical in quite some time, no shiny futuristic body suits. 

Now on both the technological and cultural fronts, I might get pushback on the grounds of practicality. After all, neither Jetpacks nor vinyl overalls are the most efficient inventions. But the history of the world shows that practicality has never stood in the way of people's love of new looks or nifty gizmos. That actually gets to the heart of my point, people adopted the nonpractical because it communicated something about how they saw the world, the ultra-modern consumerism of the ’50s and the countercultural naturalism and spiritualism of the 60s reflected social values and aspirations; I think that might be the root of this stagnation. 

The most profound manifestation of decadence in the modern age is in the world of society and politics. The world is in a moment of political turmoil and it feels more nihilistic to me than periods in the past. We see people that are increasingly frustrated and radical but without the associated political organizing and social movement, instead, we are witnessing explosive political violence. 

In the face of this few new positive visions have emerged to guide people, and this is true across the political spectrum. The right is ascendent but (to put it mildly) it lacks a positive vision for the future. It looks backward with dangerous nostalgia without even the idea of true restoration. Instead, it lashes out from a defensive crouch and a world it sees as in decline. The left has also seen a new life, but it is an old and tired resuscitation of the socialism of the past, the same battles, the same arguments, nothing new or truly radical. With so many problems in the world, and so many new modes of communication,  we should be seeing a golden age of utopian projects as has happened in periods like the late Victorian or post-war eras, but we haven't. Most people just sort of accept the world the way it is and push for relatively minor concessions, or else become embroiled in tedious culture war battles. 

I would like to make one thing clear. I come at this not from a place of cynism, but from a place of profound optimism. I see the world in the context of the long arch of human history, an endless parade of triumph and tribulation, a grand experiment. I think a lot of the problems of the modern world like depression and political dysfunction are the result of a sort of backed-up glut of utopian idealism. There were periods in the past when utopian thinking was common. America was founded on utopian principles, hence all the neoclassical architecture. The industrial revolution of the late 1800s was full of utopianism as people marveled at technological growth. The 20th century had such utopian vigor that entire societies were remade in the image of fascism, communism, and liberalism. The post-war era saw a belief that a new technological space age was right around the corner. 

Somewhere along the way this idealism eroded. I think it happened somewhere around the end of the cold war. The birth of so-called Neolibralsim created a skepticism of large-scale collective action to reform society. The loss of an enemy left the west without a powerful external motivation to strive for greatness. Having accepted their defeat, the socialists of the west retreated to academia and created post-modernism, a worldview where nothing is true and all is permitted, an ultimately solipsistic philosophy. These ideas while they started on the far left soon migrated to the far right, and thus the conspiratorial age in which we now live. The fact that most people live in relative material comfort meant that politics declined into partisan bickering. 

I am worried. I keep hoping that something will come along and knock the western world out of this stupor but nothing seems to work. 9/11 was profound and had a profound effect on society but it didn't create a universal call to service and reformation and ultimately the threat of Islamism turned out to be overblown. The Pandemic was a shock nearly as large as the second world war but it also failed to create national unity or broad calls to societal reform, and everyone seems content to pretend it never happened. And right now there is an active shooting war in Europe, an old-school war of territorial great power aggression, and America mostly ignores it while Europe holds its ears and begs for things to go back to normal.

5,2022-09-08,CMV: Further increasing exchange rates in Europe (European Central Bank) is counter productive in the current crisis,u/DizzyExpedience,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x97lf3/cmv_further_increasing_exchange_rates_in_europe/,changemyview,"Yes, I know: traditional economics tells us that in order to fight inflation you need to increase interest rates. The concept behind this is that LOW interest rates increase the amount of money in circulation and with too much money around (and people not knowing where to spent it) prices are driven up because people have the money to pay for it.

Hence, by reducing money supply you can counter this.

&amp;#x200B;

But in my view, the current inflation (in Europe) is different. Inflation is not high because people have too much money. Inflation is high because supply is to low. There is a supply scarcity of lots of things. Gas, electricits, oil… but also computer chips, cars and lots of other things. in addition, the Euro is weak, making imports more expensive.

&amp;#x200B;

Higher interest rates will NOT stop the supply shortage. It may prevent the Euro from dropping further against the dollar but higher interests will not increase gas supply or supply of chips, cars and other consumer goods.

I even predict that higher interest rates will drive more businesses into bankruptcy. While interest rates are low, you can sort of get free loans. But with rising interest rates borrowing will become more expensive and some business can’t finance their business any longer Increase speed into recession.

&amp;#x200B;

so in my view, in the current situation increasing interest rates further will NOT stop inflation but speed of recession and will lead into a stagflation.

Upon the sad  news of her passing, it is opportune to transition to republican  government.

The problem with  monarchical government is that it espouses the same evil doctrine that  is at the root of all prejudice, bigotry, racism, and classism: the idea  that by mere accident of birth, one member of a political community is  of greater status than another.

The argument that a ceremonial, as opposed to political, leader is valuable to a country is a good one.  So, for example, in the U.S. the merger of the ceremonial head-of-state role and day-to-day leadership in one man, the President, is problematic.  The U.K. avoided this problem by having a ceremonial head-of-state separate from the politician, the Prime Minister, who managed the government day-to-day and week-to-week.  However I propose this problem can be addressed by having an *elected* ceremonial head of state."

A threaded forum, but a forum. Discussions take place. That is what we are about to all engage in on this thread. In almost all forums, blocking simply stops you from seeing the poster's messages and possibly stops the poster from directly replying to forum threads you start.

Twitter/Facebook/other social media sites, which are notorious for lacking any real communication, use a block system similar to reddit's.  The old block system was mostly successful except for a few edge cases, and in those cases Reddit admins should have stepped in and stopped the harassment.

This seems like a move that undermines reddit, while making the admin jobs easier. We already have a proliferation of subreddits that are so zealous in dropping the ban hammer that some of them even automate it based on posts in other subreddits. This has created psuedo-closed communities.

I typically applaud reddit for encouraging real and meaningful conversations. This subreddit is an excellent example of that model and a reason I am proud to participate. However, the new block system doesn't seem to be adding to that in any meaningful way.

It would be simpler and more fair. They would basically be Roth IRAs that don't have income restrictions and have higher contribution limits.

Currently, high-income taxpayers benefit hugely from these plans, while the vast majority of Americans end up paying payroll and income taxes at relatively high effective tax rates (compared to ultra-wealthy who get a lot of their income from low-tax investments). Current retirement plans are not available to many lower-income families, because they aren't offered by their employer. The rich use various loopholes and complex tricks to maximize the amount they squeeze into tax-advantaged accounts. Simplifying things would make everything more fair.

Details:

* Contributions would be after-tax, but withdrawals during retirement would be tax-free. Before retirement age, the basis (contributions not including earnings) could be withdrawn penalty- and tax-free.
* Everyone would have access to an account, regardless of employer or income level.
* Annual contributions could be capped (maybe $50k? $100k?). This would be more than enough for most Americans to fully shelter their retirement savings from taxes.
* Those with very high income could shelter a lot of their savings, but not all. Dividends and capital gains in taxable accounts would still be taxed as they are now (or ideally could be taxed as normal income, thus increasing taxes on the ultra-wealthy).
* Employers (or maybe even the government) could still match contributions in order to encourage people to save, but the match would count toward the contribution cap.
* Upon death, the funds would revert to a taxable status and any future dividends or capital gains would be taxable to the estate or the heirs.

What am I missing?

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

UPDATE: Some commenters don't seem to realize how much a high-income earner can shelter from taxes under current law. High earners can use self-employment income or have their employer contribute up to a $61,000 401k overall cap. [https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/cola-increases-for-dollar-limitations-on-benefits-and-contributions](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/cola-increases-for-dollar-limitations-on-benefits-and-contributions)

On top of that, they can sneak $6000 into their Roth account via a loophole called the ""Backdoor Roth IRA.""

Some high-income earners contribute up to that $61k cap with after-tax money and then convert it to a Roth account (""Megabackdoor Roth"").

I am essentially asking to open this up to all Americans and simplify the system."

2. The two tracks are right next to eachother and each has its own platform. A person can only get on trains if the one track and would have to go up/down stairs, cross, and then down/up stairs to get to the other platform.

Each track has signs on their respective side that display the train approaching in each design.

The second platform design is strictly inferior when compared to the first platform design. This was especially infuriating when, as someone new to the area and using subways, would go to the wrong platform and miss my train in design 2, whereas in design 1 there was only one platform to to to.

And this is the kind of astrology I'm talking about. 

I've decided to check it and checked my birth chart. It was weirdly accurate, not like the ""one sign"" horoscopes, but I thought it's just that common bias and decided to check my friends chart. It said different things and was also accurate. 

I got kinda confused, because I never believed in astrology and checked it only because of curiosity. And I googled and found this 8yo reddit post from a guy, who wanted to stop believing in astrology and birth charts. 

He got ""cured"" pretty quickly, after someone told him to pick a random birth date and read the chart, trying to believe it's his actual birth date and checking if it's accurate. He found ""himself"" in that.

I did the same but it doesn't work. 

I'm very socially awkward, I always creave for new knowledge, my house is a mess and I tend to avoid everyday tasks (hello to other ADHD folks here lol) - and my chart basically says the same about me. 

My friend is very organised and responsible and her flat is always super clean and comfy. Her chart is also accurate on that and many other things. 

I put a random date in and tried to read it as for myself. Nope. ""You're very patient and calm"", ""You are unable to express your feelings and hide behind a mask"", ""Ability to control others"", ""You can feel yourself in other peoples shoes"". It's not like me at all. And I mean at all.

Capital gains and dividends should be taxed as ordinary income.

In order to protect the middle-class earner from their retirement savings being eaten by taxes, everyone should be able to contribute to a tax-free retirement account (like a Roth IRA, but doesn't have to contributed only from income) with an annual cap, maybe $50k. Current retirement accounts like 401ks would be phased out. The step-up in basis upon inheritance would also be ended, so the estate would need to pay capital gains taxes upon the owner's death. (There could be a maybe $1-5MM capital gains exclusion upon death to make sure the family house gets passed on.)

This would tax the wealthy and ultra-wealthy much more on their assets and also make the entire taxation system simpler and more fair, because everyone would have equal access to retirement accounts and everyone's income would be treated similarly."

It's a tradeoff that only the most lactose intolerant folks would accept, so lactose free milk is a slow moving specialty product that takes up valuable refrigerator space and therefore has to be expensive.  There's probably a solution there where they just make it shelf stable, but that might be too confusing.

But chocolate milk is a different story!  It's supposed to be sweet.  If you make it sweeter by breaking down the lactose, you just add less sugar and the product becomes marginally healthier.  People with severe lactose intolerance are not the only people who would drink it, all chocolate milk drinkers could enjoy it at least as much as lactose-containing chocolate milk.

So we should make the switch.  Break down the lactose in commercial chocolate milk as standard, and have lactose-containing chocolate milk be the specialty product.

As a side benefit, chocolate milk is pretty commonly available and severely lactose intolerant people could just look for that instead of finding lactose free white milk.

The same thing should also be true for strawberry milk although that product may not be common enough to matter."

I believe that cash bail unfairly punishes poor people, if you don't know, cash bail is the practice of making people pay a certain amount in bail so they can get out of jail before a trial. However many poor people can't afford this, and being in jail could cost their job and therefore livelihood over just an accusation.

Here in the US, when you are accused of a crime you should be let out of jail as soon as possible unless a judge rules that you have an extremely high risk of flight or if you've been accused of an especially heinous crime (ie murder, rape, domestic violence) in which case you have to stay in jail. You should be presumed innocent right up until the moment a guilty verdict is ruled, rather then the current system where you can be imprisoned for over a year because of a mere accusation. THe current system is extremely unjust towards the poor, goes against the principle of innocent before proven guilty and should be abolished right away! CMV!

103,2022-09-09,CMV: The consensus on whether or not female nudity/risqué content is degrading/sexist or not seems really inconsistent and arbitrary to me,u/forbiddenmemeories,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x9yd4t/cmv_the_consensus_on_whether_or_not_female/,changemyview,"I’ll preface this by saying that this is just from my own observations of people I know and social media, and I’m entirely willing to listen if other people have observed different things, as I’m conscious there’s every possibility that my own experiences could be outliers.

It seems to me that when examples of risqué or provocative content featuring women appears in the media today, there is a real inconsistency in terms of the reaction to it amongst the public, especially on social media. With some examples, the overall reaction seems to be mainly positive, suggesting that it is a good thing (or at least certainly not a bad thing) that this kind of content is around and that people who oppose it are prudish or misogynistic, or both. But with other examples, the overall reaction seems to be mainly negative, suggesting that it is in fact a bad thing that this content is still around, that it degrades and objectifies the women involved and indeed women in general, and that people who enjoy it are perverted and misogynistic, or both.

A few examples of risqué content that seems to be met with a positive reception and where opponents of the content are usually regarded as the misogynistic ones would, I guess, be stuff like the rise of cam models and other forms of sex work. Usually when I see or hear these issues discussed, the prevailing view is that this is the private business of the women involved who have taken this decision, and that condemning that kind of work or having a dim view of them for it is sexist and a case of enforcing sexually conservative values. But, on the other hand, other content such as the infamous ‘Page Three’ in some tabloid newspapers featuring topless models, or the use of ‘eye candy’ in some sports such as ring girls, has been met with a negative reception, and the people who like or support the continued presence of these things are usually regarded as the misogynistic ones. Again, presumably the women involved have taken a private decision to do this kind of work, but in these cases that doesn’t seem to be enough for most people; they still view it as bad regardless.

Now, I’m sure there are also some people out there who are supportive of all the activities I listed above, or at least have no qualms about them going on; I’m sure there are also some people out there who oppose all of the activities I listed above and feel that they are all degrading and disrespectful to women. But, so far as I have seen, the usual prevailing view is that some of them are empowering and liberating (or at least fine), whilst others are degrading and relics of a bygone sexist era. And that distinction just seems really arbitrary to me, because they often seem pretty similar. Why is one woman posing nude or semi-nude entirely fine, whilst another doing so in a slightly different context is not?

I am curious to know what anybody else thinks on the issue; whether I may have mistaken what popular opinion is, or if there is some difference between these examples that I haven't given enough consideration to, etc. CMV."

Being able to order something off of [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) with the click of a button is a life-saver. Elon Musk's companies are targetted at rich people, Apple products are also targetted at a wealther audience. Also Apple relies on slave labor in Africa. Yet somehow neither Elon Musk nor Apple receive anywhere near the same level of viceral hate as Jeff Bezos/Amazon.  


\- Amazon isn't just an online shop:

1. Authors can easily publish books and earn a living
2. Amazon web services power common everyday applications like Netflix and Dropbox

It would be nice if he were to put more of his money into philanthropy, but who knows, maybe he will in the future, or he has something specific planed in mind. At the same time, he still contributed something massively useful to society. There are all celebrities with literally like 20 cars, multimillionaire politicans who essentially contribute nothing to society, etc. Jeff Bezos has had an obvious large impact on society, and you cannot say the same about many other wealthy (but less wealthy) people."

We want to go for a 2 or 3-week holiday before we start work officially. Now we are having a significant debate about which class to get for this 24+ hours flight. He wants business ($6500+) and I want economy ($1300).

In my opinion:

1. At our current life stage, we shouldn't get into the habit of luxurious spending patterns for one-off things like a flight. I'd rather spend that money on better hotels &amp; entertainment during the holiday, or get comfy high-quality enduring shoes/clothing, etc., or even get orthodontics myself.
2. Neither of us come from a super-rich family background, and purchasing business class is not how people with family backgrounds like us work. Sure, we can fly business one day if we become millionaires or if we settle down and have our own houses and stable careers, but not now.
3. We are young, we can recover from a long flight quickly. I don't think this is going to ruin our holiday experience. This is the major point he is arguing for (he flew business once for an exchange program funded by a scholarship to Japan, and now he can't get back to economy class! He also wants to maximize his freedom and enjoy life as much as possible before he officially starts working)

Even if he is willing to pay for me, I still don't want to go to business class, I just don't feel like the money is well spent, or maybe I feel like I don't deserve it to spend money like that at the moment.

I'd love to hear your opinions! Feel free to let me clarify anything.

P.S. One more thing, I want to get both sides of our immediate family members (parents/younger sibling) to go with us, so that would be 6 ppl in total. If everyone goes business... the budget would go crazy, but this is just a side note, not about the core view. I'd be happy for our parents to fly business as they are in their 50s."

Since recently I have a friend who I'm really close with, first time in my life that I'm so close with someone. She has given me something I never had. Warmth, affection, someone laughing at my stupid jokes, someone actually giving a shit about me. And then ofc my stupid brain must find some way to make it seem bad. Well it chose to go with  

 ""you will lose her eventually because the lifespan of a friendship is limited. Yes you will perhaps remain friends after this lifespan but it won't be on the same level as it used to be, it will become boring, you will care less about them than now, you care now because it is new to you and because you want to discover them, learn about them, but eventually that will be over. Eventually you will know basically everything about them, you'll have asked every question you'll know every story and you'll be able to predict their answers before they even say it, and that will annoy you, because that will make things boring with them. Sure there are other things to talk about, maybe politics or exchange ideas, that's cool but not on the same level. You used to have friends to talk to about ideas, that was fun, but in no way was it a close friendship. The moment they disappeared they were not forgotten but there was no real longing to see them either.""  

So now whenever we text and have a convo going it's a mixed feeling because one side really likes the talking with them but then another voice is whispering that by talking to them it brings me one step closer to knowing all about them and being closer to the 'boring phase', just like a bright candle burns faster than a dim candle I suppose.

Whenever a crime happens, I think it’s worth looking at it, wholistically, , which would involve both looking at practical ways to reduce the level of that crime in society, and giving practical tips to the victims to avoid them from being victimised again in the same way, but that doesn’t mean that you support the criminal or that you’re advocating for that crime to continue in society.
For example, if I go on holiday and leave the doors of my  house wide open, and when I return everything is stolen obviously that’s the responsibility of the thief but I think it would be remiss for people who genuinely care about my welfare not to remind me  to leave my doors locked in future.
How about a person who goes to a shady part of town in a flashy new sports car, and is then surprised when that car is damaged or stolen.
When people click the links in scam emails nobody thinks it’s victim blaming to suggest that the person shouldn’t have clicked that link in the first place or recommend antivirus protection."

According to Joe Biden, the reason for the sanction was to get the Russian people to rise up against their rulers but sanctioning a country has very rarely resulted in that outcome, instead the richest cling onto the wealth they have and only the poor in that country suffer but they don’t rise up against their rulers.
The reality is that due to the sanctions on Russia, energy prices in the UK are set to spiral to an incredible level, potentially causing a recession. Germany which was once the shining star of Europe might have to cease its manufacturing processes.
Spain could go the same way as Greece did and Italy has elected a fascist ruler, and all of these are just what is happening in the developed richest countries, never mind what’s likely to happen in North Africa, the Middle East and Eastern Europe as well due to food shortages., Meanwhile, the Russian ruble is one of the most stable currencies in the world at the moment, although you could say it’s artificially being kept that way, and Russia has simply pivoted its energy resources to India and China without facing much of a shortfall from the sanctions we’ve imposed."
22,2022-09-10,CMV: Mental Illnesses Shouldn't be Considered Neurodiverse,u/blackdynomitesnewbag,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xaov0r/cmv_mental_illnesses_shouldnt_be_considered/,changemyview,"Preface:

Examples of what I consider to be neurodiverse:

- ASD
- dyslexia
- ADHD
- other learning disabilities (LDs)

Examples of what I consider to be mental illness:

- bipolar disorder
- borderline personality disorder
- schizophrenia
- PTSD/CPTSD

&amp;nbsp;

Mental illnesses shouldn't be considered part of the neurodiversity movement. I say this as a person with bipolar disorder as well as ADHD and dyslexia. Of those three, I only consider bipolar disorder to be a mental illness.

I feel this way for a number of reasons. The primary reason is that things that things that I consider to be mental illnesses are inherently detrimental regardless of societal context. They are nearly if not entirely strictly negative that cause mostly dysfunction. Example, there is absolutely nothing good about depression. I've heard arguments that it may help people learn new perspectives, but there's nothing that can be learned via depression that can't be learned via another less destructive method. Bipolar disorder is a bit more complicated because a person experiencing a manic episode may enjoy it while they're having it, but in reality they're experiencing psychosis and a detachment from reality.

Many if not most of the conditions that are unambiguouisly considered neurodiverse are due to structural differences in the brain that either were present at birth or early in childhood. Most mental illnesses don't present until late childhood or early adulthood. They're mostly considered to be due to chemical imbalances, although that may be changing. PTSD is an exception to this, but it's caused by external stimuli. Additionally, there is no one who has PTSD that doesn't wish that they didn't have it.

The way we treat mental illnesses is different from how we treat things like ASD. Most mental illnesses can be treated pharmacologically, and the main purpose is to suppress all aspects of it. ASD, dyslexia, and other conditions cannot be treated with medicine. ADHD can, but it still doesn't change the inherent structural changes in the brain nor does it suppress all traits.

I understand that the person who coined the term neurodiversity included mental illnesses, but movements often ""move"" (ha) away from their original creation as they take on a life of their own. Neurodiversity should be celebrated, mental illness should not.

&amp;nbsp;

What will change my mind:

What could change my mind would be a compelling practical reason to include mental illnesses. An example of this would be to help de-stigmatize mental illnesses so that people will seek treatment. This on its own doesn't already convince me, however.

&amp;nbsp;

What won't change my mind:

Yes, there are many people with LDs that wish they didn't have them at all. However, I think people who feel that way should be helped to feel better about what they have.
I'm aware that many neurodiverse conditions were considered mental illnesses at one point, and some still are.

Edit:

I want my mind changed on this because I don't like gate-keeping or being seen as a gate-keeper. That being said, I like to categorize things based on practicality, and in my mind there are practical reasons to create this distinction."

All tried socialism, all became shitholes ridden by corruption, low living standards, and disrepair.

So how can people who still live in decent countries support such an ideology being put into practice in their own countries?

What will NOT change my mind: pseudo-""socialist"" countries like northen europe that have been proven again and again NOT to be socialist when you stop cherrypicking policies they implemented and instead look at the whole thing, and similar examples.

What will change my mind: Successful socialist regimes with at least ten million participants and more than ten years running that are still well-off, with very low corruption and trending upward in purchasing power.

Edit: Ok, more than a year after my last attempt, the arguments for socialism haven't evolved from ""but muh scandinavia"", ""the ideal of socialism is better than the reality of capitalism"", and ""I'll rather accuse you of some fallacy to avoid discussing your actual argument"".

I'm sorry for the people who debated honestly and tried to make good arguments, I'll be distributing deltas now but will no longer debate. However, should I distribute them in a socialist way, everyone would get 1/100 of a delta, so I'll instead give it to the one guy who debated honestly."

4,2022-09-10,CMV: Victim-Blaming is not Automatically Wrong,u/TransitionProof625,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xaug8k/cmv_victimblaming_is_not_automatically_wrong/,changemyview," When something bad happens, we understandably want to find a reason why. One reason could be that the unfortunate victim(s) of the event did (or failed to do) something that resulted in their being worse off. Of course, it could also be the case that the victim(s) did nothing at all to cause their ill fortune. Finally, it might be some combination of the two--both the partial fault of the victim and of random chance or outside factors.

One reason to **avoid** victim-blaming is that it might be a lazy mental shortcut--a way of neatly and tidily tying off the discomfort of bad things happening to seemingly innocent people. It is sensible to look for other causes first, as a way of avoiding this cognitive trap. This is, of course, done in service of finding the truth. You wouldn't want to hastily settle on a solution that blames the victim and stop there without exploring many other possible causes. This is rational, and it is also ethical.

Of course, if you have carefully examined and exhausted all of the scenarios where the victim has no part in their misfortune, then you should not avoid exploring solutions where the victim is either partly or totally to blame for their circumstances. To do so, is to irrationally privilege victims as a sacred class of person that cannot be held accountable for their actions. There is no rational basis for this--it is emotional reasoning. To make this mistake will necessarily prevent you from identifying the true cause(s) of the problem and consigns the victim to further preventable misfortune. It also may result in wasted effort, misunderstanding and a failure to progress on a larger scale in some cases.

**Here are some places where our fear of 'victim-blaming' may be preventing us from moving forward on seemingly intractable problems:**

* **Repeating natural disasters**. Not the random 1,000-year earthquake. Consider people who repeatedly build in flood or tornado-prone areas. They do so often to capture the 'value' of building cheaply, a kind of short-term risk-taking. This is a choice.
* **Homelessness.** A lot of homelessness is caused by drug and alcohol addictions. While there are external causes for starting or maintaining an addiction, the victim himself is partly to blame for his actions and his continuation of the addiction.
* **Domestic abuse.** We are loathe to assign *any* responsibility to the victim of domestic abuse (male or female) but is it really possible that the victim has absolutely zero responsibility for the situation? Are they really a perfect, inculpable hapless victim, or do many victims of DV make (and continue) poor choices that result in their victimization?
* **Poverty.** Some people are poor because of unexpected misfortune. No one should be blamed for getting cancer suddenly etc. Others may just lack talent or abilities that are of value. But many people who struggle to make ends meet engage in habits and behaviors that contribute to their situation--holding them accountable is not unethical. If their actions and behaviors play a role (even a small one) in their circumstance, would it not be unethical to avoid pointing that out so that they had a chance to change?

In conclusion, the only reason to avoid victim-blaming is to escape the cognitive trap of jumping to an early false conclusion built on specious reasoning. Once external factors have been explored, we should not shy away from looking at explanations that involve some culpability of the victimized person. Victimhood by itself is not a virtue and it should not be a protective talisman against accountability."

It seems like after a few seasons that the show ran out of pertinent subjects to address like police brutality for instance. The gun control episode could have been done much better and I find it kind of telling the show messily wrapped up the arguments and buried the issue ever since.

I also thought Bow's father dying was hastily rushed and glossed over by Bow and Dre's relationship issues.

It seems like Diane's ambitions that she had in the beginning of the show got swallowed up by social concerns as she aged.

You can also tell that the show tries not to be too politically divisive but at the same time, it doesn't take a political genius tell the messages of the show lean left. In a political sense, the show can sometimes strawman the left and the right in the same episode, including the gun control episode. If I was the political/historical advisor for the show, it would look different.

After Zoey left for college and Bo and Dre got back together, it seems like the show wasn't quite the same. It had it's moments with Pops and Junior's stories but otherwise seems like it could be better regarding compelling storylines within each episode whether about the characters or discussing pertinent political and social issues, or overall humor.

For example, I think a great idea for an episode could be for a minor character like Kyra to die due to gang violence, thus potentially combining gang violence and gun control in the same episode."

The Democratic Party Leadership's Strategic Support of Election-denying Candidates Shows they Do Not Care About the Welfare of Ordinary Americans,u/PlinyToTrajan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xauqbk/cmv_usa_the_democratic_party_leaderships/,changemyview,"(U.S.A. politics)  My current view:  The Democratic Party leadership does \*not\* care about the welfare of ordinary Democrats or ordinary Americans. They have been spending money collected from well-meaning donors to help Trump-aligned election-denying Republicans get nominated.  It's intended as a stratagem; they think it will weaken the Republican Party.  The upside is Democratic incumbents, particularly leadership, have a better chance of maintaining power.  The downside, if things go awry, is the potential damage to, or destruction of, our republic.  The cynicism is extreme.   They are more interested in maintaining their grip on power than in allowing a space for a moderate politics.   

And that's even putting aside the issues it creates with long-term trust between the Party and its donors and rank-and-file members.

0,2022-09-10,CMV: Open relationships shouldn't be looked down upon. (Not including religious views),u/AriValentina,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xav6qy/cmv_open_relationships_shouldnt_be_looked_down/,changemyview,"*Open Relationship meaning according to* ***webmd:*** *""An open relationship means* ***having more than one romantic or sexual partner at a time****. It's an arrangement that both parties agree is non-exclusive or non-monogamous. As one or both partners engage in romantic or sexual activities outside the relationship, the arrangement's agreement aspect is key.""*

**My view** is that a couple can be in an open relationship and still be a perfectly **happy** and **healthy** relationship. I don't think its necessarily an unpopular view but I do see it as a controversial view that many disagree with. I understand that an individual might not want to be in an open relationship THEMSELF, but I don't understand looking down upon other people who are in open relationships. The reason I put ""(Not including religious views.)"" in the title was because I understand that if its up to religious views, LOTS of things are looked down upon. I dont argue with religion, I argue with personal views that someone created themself. 

From my own experience, open relationships have aa deeper meaning that isn't easily seen from the surface, a person cant just look into my relationship and tell me that an open relationship is unacceptable. Me and my current partner used to be in an open relationship, at the time I was labeling myself as asexual, although every now and then I would be happy to have sex with him mostly because I know that is obviously something he's into. After a while I asked him if he wanted to try out an open relationship. I told him I would be perfectly okay with him hooking up with other guys if he wanted to. He said he would only be comfortable with that if we were both there. So for a while we met up with other guys, I sometimes would participate and sometimes I just wanted to watch. Later in our relationship I started getting more into sex and I no longer consider myself asexual, Im thinking maybe something around that time in my life was just making me uninterested. We are no longer in an open relationship but we still meet up with people every now and then together. Im pretty sure that isn't something limited to open relationships. 

I think a lot of people who are against open relationships are possibly projecting? They know that they would get too jealous to do it, or they think that it would be an insult to their or their partners ""skills""

I personally don't see sex as love (Which is just a personal view, I know there's people who disagree with that) Sex to me is literally just.. making your body feel good. I think there's some things that you do during sex that feel romantic, but the actual penetration is not romantic to me at all. Kissing to me is romantic, cuddling to me is romantic, having conversations and expressing love during the act is romantic to me. We dont do any of those things when we are having sex with other people. In fact we let them know upfront that we dont want any sort of friendship or relationship with them, we just want a third wheel. So obviously if they are comfortable with that they can join but if they seem like that bothers them then we just don't have sex with them.

What about this is wrong? What about this shows that the relationship is unhealthy or unhappy?

Obviously there's some unhealthy open relationships out there. Theres also unhappy monogamous relationships out there. If you and your partner mutually agree that you want and open relationship and you are both willing to follow the rules that you two created, I don't see how that is wrong in any way."

168,2022-09-10,"CMV: If one is trying to get into a healthy, serious relationship, they should first go on relatively low cost dates until they are ready to get into a relationship",u/BOfficeStats,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xb2df1/cmv_if_one_is_trying_to_get_into_a_healthy/,changemyview,"*I define ""relatively low cost"" as under 2 hrs worth of wages, less if you have low-mid income in a high COL area. Where I live with a high COL, I would put the price of ""relatively low cost"" dates at &lt;$30 for a lower wage worker, &lt;$20 for most dates.*

Spending a lot on the first couple of dates is usually a bad idea if you want to get into a loving, serious relationship.  Here are four reasons why:

**1**

Early dates often don't lead to a serious relationship so spending a lot of money can be a burden on one's finances.

**2**

Some people will take advantage of a person who is willing to go out on expensive dates with them.  This leads to many expensive dates that don't lead to a serious relationship.

**3**

Spending large sums on a first date can attract people who want to live a lavish lifestyle.  This can lead to compatibility issues arising if you are unwilling to spend that sort of money on a regular basis.  

**4**

Expensive early dates can create an unhealthy dating dynamic.  Imagine a situation where Person A pays for the cost of an expensive date for themselves and Person B.  Person A, who spends a great deal of money on the dates, might feel entitled to more time with Person B or believe that Person B was taking advantage of them if Person B chooses not to go on any more dates.  Meanwhile, Person B, who is not paying for the dates, might feel pressured to go on more dates, even if a healthy, serious relationship is extremely unlikely to form, since they don't want to seem like they were taking advantage of Person A.

**There are some exceptions that I recognize if they meet the following criteria.**

-  Neither person will take advantage of the other person or pressure them to continue dating.

- Both parties are transparent and quickly learn about each other's expectations regarding their finances.  This will prevent people from going on many dates before realizing they are incompatible when it comes to their spending habits.

- You have enough disposable income to pay for expensive dates without being financially hurt in any significant way.

**Here are some very specific exceptions:**

- If you like a hobby/activity that requires &gt;2 hours of wages to do during a date, you want a partner who likes that hobby/activity, you would like to know if they like that hobby/activity ASAP, the hobby/activity will not break the bank, and you are good at determining whether a date is actually interested in the activity, it might be worth paying for it on one of the first dates.  

- If they live quite a distance away from you then spending more than 2x your hourly wages on a date might be a good idea in order to cover transport costs.  Yes, it will cost more money but it doesn't lead to other significant problems.  

**EDIT:**

I gave a delta and added the criteria regarding hobbies and transportation."

91,2022-09-10,CMV: ethical breeders ARE contributing to the problem of dogs ending up in shelters.,u/heckboobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xb81r1/cmv_ethical_breeders_are_contributing_to_the/,changemyview,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m very open to changing my mind on this. I know it’s possible my current viewpoint is failing to see the big picture. With that being said, my top priority is the well-being of dogs who are being born and not the value they can provide to the humans who care for them. I understand that working dogs can provide important services and they are happy, fulfilled, and (ideally) well cared for while doing their jobs. 

I believe most people agree that, in a lot of cases, we have done dogs as a species a disservice by domesticating them. We have breeds like pugs, bulldogs, and dachshunds who have a lot of health problems (breathing issues, eye conditions, back problems, etc) resulting from us breeding into them the parts we like but it not being great for their overall health. 


There are also other breeds that are generally healthy and are happy doing their jobs, like border collies for herding, labs (and other breeds) as service animals, and German shepherds for search and rescue. I don’t see anything wrong with ethically bred dogs doing jobs they like doing and having healthy, happy lives. This isn’t what my post is about. 

My post is more about people who don’t need a working dog who want to have a pet for companionship. I’m gonna use poodles as a specific example. People like poodles because they don’t shed and are hypoallergenic. As far as I know, poodles don’t have a lot of health issues resulting from selective breeding. They make good pets and people love them. In most cases, they’re not really serving a purpose other than being good and very cute companions to us. 

Are there poodles and all sorts of other dogs who provide a much needed service to their humans? Absolutely. This post isn’t about them. This post is about people who want dogs just to have a dog. Even if a breeder is responsible in their breeding and very selective about who those dogs go to, peoples’ life circumstances can change. Someone might get a dog and have all of the means to care for them properly at the time, but a relocation for a job, or a disruption in finances, or a breakup, or just a change in priorities can make it so that the person who adopted their dog can’t continue to give them the life they deserve. 

I believe that if we want a dog just to have a dog, we shouldn’t get one that was intentionally bred. I understand that people want non-reactive dogs and dogs they can raise from puppies so they can control (in some ways) and fully understand their temperament. And if you need a seeing eye dog and there are children in the home, I completely get wanting to get that dog from a responsible breeder. Again, this post is not about them. But if someone wants a dog for a companion animal and they’re worried about if they’ll be safe for their children or for their cat, just don’t get a dog. If you really want a companion animal, do some responsible shelter shopping. There will be no shortage of those dogs in the near future. If you’re worried an adoptive dog won’t fit as your companion animal, do not get one. We can’t continue to breed these dogs into existence just for us to love on, no matter how much we want that. 

I have a dog who means the absolute world to me. He is a jack russel-beagle mix that I got from an ex boyfriend who wanted to kill him cause he chased the chickens. He’s the best boy ever and I would love to get another jack russel or beagle one day because I love him and he brings joy to my life. But if there’s not one in a shelter, I shouldn’t seek out that dog from a breeder just because I want them. Dogs are mistreated or kenneled or not properly exercised so frequently and we shouldn’t continue to breed them just because we like them. 

Ultimately, dogs are wonderful but humans aren’t always wonderful back and we shouldn’t continue to breed them because we love how they make us feel. I don’t think breeders, even the ethical ones, are raising dogs where the majority are going to serve a purpose other than a show dog or a companion animal. I’d love to hear your thoughts!"

Nor do I think one gender is more prone to this than the other. 

What I do believe is that society is very focused on appearance. We like to think we're not but we are and it affects our behavior. 

There are countless studies that show attractive people are more likely to be promoted, attractive people get more matches, attractive people are viewed as more trustworthy, etc. There's a depressing, but logical flip side too- studies show that unattractive people are disadvantaged in many areas. 

I don't think this would be such an issue if people were aware of their biases, but most are not and I think this is harmful to not only unattractive people, but anybody who interacts with attractive people as well. To everyone in other words. 

Where dating is concerned, not knowing how much looks influence how we perceive others can cause us to ignore red flags and date people who are incompatible, or even dangerous. It's not just that if we encounter a model in the wild we'll perceive them as more attractive and more dateable because of their looks, it's that we will actually ascribe positive personality traits to them because we like their appearance. I personally have been there and done that. 

The reverse is true as well, although dating is a special case because some level of attraction is necessary for most people. If one person doesn't find another person attractive, a relationship won't be possible. However, maybe in some cases we would give unattractive people who are otherwise compatible a chance and we would become attracted to them and that would turn into something. 

Where careers are concerned not knowing how much looks influence how we see others can cause us to hire candidates who may not be the best fit because they are good looking or ignore candidates who are a great fit because they aren't so good looking. The former harms us and the company and the latter harms the company, us, and the not so good looking candidate being overlooked. There is no reason we need to hire attractive people. 

You might say that spreading this knowledge about how much looks matter will be harmful to people's mental health- especially unattractive people, but I disagree. Most unattractive people already know this better than anybody. I don't think it does them any good if we pretend like looks don't matter when they clearly do. 

That's my view, but I'm open to changing it- any part and can't wait to see other people's responses."

As huamnity stands up out of what were literally the dark ages - We can look back and laugh at how crazy it is people of the past believed all sorts of stuff because someone wrote stuff in a book.  In the dark ages people thought it was ""bad smell"" itself that caused disease.  Humans are not innately smart.  We took a damn long time to invent the wheel!  It is not *you* and your human judgement that lifts us together.  It is our invention of reason, ability to reason, and will to decide to use reason in a way that is exceedingly powerful.  

We should respect reason for ""beating"" every god because despite every way it is inferior the act of being demonstrable is what reason ultimately has over god.  

The very concept of what we call ""faith"" is the antithesis of reason.  We all appreciate that when your house was built the carpenter used a level.  This is because a carpenter's arbitrary feel for levelness is off all the time.  So the good carpenter uses a reliable tool to make decisions about how best to build the structure.

With reason humanity invented ""evidence"": The notion of what is worthy to make a good decision in the framework of reason.  

Look at what reason and following evidence (and not a whim, or what's in a book) has lead humanity to.  We constructed fucking airplanes and space vehicles!  These same creatures that 500 years ago thought that dirt on their skin was protective.  Can you imagine having faith in that concept and how disgusting those people must have felt because some person had this insane idea and no one thought to question it.

Humanity goes along with ridiculous things all the time.  We can and should measure and see the utility of reason and now see ""faith"" as simply a comfortable if obviously inferior way to find truth vs needing evidence minimally to hold something as true.

I'm not suggesting the action ahead is outlawing faith, how could we?  But to together ask if it's real and if it's a good foundation."

I think the sentence ""it's for your own good"" can be dangerous (except for the cases of emergency where a child put their hand in an electrical outlet for instance) because it gaves the impression to people that they are not able to choose by themselves.

A direct increase is that a child, when he/she becomes an adult and choose a job/a field of study, have to be free: the parent can give him/her useful information, opinions (personnaly I think that...) but no advice and no orders.

To be honnest, I had this reflection because my parents forced me to do a scientific field in high school, then a ""classe prépa"" (special university in France, after I decided to do what I wanted) but even if this cmv could help me to reconcile with my parents, I ask the question in a general way.

A question like one's role in society is too important to be solved by another one. I don't trust that free choice is total (social determinism...) but I think ""helping"" someone with her/his educational orientation is reducing the person to a minor who does not know what is good for him/her. It is not only a moral position: it can have consequences on the adult child, because if he/she works to please his/her parents, he/she will live vicariously and can avoid things he/she would love. I also think that it can have psychological consequences: if the young adult cannot make decisions, he will stay like a child in his entire life.

Even an interesting  job/field of study become boring if someone does that under constraint.

The role of a parent is not telling a child what to do.

EDIT : I think it is unclear : a parent can help a child to study but not interfering with his/her choice. "

“An invasive species is an introduced organism that becomes overpopulated and harms its new environment.[2]”
(Wiki invasive species)

Maybe a century or two ago humans could maybe loosely be described as invasive, but modern day humans are by far the most aggressive and persistent invasive species on this planet. 

Wherever humans go these days they just destroy entire habitats of hundreds of other species and over populate at an unsustainable rate.

We collect way more recourses than we can use and just throw away anything harvested to early (as in we harvest it without having a need to to prepare for when we do need it) so much that it just sounds ridiculous to think of humans as anything other than an invasive species.

* ***Pornography is any cultural content created to arouse involuntary response of satisfaction.***
* Cultural freedom is same as pornographic freedom, and vice versa.
* Cultural innovation is impossible without pornographic innovation, and vice versa.
* All the SFW contents produced in human history are merely pornographies moderated for wider consumption and therefore wider influence over larger audience.
* All the SFW contents can be redefined as pornographies designed to involuntarily satisfy specific needs
* Even children's stories are ""innocence pornographies"" that satisfy our spiritual needs for uncontrolled therefore unoppressed exploration of unknown world.
* Romance dramas mainly designed for female audience are also ""romance pornographies"" that satisfy women's lust for 'unconditional love' from 'highly competent men' who are willing to 'sacrifice anything' under their control for their women's sake.
* Non-media contents such as social etiquettes, and fashion are ""dignity pornographies"" designed to satisfy our needs for individuality despite being heavily involved in social affairs.
* Academics, which are a category of cultural contents primarily produced in textual mode, are ""knowledge pornographies"" designed to arouse the feelings of knowing relevant subject matters, regardless of validity of such knowledge. This explains the emergence of alchemy and other non-scientific, non-verifiable fields of studies in early stages of human history, especially those academic disciplines heavily focused on descriptions, not procedures.
* Social norms such as ethics and laws are also ""stability pornographies"".
* The distinction between SFW contents and NSFW contents is purely about what kinds of needs the consumers wish to be involuntarily satisfied.
* Any control on pornography is a control on cultural capacity of the population.
* Hypothetically speaking, total ban on pornography is total ban on human creativity.

After the Las Vegas shooting, his administration banned bump stocks and he is being quoted as saying  ""Take the guns early...take the guns first go through due process second"" and might have banned assault weapons if the New York Times is to be believed. Meanwhile, Ron DeSantis has said he will sign constitutional carry into law if it ever comes across his governors desk.

He is a more moral person than Trump, only having one wife and actually seeming to be more religious than Trump who I think claims to be a Christian just to appeal to the GOP. Meanwhile, Trump has had 3 wives and used to be a playboy and might have had an affair with a porn star too.

He has served in the military while the Trump has not.

He is younger and better at public speaking, which might come from his Harvard education."

Warning: Anyone who served in these last two wars or knows someone who was killed or injured in these two wars maybe don't read this.


People are bringing up all kinds of reasons for the military recruiting issues such as: the current labor market / economy, the amount of the population that is disqualified for military service due to xyz, the military becoming 'woke' (I think this is stupid by the way but people do mention it). Put whatever reason other than the one I'm going to write below in this category. In my opinion, a large contributor to this shortage is because people have seen how the military has been used over the last two decades and they’re disillusioned about it. I’m not surprised that pundits are not bringing up this reason because it’s hard to do tactfully and it’s just murky waters to go into.  


So we pulled out of Afghanistan over one year ago. This was a 20 year conflict where so much blood and treasure was spent, throw the Iraq war in here too because it's a similar enough situation. People see how these conflicts went, they see how many soldiers were killed or injured or came back with PTSD. They see how many civilians were killed as a result of these conflicts. They see what we accomplished as a result of these wars and in my opinion they see that we lost these wars. 


Before my next paragraph where I talk about us losing the war in Afghanistan, I implore anyone who isn’t familiar with the reports by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction and the Afghanistan papers to take a look. This gives some background on what we knew and when we knew it and to me removes doubt that those in charge knew this was unwinnable but no one wanted to be the person to actually admit defeat because it would be very politically unpopular.   


Here is a choice quote from the Afghanistan papers:

“If the American people knew the magnitude of this dysfunction . . . 2,400 lives lost. Who will say this was in vain?” - Douglas Lute, 3 star Army General 2015.  He served as the White House Afghan war czar during the Bush &amp; Obama Administrations. 


When we were pulling out of Afghanistan, which in my opinion was an incredible act of bravery by Joe Biden, people saw the country fall to the Taliban and they got slapped in the face that this war really was for nothing. It's a hard pill to swallow that yeah the people who died or were injured there didn't serve some great accomplishment in the end like in WW2, it really was just kind of a waste of life. We lost, we accomplished nothing, the people in charge knew that these wars were unwinnable but no one wanted to be the person to admit defeat. This is the murky waters that people don’t want to wade into. The American zeitgeist is that our military are all heroes, they’re all serving some greater good in the world and anyone that dies in the line of duty died for some heroic reason or serving some greater good and that’s just not true.  


I think people are also seeing how many civilians the US Military kills which is in my opinion an egregious amount. According to the Costs of War project between  184,382 and 207,156 Iraqi civilians were killed due to direct violence during the war in Iraq and over 70,000 Afghani / Pakistani civilians during the war in Afghanistan. It’s fitting that during our pull-out of Afghanistan one of our last actions in the country was to drone strike a family and kill 10 civilians including 7 children. This was then passed off as a ‘righteous strike’ and if not for the excellent on the ground reporting I don’t know if it would have come to light what we actually did. So not only have US Military lives been wasted but we’re also killing countless civilians, it brings up the ‘are we the baddies’ sketch in my mind.


Why would someone trust the military or the government at this point and sign up to potentially die in the next war given the recent history of how misused the military has been in the last few decades. People see how injured veterans are that are coming home and they go why would I sign up for that when it served no greater purpose? I’m noticing that the war drums have started to beat for a conflict with China. That’s not something I’m interested in rushing out and signing up for, I’m thinking a lot of other people feel the same way.


Recruitment suffered heavily after Vietnam too because people saw that war for what it was. It took years and years of propaganda to get recruitment back up. I think we're in that post Vietnam type time frame right now.


TLDR: It's not that the economy is so good, it's that young people see how many military members died for no reason and how many civilians we've killed and they don't want to be part of it.

Edit: I woke up to a lot of comments, I'm trying to go through them all now"

This is about the state of the world, their society and their living conditions. If anything the Judges represent the power that I believe will eventually be in the hands of our broken system of governance.

Each year the life for an average person is getting harder. Costs of living, education and personal care are becoming more unreachable and everything only stands to get worse.

People will become increasingly desperate and resort to theft, violence, etc. This will be used as a platform for politicians to funnel even more money into law enforcement, private prisons and the military. Then I feel we will begin our slow transition into a society like the one depicted in Judge Dredd.

Combined with how climate change is trending and how little big corporations care, we will absolutely see the displacement of millions of people in our lifetime. From rising oceans and temperature, to the threat of nuclear war, soon we will have many large isolated areas of the world that are uninhabitable.

At that phase we would naturally ease into mega city situations. In a mega city, it's without a doubt an invite for a large, overpowered body of law enforcement. Essentially the force that we see today multplied by twenty and with even less accountability. It would usher in the era of a dominating police force that is essential to keeping order."

I don't think it deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.,u/Signoro_Reccher,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xbwrsz/cmv_daredevil_season_3_was_just_average_to_me_i/,changemyview,"Hi guys. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm the only guy on the internet who didn't like Daredevil S3. Don't get me wrong, I love the show, the characters and the world and I was hyped for it when it came out. But Eric Oleson's take on the character basically did nothing for me. I understand why someone would like it, it had some good elements (Kingpin is amazing), but the overt praise it gets makes me feel like an alien in my own species. ""One of the best seasons of television ever?"" Huh? I thought I it was just a made-for-television remake of S1 with terrible pacing (especially in the first six episodes)   

Forget ""going-back-basics?"" Oleson went above and beyond and made the whole thing literally play out like S1, beat-for-beat. They got dirt on Fisk, nope too rich. Okay what about this dirt? Nope still too rich. Cue the third act -- they can't beat Fisk so they find Hoffman 2.0 (Nadeem) to rat on him. DD/Kingpin get into a scuffle, Mahoney arrests him, Daredevil prowls the rooftops in victory, and he frolics over Fisk's defeat with Karen and Foggy as they open up their law firm. So many scenes just felt like a shot-for-shot remake of S1. Oh look another egg making montage, oh look Fisk is wading through the closet again. Oh look he's seeing his child-hood self in the mirror again. Another botched Fisk transport operation, another dramatic phone conversation. Matt falls and yells ""I can't seeeee."" Another scene where Matt explains his powers to his friend. ""Gimme your Jacket"" was literally Car Door 2.0. and the list just goes on. Karen Page's arc is the same. She wants to defeat Kingpin by going on an investigative journal spree, everyone tells her it's dangerous, than she shows a shocked Pikachu face when it turns out to be dangerous. Melvin Potter even goes through the same arc. He has a scuffle with Matt in his garage, throws a manchild fit, Matt talks him down like a kid and promises to protect his girlfriend from Fisk. Rinse and repeat. Fisk even gets Daredevil in trouble by using the media to frame him for murder...again.

Speaking of Daredevil's legal problems -- how many times did the show hint that Kingpin was going to expose Daredevil's identity in both S2 and 3, and all we got out of that was a nebulous threat in the last episode? It made it look like the story was just going around in circles; if you're going to foreshadow a story actually follow through with it. Instead the way they actually did get Daredevil in trouble just comes completely out of left field and makes no sense. Yes I know Fisk is powerful and Hell's Kitchen is mired in corruption, but you're telling me all he has to say is ""Matt worked for me"" and now he's suddenly in a world of legal pain? It's a complete fantasy narrative with zero evidence and there's literally a million ways Matt could have fought it. Even worse is that the whole storyline just sort of happened, than the writers forgot about it because it was never really concluded. That's just sloppy writing and it came off as ""Born Again but very boring,"" which was amplified by the fact that we never got to see Fisk dismantle Daredevil's life. 

Instead it all hinged on the bland Midland Circle story-line. The fact that Oleson felt obligated to tie himself to this one piece of continuity is hilarious because he literally ignores everything else anyway - Elektra, the Punisher, the Defenders, Stick. We don't get anything close to a deep dive or explanation as to how his past experiences damaged his mental and physical health and it leaves huge holes in Matt's development as a result. He just forgets about Elektra and Stick a few months after their deaths because.....? How much of his experience with Frank caused his moral decline? Nothing was fleshed out beyond ""building crash so I hate god now."" Matt's arc is just dull because it's mostly just speechifying and moping around doing basically nothing. The biggest peeve though was going back to the black suit again and basically re-doing an origin story where he gets beat by basic fodder. Again. More S1 copying. We already saw this two seasons ago and we saw him grow past this in Season 2. Why go backwards?   

I'm okay with doing a reinvention arc, but not when he's only been a full fledged super-hero for one measly season. You need to give him time in marinate in the sun a little bit. Otherwise, the character is just spinning his wheels in the mud. Matt's literally spent two thirds of his own show finding himself. Push. Progress. Move the story forward. 

And please, could we give Matt's moral crisis a break already? Or could you do something new with it? I liked it in S1, and to me it felt like it was closed and finalized there, but Olson just brought it back and just, did the exact same thing. Again. And Again. It's the same talks about tough it is to beat Fisk Fisk FISK morally and legally, the same feuds with Foggy about Matt's Irish Catholic principles. It just felt like they were beating me over the head with such an obvious formula, and I just grew sick of hearing the same melodramatic speeches over and over about how evil Kingpin is."

First of all, I assured you that I’m not a troll who likes to create controversy and waste everyone’s time. I do feel my view is flawed, I just cannot put it into reasons. So I’m looking for better argument to change my mind. I appreciate any input. 

My view: racism is not always bad. 

Explain my view: 

First of all, definition of racism:

[Racism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism) is the belief that groups of humans possess different behavioral traits corresponding to inherited attributes and can be divided based on the superiority of one race over another. It may also mean prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against other people because they are of a different race or ethnicity.

Second of all, I give a situation when racism is not bad: 

A small town of 100 people consist of 20 people from ethnic X and 80 people from ethnic Y. It has a small police department. 
One day, the sherif got a call reporting a robbery, and the suspect was seen fleeing in a car. Upon reports from bystanders, there were two cars matching the description, but are heading opposite directions. The only difference is one car was driven by a person of ethnic X and other is of ethnic Y. At the time, due to technical problem &amp; shortage of staffs, the police department only had 1 car available, which means the sherif can choose to pursuit only one of the car and let the other escape. 

So the sheriff make the argument inside his head. According to his 20 years experience serving the town, he recorded that of the total 100 robberies occurred, 80 were done by people of ethnic X, while 20 by ethnic Y. Work up some math, that means a dude from ethnic X was 16 times more likely to commit a robbery than a dude from ethnic Y. Therefore, if he choose to go after the car driven by the X guy, hypothetically, he would had more chance of catching a criminal. 

So the sheriff went ahead and decided to use his one and only car to pursuit the X’s car, which mean, letting the Y’s car go free. 

And by doing that, the sheriff committed a racism act, according to the definition. 

However, his intention &amp; reasoning wasn’t bad: he wanted to catch the bad guy, and followed a path that had higher chance of success, to better serve the community. 

Therefore, racism isn’t always bad. 

Sorry for the grammars, I’m still practicing English,

I appreciate any input !
Thanks all,"

Mostly, anti-vaxxers. I believe that everyone should have *access* to healthcare; however, if you have the opportunity to be vaccinated *and refuse* and subsequently need a hospital bed, you should have to waive your right to it. That's my problem with ""healthcare is a human right."" If you actively choose to be a danger to society, you shouldn't be allowed to reap the benefits of living in one.

Healthcare is something we have collectively agreed upon to provide, and while I don't agree with privatized healthcare, I think by opting into it, you tacitly agree to do everything you can to take care of yourself (yes, I realize this can be a slippery slope). But we already have policies in place like this—you don't get priority access to lungs if you're a smoker, you don't get priority access to kidneys if you're a drinker. Early in 2021, I saw a tweet from a woman who needed a non-urgent surgery that had to be pushed back because the hospital had no beds available due to an influx of COVID patients, and she said something along the lines of ""we should consider that we are letting the unvaccinated run the country."" There should be repercussions for being an anti-vaxxer, or at least for being allowed and encouraged to be vaccinated and choosing not to.

I'm not saying you should check someone's political ideology or worldviews before deciding whether or not to be a Good Samaritan, and I don't necessarily have a good solution to this either, but I do think ""healthcare is a human right"" is too broad and is generally used as a buzzy policy position rather than a pragmatic counter to our current healthcare system."

Bytes are *currently* defined as containing 8 bits. The only reason they are even defined as being 8 bits is because old Intel processors used 8-bit bytes. Some older processors used upwards of 10 bits per byte, and some processors actually used variable length bytes.  
Why arbitrarily group your number of 0s and 1s in groups of 8? why not count how many millions/billions/etc of bits (0s/1s) any given file, hard drive, bandwidth connection, etc is? This seems like the most natural possible way to measure the size of any given digital thing.

Systems show you files/drives in Mega/gigabytes, your internet connection is measured in Megabits/s, but your downloading client usually shows Megabytes/s. Networking in general is always in mega/gigabit. Processor bus widths are in bits. 

Internally (modern) processors use 64-bit words anyway, so they don't care what a 'byte' is, they work with the entire 64-bit piece at once."

Well, a designer baby is when you create a baby using Gene splicing and you can create the exact kind of child you want.

How very nice. This of course would be available for people who can afford it. Unless of course the government decides to subsidize it.

No, I'm going to ask you to imagine yourself as a designer baby where you were designed from the ground up by your parents and not by nature or God or whatever.

Imagine yourself as a teenager who hates their body. Teenagers often do have problems with self-image and it's just a part of being a teenager.

Now you feel very uncomfortable about yourself and you realize that the fault is not in the God or in the stars, but in your parents.

You might even be bullied for something you had no control over which is your genetics. Maybe you are even the ""wrong race"" so to speak. Maybe you are the race that is basically hard mode in your country. You criticize your parents for making you the way you are and making your life incredibly hard.

No, you decide to kill your parent. Parent murder already happens. It can be because of misogyny or because of personal hatred or whatever. But now with designer babies there will be more and more murders.

0,2022-09-12,CMV: the Education System primary goal is not education but socialization,u/gemini88mill,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xce5yf/cmv_the_education_system_primary_goal_is_not/,changemyview,"Let me start by saying this is for primary and secondary education. Whatever your country thinks is the end of a normal secondary education. In the US it's your senior year of high school, or 12th grade. 

A lot of people in my country complain that the education system here is in shambles. Kids aren't learning, they are developmentally underperforming against their peers in other countries, but i would argue that this is because education is the secondary goal. 

In the US to get a middle class job it is mandatory to receive supplemental education after high school. Either it be a trade school or college. The offers of a position after highschool with only a high school degree are limited to unskilled labor work and even if you would like to move up the ranks at a corporation that hires you on unskilled labor alone, you still need to go back to school to advance within the company. 

This means that your mandatory education (primary and secondary education in the US is compulsory) is effectively useless. So why go through with it? 

This brings me to the heart of my argument, school is primarily for socialization. Having a diploma is the minimum requirement, not for what you know but for your minimum skill set in order to interact with other people. 

Evidence for education not being the primary goal: 

1. Education by default must be taught to the lowest common denominator. Meaning that the slowest kid at any grade must be taught so you can only gain knowledge based on his level within a standard deviation or two. This makes the education system extremely inefficient. 
    a. Most states you can opt of a dual enrollment at 16 meaning you can take college courses while in highschool sponsored by the state. 
    b. Home school programs are usually completed with months to spare per year depending on the criteria within your state
    c. Most states will allow you to leave school in favor of getting your GED and you can technically graduate at 16 or less as long as you meet the education requirements of the GED. 

This point means that the states have at least acknowledged that at 16 you are a competent adult that can do what any high school graduate can (not taking child labor laws into consideration) 

2. Socialization is the primary goal because those life skills are vastly more important then what you know. 
    a. All thing being equal most employers are interested in how you can interact with a team then opting for raw skills at a thing. 
    b. Elementary and high school teaches you how to succeed in the real world by creating a mock up of that world. Clubs organizations, student elections, friends, enemies, conflicts, drama, girlfriends, boyfriends, etc. Are all treated as real to the high schoolers involved but seen as mocks for the administration for the real world. 
    c. What better example of the real world do you get then sitting in a room listening to a boring lecture and trying to stay awake then a school. 
    d. Almost all highly sought after skills (STEM and Legal clubs) are viewed as geeky and nerdy because those activities promote individual aptitude over social connection.  While other organizations like student body, athletics, and activism are promoted for the opposite reason. 

This all comes down to my conclusion that socialization of the youth is the more important goal in education. Sure you learn a base skill set in highschool but most people will not use these skills in real life and they only exist as a catch all for the ones who will move on to college. Even then you still have another 2 years of college level general education to go through in order to get to your actual major requirements."

Dirt cheap, fentanyl can kill with as little as $20 worth of drugs. Easy to administer, the drug can be effectively delivered by someone with zero medical experience or training. Humane, the drug would kill painlessly and without unnecessary suffering. 

I have OD'ed smoking fentanyl before. I very well may have died if my friend didn't narcan me and give me mouth-to-mouth. The moments before I slipped into unconsciousness would have been my last experience in the world. And it was not unpleasant; I just saw the room spinning and felt  relaxed as I sat down and drifted off into peaceful sleep.

60,2022-09-12,CMV: There is no solution to misinformation for the layman.,u/oshaboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xcm17z/cmv_there_is_no_solution_to_misinformation_for/,changemyview,"There are many articles online about ""how to spot misinformation"", usually involves advice like ""be skeptical"", ""check the credibility of the source"", ""find other sources"", ""check the scientific consensus"",""take your biases into account"" etc. And while those work well to avoid falling into the worst conspiracy theories, I feel the actual problem is a lot more subtle.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like misinformation nowadays is such a tangled web that exists in isolation from the facts. That for the outside observer it looks just as well sourced and collaborated as real facts. Take for example an article from the Daily Wire. Usually you fact check it and find articles from Fox News, The New York Post and Brietbart confirming it. From the outside that seems great, you've checked the sources and found other sources. But all those sources are known to engage in misinformation and there is no way for the layman to know it. Especially if they confuse the New York Post with the New York Times.

Surely, the solution is sites like Wikipedia, Snopes, Politifact and mediabiasfactcheck. I don't doubt them (though if it turns out I should, that would confirm my point), but that's just begging for someone to come along and make a similar site that confirms the misinformation. All you need is funding, and funding for misinformation is easy to come by.

Luckily there is a centuries old solution to the problem, the scientific method. This doesn't work for events (such as a claims that Israeli Politicians visited funerals of terrorists, but I will get to that), but it works for reproducible claims about enviornmentalism, medicine, physics, etc. The scientific method is undoubtably a great thing. But the layman doesn't have the tools or knowledge to perform it. You might say ""well ask the scientist's consensus"", well, unless you live next to a university you now have to trust those who report the consensus.

I've been thinking about that because there are soon elections in Israel again (again, again, again) and I was researching some of the candidates, specifically of Meretz and Ra'am (2 parties currently in the coalition), and found they visited the funerals of terrorists and even called them freedom fighters and shahids. This was an instant dealbreaker to me especially when I found sources confirming that from sites I assumed were respectable. But the more I looked all the sources I realized there were no sources from the funeral itself, only retrospective reports. As far as I can tell that was a rumor. But I could be wrong.

This view has been called paranoid so I am really hoping to change it. So please lemme know if I got anything wrong.

Edit: capitalization.

Edit 2: A lot of people are saying better public education will help. It will, but my point was mostly about individuals concerned about misinformation. And how can they avoid being caught up in it. It wasn't about policy changes. "

But it seems like China (PRC) is being increasingly aggressive toward Taiwan. They moved up their goal deadline for having the capability to take Taiwan by force to 2027, from 2035. China is well behind Taiwan and the West in microchip manufacturing, and their overall economy doesn’t have the optimistic projections it did before. This may make them more likely to try to invade Taiwan, for TSMC’s tech (even if they can’t use it, just to deprive the US of it), and to promote national unity. 

Now, 90% of advanced microchips are manufactured in Taiwan. It is an incredibly sensitive process— even if China doesn’t take the island, they could easily disrupt it for years if they wanted. Besides, the raw materials are mainly in China or Africa (where China is using the Belt and Road initiative to gain influence). Microchip plants take years to make— and my understanding is that, even when up and running, the CHIPS Act plants won’t be a drop in the bucket. 

So, I’m fearing a scenario where nearly all consumer electronics— anything Apple makes, cars, medical equipment, even military equipment, is unavailable for the better part of a decade. Anyone care to tell me either why this won’t happen, or why an invasion of Taiwan won’t have such a drastic effect?

However, this doesn’t mean that I believe that society should encourage those who “feel” like the other sex to transition hormonally or through surgery. From my point of view, gender seems to be associated with certain expressions of the appearance, such as clothes, makeup, and demeanor. Therefore people who don’t “feel like a man or a woman” need to redefine themselves in order to be able to act and dress how they like. But why is it not possible to simply dress and act the way you like ? Why does one need to create new labels that only narrow our current definitions of “man” and “woman” by implicitly saying that my personality cannot exist in side of a man’s body. Furthermore, what does it even mean to feel like a woman? What does it mean to feel like a man ? These questions seem impossible to answer, which only makes the prospect of mutilation of their natural genitalia even more disturbing. Shouldn’t the proper way of achieving your desired identity be to open the boundaries of current ideas of how each sex expresses themselves? Finally, I will conclude by saying that it seems as though those who identify with the Transgender community are part of a cultural fad, that binds those who do not fit in to a community that will accept and support them no matter what, even if it means completely reestablishing social systems. I believe that this cultural fixation will negatively affect teens and young adults long term health.

0,2022-09-13,CMV: Feminism and the left are partly at fault for the rise of Andrew Tate,u/Acrobatic-Clothes248,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xczq9c/cmv_feminism_and_the_left_are_partly_at_fault_for/,changemyview,"The acceptable public opinion only tells men how they should not behave, without telling them how they should behave or giving a positive ideal for them to strive towards.

Feminists are right to say it's not their job to help men, but what they fail to realize is that this creates a domino effect because the movement is mostly aligned with the left-wing on the political spectrum, and they failed to come up with a positive, desirable solution for many young guys.

This is one of the major factors that contributed to the rise of Jordan Peterson and Andrew Tate. Notice how most guys who have spoken about men's issues independently have not managed to form a proper mainstream movement. Even little things such as men just asking for help or expressing their emotions are met with ""man up"" or ""i'm not your therapist, pussy"" by society as a whole.

It's not surprising to see the Red Pill, an individualistic part of the manosphere (compared to feminism being mostly a collective activist movement) being seen as the most ""viable"" alternative for some young men, as full of mysogyny and black-and-white thinking as it is, because collective men's movements have pretty much all went to shit, no matter how they viewed feminism and women as a whole.

Evidence of this is r/menslib. Despite being promoted as a positive men's liberation movement endorsed by feminists and mostly speaking up about real issues men face, it's overall a very small sub compared to the Red Pill movement or r/twoxchromosomes, despite it existing for years.

I'm sure i will be told ""it's because men don't care"" or ""it's because of other men"" but those are not the reasons in my opinion. It's because of a systemic issue and a collective thought that men cannot have issues or that they are privileged. 

The feminist movement complains that men keep asking ""when is international men's day"", but they themselves do not celebrate this day, nor do they even tell their fellow guys ""happy IMD"", despite claiming they fight for gender equality.

I've once read a post documenting society always ""putting men back on track"" whenever they needed help (basically, telling them to man up) before the rise of the internet. Now that men are forming communities related to gaming, anime, movies or are trying to form male spaces to feel valid and that their opinions matter, it seems like this solution doesn't work anymore. Furthermore, many men are starting to find their passions in fields such as IT, cryptocurrency or AI-powered technology, where they can often also form communties with strangers on the internet and have opportunities to express their opinions, feel validated and talk about their problems. Society has realized that ""putting men back on track"" is no longer a solution, and for this reason, combined with the above paragraphs where the left has failed to endorse a positive movement for men, I'm honestly not surprised to see so many people having an universally bad opinion on guys who play video games or putting labels on people in IT or cryptocurrency, with the stigma of them being loser white men who idolize Elon Musk, Joe Rogan, want to have sex with robots or masturbating to hentai. They think those men have no life and aren't productive members.

TL;DR While women, minorities and the LGBT have succesfully managed to form positive, respectful communities and large safe spaces that are socially acceptable and endorsed by the public opinion, men have failed miserably to do so. The reasons are other than ""because men don't care"". The mentality that men's issues do not matter is systemic, creates loneliness for everyone, and is exactly what led to the rise of Andrew Tate."

Also, leave those numbers aside for a minute, generations are meaningless anyway. As mentioned time and again throughout history, Ancient Greeks thought their ""younger generation"" was so much different. A knight in the 16th century probably thought ""they don't make knights like us anymore"".

**Final edit: While I view ghosting as a selfish and a cruel action, I now understand, that it might have very real reasons behind it, and just like any other action, it does not by itself make you a bad person, if its something that isn't a repetitive thing you often do. But please, if you can, don't ghost, because it really does have a huge negative impact on people**🖤



(The exceptions mentioned in the title being:
Someone Sa'd you, stalked you, abused you, etc...You do not owe these people an explanation.) 


I use the term ghosting for *both* relationships and friendships in this post, since it is also possible to be ghosted by your friends.


I've been told many times that my view of this is flawed, so I'd like to have a conversation to understand why, and possibly change my view. 

So I think that ghosting someone makes you a bad person,  **especially** in cases where you've known 
The person for a long time (excluding the exceptions mentioned of course), because it can really damage someone's life, and mental health, when all that you had to do, to stop that from happening, was to exchange words for 5 minutes, to make them understand why you want to cut them out of your life. 
I know that in the end the only person you are responsible for is yourself, but I feel that it's selfish to cause someone perhaps months, or years of discomfort and low self esteem, when you could've spared them from that by conforting them, and telling them the truth, so they might be able to change their ways in the future. It might cause you 5 minutes of discomfort, but I feel like someone's overall mental health is more important, than the avoidance of minor discomfort of 5 minutes.


Because when you ghost someone and cause them a sh1tload of problems to carry with them, and you just walk away, just to avoid confortation, you are acting really selfish imo, which makes you a bad person. 


Sorry for the repetitiveness of the text and possibly wording, english is not my first language
Tl;dr: Ghosting with no clear reason makes you a bad person, in my opinion."
0,2022-09-13,"CMV: Communism and Socialism will not, and should not, ever happen in the Western World.",u/WithinFiniteDude,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xdcht2/cmv_communism_and_socialism_will_not_and_should/,changemyview,"Revolutionary Socialism and Communism will never happen in the western world, as those countries are structured now, and should never rise to power because of the negatives associated with their rise. Therefore, Socialism and Communism are impossible in the west, CMV.

Socialism and Communism are broadly defined as the workplaces and industry, called the mean of production, being collectively owned by the workers at those workplaces, rather than by a corporation or a private owner. Socialism and Communism were theoretical economic systems imagined by Marx and Engels based on their critique of Capitalism starting with Das Kapital in 1867.

I think their critique of capitalism is through and fully applicable, but their prescriptions for fixing the situation both will never happen in western countries, and it should never happen because of the damage it legitimately does.

-First, why it wont happen.

1) Workers and Middle class people in western countries overwhelmingly do not support a workers revolution or socialization of the workplace

2) Property rights as they are currently are valued by Working and Middle class peoples, and would resist the radical change required to realize a socialized workplace or anything further.

3) Socialism and Communism are very diverse, fractured movements. Social Democrats, Democratic Socialists, Marxist-Leninists, Maoists and Anarchists all fall under the leftist umbrella of Socialism/Communism. Without a strong unified vision, leftists will always form the circular firing line and eat their own, ie trotsky vs stalin and mao purging his party of  potential rivals, stopping their ability to form strong movements.

-And why it shouldnt happen

1) Nearly every Socialist revolution has resulted in anti-democratic, coercive, highly corrupt single party states that were achived thru bloodshed. I oppose all of these things, as should all people.

2) Market socialism still is prone to the same problems as a capitalist market while also making capital investment far riskier, and command economies are not very effective by comparison, see Maoist China and Stalinist Russia for examples of the famines and Veitnam for the proliferation of blackmarkets to meet the needs of citizens of socialist countries. The cure to capitalism in these cases is worse than capitalism itself.

Socialism and Communism are effectively dead in the west, CMV"

I do not like it and think it is probably one of the facets of our society that causes the most suffering.

However, I constantly hear people argue especially when it comes to shopping that their individual choices do not matter because companies are the ones creating the most negative impact. Because of this, I see people buying tons of clothes off of fast fashion sites every other month or using Amazon all the time because it is convenient. I’ll also state that I’m not talking about people who need these services. I know shein is helpful for those with minimal funds or who are plus sized (however I do think there is a conversation to be had about how you are still supporting slave labor and horrible working conditions even in those circumstances) but I get that it’s a reality.

What bothers me is that we are so individualistic as a society that people can simply remove themselves from any issue by saying “well it’s the companies/celebrities so therefore what I do doesn’t matter.” Just because “there is no ethical consumption under capitalism” doesn’t mean you need to make the worst possible choices every time just because you can.

The reason individual choices don’t currently make a difference a ton is exactly because people think like this. When everyone is an individual and doesn’t have to think about the collective then choices don’t really have a chance of making an impact. However, if lots of people were willing to live more minimally, shop more sustainably or eat more sustainably, even a little bit we would be much better off. When you believe your choices have no repercussions you are making it impossible to ever make a change.

Edit: I’m not saying we should get rid of consumption entirely, obviously people have to consume things to survive but like.. most people don’t need 20 fast fashion things in bulk every other month. There is a reasonable middle ground I’d say."

However, recently with the rise of Andrew Tate and other “manosphere” type individuals, I have seen the rise in men saying that women are the reason men are suffering today and it is because they are gold diggers, don’t care about mens feelings and want a “high value man” when they don’t want to be a “high value woman.”

Here’s my two cents. I think a lot of these issues are actually the most heavily perpetrated by men. If we go back all the way in time, men were the ones who built our society and built it with the idea that men should be the dominant, breadwinners with no feelings while women should stay home and be subservient while just taking care of kids.

I hate that men feel they can’t talk about their feelings, but I also hate that this constantly gets put on women. I once posted in askmen what male friendships are like and if they would be able to care for each other and talk about difficult issues and the main answers were, “my friends and I just jack around, nothing serious.” Why can’t men be there for their friends? Why can’t they find solace in other men? I know the answers but also, again men are the ones who tend to perpetrate the idea that you need to be a real man, not show feelings, be jacked and make six figures.

Sure some women have latched onto those ideals, but why is it that women get most of the blame for mens issues?"

I should also say that I’m one of those people that hates how much Hollywood tries to be ""Woke"" to the point where I no longer watch the MCU or Netflix originals. 

I say this, the title, because Ariel’s skin colour has no bearing on the story whatsoever(unless it does when the film comes out) and shouldn’t stop any original fans of the movie from still enjoying the same plot with a different looking character. 


Note: I don’t hate the concept of inclusion in movies. As someone who grew up in a somewhat remote country, watching Western TV it’s nice when I see people I relate to on Tv however I don’t like when it’s blatantly overdone or requires the plot to be sacrificed.

People do absolutely horrible things to each other based off of the book that they were told to follow. People have accused people of being witches when not follwing the bible, people have gone to war a LOT over religion, especially in the mediveal ages, and people have done horrible things to each other for religion, even committing mass genocide over an entire race, ethniticty, or people who have different beliefs. Religion essentially encourages blind faith and looks down upon intellectualism or reason, and therefore allows someone to die for something that simply isn't true. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever for religion, or at least any VIABLE evidence, contrary to science which is a belief in pure logic. Racism has essentially stemed from religion, as people used the excuse that ""God chose them to be the superior race,"" which is pure, idealistic, nonsense. The worst part is that if you try to reason with religion, people will respond by using their blind faith as an excuse. People have to realize this is pure, nonsensical, whim that shouldn't be followed or taken as seriously as it is. Science and reason will tell us everything we need to know, and we have to accept as humans that we truly don't know our existence, rather than finding some of the weirdest and most stupidest excuses known to man.

EDIT: A lot of the stuff I say in this paragraph of mine is mainly exaggurated.

EDIT: I DO NOT DENY THAT RELIGION IS HUMAN NATURE. I NEVER DID. I think that we should, in some way stop religion if there was a way. However that would conflict with the basic human nature of skepticism and curiosity. We (sadly in my view) will never get rid of religion.

EDIT: How did this thread get so popular?

116,2022-09-13,CMV: It’s perfectly fine for men in monogamous relationships to consume pornography,u/BiteInfamous,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xdgrls/cmv_its_perfectly_fine_for_men_in_monogamous/,changemyview,"Big caveat right off the bat: 1). I’m talking about porn involving *consenting adults*. 2). I believe porn addiction is real for many people, but that’s not what I’m talking about here, I’m not referencing porn consumption that’s compulsive or damaging to a person or their life/relationships. 

So I’m a married woman in a heterosexual monogamous marriage and I know my husband watches porn, and I think it’s fine (both in my case and in general). My reasoning is, he’s a human being and it’s unrealistic to think he’ll never be attracted to or turned on by another woman the rest of his life; I don’t think it says anything about our relationship or his attraction to me that he might also be attracted to or turned on by another woman.

I also think it’s none of my business. IMO, just because we’re married doesn’t mean we’ve signed on to have no secrets; barring anything illegal or involving underage people I don’t think his one on one intimate time is mine to have much of a say in. 

I understand that some take the view of porn as inherently anti feminist, but barring my ability to know how each individual woman in porn is feeling about being in porn, I feel that all I can do is try to be ethical and intentional in the type of porn I consume (feminist porn, women led production companies, etc.) and ask my husband to do the same. It seems to me even more disempowering to tell women who say they feel empowered by or enjoy making porn that they just don’t realize they’re being exploited. 

Ok I think I’ve covered my main reasons for this opinion. I posted here b/c of a thread I saw in a woman-only sub discussing porn, and I was surprised at how many women were vehemently against their partners consuming pornography, so I’m really curious to hear others’ viewpoints and have my opinion challenged in a more generalized sub."

0,2022-09-13,CMV: Traveling (vacation) is an overrated hobby/experience,u/The_Saracen_Slayer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xdj919/cmv_traveling_vacation_is_an_overrated/,changemyview,"Obviously what is, or isn’t, overrated is really just personal taste and opinion. And the exact nature of the “traveling” can vary in terms of  what people mean. But I will try to make my case at least somewhat rigorous. And to at least give some reasons why I would argue that traveling is just as easily a burden/boring experience as much as it is a luxury.

“Traveling” (sometimes synonymous with travel vacation) is often stated as a generic hobby to describe someone’s personality or interests, similar to terms like “career-driven” or something. It’s often championed as some awesome self-independent alternative to work or settled lifestyles, “I don’t want to settle in office work or family home, I want to travel!” Its pretty laughable. Travel is not only a unnecessary burden of precarious risks, but it’s actually quite boring after a few experiences. Here’s why:

1) Travel requires constant movement between locations, which is itself its own hassle. Whether walking, car, train, etc…it nonetheless takes some toll on your energy. Carrying luggage requires extra effort, time is wasting between transit (exponentially more wasted if delays occur), and of course good old money is usually needed too. All of these are especially more burdening if traveling farther distances (internationally), which are exactly the “awesome” trips most people brag about when they try to talk up traveling. The amount of personal energy and money wasted on simply getting to another destination could have been used to hangout in local places. Or simply play video games or something. There are countless alternative leisure wasters that don’t put as much tax on your resources.

2) It is not a life learning experience, everywhere is the same because humans are the same. The idea that different locations will show life altering viewpoints is hugely over exaggerated (nor interesting). Whether Japan, Mexico, US, etc… differences in cultures are just different flavors of the same meal. Most people/places are awake at day and sleep at night, weekends are more popular for restaurants/bars, some people are talkative others silent, famous sights (whether Mt Fuji, Tikal Pyramids or Trajans Column) are just tourist traps which at best are nothing more than a nice pic for your social media profile…soon to wear off their euphoria as just another land piece. Other than the connections one makes with people (which can be done at home city), there is nothing I would say that is particularly life learning that is unique to travel. Oh and nature experiences (hiking, sporting, exploration) in other places I would argue fail for the same reasoning at paragraph (1) …too much energy expenditure.

3) Most importantly, traveling is indeed boring…or as boring as any other hobby (games, parties, movies, etc…) in the since that is indeed repetitive regardless of location. This basically ties back to paragraph (2), but the experiences are not fundamentally that different. You go eat overpriced authentic “x” food, go visit historical “x” site for your picture/memory collection, walk the streets of “x”  city where local people are doing the average routine of work on weekdays and bum on weekends, and if you’re lucky you went there during “x” festival which is really just a yearly County State Fair that just attracts international tourists. Whether its Europe, Mexico, Japan, Canada, it’s all the same (unless you going to a war zone, then you got me on that).

Bottom line is traveling is an energy intensive and resource draining hobby (more than most). It is not unique or impressively self-developing. And it is boring because it is basically repetitive once you done your 5-6 major trip…you pretty much get the picture. See a few historical sites and you’ve seen them all. How some people brag that their lifestyles aspire or work towards having more traveling is baffling to me. 

Now change my view!"

This is a bit of a repost, as my other post was removed due to not meeting the 500 word minimum. I also feel that some of the responses indicated I had not clearly explained myself, so I would like to try again and elaborate. 

There are notably some pronouns I left out of the above list, he/him/his and she/her/hers, as well as neopronouns ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopronoun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neopronoun)). The reason I have left these out is because these are the responses which I believe that society currently sees as acceptable pronouns, so I don't feel the need to argue on their behalf, as they are already acceptable. Though do note that if they were not currently accepted by society, they would be added to the above list.

My argument primarily rests on presumptions which I believe makes it hard to refute. The first of which is the simple fact that the above list is a list of pronouns. The second of which is that these are the pronouns by which I, and many others, identify and respond to in conversation. 

In my previous and short-lived post, one person made a compelling argument. Shout out to u/Ballatik. I will address the argument they made here: They has essentially stated that I fully understand the *intended* question, but do not give the *intended* response. My rebuttal is that while I do understand the intended question, humans ought to be more mindful of how we phrase things. If what is *meant* is 'how should I gender you' then that is precisely the question we should ask (and in this context, we will accept that 'they' and other non-binary answers are genders. This is a separate argument, but it is not the nature of this conversation. For the purpose of this conversation, accept it as true). Now the answer to 'how shall I gender you', the above list is unacceptable except for they/them/theirs. If the question however, is 'what are your pronouns' then I would posit it for most people that the above is something they would use as pronouns."

The economy did well, he got a border wall up (mostly) which I liked since it would keep out drug runners and human traffickers. For the most part I really liked the way he handled foreign policy. 

What turned me off from him was that he is such a crybaby loser that seems to care more about winning than the US devolving into potential Civil War. I think there could have been election fraud, but to be so certain it happened without much proof is just terrible. What really scared me more is Trump's hardcore base who will follow and believe what he says no matter what. It really irked me that Trump didn't do much to shame the January 6th stormers. Maybe there is some truth that he knew it would happen. Talk about hypocrisy in hating Antifa while members of your party break into the most important building in America.


Onto Biden, I generally dislike the Democrat party's beliefs, but I do have to say that they do a good job in creating jobs. I think they really spend too much money in the wrong places. This is how I view Biden too. 

What really sets Biden apart from the rest of the Democrats is that I believe he truly is senile, and that he behaves inappropriately physically. I feel like Biden must be taking orders from someone else wether it is Nancy Pelosi or Kamala. He even called Kamala president lol. Joe Biden handled the withdrawal from Afghanistan so badly it worries me that he could lead us into WW3 or another major needless conflict.


So to me it seems a vote between Trump and Biden is a vote between civil war and WW3. That is why I believe they are both bad options."

You should nearly always try to assume ignorance before malevolence. 

Let’s do a thought experiment, made up semi-on the fly (cut me some slack reddit).

1. Person A intentionally stabs a random person on the street, who happens to be a pretty bad dude. Person B accidentally stabs a person while packed close together in public transit, who happens to be a pretty good guy.

Let’s dissect that. First, we have A intentionally stabbing a person, and B it happens accidentally. Which would you say is more morally acceptable?

I would certainly say B , as I believe the intention behind an act matters. I’m not quite sure why I believe so, I just feel it in my gut. I’m hoping someone can CMV/open my mind a bit.

To further break that down, Person A happened to stab a bad guy (B a good guy), despite his morally unacceptable intention to stab (despite not intending to stab anyone). If impact matters more than intention, then that would mean that Person A is better morally than Person B. I don’t believe that to be the case.

I’ve taken a few ethics courses in college so I can keep up a bit if you want to argue that route. Definitely not a believer in utilitarianism, although I’m not sure what ethic I would say I do follow. CMV, keep it civil guYs

Edit 1: To paraphrase someone here, intentions are all we have when taking action. We don’t yet have the consequences of our actions - how can we act morally if we don’t know how our actions will be judged yet - unless they’re judged by intention?

Also…



EDIT: One person suggested this and it might CMV. Lets play it out

Updated hypothetical (courtesy ReOsIr10):

- Person A intends to kill a “morally average” person. It turns out the person they killed was a pre-Holocaust Hitler.

- Person B intends to kill pre-Holocaust Hitler. It turns out the person they killed was a “morally average” person.

…”strong argument to be made that the actions of person A were more morally good than the actions of person B despite their difference in intentions.”



I agree that there’s a strong argument to be made, but for now, I believe that intentions matter more, and B is a better person. CMV"

3,2022-09-13,"CMV: The Internet is a destructive force on society, and easily could lead us to a political global collapse",u/MtnDewTV,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xdrb6m/cmv_the_internet_is_a_destructive_force_on/,changemyview,"While the internet is initially seen as one of the greatest innovations and human achievements in history, I truly believe that it has strong negative impacts on society and consequences that pose the greatest threat to our current global society. 

I know it's a bold claim, and the internet has greatly increased educational and job opportunities expanded and created new markets, and has connected the world together like it never has been among other things. I do believe that the internet has done a lot of good for society and the entire world, however, I think most of the positives are short-term gains. The internet's endless possibilities and power to communicate with anyone is the world has created pockets of different hate groups, terrorist organizations, drug cartels, etc. To clarify, when I say ""internet"" I am referring to both the surface and deep web. 

As far as the ""deep web"" goes, or ""dark web"" (I know they are 2 different things), I feel like this is the more obvious problems with the internet. Making it easier for people to distribute CP, human traffic, sell guns,drugs,etc, and just other general bad crime stuff. There is also the ability for terrorist organizations such as ISIS to recruit new members from all over the world. Most of this stuff is pretty known to go on, and there is focus to stop it, however, I believe that ultimately the surface web will be more destructive to society. 

First off, the surface web and social media specifically allow corrupt political actors to easily spread misinformation and create more radicalized voter bases. Political polarization in the US has never been as large as it is today. Even during the civil war political polarization wasn't as bad. 

Not only is the internet/social media creating a more politically divided America, but it is also damaging citizens' mental health and well-being. Suicides have also seen a dramatic increase since 2000, and there has been a major uptick in mental illness overall. School shootings have also increased, while guns haven't evolved all that much in their capability. You can blame the news for this, but they are now competing with online news sources. Now with the internet, anyone can become a ""news"" source who just run sensationalist headlines. Mainstream media now has to compete with the sensationalist headlines and ""news"" found all over the internet. 

Then there is also porn. I am not some religious conservative who just hates porn because the bible says so, but rather there are some seriously damaging psychological and physical impacts that it can have on people, specifically men. It ruins relationships and perhaps this ties into the increase in mental illness, but porn can lead to loads of issues like addiction, erectile dysfunction, increase violent attitudes towards women, etc. Plus, social media's ability to allow people like Andrew Tate to rise to fame and gain a young and impressionable fan base also has really unknown but potentially detrimental impacts on society. When young boys listen to people like Andrew Tate, it can really warp their worldview and perception of society. We will see what happens I guess, but I seriously believe the internet is going to continue to increase mental illness in the US, in turn leading to higher rates of suicide and crime and poverty. This coupled with the increasing political polarization in the US caused by the internet, will eventually lead the US to a civil war and an economic and governmental collapse. In turn, if such an event does happen, the United State's influence in the global economy and security will leave a large impact on a global level. The entire global economy would collapse and human advancement would be set back years."

Women do shame men for their sexual prowess and dick size and will compare. I’m not saying guys don’t do this, actually I would say this would also apply to them as well. However the women who compare sizes and sexual performances between partners aren’t the virgins it’s the ones who slept with a lot of guys. I’m not saying all woman with a lot of sexual encounters are mean but a virgin is not going to shame you of your sexual prowess. I mean they can but they have nothing to compare it too. Imagine you love this girl to death and she leaves you because you couldn’t measure up to the sexual standards another guy before her left. I didn’t want to come off as shaming women.

But can you honestly say it is without its flaws? Is science infallible? Is medicine perfect?

Lately, I’ve seen so many folks claiming you’ve got to trust the science and the experts over your own opinions and research. I think that’s just mad!

When I was a kid, the doctors told my dad he was just suffering from heartburn. He accepted this, but my mom knew something else was wrong and marched him back in. In the ER, they discovered he had a blocked artery and was hours away from death. They did an emergency operation.

If we had just accepted the expert opinion, he would have died.

We see that science is constantly updating and rewriting itself. It seems new evidence is always disproving what we once thought was correct.

We see this in medicine, too. Take for example, the old psychiatric practices. In 1600, Dr. Thomas Willis said mental disorders were the result of biochemical imbalance, to which bleeding and vomiting was the cure. We look back at that and call it crazy, but it was renowned medicine at the time. Now, doctors still say mental disorders are caused by chemical imbalance, except now they give out pills. And still we see this as amazing medicine without questioning if it won’t be seen just as bad in another hundred years.

It seems many people think science is this perfect answer to life when, really it doesn’t even scratch the surface of reality."

So same goes for those who travel a lot and otherwise cannot give their dogs tons of exercise, attention, and general freedom. I don't care how much you claim to walk your dog or take them outside, it's not enough. It's not responsible to have them inside a small space for a majority of their lives where they do not have the freedom to go to the bathroom, explore, or play when they want to. Nor do I think it's ethical to crate them for any length of time while you're away.

What may change my mind is an argument that demonstrates dogs may prefer small spaces and lack of exercise/freedom. So the only exceptions I can think of might be around ""lap dogs"" or small, lethargic breeds. Even then, I would still make an argument that it's irresponsible that they cannot go outside when they want, having to wait for their owners to let them out, or for them to be forced to be crated when you're away. Your desires to ""own"" a dog does not outweigh their comfort and freedom.

EDITS:

My argument is that a yard is another *minimum requirement* of being a responsible owner in addition to other things like feeding and exercising them.

Apparently it needs to be pointed out that dogs are living organisms with basic needs. Being a responsible ""owner"" means dogs shouldn't be arbitrarily subjected to the lifestyle and whims of their owner if it means a lower standard of living for the dog.

Insufficient arguments:

- Just because a dog CAN live without a yard doesn't mean it should.
- Just because you want a dog and don't want a yard doesn't mean you should.

Or any variation of the above.

**Best argument so far (Delta'd, though not entirely convincing):**

/u/Scott10orman

&gt; If a dog isn't fully stimulated, and happy and free to to go wherever they want at all times, that does not mean they don't have a worthwhile living situation.

I don't think this changes my mind that it's *most responsible* for dog owners to have a yard, but I do think it makes me less judgmental about people who own dogs but don't have yard.

**Why it's not entirely convincing:**

It doesn't mean we shouldn't have a minimum standard of living for dogs and I believe a yard should be part of it."

Either with walking, public transport, or biking. 

But in many (especially more poor) countries it is not that easy to not use a car.

Let's say a person **can** walk 1.5 km to work every day. Than that has a huge positive impact on their health (physical and mental). If they cannot but have to drive to work they might or might not decide to do sports in their spare time.
I think even the 500 meters walking associated with public transport might have a huge impact summed up. 

Further driving might increase unhealthy food choices like drive through fast food.

I want to distinguish between car centricity and dependency. Car-centricity is for me a dependency by design. E.g. in some places in USA it is not possible to walk somewhere, because they only built for cars. 

I do not know any studies on car-centricity / -dependency that support / neglect my claim. 

I know that USA is one of the countries with the highest obesity and very car centric infrastructure. It makes therefore sense to me that there *might* be a causal relationship.


Edit: 
I am not at all arguing that there are no other reasons for overweight. I am just saying that this is a **factor** that increases obesity."

I understand that not all dogs are appropriate from some homes and sometimes you wont know until you bring them home, but why does someone else need to pay you to take the animal off your hands because you cant provide what they need.  It also gives insecentive for people to keep adopting until they get the ""perfect dog"" because they can recoup some of the lost money and know if the next one doesnt work out "" I can just give it away again""

This argument doesnt have to be exclusively about dogs, its just that I see these types of posts the most with dogs."

I do think there are some childfree people whose feelings genuinely will not change for their entire lives and who will stay happily childfree forever. I just think that's a lot rarer than it seems, and most people who are opposed to kids in their youth eventually do fall into it. 

Three reasons, basically: 1) Biology. You don't have any way of knowing how it'll feel when your hormones kick in and you notice babies everywhere. 2) Being in a relationship with someone who really really wants kids to the point that you have to choose between being childfree and being with them. A lot more people than you'd think will find their principles become flexible when it means losing the love of their life. And 3) Social pressure is a motherfucker. We don't like to think we're vulnerable to it but we are.  

I understand why childfree people are hostile to this opinion. They hear it all the time, and it's used to dismiss the reality of how they feel and deny them medical procedures. But the reason they hear it all the time is that there's a grain of truth in it, honestly. And the reason they're denied permanent medical procedures is that a lot of them will change their minds and no doctor wants to be the reason somebody holds regret in their heart for the back half of their entire life. 

Why I'm open to changing my view: I haven't done research on this, I don't have statistics, and I also am not childfree. All I've got is all the people I've personally seen change their minds, which is all anecdotal. I also know that when you don't share someone else's feelings, it's easy to conclude they're not ""real"" feelings, and I don't want to fall into that trap. So I totally could be wrong."

If a straight cis male meets a girl at a bar, say, and they hang out out for a couple of weeks, and she discloses to him that she in infact trans to him and he suddenly loses interest, I find it very hard to believe that its because he wants to have bio kids is the reason he's breaking it off, and thats it.

if the same issue was with your gf finding our she is infertile and discloses that to you, would that same guy break it off? I seriously doubt so.

and Im mainly talking about trans women who are fully transitioned so im not even talking about the issue of ""well I dont like dick, so thats why I couldn't"". Like she got the bottom surgery and the guy still decides to break it off. I cant see how thats not transphoic.

I honestly think the same thing about it even if the trans woman didnt have bottom surgery, but I would be more willing so sympathize with alt opinions on that then the issue of the guy turning down a trans woman who is completely transitioned supposedly just cause ""hes wants bio kids"". I find that excuse to be suspect."

When our pets are given two outcomes - suffering and death - we are allowed to choose death, so why are we not allowed to make the same decision for ourselves?  I have heard some arguments against this claim, but without fail I always end up with the thought that if I were faced with a truly miserable existence, unable to even facilitate my own life, then I would rather be dead.

I want to clarify that I don't believe it should be like the situation out of Canada last month, where a veteran with PTSD was offered death by Veterans' Affairs instead of treatment.  This is a topic which should be between a doctor and their patient, or nearest kin in their stead.  However, the option should be there.  Thus far, view the lack of this option in favor of prolonged suffering as a great cruelty to our fellow man, and see no reason for it to be withheld.

how can a such important position in a nation have the

*""Anyone"" can enter in Harvard University?* Yes, if you is qualified enough.

*""Anyone"" can be a president?* If you meet the criteria, and the popularity, sadly yes.

After all what is a president? Is it just the portrait of a contry, hired by popularity? NO!
A president is much more than that!
He is the voice, the power.

And how such important position can be given by mainly *popularity*?
Something that you can buy with money or power..

In my opinion, they should at least put some criterias to enter in such position, like competency, excellence... And not mainly popularity.

0,2022-09-15,CMV: First world countries should pay third world countries to take poor and unskilled refugees,u/NASA_Orion,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xenlho/cmv_first_world_countries_should_pay_third_world/,changemyview,"Disclaimer: refugee is referring to FUTURE refugees who are still in the war zones. I’m not mad enough to have people who are already here removed.

There are two perspectives  here:

The refugees need a place to settle down since their homes are destroyed due to various reasons.

First world countries take immigrants for two major reasons.

* The petitioner has connection with the country. (e.g. their parents, partner or children are citizens of this country) It would be inhumane if they are not accepted.
* The petitioner can benefit the country as they are skilled or rich. (e.g. petitioner has a PhD in CS)

&amp;#x200B;

In general,  first world countries have higher GDP per capita because their people are more productive. (i.e. skilled) There aren't many labor intensity industries in the first world countries. For example, your sneakers and clothes are most likely not produced in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

On the contrary, those low-tech products are manufactured in third world countries, which require huge amount of labor. For example, [China’s factories are wrestling with labour shortages](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3163097/chinas-factories-are-wrestling-labour-shortages-age-old).

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, the best solution is first world countries paying third world countries to accept refugees. Those payment can be used for transferring refugees and helping them settle. Refugees have a place to live without the fear for war. Third world countries (such as China, India, Brazil) have more young workforce, which could boost their labor-intensity industries (lower labor costs could boost their exports). First world countries won't have excessive supply of unskilled population. 

&amp;#x200B;

This should be the best solution."

Through much of the discussion about it, there's been a strong consensus that race does matter, and Ariel is a good or bad example of this, because she's fictional, or because race isn't core to her character, while it does matter for snow white or black panther because they have a colour in their name, or such.

I say, it doesn't matter. Why should we care what a big mega corporation produces? It's not like the original books no longer exist. The race of random fictional characters doesn't matter. The [Danish don't care about Ariel being black](https://old.reddit.com/r/Denmark/comments/xctexs/what_do_you_guys_think_of_disney_making_the/) and they noted that a larger concern is turning the red haired Thor into an American alien superhero, which people don't care about, and that Ariel doesn't die in the little Mermaid at the end to represent an authentic Danish experience. 

Why care at all? People clearly don't care that much about the feelings of the Danish. The outrage on their behalf about the Little Mermaid seems silly. And in general, outside that, why care about other movie franchises race swapping? If Black Panther wants to cast Bucky as the next Panther, good luck. If Snow White wants a black princess, whatever. Why does it matter what a big mega corporation does?

I do hold an exception for systematic stereotypes and employment. It would be bad to not hire a particular race, or portray a race negatively on tv. But race swapping? It doesn't matter. 

Change my view, because I feel weird that so many people care so much about the sovereignty of Danish fairy tales."

Here in Australia, supposedly renowned for its high standards of living and strong economy, on a given night more than 110,000 people (including nearly 20,000 children) will be homeless (out of our population of around 25 million). \[data from government census, 2016\]

This is despite the fact that around A MILLION houses (or 10% of all housing stock) sit vacant in Australia the majority of each year (some of these are holiday homes used once or twice a year). \[data from government census, 2021\].

Data from the ATO also shows that there are 2.15 million property investors in Australia – that is, people who own at least one property they do not live in as an investment. 29% of these investors own two or more investment properties – that's around 625,000 people who each own at least 2 properties they don't live in, in addition to the house they do live in. 625,000 people with 3 times more than they need of a basic necessity while 110,000 people go without a safe and appropriate roof over their heads. Imagine going to sleep at night in one of 3 houses you own knowing that 20,000 children out there have no safe roof over their heads, all in the name of financial profit or so you don't have to book a hotel when you go on holiday like a normal person. It's despicable and morally unconscionable.

All of this is compounded in Australia by several decades of government pandering to investors and cashed up developers, treating housing as an investment commodity rather than a basic, common necessity for human life and survival. Government policy and investor behaviour has driven average house prices in Australian cities well north of a million dollars, and more or less permanently out of reach of an entire generation or anyone who isn't already a rich landowner.

I have no \*fundamental\* problem with people owning multiple houses. But in a society where anybody has no house and no access to appropriate housing, nobody should own more than one. Nobody should be forced to endure the suffering and the assault on basic human dignity and human rights that is homelessness while someone else has multiple houses, many of which nobody at all lives in."

0,2022-09-15,CMV: A Constitutional Monarchy is a superior political system to a Republic,u/Subtleiaint,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xeuqcn/cmv_a_constitutional_monarchy_is_a_superior/,changemyview,"With the death of the Queen Elizabeth II and start of the reign of Charles III monarchy and republic are buzz words in the UK. Whilst I understand the argument against un-elected head of states and I’m a full supporter of democracy I believe that a constitutional monarchy is ideologically fully democratic and actually creates a better political system than a republic. In short the fundamental crux of my view is that an unelected and non-partisan head of state is superior to an elected and partisan one. 

Before I attempt to justify my view there is a caveat, the UK implementation of constitutional monarchy has one major flaw, Crown Consent, where the monarch must be consulted and give approval of any legislation that effects the monarch’s interests, I believe this should be abolished but that doesn’t fundamentally change the concept of a constitutional monarchy or invalidate my view.

In a constitutional monarchy the executive and legislative branches of the government are fully democratic just as they are in a republic, the monarch has no authority (beyond ceremonial) over these systems, therefore a constitutional monarchy is, democratically, equal to a republic. Where it has an advantage is that the head of state is non-partisan, i.e. they are not representative of a political party and are therefore not opposed by those that didn't vote for them. This has advantages for national unity and gives equal access to everyone to the head of state. 

meanwhile there are two main criticisms of monarchies, the elitist nature of their existence and their appointment by birth, but I believe both these things can be justified. The Monarch is the senior diplomat of a nation, they represent the nation abroad and host foreign officials and support the nation’s interests, in short they are a countries marketing. If you wish an institution to be seen as rich, influential and with a strong identity it should be marketed as that. Republics spend similar money on state visits and presentation as monarchies do, in short the head of state of a Republic will be similarly elitist (consider the US White House and the pageantry that supports their head of state).

As for selection by birth, I consider it a fairly elegant solution to providing a non-partisan head of state. If there is any selection process for a head of state then that selection is fundamentally partisan (it represents the interests of whoever selected them). Selection by birth means that the head of state is not chosen and is not beholden to the interests of selectors. An alternative way of doing this would be a lottery, but a person who is trained, guided and supported on their path to this position has advantages over those who are instantly elevated to it. Prince William has been preparing to be head of state for decades and will likely have decades more to get ready, I suspect he will be a perfectly suitable candidate to be a head of state when the time comes.

Few people in the world think that Queen Elizabeth II was a bad head of state but many argue that the system is broken regardless of Queen Elizabeth’s personal qualities, I don’t agree with that. I believe the system will produce candidates similar to Queen Elizabeth and that unsuitable candidates (ones who don’t feel beholden to the standards Queen Elizabeth set) would be deterred (think King Edward VIII's abdication or Prince Harry’s move away from royal life). I believe that Charles III and Prince William will be excellent heads of state in the vein of Elizabeth and I don’t think this is will be surprising.

So what do you think, why is a constitutional monarchy bad? Why is a Republic superior? Change my view."

Now of course, I'm not saying there is no push for these things, but it isn't nearly as widespread.  Talk to any girl/young woman who has been in middle or high school for the last 20 years, and I can almost guarantee that at some point, they were pushed to go into a STEM field.

Why don't we see a big push for more women in trades, which is also well paying and dominated by men?  What about working on oil rigs?  Its dangerous, but pays well.  Its because those jobs aren't ""sexy"" or flashy.  They are hard work that people are fine leaving to me.  Or why don't we see a big push for men in education?  As a former teacher, god knows that in the US we could use more balance in who is literally teaching our youth.   But that job isn't flashy, so no one really cares about having equality there, even though we really should.

I fully believe we should be making sure students know all of the options that are out there, but not pushing them in a specific way for optics sake.

But its just more sexy to say ""we need more women in STEM"", but the reality is, these people want to see more women there for their own desires.

Edit:  Lots of good conversation here.  There were many very good comments that explored the ""why"", without really changing my view.  I understand history, power, etc.  That doesn't change the fact that we aren't trying to get more men in positions like teaching (which I think is extremely important in society, even if the respect isn't there) at nearly the same rates, and a lot of it has to do with the prestige level of different careers, not really the equality aspect.  So while very few people actually changed a view, I do want to say I appreciate the responses.  

Also, I probably should have specified that by society, I meant the United States, not worldwide. 

Finally, I wasn't trying to diminish anyone's actual experiences.  We all have experienced things differently.  But I've worked both in tech and education, and I will say the differences in where they want to ""diversify"" are striking. "

I've seen their results and sometimes they're very cool. AFAIK, the human input into these programs is to add a text prompt and possibly alter some sliders. Then the AI spits out dozens/hundreds of images it generates and you pick the few you like best.

I have no problem with this as a hobby, a toy, a creativity tool, whatever. And I'm aware it's not going away and will only get better. But I don't think any AI-based ""artist"" can reasonably call themselves the true creator of the piece, and I find it genuinely bizarre when someone takes credit for something made on midjourney or whatever. 

To my mind, it's no different than typing your text prompt into Deviantart and claiming credit for the top five or six results. Perhaps you altered some sliders or used some creative instinct when you curated its offerings, but this is not ""creating art"". It's picking out art. Maybe they're ""yours"" in a legal sense, but you are not the author. The AI is.

I've heard the analogy to photoshop before, as if AI is ""just another tool"". And I suppose it is. But it's a tool that makes art FOR you, not WITH you. It's not a paintbrush, it's a hand. And not YOUR hand either. A hand attached to a robot brain that will take your suggestions but ultimately is the true author of whatever comes out the other end.

To me, the ""male"" restroom symbol (🚹︎) is sufficiently gender neutral since it doesn't point to any specific fashion norms (female=skirt, male=tuxedo), and is also sufficiently universal since able bodied humans should have all the appendages mentioned in the symbol. 

The primary arguments against I can see are easily countered: 

1) The ""Male"" Restroom Symbol is ingrained into society as being associated with a specific gender. While this is true, it doesn't mean that we cannot change it. The current Male/Female symbols for instance, is a fairly recent phenomenon, starting to appear in the 1960s. 

2) The ""Male"" Restroom Symbol is ableist: This I agree, but the key message we are trying to convey is that the restroom is all-gender. I do agree that a handicapped symbol could be an addition to this if the bathroom is indeed accessible, but even then, I would argue that a wheelchair that is currently used is ableist since it discriminates against people with other accessibility needs and are not on wheelchairs."

To start off: I do not advocate for mockery of her death and do not think it was a good thing, but I also stand by my original comment. A couple days ago I sent a comment saying that we shouldn't really care about her death, and obviously I got bombed. I am not certain if its because its actually a bad take or people were just emotional, but the original comment was this: I might be bombed for this, its a hit im willing to take, why do we fucking care? The queen died. So? She was born into a life so rich that its beyond most peoples comprehension, she had a life so good that to many people it would be considered utopia. She had her amazing life, do we still need to suck her off in death? Why care about her more than the person that died just while you were reading this comment, because he wasn't rich beyond imagination? Cant we at least have her be equal in death, seeing as she clearly had a major advantage in life. Let the people close to her mourn her. Don't make rude comments and jokes, but don't suck off her dead body.

The overall statement being why should we care that she died if we don't care whenever anyone dies? Caring about someone who died strictly because of their money and power seems terrible. Like I said in my original comment, shouldn't we all at least be equal in death?"
1,2022-09-15,CMV: Thin cut French Toast is superior to Thick cut French Toast,u/doesntgetthepicture,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xf0hq8/cmv_thin_cut_french_toast_is_superior_to_thick/,changemyview,"Good french toast is dependent on both the bread and the custard used.  Science tells us that a sturdy bread is needed to make french toast.  A richer slightly sweeter sturdy bread like Brioche or Challah I find are the best, but Sourdough or French bread are both sturdy enough to manage the custard.  You can't just use any old bread, especially if it's apt to fall apart in the custard.  Savory breads will clash with the flavor profile of the custard, so whole grain, or herbed or seeded breads are out. 

The fact that it needs to be able to stand up to the custard, and mesh with the sweeter creamy flavor profile of the custard, to me, means that it's the custard that really defines the french toast.  We choose a bread for the custard, and not make a custard to fit the bread.

Given that the custard is so important, and is what defines the flavor and experience, a good french toast will be soaked all the way through.  It needs to be soaked all the way through to get that rich creamy goodness in every bite.

Thick cut french toast (by which I mean any slice cut thicker than an inch - though an inch is pushing the outer most limit) can't and won't soak through.  No matter how stale the bread is (and stale bread is the best for french toast since it's able to soak up more custard) a thick cut will just be dry bread in the middle. 

Which is why a thinner cut (preferably 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick) is superior to a thick cut.  A thinner cut soaks all the way through, and delivers a greater flavor and mouth feel experience.

*Edit: I have awarded a delta because it's been pointed out that the bread will soak through if you give it long enough.  I am amending while it is physically possible, I have not once in my 42 years of life experienced anyone, be it in a home cooking situation, or at a restaurant (especially at a restaurant) give it the required time.  Thus making thick cut french toast inferior due the amount of time it takes to soak all the way through.  The fact that it is so rarely done, on a large scale of everyone making french toast, thick cut will still, by and large, be dry in the middle.

On a side note, I do feel silly for insisting that it's impossible for it to soak all the way through, as if physics goes out the window when making french toast."

Things that serve no purpose except a threat to the existence of humans, nations and ultimately humanity itself. 

Though I believe it's a fairly accepted and popular opinion, I have heard some arguments in favour of WMDs. The main one being that the creations and purpose of these weapons is based mainly on deterrence not actual use, and i disagree. We have in a span of 70 years, already used these weapons of multiple occasions. And a system with a potential to wipe out nations, and even humanity itself in a matter of hours and days, is nothing but worthless danger, no matter how small the probability of use at any instant, if it happens the subsequent probability of destruction is very very high. 

A same argument stemming from this is that these weapons stop wars. But do they? Maybe yes maybe no, but keeping wars in check in the present, with the possibility of occurrence of an event (no matter how miniscule the probability) that might ensue a destruction at unimaginable scale in future is idiotic at best.

Also this technology through spread is now out in the open, in the hands of tyrants such as Putin and Kim Jong Un, who in the face of their own adversity have the power to wipe of everything by the click of a button. Any such power, even in the hands of wisest of women and men is dangerous, let alone tyrants. 

My views are pertinent to WMDs, not the technology behind them. Per say development of nuclear technology is pivotal in meeting the energy needs of modern day society. Use of some chemicals is essential to many industries which were previously used as chemical weapons. My view is specifically concerned with the destructive use of the said technologies."

Not anymore. Now I accept my fate. I have come to accept the fact that there is nothing in this life that is better than consuming information on the internet.

The internet has endless interesting information to offer me. I love reading interesting things and seeing interesting stuff. The internet offers me exactly that. It has endless interesting experiences which I would never have been able to see had I not been an internet addict. Because of the internet, I have been able to see more than 99.99% of people who have ever lived on this earth. Isn't that worth something?

I barely even feel human anymore. I feel like an omniscient, all-knowing being that has matured and transcended beyond the human experience and lived a thousand lifetimes already. Spending one evening on reddit, I can read about the life experiences of hundreds of people. I can read about their life regrets, their advice, their relationships, their scariest and most interesting experiences, their career choice happiness, etc. I can also watch the most incredible human feats online, whether it be out-skiing an avalanche, skydiving without a parachute, surfing the biggest wave ever, and those things don't even scratch the surface. I know that there is so much more the internet can offer me. I will not be satisfied ever, I exist only to read more interesting facts, to watch more interesting videos, to consume everything the world has to offer, but through my blue light screen in the safety and comfort of my own room.

Why would I ever be interested in growing my own personal mundane, generic, stereotypical cliche life experiences? Boring! Because of the internet, I've ""been there, done that"" already (even though I actually haven't ""been there and done that""). There's no point in doing those things myself when so many before me have already done them, to no avail. Life goes on, the earth continues to spin, the flowers continue to bloom, and and so on. When I scroll the internet, I am seeing the best of the best the world has to offer, given to me on a silver platter for easy and limitless consumption. How could real life boring experiences ever hold a candle to complex algorithms that scratch my human thirst for information in precisely the right way?

Just one example: With the internet, I can be in Bali one second and Prague the next. I can tour the Palace of Versailles for 5 minutes and then I can click through the streets of Barcelona. I can effectively see all the best the world has to offer, the result of thousands of years of human history, all from the safety and comfort of my own screen. Going there wouldn't be that different. We all know that vacations always end eventually, and when you're back it feels as if you never went at all.

I have read plenty of books (fiction and nonfiction) earlier in my life, but why would I read books now? It takes so much time, I can just read a summary online and get the gyst of it. You see, reading books, though better for your attention span and less dopamine-frying, is actually just another form of consumption, that doesn't actually get you anywhere in the long run. It's less effective; for me, the opportunity cost of reading a book is consuming a vast variety of tons of different interesting facts and information on the internet that truly broaden my perspective. And the broader my perspective gets, the more I realize that there is nothing better than scrolling."

3,2022-09-15,CMV: It is impossible to have the hero character be proactive.,u/xSwaferx,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xf7ugf/cmv_it_is_impossible_to_have_the_hero_character/,changemyview,"A recent topic that has been my focus is how villains are much more liked than the hero. One reason is that the heroes are reactive while the villains are proactive, which suggests that the hero needs to be more proactive to change this.

However, I feel that it's impossible for a hero character to do that, based on the role of the hero itself. When I think of a hero character, a hero is usually the classic save/protect the day/girl/town etc type. The one that usually stops the criminals. Yet, if there are no criminals to fight, then they're not really needed.

I'm not saying that a hero character can't have other interests or goals, I just doubt that those other interests and goals would be enough to make the hero character proactive -if it can make them a proactive hero at all. And I feel like any additions like drama and romance or something, while may add depth to the *character* who is the hero, might not do anything to advance the *hero part* of the character.

&amp;#x200B;

I want this change this because I find that reason as to why people don't like heroes as much to be generally disappointing (and the idea that the majority of people would like the villain more than the hero character in general, but that's for another conversation), as I feel like it's possible for that to be not true, for the hero to be a proactive force in *their* story, but I can't think of a way to make the hero proactive.

&amp;#x200B;

Note:

* A Hero is *different* from a protagonist. A protagonist is just someone who is the main character, while a hero is someone who is the good guy. It is possible for a [villain to be a protagonist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist) and [vice versa](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist).
* This is not a bash on villains or antagonists at all, in fact, it is hypocritical of me if that were the case. This is coming from someone that is, admittedly, an amateur in writing but is passionate about not only trying to bring something refreshing but still enjoyable for the audience and myself.

**Edit**: this video brings context to my point of interest: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKJQvyWTqh4&amp;t=589s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKJQvyWTqh4&amp;t=589s)And this Reddit comment specifically from a post about the growing trend of people loving villains more:[https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/etxyl0/comment/ffja9aw/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/etxyl0/comment/ffja9aw/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

**Edit 2:** Should've given examples on the hero type I meant, as there are a lot of those that I completely forgot that I know well enough yet didn't think off the top of my head (ex. Batman) or those that I don't really know well enough (ex. Frodo from Lord of the Rings, the protagonist from Mistborn series, etc.)

When I think of classic hero archetypes, I'm thinking of characters like Spiderman, Harry Potter, Flash(?) etc. Admittedly, some were more anime/manga-focused typed -Deku from MHA, Makoto from Danganronpa etc- because that is some of the examples mentioned more.

On an unrelated note, wasn't expecting the rapid responses, so I'm a bit overwhelmed. My apologies for the slow responses."

A well observed phenomenon is childhood amnesia, where adults can't recall clearly what happens episodically before age 8.  Children at the age of 5 are not ready on any level to sit relatively quietly for 7 hours a day learning.  In fact, the reason for schooling at this early age is more to do with the parents needing state provided childcare at that age than any educational benefit to the child.  My view is that it would be much better to have the children remain at home until at least the age of 7.  At this age they would not be isolated but meet and play with children in their own community of all ages.  The state would give enough subsidy to at least one parent to be able to provide and care for the child without working.  The state would also provide subsidized enrichment activities, including free admission to zoos, museums, etc.  The state would also hire and provide trained early childhood education specialists and psychologists for children who require more assistance than a parent could provide, though I think the vast majority of parents would have their children reading, writing, and with knowledge of basic mathematics.
Children should start school between 8 and 10, and not divided by age but knowledge and ability.  Waiting until this age would allow for children to look at topics more maturely and eliminate the need for repetition and teaching such simplified concepts that they are incorrect, like current glosses of early elementary history that have to be erased and changed later in the education of a child.  Children would also mature in school.  If a person spent 13 compulsory years at school, a figure that wouldn't change, a person wouldn't leave school until they are 21, more mature physically and emotionally and capable of making the adult decisions like enrolling in college or joining the army 18 years old are now expected to do.

One counter I foresee is a claim of children need socialization.  My preemptive rebuttal:

Socialization:  I think this is odd to attribute to schools, since it differs so greatly from ordinary life.  In the first place much of school is not about allowing children to socialize.  A child will be told to stop talking to his friends much more often then they will be told to socialize.  Perhaps an hour or so is given to lunch and recess, less time they would outside of a school.  In addition this socializing is quite odd, never again in your life will you be expected to socialize with people of your exact age."

The article was heavily biased against them so if they did get banned for saying something racist I think they would’ve mentioned that but it didn’t which leads me to believe Twitter just banned it based on the content alone. 

Many people seem to be going based on the premise that by race switching a character you are racist. This is hypocritical to me because Ariel has always been a pale ginger fish woman. So is it racist that Disney switched her to be black for some reason or is it racist that people switch her back to her historical form. What about this makes it racist? Before reading on I want you to think about what makes it racist and what justification Twitter would have to ban the guy based on the content.

Now going off the idea that it is somehow racist to change the race of characters, we’d need to think about the consistency. To me this would mean reimagining a character as a woman or a man is sexist as well. 

If we are to accept these premises, then we’d have to think about how to apply them consistently since obviously we want to eliminate prejudice as much as possible.

So if it’s not alright to switch Ariel we must also say it’s not right to switch any other character. I’ve seen a ton of good art that reimagined characters as different races and sexes than they would be and we’ve all seen them. Like black Aang, or those animes that or the office characters changed to the opposite gender. I think the most popular and probably most questionable (going by the premise) is changing Jesus to be black.

This would mean to me that any sharing of art of this nature would need to result in a ban from Twitter since it would be prejudice. But this is problematic to me because I think being able to reimagine a character with different features or change a character to be more accurate to how they’d look based on previous iterations is just a form of art and not inherent racism.

*I will say that Jesus being reimagined as white is racist to me because that’s what it’s based on

Edit: I also want to add that I believe anyone can be prejudice and how privileged or oppressed they are doesn’t change that"

0,2022-09-16,CMV: Homeless people are less clean and more likely to have addiction/mental health issues. Putting them in vacant hotel rooms makes no sense,u/ICuriosityCatI,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xfk4wa/cmv_homeless_people_are_less_clean_and_more/,changemyview,"There are some times that I read something in the news and it just baffles me. 

Most recently I've been seeing articles about putting homeless people in vacant hotel rooms. Not vacant hotels, vacant hotel *rooms.* 

I'll admit, I think the idea makes some amount of sense if you're just looking at vacant hotel rooms vs people who need a place to stay. Thousands of homeless people, thousands of vacant hotel rooms. The problem is, despite recent attempts to reduce stigma around homelessness (calling them unhoused for example) there are some harsh realities about homeless people. 

First, they are dirtier. It sounds mean, but it is true, homeless people are not able to wash themselves as much as non homeless people and are more likely to spread disease as a result. Not because they are biologically different, but because  they aren't able to wash themselves. On top of lacking access to facilities, many homeless people are not even in the right headspace to be able to take care of themselves hygiene wise. Which ties into my next point. 

Second, they are more likely to have mental illnesses, some of which lead to violence. Some homeless people are incredibly peaceful (albeit many of the peaceful ones still aren't in their right mind) but there are a lot of violent ones too. And even the peaceful ones are often not in their right minds. Putting them in a community of people who are seems odd to me. 

Third, which ties into the second-because of their addictions and their states of mind they often leave biohazards around like used needles. ""Think of the children"" is a cliche, but it's true that there are families with young children staying in hotels. It's going to be a problem if drug addicted homeless people leave their needles around, as many drug addicted homeless people tend to do. But that ranks pretty far down on my list of objections because I think it's relatively unlikely that a young child pricks themselves with a used syringe. 

In my view the city needs to build more homeless shelters and transfer homeless people living in tents to the shelters that currently exist. One of the problems- and this in itself shows how detached from society many homeless people are- is that many homeless people don't want to live in shelters and prefer to live in a tent under an overpass, despite not being legally permitted to do so. This shows a clear lack of care about social norms, which makes me question how these homeless people would act in a community setting like a hotel. 

Also, I think it's on the city not on the landowners to fix the issues. The city shouldn't be burdening landowners because they can't be bothered, can't figure out how to address the issues. 

I also don't know all the specifics, but it seems unlikely that if a homeless person were staying in a hotel they would be forced to be in their room at all times. It seems like amenities, if the hotel offers them, would be unsanitary if a homeless person were to use them. 

The goal in my view is not to keep homeless people out of society, the goal is to get them the help they need and then integrate them back into society. But putting them in a hotel is putting them back into society with others before they are ready. 

I don't hate the homeless. Most are nice enough (although many of the nice ones are also insane) and I cannot imagine how difficult it is to be homeless. On the other hand I recognize that being homeless affects a person and/or they are homeless in the first place because of other issues and those issues need to be addressed before integrating them back into society. 

That's my view. I am of course open to changing it and I don't know all of the particulars of these plans."

So I decided to challenge this idea, and see any shortcomings that my argument has.

&amp;#x200B;

1. We cannot decide who **truly** deserves to die. As intelligent and wonderful the human mind is, we are not God, and thus we do not know everything, much less morals, so we cannot decide who is worthy of death or torture.
2. Morality is inherently subjective. Along with our lack of knowledge on many things, we also have many disagreements on the subject of morality, because morality is inherently subjective since it is a human idea, not a product of the Universe.
3. No one is inherently good or evil. Many people are hated for their despicable acts, and many people are celebrated for their benevolence, but a look into their backstory will show us that the people we despise and praise are not Satan or Jesus. For example, Hitler is one of the most hated people in the history of Earth, and nothing can justify the horrible actions he has done to millions of people, but a look into his younger years will reveal that he was once just another kid living in a sad time. He loved his mother and siblings dearly, had a passion for art, made postcards for people, and volunteered to defend Germany in WW1. He has done many good until...well, you already know that part of history. Now let's take a look at Gandhi. Gandhi has done many good for fighting against discrimination and for the liberation of India, but **supposedly**, he was very racist when he was young, and it was only when he visited South Africa that he has changed his racist views after facing heavy discrimination and racism from many people. Hitler and Gandhi, along with everyone else who has ever existed, is not as benevolent as Jesus, or as evil as Satan, they are, like you and me, just humans.

&amp;#x200B;

That is my argument as to why no one deserves to be killed or to be deliberately harmed. What do you all think?"

0,2022-09-16,cmv: Driving at exactly the speed limit on the leftmost lane should be OK,u/jpdesdeny,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xfsv8y/cmv_driving_at_exactly_the_speed_limit_on_the/,changemyview,"I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I honestly think I’m right and the ones that are wrong are the tailgating psychos and maniacs flashing their headlights. No offense. Hear me out.

1. The speed limit is there for a reason. Whether it’s because of the quality of the road, the usual traffic, or the sharpness of the bends, it’s the maximum speed at which it is safe (and legal) to drive. Braking distance and controlling the car if you blow a tire make it a bit of a Russian roulette to drive over it.

2. What’s actually illegal in most places I know is tailgating (not respecting the safety distance from the car ahead of you) which is what most of these people who are in a hurry do.

3. So, add to the tailgating the flashing lights which can be unsettling can make the driver of the slow car nervous and cause an accident.

4. Changing lanes in general is also less safe than staying put, especially when rushed to do so.

5. Often times there are cars travelling on the next lane, so for me to “get out of your way” implies myself going faster than the speed limit to get safe distance from you until I find a gap. Aside from the safety aspect, this also exposes me to speeding fines (I live in a place with strict camera-enforced fines).

The only way to make the roads safer for everyone is to re-educate these aggressive drivers, and maybe a good way is to set your cruise speed to 119 on a 120km/h max road and chill.

*Edit: a couple of typos/formatting plus added the following closing thoughts...*

Thank you everyone who contributed to what I think was a healthy discussion, aside from some of the anger I knew this post would cause for some people who seem to take this very personally.

Below is some clarification of the original post above as well as reactions to the more frequent themes that came up and what I learned.

I do not usually intentionally block the left lane by driving at the speed limit or lower, as my post may have sounded. If you re-read the title and the last line you will notice the words ""should"" and ""maybe"", as some of you have.

I learned and we exchanged about some country specific laws that I did not know about, more specifically about the ""passing lane"" in the US. For context, I drove in the US for a few years, and have been driving in other 3 countries regularly as well, and of course there are some differences both in the rules/laws and people's behavior. This rule may change how I decide to drive in the US but it does not change my view, because I still think I have the right to decide to pass cars that I think are going slower than what I want to do, and **should** be ok to use the passing lane for that, while always staying within the max speed limit whatever it is. 

So, if the speed limit is 55 (sorry if too low for you, I didn't implement it) and I'm in the middle lane going 50 but run into a cluster of cars going 45, I will pass them on the passing lane at 49, which will take a bit of time and you should not bully me because I'm doing nothing wrong, unsafe or illegal. You can wait (not tailgate) and flash your lights from a safe distance if you see that I have a gap to go back to the right and I don't, or if I'm actually going under the speed limit by a lot and have plenty of space ahead on the fast lane.

I currently drive mostly in the UAE, specifically Abu Dhabi, which appears to have a very unique set of circumstances: automated speed cameras that issue speeding tickets immediately with zero tolerance, very frequent high traffic at high speeds in multiple-lane highways, frequent aggressive tailgaters no matter what speed you're going, even at or above the max speed limit, if you are on the left lane.

Note that most roads here are set to 120kmh (74mph) or 140kmh (87mph) both or which to me are not ""slow driving"" speeds or outdated limits considering new car technologies. By the way, cars may have improved but humans not so much, our ability to react to speed changes is terrible and explains the correlation between higher speeds and accidents, in my opinion.

I agree with most people who calmly explained that driving slower than others is generally unsafe and I don't typically do it and try to avoid it, except when I'm already driving at the max speed limit and if I speed up I will likely get a fine. I think I also have a right to pass who I consider slow drivers but should not be forced to drive other the max limit to do it.

The fines here for speeding up to 20km/h over the max limit are approx. U$S50 and I have spent about U$S800 in the last 12 months, all while identifying as what somebody else here called me, which I liked very much, a ""speed-limit driver"".

I know in many large cities in the US many people have long commutes to work and rush hour traffic is terrible, not fast moving probably due to the roads not having enough capacity. This can be very frustrating. But I do wonder if these aggressive drivers have ever tracked the difference in minutes between the GPS estimate when they leave vs. when they get actually get home. I bet they did not save more than 5 minutes by tailgating and rushing everyone else on the left lane out of the way. Even if those minutes are valuable to them, to me they are not worth it because driving like that is not only more unsafe but also more stressful and involved when compared to driving the same distance within the speed limit without passing many cars or changing lanes. I think they did a Mythbusters episode on this.

Conclusion: I think the solution to this as to many other things is advancements in technology. I wonder (and still need to research) whether self driving cars will ever tailgate or break the max speed limit. I hope they do not and when we all have such cars it can't be overridden. We may not get home those 5 min sooner but accidents would drop to near zero.

Or, more likely and real because there are already some applications, the new smart AI-driven traffic cameras will punish both me if I'm blocking your passing lane by driving too slow (based on the rules in that road) and you if you tailgate or change lanes without signaling or overall drive unsafely. I learned that these cameras are being installed where I live now, which may solve my problem 100% soon.

I will close with a quote from the great George Carlin who summarized the source of our disagreements perfectly: *""Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?""*"

It also isn't unprecedented, Japan did it. They have 3 (4 if you count romaji) writing systems all used together in different contexts.

And of course, there is some debate over traditional vs simplified to be had. But I think the goal here is to save space, and make writing easier for people. Saving some strokes on simplified characters probably makes sense."

Imo i would consider it art, especially when given the fact that art is fully subjective. Skill/ time invested or effort does not correlate with whether something can be viewed as art. 

It's funny how much scrutiny that AI art is facing in an abstract art subreddit considering how a common view on abstract art is ""i could have done that"" to which the reply being ""but you didn't."" I think this seriously applies when speaking on AI art as it is in infancy as a medium (atleast to my knowledge is fairly new) 

I think what we're seeing is a knee jerk reaction to a newly budding medium.  The same way digital altered photographs were not seen as art and abstract art's criticism of ""that takes no skill""

If the art community is to continue to grow and develop we can't gatekeep what is considered art. Because every single person has different definitions. Is the person who enter the prompt to generate AI art an artist?  I say it's as legitimate as anyone else who calls themselves an artist regardless of skill level. 

Personally i have enjoyed some AI generated art,  i would have found it more impressive had it been an acrylic painting but that doesn't take away from me liking the emotions the piece illicits.

i do however think it's important to label something as AI art,  if only because i feel like it can be misleading and be seen as almost stealing the art by claiming you physically created it. But that might just be a ""me"" thing."

744,2022-09-17,CMV: It’s not atheists or secularism mostly responsible for the decline of religion in the West - it’s religious (mostly Christian) people,u/Billyjoewayne,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xgexuf/cmv_its_not_atheists_or_secularism_mostly/,changemyview,"Firstly, to clarify I consider myself a religious person, which might sound odd considering that the subject of my viewpoint is about other religious people and the harm they are doing to religion. My grandparents were all deeply religious. I remember praying the rosary with my pop as a child and him explaining the prayers. My siblings and I attended Catholic school. I was even excited to be confirmed as I got to choose another name. I prayed every night for God to protect my family. Hopefully, this establishes my credentials as a religious person.

How am I able to show that I’m open to changing my opinion? Well in my twenties I became an atheist. I’ll come back to this later. Then in my thirties my faith was renewed and I rebuilt a relationship with God again.

Now I hear and read a lot from religious people that religion, particularly Christianity, is declining in the West due to things such as secularism and atheism. But I think they‘re only minor causes. I believe the number one reason for the decline of religion is religious people themselves. 

Now I don’t include myself in this personally for one good reason - I am a progressive libertarian. Part of that means that I do not believe religion should be forced upon others. That is a denial of individual liberty. I am also aware how that puts me at odds with conservative religious people. So for example, with all the events happening in the USA with abortion laws, regardless of my own opinion, I believe that type of government intervention is also a denial of individual rights. I wouldn’t like to live in any kind of theocracy, so I would never give that a pass, not even a Christian one. I also think all the people that support it are basically driving people away from Christianity rather than saving it. They are oppressors and inquisitors. Then there are other things such as pedophilia in the Catholic Church and the Church’s role in covering it up, which is just outright evil.

From a more personal perspective, there have been a litany of religious people that I have met that have said and done terrible things. The priest who told my mother that her unborn babies would go to hell. The nuns that used to beat my brother for being left handed and may have been responsible for his dyslexia. The seemingly nice old lady who told me God makes African children starve because they worship heathen gods. These people think they’re doing the lord’s work. Religious family members and friends who were disgusted by my gay friends and cousins. To me though these people are walking billboards advertising against religion because if they’re the ‘good guys’ then I can see how neutral or unsure people would be driven to atheism. Edit: It’s what happened in my case.

  
That’s not to say that there are no good religious people. There are. Plenty of them. I know them. But I don’t think a person’s worth is based solely on their religious devotion (something that some religious people do). There are good and bad Christians and muslims just like there are good and bad atheists. But I also think that the voices and actions of good religious people are drowned out by self righteous judgmental religious (for lack of a better word) assholes.

So change my mind. Convince me that it’s not religious people causing the decline of religion in the West. I look forward to your responses.

Edit: I just want to clarify a bit further. I agree that atheists pull people from religion. But I believe that bad religious people push people away and that’s the greater force because humans are more so driven by the negative, personal and emotional than the analytical or the good. So to the atheists who are responding, please reply on those grounds rather than just repeating that ‘God doesn’t exist’.

Edit: Probably the argument that is most convincing so far is that there are greater support networks for people to leave religions today than in the past. So yes people are pushed out by bad religious role models but now they have a place to land. Someone in this thread compared it to domestic abuse. Victims need a safe place to go to escape abusers. That to me is an argument on personal and emotional lines."

44,2022-09-17,CMV: 'noun-self'/xenopronouns aren't going to stick around in the same way other neopronouns have,u/Amekyras,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xgiaj9/cmv_nounselfxenopronouns_arent_going_to_stick/,changemyview,"First off, I'm coming at this assuming a couple of things:

* Most people, when interacting with trans people, will try and use the correct pronouns
* Singular they is mostly accepted
* Neopronouns like ze/hir or fae/faer or somewhat accepted (I know it's much less than singular they or binary pronouns, there's like a sliding scale of acceptance)

My problem is, I can't see people using nouns like kitten or vamp(ire) as pronouns being a thing that sticks around or becomes widely accepted in language. This isn't because of people thinking 'oh weird kids on tumblr are being weird kids on tumblr again and calling themselves vamp' (though that's obviously a factor), it's because it defeats the point of a pronoun - to replace a noun and make writing/speech easier. For example:

'Amekyras went to the shops. Amekyras put ingredients for the cake Amekyras was going to make into Amekyras' basket. Amekyras then paid with Amekyras' debit card and put the ingredients in Amekyras' bag.'

Sounds a bit clunky, no? Whereas:

'Amekyras went to the shops. She put ingredients for the cake she was going to make into her basket. She then paid with her debit card and put the ingredients in her bag.'

sounds far more natural.

Noun-self pronouns are effectively just taking a nickname (like kitten) and acting like it's a pronoun, it seems just as clunky as using a name, like I did in the first example.

'Amekyras went to the shops. Kitten put ingredients for the cake kitten was going to make into kitten's basket. Kitten then paid with kitten's debit card and put the ingredients in kitten's bag.'

I don't have a problem with using them, but I just don't think they're pronouns, and I don't think they're going to stay."

1032,2022-09-17,"CMV: Men seeking therapy is seen as a great thing, but in practice it leads to complex consequences.",u/Acrobatic-Clothes248,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xgj43x/cmv_men_seeking_therapy_is_seen_as_a_great_thing/,changemyview,"At first glance, if a guy admits he has mental health issues and wants to manage them, and says he is going to therapy or taking medication, you will see an universally positive reaction on the internet. And as studies have shown and will continue to show, people seeking therapy and being in touch with their emotions will lead a happier and more fulfilled life, regardless of their gender. You'll be constantly told you are a human being, nobody is perfect and that talking to a therapist to seek your path and try to learn to love yourself is the thing to do.

But... in practice, things are much more complicated. Men are reclutant to seek therapy. And I don't think it's because of ""toxic masculinity"" teaching them that they are supposed to be strong. 

I sought therapy for three years and plan to go back in October. But I'm very afraid of actually admitting this to everyone besides some family members. At least where I live, men seeking therapy are, in practice, seen as ""less of a man"" by the vast majority of people, no matter if they are just whining about their problems or admitting they have issues and they are working to manage them. 

This leads to my next point - the lack of a social net to catch you when you fall. For many men, going to therapy is only a partial solution, and even having mental health issues in the first place traps them into a catch-22 situation where if they don't open up, they are slowly disintegrating on the inside, and if they do open up, they are quickly put back in their place by their peers and told to ""man up"". Therapy is never going to be a full replacement for having friends and family you can open up to. Women and the LGBT community have somewhat solved this problem. 

Going for a drink with your peers honestly is not enough. Some guys certainly do react in a more emotional matter under the influence of alcohol, but at least from what I've seen, their peers do not empathize with them, but rather just tell them ""it seems like you're drunk haha"". Those are not people you can safely share your emotions to. If admitting weaknesses and sharing emotions are part of a great friendship, then finding a good friend as a man is incredibly hard. Often it's because you're not emotional yourself, at other times because your friend is not emotional and doesn't want to appear weak - and so on. 

I've also read stories of men who have opened up to their peers, and while at first everyone was empathetic and was there for him, these guys later said after that moment, those same people were slowly distancing themselves from him. Of course, you can easily say that ""those are not your friends"", but the problem is systemic, and dozens of years of male actors showing emotion in movies haven't been enough to also extend this idea to our society.

In January 2020, Linus Sebastian, the owner of the Linus Tech Tips channel, considered retiring from Youtube. The comments on his video were very supportive and empathetic. But those people failed to convince society that this cannot be turned into a meme, and in the weeks coming up, memes with a clearly sad Linus face were literally everywhere in social media. Later that year, the same thing happened with Will Smith after Jada cheated on him, and he was visibly emotional on an interview. Again, he was turned into a meme.

What does this tell young men? That showing emotions can literally turn you into a meme. Both of those incidents were from 2020, not from the 1800s or something. You can't tell me everyone's mentality has changed within the last two years. Especially with Andrew Tate being everywhere on social media today.

And speaking of the young, while society has proposed teaching young boys that it's okay to cry and show emotions because we are all humans, in practice you're probably setting up your boy to be bullied. This has happened to me, and I'm early Gen Z... I'm not sure how much things have changed in the last few years.

TL:DR Society cannot seem to be comfortable with men in need of help. They either seem to turn this into a MRA stuff and therefore attributed to that ""what about the men??"" thinking, they think men are not expected to show emotions and tell them to man up, or they appear empathetic at first glance but then slowly distance themselves from that guy, giving fuel to the same idea. I'm not saying that a guy showing emotions is doomed... but he often seems to have therapy as his only option. But guys going to therapy in the first place are being seen as less of a man. Then what can he do? Drink alcohol? Watch manosphere videos?"

In this topic of conversation as people argue what buy out was beneficial to the gamer community as a whole and what buy out was harmful.  I understand that no on likes exclusivity because no one wants to miss out on a game that catches their eye.  But people that spout the idea that all exclusivity is the same are just absolute idiots of the highest order.

&amp;#x200B;

Like everything (with few exception) in the world there are degrees of everything.  Punching someone in the face and giving them a black eye is assaulting someone and that is bad. But picking up brick and smashing it against their face breaking bones in their face and causing their brain to bounce around inside their skull is also assaulting someone and is much worse.  Both are assaulting someone but one is clearly worse then the other and as a result carries different penalties in the justice system.  Game exclusivity is no different with different forms having differing effects with one being worse then the other.

&amp;#x200B;

Broadly speaking there are 2 kinds of exclusivity

&amp;#x200B;

**Permanent Exclusivity**\-  These games never leave the platform they were created on either because their creator owns the platform or a deal is made with said platform creator. Or they simply can't be ported to another platform due to other issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Real Time Strategy games often have this problem of transitioning the PC mouse and keyboard based interface into something that can be used with a controller and their limited button options.

&amp;#x200B;

**Temporary Exclusivity**\- These games will be on one platform for a period of time before being released to others. This can be a result of a deal between the publisher/developer and the platform creator. Or simply a result of a lack of funding/manpower to release the game to all platforms at once and so they stagger the release allowing each new platform release to help pay to port it to the next one in line.  The only limitation is if the platform is capable of actually running the game.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The effects of permanent exclusivity are clear. You wanna play the new Pokemon game? You best have a Nintendo Switch.  You want to play God of War you best have a PlayStation console or a PC. You want to play a Halo game you best have an Xbox or a PC.  If you don't have the right platform you are fucked forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Temporary exclusivity however is very different. You didn't have a PS5 when Death-loop was released you have to wait. But it will still be released on PC and Xbox. The only reason a Switch port might not have happened is simply due to the hand held nature and age of the Switch making porting a game build around the PS5/SX/PC very difficult to such old hardware.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes you are inconvenience if you have a Series X/S console having to wait to play the game. But that is all that it ever is or ever will be.  An inconvenience and a temporary one at that. A great example to show how long term effect of it is the Mass Effect Trilogy.  Mass Effect 1 and 2 were temporary exclusives with the 1st game releasing in 2007 for 360, 2008 for PC and 2012 for PS3.  The 2nd game released for the 360 and PC in 2010 and 2011 for PS3.  Only the final game in the trilogy released for all systems at the same time releasing in 2012 for PC, 360, PS3 and Wii U.

&amp;#x200B;

2012 and beyond no one who was already a fan or was new to the series after hearing about it from friends or from forums gave a rat's ass that the previous games were exclusive.  No one cared because everyone could enjoy the game and play it as many times as they wanted.  It has all of the impact of some kid in 2022 sitting in a history class and learning that people 2,000 years ago used urine to clean their teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

Yet despite the clear differences in the two they still cling to the same ""they are both the same"" argument. These people are idiots because they only look at the similarities and refuse to look at the differences."

0,2022-09-17,CMV: The Amish are doing it right,u/idrinkkombucha,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xgkzex/cmv_the_amish_are_doing_it_right/,changemyview,"I am mainly comparing the lifestyle of first world countries like America to the Amish. So many people are quick to laugh at the Amish. You’ve done it, probably. I’ve done it too. Once, I saw an Amish family washing their clothes in a river while on a road trip through the country. My friend and I made a forgettable joke.

But, we are the real joke, and the Amish are laughing at us!

We see ourselves as superior to the Amish because of our education, technology, careers, and lifestyle, but let’s take a moment and examine what’s really going on.

Our education is overpriced knowledge, a lot of which is biased and vain. If you’re in a STEM major, you’re less likely to run into this, but all the other majors - especially the liberal arts - are bloated with nonsense and wacky theories, most of which are unverifiable (looking at you, psychology).

Most of our education and careers focus on increasing efficiency. We need better cars to take us to work faster, and we work to bring better technology so we can have faster cars. As an example.

But let’s stop and think about what we really want. Deep down, most of us hope to have a meaningful and positive existence. A good life. And yet, the depression rate is skyrocketing in first world countries like America. Are we truly finding satisfaction and meaning in our higher education, flashy technology, and professional careers? Maybe some of us. But many people are left burnt out and wondering, when am I supposed to feel like I’m living?

As a personal example, a few years back I went on a backpacking trip. When preparing, you only pack the bare minimum. I had no phone, no wallet, nothing I didn’t need. A few days into the trip, I was sitting in a field with some other backpackers, chatting and eating beef jerky when it hit me: I didn’t know what time it was. I wasn’t busy checking my phone for texts, wondering when I had to get to work, scattered and scrambling to get things done. I felt peaceful, content. I had everything I needed - sunshine, food, company. 

Life is a lot simpler than we make it. We live in a culture that sells the idea that we need things to be happy, and then when we get the promotion or the new car, we might feel a rush, but soon enough we’re wondering why we can’t find satisfaction and we’re off chasing the next thing we think we need.

The Amish live like I did on the backpacking trip. No, they don’t have a lot of education or technology, but what does it matter if their lives are better? They are content living simple lives of honest work, community, and innocent recreation."

The opinion piece, ""[**Why we should be teaching our kids to protest**](https://ethics.org.au/why-we-should-be-teaching-our-kids-to-protest)"", was a hot topic here in Australia a few months ago. Similar to [another CMV post of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/vpf9vm/cmv_the_debating_skills_we_are_taught_in_high/), I've been wanting to make a CMV on this topic for quite some time now, and that recent political events made it easier for me to highlight my point.

# Political events that highlight my point

The recent political event in question is the death of Queen Elizabeth II and accession of King Charles III. My brother has been sending me Viber messages showing that everyday Australians are worried about a republic being a worse system of government, that a republic referendum would be a waste of money and that [60% of Australians are now monarchists](https://www.roymorgan.com/findings/a-resounding-majority-of-australians-want-to-retain-the-monarchy-rather-than-become-a-republic). He is doing this to make me admit that I am wrong to support the concept of a republic. However, even from a republican standpoint, we need to acknowledge that because some people on our side are making insensitive comments, it is discrediting our side - here are some examples:

* [Aboriginal activist says the Queen's death is a time to rejoice: 'We can’t mourn something that has colonised us for so many generations'](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11202331/Aboriginal-activist-Gwenda-Stanley-says-Queens-death-time-rejoice.html)

It doesn't matter if you agree with the assertions of those activists and politicians - [republicanism in Australia lost in 1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Australian_republic_referendum) and we'd lose again if we keep up this terrible political manoeuvring. In contrast, current prime minister Anthony Albanese, [who is a republican himself](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/27/two-step-plebiscite-is-only-way-australia-could-be-a-republic-malcolm-turnbull-says), has a better understanding of the political manoeuvring needed for the republican side to win - he knows it's an inappropriate time for a republic referendum, [so he will wait for an appropriate time](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/12/albanese-says-inappropriate-to-discuss-republic-now-but-doesnt-rule-out-future-referendum), even if that means that it won't happen in his first term. My brother says that my emphasis on political manoeuvring is ""Machiavellian"" and ""Hobbesian"" - but regardless of where you stand on republicanism vs monarchism, would the republican side be more likely to win by:

* Having a referendum ASAP and protesting for a republic even during an inappropriate time (like the current mourning period for Elizabeth II)?
* Or by quietly waiting for a more appropriate time for a referendum and not saying insensitive stuff that could discredit our side?

Other political issues we've had in Australia that highlight my point include:

* The [climate wars](https://theconversation.com/climate-wars-carbon-taxes-and-toppled-leaders-the-30-year-history-of-australias-climate-response-in-brief-169545).
   * Australia was the only country to go backwards on a carbon tax, a sign of poor political manoeuvring on our side.
   * However, one of the moments of the climate wars I relished most was when TV presenter Hamish McDonald baited climate change denialist politician [Jim Molan into discrediting himself on live TV](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/04/im-not-relying-on-evidence-for-climate-change-jim-molan-angers-audience-in-new-look-qa). The best part was that Hamish McDonald wasn't even trying to attack Jim Molan - he just chose his words wisely and asked the right questions.
* BLM protests against institutional racism.
   * In Australia, BLM protests discredited themselves [because it was seen as unfair that they get to protest while there was a lockdown](https://www.smh.com.au/national/black-lives-matter-protest-was-irresponsible-and-unfair-20200607-p5508s.html).
   * BLM protests worldwide have been met with a lot of right-wing backlash, in part due to the violence and disruption associated with them. And the sad thing is, BLM wouldn't have been necessary if opponents of institutional racism made shrewd political manoeuvres to quietly fix the problem in the first place.

# Analysis of the original opinion piece

Going back to the original article ""**Why we should be teaching our kids to protest**"", it claims that the following (see quote block below) is a reason to teach kids to protest, however, I don't see how the goal of fighting corruption and maintaining democracy can't be achieved by shrewd political manoeuvring either. If anything, recent history has shown us that public discourse and intellectual virtues can lose votes by seeming elitist.

&gt;*But we do want children to learn how to protest. We want them to be able to see corruption and have discussions and heated debates and embrace complexity. Everyone should have the ability to say their piece and be heard in a democracy.* [*This is something that we’ve already recognised as persuasion is a major part of education and has been for years*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epub/10.1080/00220272.2020.1727018?needAccess=true)*.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*However, when we talk about this, we need to recognise that we aren’t just talking about skills or knowledge. This isn’t putting together a pithy response or clever tweet. It’s about being capable of contributing to public discourse, and for that, we need children to hold certain intellectual virtues and values.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*An intellectual virtue refers to the way we approach inquiry. An intellectually virtuous citizen is someone who approaches problems and perspectives* [*with open-mindedness, curiosity, honesty and resilience*](https://mindrxiv.org/vy687/download)*; they wish to know more about it and are truth seeking, unafraid of what terrors lie in it.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*If virtues are about the willingness to engage in inquiry,* [*intellectual values are the cognitive tools needed to do so effectively.*](https://education.nsw.gov.au/content/dam/main-education/teaching-and-learning/education-for-a-changing-world/media/documents/Peter-Ellerton_Critical-Thinking.pdf) *It’s essential in conversation to be able to speak with coherence; an argument that doesn’t meaningfully connect ideas is one that is confusing at best, and manipulative at worst. If we’re not able to share our thoughts and display them clearly, we’re just shouting at each other.*

# Conclusion

To conclude, I will use the following analogies:

* You can't win a game of chess by shouting at and pleading to your opponent. Predatory animals generally would scare away their prey if they were being as loud, impatient and conspicuous as possible. These are an analogy to protesting.
* To win a game of chess, you need to make smart moves or at least bait your opponent into making bad moves. Most predatory animals use strategies like stealth, patience and entrapment to catch their prey. These are an analogy to political manoeuvring.

This is not a republic vs. monarchy post. Maybe I am indeed wrong to support a republic, but that isn't the point. The topic of this post is that we should not be teaching kids to protest, but instead teach them political manoeuvring."

Twoxchromosomes is a default sub so it shows up in my feed a lot. Most of the posts I see are complaints about men. Sometimes it's specific men and sometimes it's just all men. The comments tend to be worse.

Men are typically described as being sexist, hating women, weighing women down, being jealous of their careers, wanting women to be sex objects, being too emotionally closed off, not being emotionally closed enough and wanting their partners to be 'therapists', only having money to contribute to relationships so now that young women often have more successful careers than men they have nothing to offer, being lazy deadbeats that need 'moms', bad at sex, being dumber than women and being entirely at fault for all their and women's problems.

The consistent message is that if you're a man you should do women a favour and leave them alone because you're a burden, a jerk and probably dangerous. Given that there's plenty of lonely people on reddit, I don't see how making a sub that tells more than half of the them they deserve to be lonely is good.

I don't normally say this but, if the roles were reversed and this sub was for men complaining about women, it would be more likely to be banned than made a default sub.

I'll CMV if someone can convince me it isn't toxic or that it's toxicity is somehow good."
0,2022-09-17,CMV: I shouldn’t make friends with married people or people too career oriented,u/[deleted],https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xgozy9/cmv_i_shouldnt_make_friends_with_married_people/,changemyview,"I’m a 26yo male virgin. I think the optimal way by which I could have averted this fate is by having joined a fraternity when I was 18, but I was stupid and didn’t do that.

My career is okay. Not the best but pays the bills, and it’s not really a priority in my life, I work remotely so I meet exactly zero people from it. It’s not a priority in my life at this time. As a result I shouldn’t make friends who are too career oriented or else they will lead me astray, make me focus on career stuff to the detriment of what matters to me.

I don’t want to get married in the next five years. I see that as something which will both suck away any last opportunities I have for experimenting in my youth, and also doom me to divorce because I have no clue how I’ll actually act in relationships or what I want from them. So I should avoid married people because they will pressure me into marrying the first person I meet.

I think it’s very important to surround yourself with people you can learn from, people who are living the life you want to be living. Because in such an environment people can help you grow. Fraternities definitely would have been the best place for that. Now I think I’m too old to have the life I wish I could have had because people generally aren’t willing to mentor older people, but the least I can do is avoid clear negative influences.

And no I’m not willing to do online dating, if someone does online dating they are also a bad influence and I shouldn’t be friends with them. I want to do social circle dating."

I find it disingenuous when characters who are made for a more diverse show or movie get voiced by a white person because now it’s like “What’s even the point?” If that makes sense. But there’s always an excuse that the voice fits the character and they shouldn’t be denied roles off of race instead off of talent, and while there is some validity coming from that, I still think it’s just ethically inappropriate for a character to be voiced by somebody of a different race, take for example Al Pacino as Tony Montana, while he did play the character extraordinarily well, I can’t tell you how many Latino’s who absolutely hate his accent and wish he was played by a Cuban actor, not to say some didn’t think of the opposite. The only time when I can excuse a voice actor to play somebody of a different background  is 1 of 2 things, 1 being if they are trying to replicate a real life persons actual voice I.E Thomas Bromhead voicing Ronin in MW2019 who is based on Tu Lam. 2 being if their nationality’s/ethnicity’s country has an extremely similar accent to the characters nationality I.E Portuguese actors playing Hispanic characters.

I have lived the last two years of high school under restrictions and lockdowns (necessary, for goodness sake) because of a pandemic caused by government incompetence and petty nationalism. I have crisis after crisis slapped in my face (pandemic crisis, climate crisis, economic crisis, war in Ukraine...). The cost of living is rising, energy rationing will probably have to be done in my country. 

Honestly? Being young today sucks. There is only despair, despair and more despair. As soon as one problem ends, another problem immediately arises. I don't even know why I even bother to study since it's very likely that everything will have collapsed in 50 years and/or I'll be stuck working for decades for a pension I will never see just to enrich some rich guy.

Now it will surely come naturally to many of you to say: *well, the world had always problems*. That is true, but I think there was a relatively quiet time when the problems were small and solvable and were balanced by a number of positive aspects. Which time? 

The 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Now, I'm not stupid, they had many problems. Many. Terrorism, racism, drugs, African countries being colonized etc. etc. But you know what those times had that these times don't? Cheap housing, stable and well-paid jobs, guaranteed pensions. And you didn't even need to be an university graduate to have all of that! 

Plus, there was something called **hope** back then. Hope for a better world, hope for a better humanity. Now? Economy is fucked, climate is fucked, future is fucked and nobody wants to move a finger to improve things, at least in my country everybody seems resigned to just roll over and die.

So, honestly, I would gladly accept looping through the years from 1960 to 1999 for the rest of my life rather than having to live through another year of this bleak and horrible decade that is the 2020s, even if it means giving up the Internet and having to live with some small cons like terrorism and drugs, but which are at least small and manageable compared to the horrible messes we have to face now.

But since that is unlikely to happen, I think the way we calculate tips doesn't logically make sense.

For example - I go to a restaurant and order the most expensive meal and the table next to me gets the cheapest. If we both stay there for the same amount of time and the waiter/waitress doesn't have to do anything extra, then it doesn't make sense that my tip should be significantly higher. It would be different if the tip went to the chef, but if the wait staff treats the two tables the same, why should I pay more?

Edit: the same argument could be made for bartenders. If I go to the bar and order a pint of craft beer that has a higher ABV and costs 10x more than a pint of a cheap imported beer, why should I tip the bartender more? They are both on tap, it requires no extra effort.

I believe tips should be calculated based on the time spent in the restaurant and the service received by the waiter/waitress.

Growing up I always thought that in an ideal world skin color would not matter, it seems to me we are going in the opposite direction.

Just to be clear, I think racism sucks and I’m searching for non polarized and logic-based opinions. I must add I’m a white non-American man so I could not have a complete view on this matter."

 I’ve seen a lot of discussion over the decisions of Governor Greg Abbott, and Ron DeSantis to send immigrants from the border to sanctuary cities. While I don’t agree with the political theater, to me this seems like the most logical idea and should have been implemented years ago. 

One reason for blue collar workers becoming republicans in the southern states is because they fear losing their jobs to immigrants and international trade. 

The low-skilled labor market is over-saturated in the border states due to high levels of immigration in those areas. Dispersing immigrants across the U.S will create downward pressure on the low-skilled labor market inside the border states, which will cause the value of that labor to go up. This will result in the minimum wage and employee benefits to rise, and the overall quality of life to increase.

Also, it’s a better deal for the immigrants;

1. They get transported to a city that has programs in place to welcome and support them.

2. They won’t have to deal with xenophobia in states that don’t want more immigrants.

3. They are more likely to enter a community of their peers, so it’s easier to assimilate.

4. Less immigrants will get deported overall

It’s a win-win, and if not for the political theater, the Democratic Party would have no reason to oppose this decision.

The way I see it, it’s a classic case of do as I say not as I do. Sanctuary cities are mostly located in the northern parts of the U.S, away from the critical immigration points along the border. This largely means they don’t have to deal with the crime associated with welcoming migrants from poor countries in the global south. They likely receive skilled-workers from other OECD countries, who on average are more wealthy, and come from similar systems of governance, which makes it easier for them to assimilate.

The fewer amounts of low-skilled immigration also allows these cities to retain a higher minimum wage when compared to the border states.

TLDR; Dispersing immigration across the country is a great thing for both the immigrants and the border states. Political theater aside sanctuary cities have no reason to oppose these decisions as their cities are more tolerant and ready to accept the influx of migrants."

I believe this anger is misdirected, largely unconstructive and should actually be aimed at adblockers instead

For one YouTube doesn’t owe its viewers anything. I’m not sure if people are aware but its a business and the purpose of any business is to generate revenue. The main way they generate that revenue is through ads. Yes they can be annoying, but that’s the price for essentially getting an unlimited amount of free content. If the ads are that terrible then they also provide a paid subscription and you’ll never see them. So an increase in ads is a good decision from a business standpoint. 

But besides YouTube being a growing business, a major reason for more ads is to generate more revenue for what’s being lost on people who use adblockers. These people are getting the content for free while others are footing the bill - the bill being ads. But for some reason all the rage is directed at YouTube and not at the adblockers. To me this is like a store constantly being robbed of bread so they raise the price by $1. The customers then rage against the store for the price increase, while ignoring, sometimes even encouraging  the people who are taking the bread. You can say the store should implement better bread protection, but the real issue is the bread thieves.

So I think it’s fine to be angry about the increase in ads but the anger should be directed toward the issue of adblockers not YouTube"

130,2022-09-18,CMV: Mentioning gender is unnecessary in all but the most niche interactions and informing people of one's sex makes more sense,u/SmoughJunior,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xhfz84/cmv_mentioning_gender_is_unnecessary_in_all_but/,changemyview,"To start with some definitions: 

By gender, I mean the cultural identity that loosely related to sex as a concept, but is not inherently bound to it. I believe this understanding coincides with how businesses and the dictionary defines it, but I recognize I could be misinterpreting something.

In this case, by unnecessary I mean that it is almost wholly irrelevant to every situation and conversation I can think of.

The core reason I hold this belief is because any one gender does not inherently allow anyone to safely draw any other conclusions. I have known male-identifying gay friends and acquaintances who will often refer to each-other as she and are more comfortable with those pronouns (or at least, they appear to be;  when I asked there was a lot of good-natured teasing and very little by way of helpful education). This unreliability is, of course, far less prevalent in those that are culturally men and women (I have no idea what the gender version of ""biological male/female"" is), but when non-binary people are thrown into the mix, as I understand it one can't really derive anything specific about how one should treat them based on just that information.

Now, if there is no reliable conclusions to be drawn from gender, does that not make it a little pointless in all conversations not about gender itself? Wouldn't it simply be better to, instead of indicating one's gender on a form, simply leave it at jotting down one's pronouns? Also, since more and more forms seem to ask for gender instead of sex, isn't something being lost there? 

As I see it, your landlord doesn't necessarily need to know a nebulous facet of your cultural identity, they need to know what to call you and what kind of hygiene needs you have. I can't think of what benefit knowing your gender would provide to a tinder date, as long as they know what to call you. Meanwhile, even as a bisexual myself, I still thoroughly appreciate knowing what's between someone's legs before a date for preparation purposes. 

Even if mentioning one's sex is uncomfortable, wouldn't it be better to just leave the point unaddressed rather than use gender as an unreliable substitute?

If it helps, I'm coming from the perspective of a cisgendered man who has never been very active in LGBT spaces. As such, I fully realize I'm not exactly on the forefront of understanding in this field, and generally keep my opinions to myself. This has just always bugged me a little and I thought maybe I could learn where people are coming from.

Also, fair warning: I'm not 100% on how to award Deltas, so a little patience on that front would be greatly appreciated."

Point 1) is the ability to make institutional change (even if small) to reduce oppression, a form of institutional power? If no why would you think not?

Point 2) is yes, if I was to intentionally or unintentionally focus the institutional change on the discrimination experience by my group, would that be an (albeit small) form of institutional oppression towards other groups? For example, explicitly saying or influencing it so my groups oppression should be the focus of the majority of change. Centering disussions around how change occurs in a way most beneficial to my group, with little or space for other groups to express thiers. 

This is something I am trying to get my head around, but is a something I have been hearing more and more, as friction between different racial groups."

2051,2022-09-18,"CMV: Making Ariel black isn't a problem, but The Little Mermaid is still an extremely problematic movie for young girls to be watching",u/thehomiemoth,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xhkaup/cmv_making_ariel_black_isnt_a_problem_but_the/,changemyview,"There's a lot of uproar right now about making Ariel black in the little mermaid. Because of the backlash, which I believe to be largely racist opposition to having black characters in media, many people in response have rallied to defend the movie. However I think we are forgetting just how problematic this movie's plot is.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's recall: the movie is about a *16 year old girl*, who sees a man without speaking a word to him, decides she is in love with him, gives up her entire life and *gives up her voice* and has to make him fall in love with her *without even speaking to him*. 

&amp;#x200B;

At one point Ursula says, ""The men up there don't like a lot of blabber... They dote and swoon and fawn on a lady who’s withdrawn. It's she who holds her tongue who gets her man.” Which would be a fine thing for the villain to say, if she was proven wrong in the end. But she isn't! Ariel gets the guy by being silent and not saying a single word. Prince Eric's love for her is essentially, based entirely on lust. It basically tells little girls that their only value is what they look like.

&amp;#x200B;

In the movie, giving up your ability to speak so a man you don't know anything about will find you attractive turns out to be a good decision for the main character. This seems to be a hopelessly misogynistic message. So while I support increased representation in media, the Little Mermaid is a poor vessel for doing so because its message is so problematic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, it is possible that they will change the plot of the movie, but they would essentially have to change the entire conflict of the central plot (Ariel's inability to speak) to make it work. Given how engrained the misogyny is to the plot itself, it seems extremely difficult to do so."

Of course this can cause a situation where they are the only one to clean: if they think the place should be cleaned every 3 days and everyone else every 4 days, if they clean every 3 days nobody else is going to clean because they will never consider the place dirty enough to be worth cleaning. A schedule should be put in place for these situations.

Now no matter what, everyone should clean often enough that it doesn't become a health hazard. But it's an extreme case and at low enough levels, which level of dirt is acceptable is simply an aesthetic preference as it makes no practical difference.

The simplest solution is averaging the cleaning schedule between everyone's expectations. If person A thinks cleaning should be done every 3 days and person B every 5 days, they should clean together (or take turns) every 4 days. If A still thinks that's not enough they can take it upon themselves to clean more often, B doesn't owe it to them.

If A thinks it's too dirty and B, C and D agree it's not, then frankly A should suck it up.

Now I will answer some possible counterarguments I've heard:

1. Cleaning is something you owe to the community

To some level, yes. But solving a problem only benefits everyone if it's a problem for everyone in the first place. If it's only a problem for one person you're solving it for them in particular, not for the community.

2) There is such a thing as ""not enough cleaning"", but not ""too much cleaning""

Sure there is. Cleaning takes time and energy (also money for supplies) that could have been spent elsewhere, so it has to be balanced against every other activity you could do instead. How high of a priority it is depends on the person.

I've also been asked to clean so often that it actually became impractical. It was already clean enough to begin with that I couldn't see the difference before/after, which was not only unsatisfying but I couldn't see which places I'd already cleaned or not.

The reason I'm posting this is that I've seen a lot of clean freaks trying to boss everyone else around and thinking the world owes it to them to match up to their standards, so I assume their POV is not uncommon.

A lot of the time, when you, as a man, do get encouraged to express your emotions, they are simply invalidated and you kind of just get ridiculed as a result. Men can't open up to people because society has made it such that if you do, you're weak and feeble, and often times people pretend that they care, when really they don't. Thus, it has ultimately lead men to just weep in solitude away from any prying eyes and then putting on a facade as if nothing is wrong, when deep down there really is, and we can't let it all out unless it's when we're alone.

In summary, change my view that crying and expressing emotions as a man *isn't* perceived as weakness, and also that you *are* allowed to show emotion *WITHOUT any* repercussions in doing so.

EDIT: Grammar

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2:  

Hey  everyone. So after giving the post some time, it seems that I have come  to the conclusion that my view has changed, but only slightly. Crying  in the name of grieving over the loss of a loved one *is acceptable*  because if you are chastised for that, then it speaks volume for the  person doing so, since that would imply they have very little to no  remorse had it been on their end. Also, I should have made the  distinction between crying for sorrow vs. crying for happiness. My view  was aligning more towards crying for sorrow, but I could see the  argument being made for crying for joy/happiness, (i.e. Your favorite  sports team wins, or you accomplished/succeeded in a goal you set for  yourself).

Ultimately, I can walk away with *some* view change, but I still will continue to hold my view until there is a visible change I can see within society.

This is an opinion I've gone back and forth with myself on a bunch, and would absolutely love to have changed.
My problem mainly lies with the ""social construct"" understanding of ""gender"", but some similar issues lie in the more grounded neurological understanding of it (although admittedly it seems a lot more reasonable), which we'll get too later.

For starters, I do not believe there is a difference between men and women. Well, there are obviously ""differences"" between the sexes, but nothing beyond physical differences which don't matter much. At least, mentally, they are naturally the same and all perceived differences in this sense are just stereotypes stemmed from the way the sexes are socialized.

Which takes us to the definitions of man and woman used by the gender social constructionist, which is generally not agreed upon but I've found it to be basically understood as

Man: Someone who desires to be viewed/treated/thought of in the way a male is in society.
Woman: Someone who desires to be viewed/treated/thought of in the way a female is in society.
(For the non-binary genders it would be roughly similar with some changes depending on the circumstances)

Bottom line is that it defines gender based on the way the genders are treated. But this seems problematic for a variety of reasons.

First off, it is still, at the end lf the day, basing the meanings behind stereotypes about the genders rather than letting them stand on their own. It would be like if I based what a ""black person"" was off the discrimination black people have faced. But this would appear messed up and borderline ""racist"", while the same situation with gender is not considered ""sexist"".

It would also mean that gender is ultimately meaningless and would be something we should strive to *stop* rather than encourage, which would still fly in the face of the trans movement. Which is what confuses me especially because the gender social construct believers typically also support ""gender abolition"", yet they're the ones who want people to play around with gender the most? If you want to abolish gender, why don't you, y'know, get a start on that and break your sex norms while remaining that sex rather than changing your gender which somewhat works to reinforce the roles? (This also doesn't seem too bad to criticize, considering under this narrative gender is just a ""choice"", which is something I think the transmedicalist approach definitely handles better.)

Finally for this bit, this type of mindset validates other controversial concepts like transracialism (sorta tying back into what I mentioned earlier), but I don't think anyone is exactly on the edge of their seats waiting for the ""transracialism movement"".

Social construct section is done, now let's get into the transmedicalist approach. This is one where I feel a ""breakhthrough"" could be made for me a lot more easily, but I'm not quite there yet.
I do want to say I'm fine with the concept of changing our understandings of certain words if there is practicality to it and it isn't counterintuitive. Seems logical enough.

The neurological understanding behind the sex an individual should be defining ""gender"" seems sensible on it's own, but the part I'm caught up on is why we reach this conclusion.

The dysphoric transgender person's desire to be the other gender seems to mainly be based in, 
A. their sex, they seem to want to change the sex rather than the gender. Physical dysphoria is the main giveaway of the dysphoric condition it seems, anyway. But more specifically, a trans person wants to have physical attributes *associated* with the other sex. This seems like a redundant thing to point out, but the idea that certain physical traits are ""exclusive"" to a specific sex/gender is, well, just encouraging sexual archetypes about the way the sexes ""should"" look. This goes even further when you consider that trans people tend to want to have more petite or masculine builds depending on their gender identity - there is nothing wrong about this, but conflating gender to ""involve"" one's physical appearence inherently reinforces sexist sexual archetypes.

And next,

B. the social aspect. Typically described as social dysphoria, this describes a dysphoric trans person's desire to be *socialized* in the way the other sex typically is, which is what, aside from the physical dysphoria, causes them to typically ""act"" or dress more stereotypically like their gender identity, or describes their desire to ""pass"". But, to put it bluntly, because I believe there to be no difference in the way the sexes would act without social influence, I can't picture this phenomona described as ""social dysphoria"" coming from the same biological basis that the physical dysphoria does. Even if there were a natural difference in the way the sexes would act without societal influence, there would still be the obvious undeniable outliers, and with that in mind, using the way the genders ""socialize"" as a way to justify definining gender seperately from sex would be useless. It appears more akin to a delusion based on the same ""false stereotypes"" I've been talking about all along, ideas about the ways men and women ""should"" or ""should not"" be causing the transsexual person to feel anxious and care about actually *being* the other gender. But using this to justify our understandings of gender would still fall back on the same faults that the social construct uses, being that we'd be ""giving in"" to socialized norms and we can't have that be what helps us reach our understanding of gender.

With this in mind, if social dysphoria is that big of a factor, it would seem most sensical to me to define ""trans man"" and ""trans woman"" in their entirely new, individual categories which their own definitions, and still just treat those categories socially in similar ways to the way the genders are typically treated now. 

To recap, an understanding of gender and sex as synonyms based purely on sex seems to be the only understanding we can reach without basing some of our thought process on one given stereotype or another.

12,2022-09-19,CMV: The human lifespan is too short.,u/Master-namer-,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xi9x4u/cmv_the_human_lifespan_is_too_short/,changemyview,"As title suggests, recently I have been thinking that human lifespan is very, very short. Considering the average life expectancy to be around 72-85 years (in developed countries) is a woefully small span of time. 

Now this view is not pertinent in regards to the point some people make in context of natural philosophy that 70-80 years is nothing on cosmic time scales, yeah that is true but in a sense irrelevant as such. It's obvious that biological beings can not have lifespan in thousands or millions of years (atleast in the foreseeable future). 

My view is that 70-80 years is still very very small. A major chunk of our life span (0 to 15-25 years) is spent on just understanding the basics of life, 25-50 years are probably the actual most productive, healthy and stable period in an average humans life (again talking generally, with respect to people belonging to upper socioeconomic strata in developed nations). And 50 to 75-80 years, is generally involving various health issues and all (though still good if someone is not suffering from any crippling illness). 

This totals to around 25-500 years of time to actually do something, enjoy life etc etc. Isn't this time span too short? Thinking most of us aren't even able to see the next century. For example I have a pretty good life, a loving Significant Other, a caring family, a secure future and good earnings. This makes me wonder how in span of 10-20-30 years things will start to change. Things will change, people who love me will leave this world, which is sad, i.e this state of happines is transient, not that is wrong, as far as we know everything in the universe is transient, but that life is woefully short. Small and big things that make us happy, end in short periods of time. And ultimately we will die too. 

I think the human life span should atleast be like 250-300 years or more (with a majority portion being healthy and in youth). Now this is just a vague number that I came up with, no rational as such. 

Looking for interesting conversations, insights and perspectives on this."

0,2022-09-19,"CMV: I believe that Rehabilitative Justice, though it can be effective, places an unfair burden on Victims to forgive.",u/Doodle_Brush,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xib9h1/cmv_i_believe_that_rehabilitative_justice_though/,changemyview,"I'll clarify a few things first:

1.  I believe that Rehabilitative Justice is currently one of our more effective criminal justice systems in reducing recidivism and generating a more positive outcome for the convicted person, though this success is not 100%.

2.  I have no expertise in the Legal or Social Services sectors beyond what any regular person would.  For this post I'm speaking entirely from my own perspective.  My goal here is to get a different perspective on a topic I have long thought about.

MY OPINION:

I am, I'm willing to admit, a very ""emotionally vengeful"" person.  By that, I mean that when someone hurts me or transgress me (I.e. Like if I was the victim of a crime) my first instinct would be to get back at the person who targeted me.  Even if it wouldn't right the wrong, I'm first instinct is to hurt them as bad, or worse, than they hurt me to ""even the score"".  However, I say ""emotionally vengeful"" because I have common sense enough to know that, while I personslly would find it satisfying, seeking revenge instead of going down the legal route would just be ineffective and counterproductive.

It's been made clear over the last Century alone that the Prison and Legal systems need a big overhaul.  The Prison system fails at reforming criminals, and the Legal system fails at supporting victims of crime.

We, as a society, agreed to put aside mob law and adopt a Legal foundation we're all bound by, like it or not.  It means that revenge, as a concept, is meant to be off the table, however it still exists in our courts today because the public wish not only for the criminal to be rehabilitated so they pose no more threat, the public also wants them to be punished for their crime (in this case we'll call this a desire for revenge).

Rehabilitative Justice is shown to be very effective at reforming criminals, and it's use is gradually becoming more and more accepted as prisons start to turn away from the old school style of Prison Justice.  It is a system with a proven positive benefit to both the criminal and the victim.

However, my issue is that a big part of this Rehabilitative System seems to rely on the victim being asked to forgive the criminal.  This is done in many ways, such as hrough organisations like the Forgiveness Project which strives to bring criminals and victims together so they can both agree to forgive and move on.  In other instances, Rehabilitative Justice means the Victim being forced to accept the Criminal service what seems like a very short sentence in what is usually seen as luxury surroundings (Rehabilitative Prisons are often referred to as ""resorts"" compared to the bare-bones lifestyle we've come to association with Prison life).

In this second example the Victim almost appears to be brushed off and told, ""Well you're not allowed any revenge because that's bad.  We're going to remove them from society for a short while and try to help them make a good life for themselves, so you'll have to accept that as Justice.""

If I was the Victim, I would feel let down by the Legal system for the short sentence, and let down by the Prison System's almost pampering of the Criminal.  While on some level I am happy that no one else would become a Victim of this person, on a much deeper, more personal level I would feel as though I have been robbed of seeing the criminal punished.  I would not be open to having a dialogue with the Criminal or of forgiving him (as Rehabilitative Justice suggests) because, in my head, he got off lightly.

CONCLUSION:

I think that Rehabilitative Justice, while it is highly effective, needs to do more to appease the Victim's (and the Public's) need to see the Criminal punished.  I have no idea what this would be, whether it means a token Prison sentence added to their rehabilitation (I.e. ""Yes, you're rehabilitated, bit part of that rehabilitation is in accepting you've committed a crime and must do a set amout of prison time as a consequence""), or long-term restrictions after prison like a curfew or such.

I'm sorry for the long post, but I wanted my stance to be as clear as possible to cover any questions folks might have."

Now I get why the British might be sad, but even then - you have an uppity elite family born into extraordinary wealth and circumstance. I don't get why the poors constantly revel and worship these privileged c\*nts. I mean you save that sorrow and despair for when your true loved ones pass away. Like your parents, significant other, pets, etc. Why shed a tear for somebody that most certainly didn't even know who you were? 

Is it a female thing? Because literally all the people balling their eyes out are women. By the way, I identity as a cis-gender male. You may refer to me as he/him. I don't want to assume their genders lest provoke the wrath of the LGBTQ+-ABC community. 

Besides it's not like Queen Elizabeth didn't live a full life. Presumably she passed away somewhat peacefully at the age of 96! I'd be happy if I lived past 80. Hundreds of people die every day. Their lives cut short. In a ditch or alleyway. I mean look at Princess Diana. Now she deserved more or a mourning. A life cut short by some bizarre accident, leaving behind boys without a mother."

0,2022-09-19,CMV: Acrotomophilia should not be classified as a paraphilia,u/mikeman7918,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xig6xg/cmv_acrotomophilia_should_not_be_classified_as_a/,changemyview,"For those unaware, which is probably most of you: [Acrotomophilia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrotomophilia) is a sexual fetish (defined as a paraphilia basically everywhere, but obviously I disagree) where one is sexually attracted to amputees, and also often aroused by the idea of being an amputee.  And full disclaimer: it's a fetish I have.

The definition of a paraphilia isn't super set in stone, but generally it refers to abnormal aspects of a person's sexuality that are extreme or dangerous.  Examples include things like pedophilia, bestiality, sadism, and necrophilia.  All things which generally depend on the misfortune of others or that create a desire for things which can't be done ethically.  Studies on paraphilias tend to use convicted sex offenders as their sample group, so to say that the term is loaded in a very negative way is an understatement.

The argument for considering acrotomophilia a paraphilia is that it's dependent on the misfortune of others, and that in a perfect world where disabilities didn't exist this would be a problem.  But I don't buy that argument, mostly because for me at least the misfortune of others is actually a pretty massive turnoff.  If I'm going after amputee porn, I'll usually gravitate towards hentai and drawn stuff because that way I don't have to feel bad for them.  It's not uncommon to see porn of this sort where some fictional scenario establishes that this person has perfect prosthetics or they can grow back their limbs whenever they want, and they're just choosing not to because they too have the acrotomophilia kink and they're just into it.  And while a lot of this sort of hentai does by its nature often find itself combined with gore and sadism, those are their own different fetishes which are already considered paraphilias and which I am not into.

Another thing I've seen argued is that most amputees are uncomfortable having an aspect of their body which they generally don't like being a major focus of sexual attention.  And while that's true, the keyword there is ""most"", not ""all"".  For instance: almost anyone who has acrotomophilia and who is also an amputee would actually be very much into the idea of being fetishized for that reason.  If you need evidence beyond my own word, if you look at the comments under any kind of acrotomophilia hentai, for every person saying they wish they could fuck the person in the drawing there's another person saying they wish they could be them.  And even so, that only places acrotomophilia in the same place as having a fetish for obese people even though most obese people are uncomfortable about their weight.  It's not dangerous or extreme.

In a world with better technology where perfect prosthetics exist and limbs could be regrown, acrotomophilia would not become harmful or unethical in any way.  In such a world the only people who are amputees are those who want to be which some people do, and they could do so without experiencing any kind of disability which eliminates all the ethical problems with making someone an amputee without a good medical reason.  It won't be a problem then, and it's not a problem now for different reasons.

The point is: I don't think it's justified to call acrotomophilia a paraphilia.  I'm also bisexual, and it used to be considered a paraphilia to be a man attracted to other men the way I am.  Sometimes people get these things wrong, and as times change so to do the way we talk about this stuff.  Not that this is some major social justice issue or anything, the real world effects of acrotomophilia being classified as a paraphilia are basically nothing.  But it's the kind of marginal issue that can be interesting to argue about on Reddit."

I have felt this way for over a year. This all started when I read a book named *The Ultimate Resource* by Julian L. Simon. I have been interested in environmental and humanities issues for quite a while. This book really laid to rest a lot of preconceptions I had about the environment and resource management. 

I originally, without knowing the name of it, held Malthusian conceptions towards how the planet works. The idea of there being only ""finite resources."" What does that really mean, anyway? 

As I have become more educated with this book being a huge factor to forming my viewpoints. I have noticed a lot of well-intentioned, and logical at first, but wrong perspectives on population. The idea that the world is overpopulation primarily due to the myth of ""finite resources."" Though the environment also has a plurality as justification for people's beliefs on population.

I primarily believe that the mainstream idea of overpopulation is the wrong solution to issues we face.

I'm incredibly optimistic about humanity. Everything r/collapse talks about, I'm completely the opposite of. I believe the solution to a lot of the worlds issues isn't to depopulate, but rather, continue growing the population. 

**More People = More Ideas**

The more people the world has, the more brains we have that will be thinking of new ideas and innovations that will improve our lives. My thinking is that the more people we have, the higher the probability is that we'll have people with genius ideas appear. It makes sense that a country with 10,000,000 people will be more innovative than a country with 1,000,000 provided the social and economic framework is equal. 

Yes, this means there will be more brains working towards environmental solutions. There will be more people who work in the medical research field with ideas. Computer science will do better with more people. As a whole, even if the percentage remains fixed, a larger population will mean more people working in science, research, and figuring out innovations. This makes sense.

**More People = An Insurance Policy FOR Humanity**

The idea of shrinking the population in order to save it is a silly one to me. The mainstream idea is that by concentrating the population of humans, we are somehow making it more secure. How does that make any sense? More people means more diversification and options to keep ourselves alive. I believe we'll become an interplanetary species at some point. Should anything happen to the planet, more people which will take an interest in going to space, living underwater, living in Antarctica, etc etc is an insurance policy. If the population of the world is more concentrated, there's going to be less people at the edges willing to do these things. 

**More People = More Demand For Clean Energy &amp; Public Transport**

This should be common sense too. Countries where public transport, like high speed rail, is deployed tends to be where population density is heavier. With smaller populations, there is far less economic sense in constructing public transport infrastructure. A greater population ensures that high speed rail will be constructed, more public transport options will be available, and that these services also begin to establish an economy of scale, resulting in cheaper prices. 

An increasing population will also mean that it makes significantly more economic sense to move towards green energy from where we are today. As renewables are the only sources of electricity which make long-term economic sense from today, an increasing population would be the impetus to cause the construction of those power sources. 

The trouble with stagnant populations is that they must carry the cost of having a currently commissioned power plant whilst constructing the new power plant. This is very expensive especially in regional areas. If you grow the population, and with that, the amount of green energy as a market share increases. Eventually, fossil fuel sources become such a minor part of the grid that turning them off would be a lot easier. An increasing population also means the costs of new construction, per user, becomes a lot cheaper. This can only be better for pushing towards green energy.

**Debunking Nonsense Ahead of Time** 

Strawman: you can't keep growing the population indefinitely we'll eventually run out space, we'll be crammed like sardines, there'll be a catastrophe.

Answer: I don't believe the population will grow indefinitely. But it's very much a Moore's Law situation where so far the population has been able to grow, and we've had sufficient resources and space to cope with that. Eventually, due to the laws of physics, there would be a cap. But I believe it's silly to suggest that we'd end up depleting atoms. 

As The Ultimate Resource points out, what matters is the scale relative to mankind. Of course, if you want to be pedantic, you can make an idea that there is a hard cap physically. But are we actually close to approaching that physical boundary? I certainly don't think so. It's my belief that the trend will keep going. Instead of trying to exert downward pressure on it, I believe we should support it increasing. 

**Bonus, Brief Reasons in Support of Growing The Population**

More people, in the case of small towns, would be a lot better as well. Small towns, like where I am from, don't have enough infrastructure. There's no bus service. There's no hospital except for a GP and minor clinic. A growing population would mean a hospital could be constructed in this area, that public transport options could be introduced, that we see an investment into a larger public library and recreational centre, etc.  

An increasing population has corresponded with greater prosperity. Despite the supply of humans increasing, wages have increased globally. People are living longer lives. Everyone's quality of life is improving. 

**Conclusion**

These are only a few of the reasons why I support increasing the population of the world. I sincerely believe that it is better for us to keep growing the population than to stagnate or even reverse course."

* Obligatory: I believe this, but I don't want to. I would absolutely love to be convinced otherwise. I find the concept of being so alone and limited very depressing.
* The main reason is the speed of light, special relativity, and shit just being really far away
   * The closest star system is 4.5 lightyears away, meaning we couldn't possibly have a meaningful conversation without almost 5 years of latency. 
   * Granted, that's the *closest* one. There's only 8 systems in an under 10 lightyear range from us, and none of them are likely candidates for life containing planets afaik. 
   * Any spaceship travelling at relativistic speeds (significant percentage of the speed of light) would experience time dilation. For example
      * Travelling to the closest star, Proxima Centauri, it would feel like about 5 days, however, while you travel, earth will have aged 5.5 years.
      * Faster than light travel, while fun to think about, is pretty much proven *impossible* just by the nature of it [breaking causality and causing time paradoxes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUMGc8hEkpc&amp;ab_channel=PBSSpaceTime) There seems to be good consensus amongst the world's physicists that moving faster than light just wouldn't be possible, even in the case of [alcubierre drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive)s.
* Furthermore, cosmic speed limits are probably the reason earth *hasn't* been taken over by some imperial alien legion. Civilizations probably blossom and perish within their own systems, never leaving them, no matter how long they last or how advanced they become."

And whatever “compromises” are established between the two races are simply temporal practical concessions for creating a preferred balanced environment…but this does not solve the ultimate underlying conflict between the two.

I won’t base this claim much on socio-economic research since I find such disciplines to lack the sufficient rigor I value from applied math and statistics modeling (at least for these macro level claims). Instead I will simply use personal anecdotes and maybe some generalized historical events to support my claim.

Being rich is of course an objectively superior attribute. Even as a child I immediately knew the luxuries of the new rich inheritance  were vastly preferable to the environment of being poor. Only an imbecile would think otherwise. But it wasn’t until I lost my innocence did I understand the dichotomy that being rich caused between family and friends. The poor envy, that is universal truth. The poor will always envy the rich, and this alone will always be a destabilizing force between the two classes (for humility is unfortunately a lacking virtue in the vast majority of humans).

Because of this, the poor will inevitably always end up hating the rich and this will lead to violence if left untamed. We’ve seen it in historical events: slave revolts, seizure of property and of course good old revolutionary distribution of wealth movements. Furthermore, ideologies like egalitarianism or communist type theories are indeed weapons that can, and have, be used to seize the assets of the rich. 

The ultimate goal of the rich is to maintain their prosperity, and this requires looking at the reality of the situation. No matter the current system, the rich must always be vigilant for any populist movements…because they will all inevitably be used to take money away from us and give it to the poor."
0,2022-09-19,CMV: The Pro-Life Argument is essentially Socialist,u/MtnDewTV,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xik3lu/cmv_the_prolife_argument_is_essentially_socialist/,changemyview,"I believe The Pro-Life argument could easily be categorized as socialist in its nature.

The pro-life argument is that life begins at the moment of conception and that the zygote/fetus is a person with the right to life. Also often noted by the pro-life side in the abortion debate, abortion procedures are all directly ""killing"" a ""person"", through poison pills, dismemberment, etc.

However what happens if a woman who is 8 weeks pregnant goes to the ER/Police/Court and says that the ""person"" is trespassing inside her body without consent and she would like a c-section to remove it. Obviously, this is a lot more dangerous for the mother than an abortion, but a c-section could allow the ""person"" to be removed without killing them directly. Of course an 8 week old fetus won't survive outside of the womb, but since it's not directly killing the fetus, but rather the fetus is dying due to ""natural"" causes/the inability to support life for itself, would this be allowed?

The Pro-life position would say no, this isn't allowed, but then its position isn't just ""pro-life."" If they agree that the above act is also wrong and should be illegal, then they are not only granting a ""person"" the right to life but additionally the right to shelter, and nutrients/food. In this instance, the fetus or ""person"" is guaranteed these rights, even at the expense of another's rights to bodily autonomy and private property. The pro-life position places a person's right to life ahead of other's right to private property, and it mirrors socialist ideology, as it requires ""society""(The pregnant woman) to provide shelter and nutrients to ensure another individual's survival, even against the ""societies"" will, forcibly taking private property to ensure it happens.

Basically, the ""production"" of humans is owned by the government, or society as a whole, and mandates participation.

**EDIT: By ""Socialism"" I am not referring to its pure form, but rather just the current policies being suggested by the left-wing of the democratic party, especially policies supported by self-described ""socialists"" like Bernie Sanders. Policies like Universal Health Care, Affordable Housing, Right to Food and Water, free public higher education, etc.** "

10,2022-09-19,CMV: The United States gets undeserved criticism over its immigration policies toward Latin American migrants.,u/godlike_hikikomori,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xiowdf/cmv_the_united_states_gets_undeserved_criticism/,changemyview,"There's no doubt that most of Latin America simply have shithole countries AND governments, for that matter. No wonder why you see hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people over there trying to cross into the US. Crime, corruption, poverty, drought,...... you name it.  Seriously, who would want to live there? And so, developed countries, not only the United States, are faced with these questions:

1.) Should we even let them in the first place?

2.) Should we let them in and then grant them work visas or citizenship?

3.) What could be done to alleviate conditions in Latin Americas or other crime/war ridden countries?

&amp;#x200B;

Now, back to my key argument, which is my belief that the US gets undeserved criticism over its understandable Latin migrant policy. It is not the US government that should get the blame for this. It is the Mexican government. Shame on the drug cartels who corrupt Mexico's institutions.  Shame on the Mexican government for not cracking down on the drug cartels.  Shame on the Mexican politicians who curry favors for the drug kleptocracy. Now, I do realize that part of the reason why Latin America is such a shithole right now is the past imperial exploits of  the Spanish, Portugal and American empires onto their land. However, upon independence from these countries, these newly established and independent governments have had DECADES to solves their own problems and provide for their own citizens. AND YET, they have failed and frankly they do not care about the blight that their citizens face.

In short, these Latin migrants who are desperately pouring into the Southern borders have been failed by their own governments, not the US. Simply put, they are not our citizens. In fact, the US' own citizens, especially the working class, have been failed for decades on issues with respect to the cost of housing, climate change, campaign finance,  corporate greed and lobbying, and etc.. Perhaps, its time to help our own citizens, and not those who would indirectly( even though they didn't mean to) just make our issues even more complicated when we take into account the draining of resources( social safety net, housing, and jobs).  As much as I disagree with various far right wing figures in America, the one thing I agree with them is that America needs to really have this ""America First"" mindset. But, what I do disagree with are, of course, the policies that attempt to bring this into reality. I'm more inclined to opt with a sort of Nationalistic Progressive version of America First.

Through a humanitarian perspective, it would be truly altruistic if the US had just simply let every desperate migrant in the country. Of course, there should be at least some compassionate measure to bring  some of them in, as long as the number is capped at a certain amount per year(let's say few 10,000s). But, the rate at which this is going, the flow of migrants into the United States is simply unsustainable for the economy to handle it; and unless the deep-rooted problems in Latin America are addressed, this problem won't stabilize even if America were to all of the sudden accept all of them and even grant them citizenship and social safety nets.  One solution to this would be to start with the flow of drugs into Mexico itself. The US government could legalize several key drugs that it deemed illegal for a while, like weed, heroine, or even crack. That way, drug cartels would be nearly sapped off all its financial resources.

Throughout the past decade or so, when trying to address these issues, left wing pundits tend to follow a rather philosophical argument, in which America should accept every Latin migrant of its own because ""America is a country of immigrants"", and then they would try to tie this talking point to America's Constitution. There is one problem with this which is that no where in the Constitution does it say that America is a country of immigrants. What I think is that they mix up the contents of the Constitution with the a certain poem inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.""

This was not part of the Constitution. The way that they bring this up numerous times lack historical context. Now, the Statue of Liberty was built during a certain crucial yet often overlooked period in American History called the ""Gilded Age."" It was a time of rampant political corruption and corporate, industrial greed during the Second Industrial Revolution. The Statue of Liberty and its poem were actually used as corporate propaganda used by American Industrial elites at the time, in order to exploit poor Italian, Irish, and Chinese migrants as sources of cheap labor...... much like how they're doing it now with Latin migrants. Different time, same shit.

Now, you could argue that it is imperative to America's symbolic goal to accept every Latin migrant in. Just look at the diversity we see now in many key cities of America(NYC, Dallas, LA, etc.). That is true. There is no doubt that America is pretty diverse country, albeit a bit less diverse than Canada. But, a lot of these new immigrants (most of whom are Indian and East Asian,) have brought with them valuable mid-to high skills with which they could significantly contribute to American society. What do the Latin migrants have to offer to the United States empire? Not much. My point is that the US should reform its immigration system in a  way that makes it more selective yet a lot more humane and efficient.... none of the unnecessary long-ass delays we see in a lot of the legal ports of entry. We simply need to have a more strict immigration system, and a more secure border with Mexico.

America is not the only one to have strict(albeit somewhat inefficient) immigration system. Look at Nordic countries, like Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark. They all have strict immigration policies, while they preserve one of the greatest social safety nets and labor fairness in the world for their own citizens, especially their working class. In fact, you don't even look at just the Scandanavian countries. Singapore, having the best housing system in the world, has quite the strict immigration system. Other Asian countries, such as Korea and Japan have a strict immigration system and also have a  high human development standards and smart national healthcare systems in their countries.

I am aware that this is a somewhat hot button topic issue, and my view will get quite a bit of backlash from fellow Redditors. But, I am willing to debate the solutions to this problems and also the argument itself."

But, more often than not, those rivalries seem incredibly toxic.

A great example would be in the English Premier League, between Tottenham Hotspurs and Arsenal. The two teams are fierce rivals, but so many of the fans seem to genuinely hate the other side. You've got some examples that are pretty hard to defend, like death threats and stuff. But it goes to the point where I've seen English Arsenal fans refuse to celebrate if an English Spurs player scores an international goal, even though it's for their country, because they hate the player's club. And vice versa. This happens in a lot of other rivalries, where they call they call the other team's fans scum and such, and I feel like that's not conducive to why sporting events are beautiful.

I think rivalries should absolutely exist, and I think during the 90 minutes, or however long the game is, it should be intense and exciting. But I think rivals should respect each other. When the game is over, it shouldn't be hating on the other team for being bad, or bad faith claims that they're cheating/playing dirty. It should be congratulations, or comments like ""well played."" 

I also don't think rivals should want the other club to fail. An example of this is also two English football clubs, Newcastle and Sunderland. A few years Sunderland had a real fall from grace and dropped two divisions, and Newcastle fans rejoiced. I don't see the point in having a rival that's more or less a punching bag. It makes the rivalry feel less genuine, and the competition between the two teams less interesting. As a Spurs fan myself, I want to see Arsenal do incredibly well because that means our matches will be as exciting as they can be. I'd be genuinely devastated if they got relegated or became a substantially worse team because what's the whole point of the rivalry, then?

I'm interested to see what other people think about this or if they have alternate points of view that might change my opinion on this.

Edit: I have to add since it was an oversight when I originally posted, I think actions like banter are part of the sporting spirit and are absolutely fine. I concede that they are not on-pitch activities and the title isn’t the best-worded one. But I still think it shouldn’t be used as an excuse to be toxic or needlessly disrespectful."

The indoctrination into this mindset normally starts as a kid when parents use the excuse “because I’m your mom/dad”. If we really think about what this is meant to imply what they’re saying is “I control everything in your life so do what I say or there will be consequences”. At least some parents are straight forward and say “I brought you into this word so I can take you out”. While this is mostly true it amounts to emotional manipulation to get kids to do something. Some most young kids don’t have a sense of logic and reasoning yet this will become normal. But it continues into teen, young adult and even adult years which can cause issues between parent and offspring or even between entire families.

Parents need to realize your offspring don’t owe you anything. You made the choice to have a baby therefore it’s your responsibility to care for that baby. If you don’t want to take on that responsibility you have others options none of which your kid has a say in.

So the simple act of bringing a kid into the world, and taking care of them doesn’t then obligate you to anything from that kid or who they become.

1. the ideal by which equality of opportunity is available to any American, allowing the highest aspirations and goals to be achieved.

As someone who highly believes that the US is still in 2022 full of systemic racism, I almost feel like the American dream saying is almost a cover up. Im a person of color, maybe obvious maybe not, and I do agree that equal opportunity can exist, I also agree that equal opportunity is pretty much the only legal option available in businesses. That doesn't necessarily mean its equal opportunity though. (Which goes back to systemic racism)

Obviously I don't think using the saying ""the American dream"" victimizes people I simply just thinks it gives off a false impression. Which also obviously I think the U.S. days of trying to play the perfect country role is over, we have made it quite clear that we are far from perfect.

I could also argue that it doesn't apply to the LGBTQ+ or women. The same way that racism contradicts the American dream, homophobia and sexism contradicts it too.

How I would correct the definition: 

noun: **American dream**

1. the ideal by which equality of opportunity is available to ~~any American~~ **most** straight white men, allowing the highest aspirations and goals to be achieved."

To define it as such would completely eliminate some things that are quite racist. For example (depending on the specifics of the definition beyond just p+p), the ethnic violence during the Rwandan revolution (not the genocide) couldn't be called racist on the basis that the Tutsi minority had power and privilege. To claim that the killings were not racist would be completely disrespectful.  To change my view, I ask that you prove that this definition is firstly, beneficial for discussion and secondly, the problem with the simpler ""discrimination on the basis of race"" that requires changing it in the first place.

To separate my view from some related posts, I'm not arguing that systemic or systematic racism does not exist. I'm also not arguing that no one(edited for clarification) has more power or privilege than others on the basis of race. Im solely arguing that power and privilege have no impact on determining if a statement is racist."
3029,2022-09-20,"CMV: If Trump were indicted, arrested, convicted and imprisoned, the reaction from his base would not be that bad and the nation would move on.",u/Hall_Pitiful,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xiyxcs/cmv_if_trump_were_indicted_arrested_convicted_and/,changemyview,"The idea has been thrown around quite a bit lately that if Trump is ever arrested, tried in a court of law, and sentenced to serve time behind bars that there would be a violent backlash in the U.S.--a massive upheaval of the body politic. The claim is that ""The country would not stand for it."" 

I don't believe this is true. It's a canard. It's wishful thinking on Trump's part.

Yes, there would undoubtedly be protests, demonstrations, fire-breathing talking heads, intimidating posts on social media, and maybe even a few isolated outbursts of violence. But these'll all largely fizzle out in short order as Trump fades in America's collective memory. The news cycle would dwell on it for awhile, then look for the next big attention-grabbing event. Not much would change. Life would go on.

The US as a nation seems pretty used to civil unrest and psychopathic bursts of violence by now. If there is an uptick in these phenomena traceable to Trump's arrest, that wouldn't exactly signify anything momentous. If a Trump-sympathetic person goes berserk and hurts people because Trump or his inner circle are apprehended and forced to face consequences, it wouldn't really be all that meaningful, memorable, or original. Of course, it'd be tragic and heartbreaking to see innocent people hurt--but in the long run, any sort of backlash would be relatively minimal, and would be largely forgotten and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. 

A deranged active shooter kills people in a US mall, church, school, or concert? That's basically par for the course in the states, sadly, regardless of the motivation. A mob breaks shop windows downtown, starts fires, and flees from the police? Flip on the news and watch that happen pretty frequently in many major US cities \*right now.\* A pickup truck mows down pedestrians? Again, the nation has become somewhat inured to these sorts of incidents--they aren't exactly the sorts of profound events that would shake the foundations of the republic--even if there would be an above-average smattering of them in the wake of a Trump arrest. (Again, this is not to say that the victims and families caught up in these horrific events wouldn't be forever changed and traumatized--only that from a big picture view, most of the other 330 million Americans would go back to their daily lives.)

Americans shouldn't be scared of riots and organized crime motivated by people who wouldn't be able to fathom that Trump could be held accountable under the law. These are marginalized and fringe actors. The hardcore elements of these factions would eventually be rounded up and imprisoned, too. This is the FBI's bread and butter. They take down crime rings on the regular. Then, all the lukewarm Trump supporters would find another leader to rally behind. They'd hold Trump up as a martyr, yes. But it'd mostly be symbolic. Then they'd move on. Eventually even the references to the perceived injustice of his arrest would fade away. Elements of the GOP would probably breathe a sigh of relief."

It features Nanisca, the fictional leader of the historical all-female group of warriors, the Agogie. The film has been accused of re-writing history by giving a rose-tinted view of Dahomey, who are treated as the heroes of the story despite the fact that historically, Dahomey was heavily engaged in the slave trade, which produced most of its wealth in the early 19th century.

It is true that The Woman King is not an entirely historically accurate depiction of Dahomey's attitude to slavery during the first half of the 19th century. However, to insist that it should be seems to me hypocritical, as this standard is not applied to other historical films.

The British Empire and the Southern United States also derived much of their wealth from slavery in this period. Indeed, Dahomey could not have become rich through slavely of they were not selling enslaved people to work on the plantations in the West Indies and the Southern US. But we do not expect all films set it the British Empire or the Southern United States to present a balanced depiction of the horrors of slavery. ""Master and Commander"" is not a lesser film for not having the protagonists encounter a slaving ship, there are no enslaved people to be seen in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", despite their having been widely present in the area it is set in.

This is not to say that there are no films which come to grips with the practice of slavery in these places: there are many. My point is simply that we do no expect films set in the British Empire or the pre-civil-war US to always be historically accurate depictions and critical appraisals of the practice. There is no great outcry when such films fail to do so, and therefore there seems to be no reason The Woman King, a film about the African side of the trade rather than the European and American, should be held to a different standard."

In the specific case of China, their lax environmental laws are allowing us to off-load our responsibility.

100,2022-09-20,CMV: No one truly accepts Pascal's wager,u/N0z1ck_SSBM,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xj8jg6/cmv_no_one_truly_accepts_pascals_wager/,changemyview,"Pascal's wager, first proposed by the 17th-century theologian of the same name, can be summarised as follows:

There are conceivable theologies on which belief is rewarded with an infinite good (typically thought to be access to an eternity in paradise in the afterlife) and nonbelief is punished with an infinite evil (typically thought to be condemnation to an eternity of torture in the afterlife). Given that these outcomes are thought to persist infinitely, their utility would be infinite and so would eclipse any finite utility that could be achieved during a mortal lifetime. Assuming that we have stronger reasons to believe in one of these theologies than any theology on which the reward function is reversed (infinite punishment for belief and/or infinite reward for nonbelief), then it is prudential to believe in that theology, as doing so maximizes expected utility.

For the sake of debate, I'm willing to grant Pascal the following:

* We have stronger reasons to believe in a belief-rewarding theology than a nonbelief-rewarding theology. I consider this uncontroversial.

* An eternity in paradise constitutes infinite utility and an eternity of torture constitutes infinite negative utility. This I consider more controversial, but I think it's uncontroversial on many people's views.

* People can alter their fundamental beliefs in virtue of prudential considerations. This is probably false in this context, but even if it is false, Pascal's wager would still necessitate action, as it's plausible that we have stronger reasons to believe in a theology on which adherent nonbelievers are rewarded and nonadherent nonbelievers are punished than to believe in an opposite theology, and so you still maximize your utility by acting as if you believe.

It seems, then, that Pascal's wager is compelling: everyone should believe in whichever of these belief-rewarding theologies they believe to have the highest probability of being true and act accordingly. This seems to provide a convincing reason for prudential atheists to convert to theism. 

Many people have proposed rebuttals to Pascal's wager, but I do not believe many of them have been successful. In fact, I am only aware of one promising rebuttal (to reject the notion of infinite utility), and for the purpose of this exercise, I have granted to Pascal that this rebuttal is inadequate.

Nevertheless, I believe that Pascal's wager must be rejected because it leads to an absurdity. 

If Pascal's wager is to be compelling at all, it seems to me that there can be no end to the compulsion: it is not enough to believe in a particular historical theology and adhere to its precepts. After all, there is always some possibility that our understanding of a theology is ever so slightly wrong, and that it demands of us ever so slightly more than we are currently doing. Let's say I am of the opinion that, of all possible theologies, the reasons to believe theology T1 are the strongest. However, I must concede that there is some finite possibility, however minute, that actually some slightly more demanding theology T2 is true, and that only adhering to T1 will fail to secure me the desired reward. No matter how small the probability that T2 is true, the reward at stake is infinite, and so belief in T2 is warranted no matter the cost (if Pascal's wager is to be compelling at all).

This can be carried on to absurdity. Some popular historical religions say that you should give to the poor, but how much? If you gave 90% of your income, we would regard this as saintly, but I can see no principled reason why we would stop there. After all, how foolish would we be if we stopped at 90% but the cutoff were 91%? In fact, you can never stop. If Pascal's wager is compelling, then we are compelled to take *any* action which might plausibly increase our chances of the infinite reward. We cannot hope that our historical conception of theistic morality is adequate, because there is some possibility that our belief and adherence will be inadequate, and this constitutes an infinite loss of utility, which must be avoided at all costs, no matter how unlikely. 

If you truly believe that Pascal's wager is compelling, you would be living as a pauper in the streets, and you would likely choose to die a martyr at the earliest opportunity. And so in response to the wager, I feel only the need to reply, ""You first.""

Edit 2 (2022-20-09 3:06 ET): I'm no longer addressing comments whose main contention is that the formulation of Pascal's wager that I have provided is not, in effect, actually Pascal's wager. I've gone through this line with at least two different commenters thus far and it only ends with an impasse. I task you, the reader, with understanding how the principles of prudential reasoning driving Pascal's original conclusion can be applied to a contemporary formulation that considers the possibility of multiple gods, as many commenters have already demonstrated the ability to do.

Edit 3 (2022-20-09 6:37 ET): I have awarded 1 delta, and I believe I have finally managed to get through most of the replies that I feel substantively engage with my position. I don't think I'm likely to award any further deltas, based on the conversations that are currently ongoing, and so I will probably be moving on shortly.

Which normally, would be something along the lines of greeting guests, taking their orders/answering questions about the menu, delivering food/drink, collecting payment, cleaning tables and any other related tasks that the employer feels necessary (like restocking napkins/utensils or refilling condiments).  Of course, not limited to these tasks.

The job duties outlined by the employer are expected to be completed, regardless of whether or not the employee receives a tip from the customer or not.  This also leads to my opinion on tipping and that it should never be expected, but they should still be allowed to be accepted if offered.

It seems like the ""tipped employee"" wage difference is somewhat exploitative in favor of the employer, even though the employer would be required to compensate the difference if the employee did not earn at least the minimum wage in tips.  In some cases, customers return to a specific restaurant with service received having an influence on that decision.  So if a restaurant has a handful ""top"" servers that each contribute in bringing regulars weekly, the employer is essentially paying these ""top"" servers less than what they are worth to the company and it just doesn't sit right with me.

While I recognize that this undermines principles of academic freedom, I think the situation is dire enough to warrant that, and that academic freedom is, at present, a flimsy shield for defending public servants who are politicizing their positions, wasting public money,  and failing to do an adequate job teaching and researching. When John Dewey originally set out laying the foundations of academic freedom, he imagined a contract between society and academics, where academics should be left alone, and in return, they'd give society high quality education and research. To my mind, if one party fails to hold up their side of the bargain, the other should intervene. I'll lay out why I think Universities are failing at their social function, and some suggest some policies to remedy them. I will adhere to /r/CMV rules, and grant deltas for anything that changes my view, however small, though I prefer answers that address my central contention. Additionally, I recognize that I'm dropping a big wall of text, and it's okay if you want to only skim or just challenge what you think is most pertinent.

1. **Politicization**

In a liberal democracy, we distinguish between procedural and substantive justice - e.g. while we all want our preferred candidate to win (our substantive view), we also (should) respect electoral outcomes (procedural justice). Most public institutions, like the cops, fire department etc. ought to be substantively neutral, to prevent a political faction from entrenching themselves, and undermining liberal democracy. For example, while we allow police to have political opinions, they aren't supposed to advance them while in uniform. In my mind, university professors and administrators regularly flout these principles, and we should have norms and policies to discipline or fire them when they do. To be clear, an administrator or professor's job might involve making technical judgements within their area of expertise, but I believe the following go beyond technical judgements, and into normative pronouncements and political activism.

* **Complaining about democratic outcomes** [After a ballot measure supporting racial preferences failed, UCLA released this statement](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/ucla-s-unwavering-dedication-to-diversity-and-inclusion). By focusing on the people who don't like the result, and ignoring the people who do, the release is heavily implying that the people of California voted incorrectly. I get that's it sucks when votes don't go your way, but it's weird to talk about how 'painful' it is for one side. I can't find any press releases where he talks about how 'painful' it is when conservatives lose elections, and nor do I think he should be releasing them.

I think this is completely inappropriate for a public servant. When votes don't go my way, I don't use my public position to bitch about it. I accept that I serve the public's will, and do my best to enact it. I don't use government resources to mollycoddle the losers. The public shouldn't accept this kind of politicization of ostensibly apolitical government jobs. This seems pretty easy to deal with on a policy level, academic staff can just be brought into line with the same sorts of rules we have for other public servants. While obviously the line between just supporting broad principles and specific partisan views can be difficult, we mostly successfully draw the line with most government jobs.

* **Attempting to curtail public speech**

A lot of DEI flavored initiatives seem to hint/gesture at certain political views being unacceptable at universities. [Here's an example of what I'm talking about](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/06/16/uc-teaching-faculty-members-not-to-criticize-race-based-affirmative-action-call-america-melting-pot-and-more/)

While the seminar doesn't explicitly state that these views are forbidden, I agree with the wapo author that there's a certain mafioso reasoning here - ""it'd be a shame if something were to create a hostile environment"". Virtually any political speech *could* contribute to a hostile work environment, but it's weird that they single out opposition to affirmative action. I can't find any cases of this kind of speech actually creating a hostile work environment as adjudicated by a court, so it seems sus that they single out these views as potentially problematic.

I don't get why we're so worried about academic freedom being curtailed by the government, when the administration is doing a fine job of it themselves.

* **Political bias in admissions, hiring, promotions, grants, and publication** [This report](https://cspicenter.org/reports/academicfreedom/) seems pretty damning. While I'm somewhat skeptical of polls of conservatives self-reporting being cancelled or not free to share their opinion, this study found that academic staff had a shocking appetite for suppressing political views that they don't like. 

For a long time, I kind of poo-pooed the idea that universities were hostile to conservatives just because a lot of liberals work in universities. After all, my government job is largely liberal but I don't think there's much appetite for keeping conservatives out. But it looks like academics are built different.

But this isn't just happening at the level of individuals: [the UC system has created what are effectively political litmus tests to be hired](https://reason.com/2020/02/03/university-of-california-diversity-initiative-berkeley/)

and some professors are even calling for this sort of litmus testing in undergraduate admissions: [in this Op-Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/views/2022/08/22/affirmative-action-probably-dead-whats-next-opinion), the authors, public university professors, propose that:

&gt; Though universities may soon be denied the ability to consider race in admissions, they can consider a commitment to racial justice as part of a holistic admissions process.

while obviously 'racial justice', in the abstract is an unalloyed good, the authors pretty clearly hold that opposition to racial preferences is racially unjust earlier in the piece. I doubt that if they got their way, a student who wrote that they support racial justice by opposing California's prop 16 would be treated equally as someone who said that they supported it. In a liberal democracy, resources like college admissions shouldn't be witheld based on political views. While the authors have fortunately not gotten their way, a normal public servant would almost certainly be required to at *least* retract public statements about denying resources to the public based on political view. More likely they would be fired or put on probation. 

A plausible policy solution would be to audit the distribution of admissions, hires, grants, promotions and the like, and fire people shown to be discriminating for political purposes, or cutting funding if it's more of systemic thing.

2. **Wasting money**

* **Administration costs are out of control** 

[We all know education costs are outpacing inflation](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/college-tuition-inflation/#:~:text=College%20tuition%20inflation%20since%201980,tuition%20rising%20faster%20than%20inflation.&amp;text=Between%202008%2D2009%20and%202018,19%25%20at%20private%20nonprofit%20institutions.), in large part due to [administrative bloat](https://academicinfluence.com/inflection/college-life/overcoming-administrative-bloat#:~:text=Back%20to%20Top-,What%20is%20administrative%20bloat%3F,detracts%20from%20that%20educational%20mission.) This seems pretty wasteful of the public's resources, and the government should make them cut it out.

A plausible solution would just be to cap administration spending, or require higher numbers of students to be taught for less money, while maintaining class sizes, squeezing out sinecures.

* **Tenure track faculty are overpaid** 

[We have no trouble filling tenure track position](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-we-need-honest-students-phds-academic-job-market-wood-phd/) at the prevailing wages, yet professors are very well paid. For example, at UCLA, [entry level TT professor job](https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/2022-23/oct-2022-salary-scales/t1.pdf) pays more than the [**mean** LA wage](https://www.bls.gov/regions/west/news-release/occupationalemploymentandwages_losangeles.htm).

I don't get why a job where there's a glut of qualified applicants should pay so well. Usually, we raise wages because there's a shortage of qualified applicants. I don't believe in paying people poverty wages for honest work, but it seems like a reasonable policy might be to cap salaries at either the market clearing price (ie the minimum wage to reliably get a qualified applicant) or something like 80% of the median wages in the area, or 150% of the poverty line, whichever is highest (I'm not like dead set on these numbers, just giving an idea of what I'd like to see. I'd also note that some of my other proposals might raise the market clearing price by making academia a less attractive prospect, but that's ok). It seems weird that rando public servants get upper middle class wages for doing a job that we don't really have trouble filling. I suspect this is just a cultural hangover from when professors often came from the ranks of the idle rich, but in a society that's ostensibly egalitarian and democratic, I don't think we should accede to this expectation. 

3. **Poor educational practices**

In his (admittedly bombastically named) book *The Case Against Education*, Bryan Caplan advances the empirical case that education, especially four year universities, are not actually doing much to mold people into better citizens or workers, but rather the improved results we see from university grads are just the result of them being sharper people in general, and that getting a degree helps signal to employers that they're competent and conscientious. I'm not against signalling instititions, but it seems wild that we spend ~2% of GDP on one. In the book, he makes a more rigorous empirical case, but an intuitive way to get on his wavelength is noticing that the life outcomes of students who do 1 semester of college are mostly the same as those who do 7, and then there's a big jump in things like earnings and such from people who actually finish. This implies to me that the main effect isn't in the education itself - why would doing 1 semester at the end of your college career have a vastly larger effect than the 6 intermediate semesters if the effect really were educational, as opposed to signalling?

4. **Poor research practices**

* **Social science research fails to make predictions about novel phenomena**

In his book *Expert political judgement: How good is it? How can we know?*, Phil Tetlock gives the startling result that a lot of experts (in many cases, university professors) fail to do better than extremely simple statistical models, or in some cases, fail to do better than chance. The core of scientific reasoning is making models that are *predictive* not just explanatory. I can make a model with 100% explanatory power by proposing that there's an invisible gremlin that decides everything that happens in the world, but that's stupid.

I'm a public servant, but if my work was no better than some rando, or a monkey throwing darts, I should probably just be fired. We could have mandatory prediction tournaments, and fire low performers.

* **Medical, biological and social sciences don't have very good practices at uncovering truth**

[A huge portion of published medical and psychological science are bullshit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis), by failing to preregister hypotheses and publish negative results, researchers can fish around for positive results, that will occur at the ratio given by the selected p value, even if there is no underlying effect. To be fair, there is some movement to correct this, but to my mind, it's much too slow. If my colleagues and I were found to be fucking up this badly, many of us would be fired, and the government would require us to adopt better practices more or less immediately, not wait around for us to decide on our own that we're fucking up and pinky swear to do better in the future.

* **Potentially unrigorous nonsense is published**

There's a lot of research (in things like 'cultural studies'), often the ideological descendent of what we'd call 'Continental Philosophy' that's full of jargon, and because it's not empirical or formalized like mathematics, it's prohibitively difficult for an outsider to tell if what's being discussed is nonsense. I can link some examples if people are skeptical that this sort of thing exists. To be clear, I'm not against continental philosophy tout court, but I think a lot of its offspring is kinda just nonsense, or at least, could be nonsense, and we'd have no way of knowing.

To my mind, the point of academic freedom was to protect scholars who were telling hard truths that the government didn't want to hear, not for people to get sinecures publishing stuff of which only they and their friends are 'qualified' to judge the merits. There needs to be external standards for rigor beyond the academic fields themselves to prevent spirals of nonsense.

* **Research is often behind a paywall:**  

I can find a source if people seriously doubt this, but a huge amount (the majority?) of academic research is only published in journals that you need a subscription to access. I don't see why the public, who are already paying for the research to happen, also have to pay to see the research. If performing peer review is already part of academics' professional obligations, why isn't the cost of doing the review and publishing the journals just part of the normal university budget?

While it's true that you can often email a professor and ask them to send you a copy of their research, this seems, at best, overly clunky and inefficient. At worst, ripe for abuse. Anecdotally, I've overheard professors saying that they ignore emails from members of the public that they consider ""bad actors"" - imo, this is completely unacceptable behavior for a public servant. Their job is to publish research for the public, not determine who should be allowed to see it. I don't see why the public should put up with rando professors deciding to keep their research private from people they don't want to see it.

TL;DR: Universities are bad at their social function, so the government shouldn't keep letting them govern themselves.

EDIT: Since I'm under consideration for deletion, I'd like to say that I think people have brought up some interesting points and I might change my view on certain aspects soon. I don't know how else I can demonstrate my openness to changing my view besides giving deltas I don't believe."

7,2022-09-20,CMV: The Fed will need to raise the Federal Discount Rate to around 8% to kill US inflation,u/thetreecycle,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xjhb3x/cmv_the_fed_will_need_to_raise_the_federal/,changemyview,"Many news sites are saying the fed will stop around 4%. But I think the federal discount rate will need to rise to match the 8.3% inflation rate most recently reported in August 2022.

In 1975, when inflation reached a local maximum of 12%, the Fed raised the interest rate to 8% in an attempt to kill inflation, and while inflation did drop temporarily, this interest rate proved to be insufficient to kill it, as inflation hit a new peak of 14% in 1980. It required the Fed raising rates temporarily to a matching 14% to finally send inflation back down to normal rates.

This pattern of central banks needing to raise interest rates above the rate inflation to kill the inflation holds true for other countries, such as Germany and France around the same time periods.

In the period after 1980 until 2007, the federal discount rate was held above or approximately equal to inflation to suppress inflation and keep it around 2%.

The August inflation rate in the US was 8.3%. Shouldn’t the fed need to raise rates to around 8% to kill the new inflation?

I know some sites are arguing the inflation is transitory and doesn’t need central bank action to fix, but inflation has been high since mid-2021, how long does inflation have to persist before it’s not transitory?"

They means-tested it at [$75,000 for single, $150,000 for married couples](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/coronavirus-stimulus-check-calculator/). This number isn’t as arbitrary as it seems, as George Bush used the same numbers ($75,000 and $150,000) in 2008 for his [tax rebate plan](https://www.npr.org/2008/01/24/18391644/stimulus-plan-refunds-600-to-1-200-to-taxpayers). 

So, where does the US come up with these magic numbers, that within these thresholds, you “need help by government standards? 

Let’s take a look: 

Senate republicans in the 90s looked to pass a child tax credit act, and they did, and also used the $75,000 threshold because [At that time, that was thought to be the bounds of where upper middle-income folks were,”](https://www.marketplace.org/2021/03/04/how-75000-became-the-threshold-for-receiving-a-stimulus-check/amp/). Apparently, the middle class from the 90s and the middle class today make the same amount of money, but that’s a different topic. 
There’s also usually a 5% phaseout in these programs, as there was with the COVID stimulus. Also, it seems the tax code plays a part in why they choose these numbers.


Back to the main point, federal government programs “handouts” are tied to a specific income threshold, which in my argument should be tied to free healthcare. If these individuals need help during the toughest times, they likely need help all the time, and I think healthcare should be offered for these individuals. It would be cheaper than M4A, and the well-off can keep their private insurance."

Under US law it is (at least in theory) illegal for an individual to discriminate based on race, sex, disability, religion, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, etc. in different areas of our society. This includes business practices, hiring practices, employment, housing, education, loans, etc. Some may argue these legal provisions do not cover all areas of society or opportunities for discrimination, however, they are at least partially there and do protect individuals within many areas of society. Meanwhile, there is public outcry today for certain social groups and constructs and their specific needs, like the ""fat-acceptance movement"" and ending weight-based discrimination, or LGBT's communities push for better protections for sexuality and gender-based discrimination. 

With all that said, ""lookism"" and social advantages given to those based on their attractiveness, is not focused on at all in our culture. Perhaps it is partially noticed or commented on but there is not the same kind of social movement or legal protections behind it to stop discrimination or reduce disadvantages in society. I am not saying this as a bad thing necessarily, and my CMV is **not** that ""lookism"" should be give more attention or legal protection. I believe its really not possible because of the nature of attractiveness and its subjectivity. It's distinctions are way less distinct then other ""social castes"" and it is way more up for one's own personal interpretation, compared to social constructs like race and gender, which makes it hard for any kind of legal protection. There are however, a societal scale of attractiveness and general standards of beauty within our society. And of course beauty standards can and have changed over time, but so have classifications of gender and social standards of weight. While some changes in beauty standards change, in general, the idea of being attractive has remained over time, as things like body symmetry have been scientifically linked to society's scale of attractiveness.  

An Individual's attractiveness affects their job and economic opportunities, romantic relationships, personal relations, and overall quality of life and happiness. Research has shown that those that are more attractive have more friends, sexual partners and better social skills than unattractive people. Unattractive people are more likely to experience bullying in life, and holds effects in one's employment/economic ability. Especially when looking at certain markets, like entertainment and fashion, you can see huge advantages. Attractiveness and the modeling business are directly linked, as well as Hollywood and actors/actressess. If you want to be in the MCU, you have to be attractive. You can be gay, black, Muslim, female, etc. and be in the MCU but if you are viewed as conventionally unattractive, you will be strongly disadvantaged in casting. You could also look at examples like being an influencer or OF model. 

TLDR: While all types of an individual's characteristics and identity can cause advantages/disadvantages in society, physical attractiveness grants the most social privilege, and individuals who are attractive receive greater advantages over unattractive individuals. The nature of ""physical attractiveness"" limits the ability of society to end ""lookism"" or stop certain disadvantages placed on ""ugly"" people, and this isn't really possible to fix/change."

This is inherently sadistic and cannot be understood as just by any sane, compassionate just person. Punished horrifically for eternity for finite ""sins"".

Secondly, I know other religions make the same claims but that does not make it ok. It just means some other religions have the same problem.

Thirdly, a significant number of Muslims believe people who insult Muhammad should be killed. You can say they do not represent real Islam. But why should we believe the peaceful ones represent it more accuratly? Islam is what Muslims do and believe. This is what a significant amount of Muslims believe. So this IS a significant part of Islam at least. 

Fourthly, I know Islam talks about peace and love. But that simply is not enough to negate the promotion of vilence in other parts of the Qur'an and Islam in general.

I am not saying all Muslims are bad people or terrorists. That would be a more extreme claim. I am saying that the religion, while promoting some good, does significantly promote violence. Not every Muslim will accept those aspects of Islam of course. But I am not talking about particular Muslims. I am talking about the religion as a whole.

In general, can Muslims say: ""god won't torture some people in hell for eternity"", ""never kill anyone for what they believe or say"", ""do not be violent unless in self defence"", ""God loves all people and does not hate any person"". If Muslims can not say these things then Islam is a violent religion.

It promotes a significant amount of violence."

If history has taught us anything, it's that Americans don't like things being banned if a big enough part of the population likes it. For example, alcohol during Prohibition or increased sale of assault weapons when talks of a ban on them go around.

Abortion bans might reduce them in the short term but in the long term, I don't think so.

In my opinion, Republicans should allow abortion and put more things in place to get an abortion that might weed people out on the way like counseling, adoption services and ultrasounds.

The GOP should also try to convince people through debates, logical and emotional appeals to not get an abortion rather than bans."

Climate doomerism, as I view it, is the idea that humanity has set itself on a course of total destruction of human life on earth, this paper seems to say that, essentially, this mindset is correct. 

Now I am coming from a layman's perspective here, but the recent video by a scientist and youtuber I respect, [Simon Clark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxoyaCSWFGs), essentially confirms my fears in this regard, the words he uses towards the end of the video are something along the lines of ""sending ourselves on a spiral towards the end of a habitable earth"" (obviously not a direct quote, I can't re-watch it without spiralling myself lol)

Now, on the one hand, I am aware this somewhat contradicts the IPCC report(s) released last year that talk about how, whilst the situation is indeed dire, the ""tipping point(s)"", so to speak, have not been reached. Additionally, I am aware this is just one paper. However, the fact that this was published in a reputable journal, by reputable people, and people who's opinions I respect in this matter seem to be as concerned as I am, all add up to an absolute doomerism bonanza on my part.

Another aspect of my dread when it comes to the future is the seeming ineptitude, malice, and/or desire for profit all people in positions of genuine power seem to be displaying in this issue. I simply cannot trust any of them and have been given no real reason to trust them, at least not on the climate issue."

Obscure actors are some of the best actors.

******

Counter arguments I anticipate.

-	**But who?** Examples from American cinema: Elias Koteas, Parker Posey, Ted Levine, Richard Schiff.
-	**Acting skill and and an actor’s goals change over time.** Yes. Bruce Willis of the last few years was doing a different kind of work than *Moonlighting* or *12 Monkeys.*  We know what he is capable of. That’s what matters.
-	**It’s subjective.** Of course acting skill is a subjective scale. Since we clearly have schools of acting, casting directors, award shows, and ranker.com we can say what the trends are.
-	**Awards shows?** Yes, just because the big name actors win all the awards doesn’t mean they are the best. It’s because the awards shows themselves tend to include more mainstream, multimillion dollar productions. That’s the pool the award shows draw from.

Not convinced yet? 

Corollary: The best stuff in *any* field tends to be hard to find. Comic books, potential world-class athletes, the right piece of furniture for your space. If you believe any of those why not for acting?"

I will be using textbook definition from Webster Dictionary for all definitions*. I will also not be addressing hermaphrodites due to that being a genetic mutation.

Sex*: either of the two major forms of individuals that occur in many species and that are distinguished respectively as female or male especially on the basis of their reproductive organs and structures.

Gender*: the behavioral, cultural, or psychological traits typically associated with one sex. 

Normally when people address others, they use sex. When I talk about my wife begin a female, it's not because (insert sexist/gender female home role), it's because she is a biological women. My biological male friend that has a culinary license isn't a female because he can cook.  

To address people as genders could be seen as being sexist*. (Webster doesn't have Gender Discrimination definition and sites Sex Discrimination, which is sexism). To say gender A can only X because society says that's their role, and gender B can only do Y would fall into being sexist. When I grew up when a male was asked what they wanted to do when they grown up they normally said cop/military/firefighter, because those are perceived as a male job. I'm not a female so I'm guessing when young girls are asked they said the typical jobs for their gender, because this is was society has taught us. This possibly has changed since my child(hood)*.

Biological women (BW) Biological male (BM)

By addressing people by sex, that doesn't place them into a stereotype group which would been seen a positive for society because any sex can have any job, only exemption I know of is for frontline military jobs. Also addressing people by sex would help dating, for example BW or BM that wants a biological family would need the opposite sex to produce offspring. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming when someone identifies as the opposite gender, they're not talking about societal roles like cooking/laundry or mowing the lawn/carrying heavy objects, they're talking about sex. And with this I conclude it's impossible to misgenger someone."

Here is an excerpt from local TV station [KOB4's coverage](https://www.kob.com/new-mexico/protesters-shut-down-tomi-lahren-event-at-unm/) of the events. 

&gt;ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Conservative political commentator Tomi Lahren was scheduled to speak at the University of New Mexico Thursday night.
&gt; 
&gt; Lahren was invited as a guest speaker by the Turning Point USA student chapter at UNM.
&gt; 
&gt; However, a large crowd of protesters were upset Lahren was on campus during the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, according to Maddie Pukite, UNM student and managing editor at the Daily Lobo. Lahren has stirred up controversy with past statements about the Black Lives Matter movement and immigration.
&gt; 
&gt; Inside the Student Union Building on campus, cell phone video shows protesters outside the doors to the ballroom where Lahren was speaking.
&gt; 
&gt; UNM said a hole in the wall was made by protestors. University officials said they are “investigating these incidents and will hold anyone who violated the law or University policies accountable.”
&gt; 
&gt; Lahren and students inside the ballroom were escorted out. UNM officials said there were no injuries reported. 

I'm no fan of Tomi Lahren or TPUSA (and have no real doubt they wouldn't use the same tactics were the social dynamics in their favor) but this seems explicitly the thing conservatives mean when they say left* wing ""cancel culture,"" which I'll tentatively define as ""coordinated social pressure intended to induce a third party into disassociating from a target based on alleged moral transgressions."" 

\* ^(*I think it's wrong to conflate it with ""the left"" in general; it's not everyone on the left, but a small, determined minority.*)

In this case, the protestors even used physical and verbal intimidation to the point where UNM officials felt the need to escort Lahren and the students out. This was also a state university, with which the sponsoring group and speaker had both received approval for the event.

This is not how liberal democracies behave. There's an old saying that solution to bad speech is more speech. If the speech is so bad that it's about to incite lawless action, then the proper authorities can make that call and shut it down. There are civil remedies for tortious speech. To have crowds of protestors make these decisions, or force the authorities to make them in the name of public safety, is not a liberal society but vigilantism. 

On the one hand this is simply counterproductive. Rather than change anyone's mind who came to hear her speak, the protestors have likely validated her claims in the eyes of her audience there and elsewhere. Yet it also acts to justify (in their eyes, not morally or legally) right wing groups who want to shut down speech or activism through acts of intimidation. 

I can CMV if someone presents a compelling argument why normalizing this as an acceptable tactic is a good thing regardless of the fact right wingers will use it, too, or some consistent principle that can help us differentiate ""good"" uses of this tactic from ""bad"" ones."

I'm not gonna name any names, and I don't think we should be naming any names. It's not about whether or not so and so is or isn't a grifter anyway, because from the outside, a grifter and someone who does exactly the same thing for genuine reasons are exactly the same. As in, they appear exactly the same. 

OK, so let's say you have a swastika on your house. You wake up one morning and you see that there is a swastika on your house and you're all bugged about it. You get all worried and think that there might be some local NEO Nazi in the neighborhood. But when you check the camera, it turns out it's just the local kid. You know this kid. He's your kid. He just drew a swastika in your house because he was mad at you or something and you know he's not really? A neo Nazi. 

Does it really matter? You still have a swastika on your house, and for everyone else looking onward, they see a swastika and are still frightened. They still get the same message from it. Any local Neo Nazis within the area are still validated by the imagery, and any Jewish people there are still frightened. Sure, you try to tell them that it's all fake and that it's by a fake neo-Nazi, but it still doesn't matter. Fear and validation still ring throughout the neighbourhood. 

It's the same idea with Grifters. Why do people care so much about whether they're grifting or not. I mean, does it really matter if someone is grifting or doing it for genuine reasons?"

4. Full mobilization cant save the military war in Ukraine and will only weaken his hand in the domestic (dis)information war which ends in him losing everything.

5. Putin cannot afford to use nukes or chemical weapons in Ukraine because if he does he loses China as an ally and risks a conventional war with the US which ends in him losing everything.

6. Putin cannot afford to spark WWIII because it ends in him losing everything.

7. Putin cannot afford to be the aggressor in a nuclear war with the US because it ends in Russia being turned into glass and him losing everything.

Is this situation in Ukraine as bad as I think it is?

Russia is going to hold referendums which we know are going to inevitably give Russia / Putin the outcome they want.   Luhansk, Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Donetsk will all join Russia.  Ukrainian forces occupy land in all of these regions.

Putin has done the whole limited mobilization move, but even if that proves to be mildly successful, it'll take months before those troops are prepared to go into Ukraine in meaningful quantities.  In the meantime, Putin has to decide what to do.  He's got tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops running through ""Russia"" and is either going to look completely incompetent by doing nothing as they continue to battle through that territory for months or he can start dropping nukes to try and end the war.

I really don't see a third option here.  Russia has no more levers to pull that would help stop the progress Ukraine is making right now.  They have no way of making Ukrainian forces leave these supposedly annexed lands.  The west isn't going to recognize the referendums and will continue supplying Ukraine as if they never happened.  Heck, the west doesn't even recognize Crimea as Russian and that was after 8 years of Russian occupation.  They certainly won't recognize these referendums.

Putin has to have been thinking about this situation before saying he'd allow the referendums to go forward.  There is literally only one option he has at his disposal here and that is to use nukes.  Maybe tactical nukes on forces within ""Russia"" or maybe a strategic nuke on Kyiv.  Either way, what other options does he have?"

14,2022-09-21,CMV: CBT is more trendy than it is helpful.,u/Commerce_Street,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xk50ef/cmv_cbt_is_more_trendy_than_it_is_helpful/,changemyview,"I have always taken issue with the thought process of “You’re just not thinking about it the right way.” How can you, degree or not, tell someone that the way they experienced *their* trauma is the “wrong way” to go about thinking about it. If a traumatic experience happens, that’s just it. You can’t change how it happened, how you felt when it happened, or the end result.

My significant other passed from a heart defect last October and the therapist I had kept trying to get me to “reframe” my thoughts behind it. Reframe *what*? They’re dead, I was at work when it happened so now the job has a negative association, and I’m deathly afraid/severely anxious to date again because I don’t want to be died on. There is no changing that no matter how many “body awareness” exercises or homework sheets are assigned.

And yet so many healthcare professionals rave about how good and helpful CBT is just because of its sheer ubiquity. “So and so refers patients to CBT, so I will too.” Now laypeople are jumping on this bandwagon the second someone expresses needing therapy as if there aren’t other kinds. If you’re going to just tell a person that how *they* experienced trauma is wrong, you can leave that to an invalidating parent or other relative (as we all have at least one) for free. 

Essentially, when someone is feeling something deeply negative and painful from their past, telling them they’re “seeing it wrong” when it’s their life and not yours as a therapist is tone deaf and invalidating. The “cure” is counting to 10 to “ground yourself” and “being aware of each body part.” And then you’re charging them for it, and nothing is fixed.

*Edit*: Would like to put this here to say thank you everyone who turned this post into a support circle more than anything. I’m still wary of CBT due to how I was treated while in it but the explanations of how it should *ideally* be used are also helpful to know."

I'm talking about places like incels.co, the /pol/ board and to a lesser extent the red pill community.

Most moderate incels (from what I've lurked) lean on the conservative or lib-right side, but the ones who make lunatic posts on 4chan are obviously alt-right extremists. The latter probably need psychiatric help, so here I'm going to focus on the moderate incels.

I believe moderate incels are those who have adopted incel vocabulary and are using demeaning words to consider themselves above women. However, the moderate incels do have some legitimate complaints, such as the lack of father figures, the mainstream media's bias towards progressive viewpoints, and the general lack of emotional support towards men. 

Currently, influent media, celebrities, academia and many young people (especially women) tend towards progressive values on the left. Incels feel like this is a massive threat to their existence as people, as they find it difficult to maintain meaningful relationships in the real world, have daddy issues and cannot seem to be able to open up about their problems because of the fear they will be judged. 

These young men being so hateful is merely a consequence. I've mentioned in previous CMVs that men's movements have all went to shit. The lack of a positive such movement, that does not blame feminism, China or other external factors, was a major factor contributing to the rise of the incel mentality as we know it.

The fact that the incel community was started by a woman who just wanted to help and had a very positive support group in the beginning seemed awesome. But... ( and this is not the only time, happened to MRA as well) the community got toxic, and once she left it became a massive hellhole wasteland.

I'm wondering what causes the turn of initially positive men's movements towards the alt-right. Sure, you can try to heavily moderate them (but, from what I've noticed, such communities are insignificant in terms of reach, like r/menslib), but I'm wondering if this is because society as a whole still believes that men cannot have issues, that when they open up they are being told to man up, and the men's movements failing to send positive messages to the mainstream.

You cannot stop the incel mentality and the male identity crisis by just banning their communities. You're honestly just delaying the inevitable and I believe you really need to start talking. The incel community and the feminists need to have representatives capable of constructive criticism, that do not resort to sweeping statements. A moderator definitely needs to be present as well.

I'm thinking about the whole Poland elections back in 1989 between the communist party and the ""S"" opposition. The government banned ""S"" for eight years before finally allowing them back and starting to negociate. The same can be done here. I believe that only talk and openness from both parties can be done."

Given the recent announcement by Putin talking about nuclear weapons and defending Russia from Western powers, I have grown rather concerned about nuclear weapons being used. While I don't think full out nuclear war will happen, there is a scenario that I feel are not unlikely to happen.

Given that the Donbass region might undergo a referendum, Russia will claim that the Donbass region is part of Russia. Ukraine does not recognise this and pushes into the region and should they be successful, Russia will claim that that they have been invaded. Putin considers that all out nuclear war will not happen if he does a limited nuclear strike on Kiev and Western powers will back down for fear of nuclear war (this is similar to the belief that Western powers won't really intervene when he launched his special operation). With this consideration in mind, he launches his nuke at Ukraine.

Edit: was too hasty in posting. Went to change some grammar errors.
Edit 2: Its hard to argue against whether it can happen and i don't think i can change the title. So you can assume the title reads that a limited nuclear war is not unlikely to occur."

However, I've recently begun to question the underlying assumptions behind the sustainability movement. 

Nothing is truly, infinitely sustainable. The sun will eventually go nova, killing everyone on earth (if humans haven't already gone extinct by then). If humanity manages to escape Earth, then the universe will likely perish as well, depending on what model you accept. The universe is in a constant state of change, and nothing lasts forever. Is it better to be moderately happy for a long period of time or extremely happy for a short period of time? When talking about entire societies, I tend towards the latter, though on an individual basis I tend towards the former. 

Essentially, my question is this; what is the value in things that last a long time in a universe where nothing is eternal?"

The bullying and mockery they receive online is pretty collective, wether it’s just a meme or just outright ridicule lots of people do it (more often than not) and no one ever really sympathizes for them. 

Now I’m not from a religious family so maybe I am just being ignorant to what the Bible is really about. I do however have a few religious relatives, and they always described the Bible as more of a metaphorical text. However I’ve read online and had countless conversation with people who think the earth is only a few thousand years old, that carbon dating is a lie, dinosaurs didn’t exist, the list goes on. All of this is highly illogical and downright asinine. Yet when I say things like this I’m told I’m just being offensive and ignorant, and even people who aren’t religious will side with them and tell me it’s just disrespectful to say.

How are the two beliefs any different when neither are logical? Why is it seen as acceptable to mock flat earth logic but offensive to simply argue the logic of a person who believes that Noah was hundreds of years old when he built the ark?

0,2022-09-21,CMV: Insecure people are undateable.,u/AriValentina,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xkilfz/cmv_insecure_people_are_undateable/,changemyview,"To put it simple, insecure people bring bad vibes. Not only for themselves, but for you too. *First to clarify, even though I don’t really think anyone SHOULD be insecure, I can forgive anyone who suffers from unfair appearance deformities.*

Theres so many ways people show insecurity and all of the different ways annoy me. Caring too much about the opinions of others..Hella annoying. Refusing to show your face in a picture because you feel like your ugly.. Thats annoying too. Changing the way you act around certain people. Annoying as fuck. I would go as far as saying **being** insecure is bad, **showing** **insecurities** is **toxic**.

I know people who literally think insecure people are cute. My little brother has **literally** **said** he dates girls who are shy and insecure. Thats weird to me. I can get around dating a shy person(not me personally but other people), **I definitely wouldn't** look for that. Id hope that most people aren't like my little brother especially since he's a 17 year old boy and still mostly stupid, but I know there's a good bit of people who see those traits as cute. Toxic traits aren't cute and they aren't going to add anything good to your relationship.

My previous boyfriend was the worst. Our relationship didn't end only because of his insecurities, but I would say that was one of the biggest red flags for me. Obviously there's some fear behind being LGBTQ publicly with a lot of people. Thats fine, but I won't date anyone who's that invested in the publics opinion. I would maybe excuse it if it was illegal to be gay where we are, but it's not. In fact it's common here in Atlanta. He would buy all these outfits and random shit and not even wear them. It was always, ""I dont have my summer body yet"" , ""I dont want to look too gay"", ""People are going to be staring at me"". Thats all bullshit in my opinion. I have a mini gym in my house that he used pretty often. AKA he had his summer body all year round.

Then I have a couple friends who are the same, one friend in particular, whenever we hang out she tells me to dress up. We usually take pictures in clubs or just random parks in Atlanta. Then you look at her instagram page and all the pictures are face tuned (An app to photoshop/enhance your face) I always ask her why she's face tuning the fuck out of her face and she says she's ugly. The bitch is not ugly at all. And then if I take a picture of her with my own phone she has to go through the pictures and delete all the ones she hates. Obviously I have no interest in dating her regardless, but if I was a straight single male her insecurities would instantly make her a no.

Last example, I have a couple friends who I went to Miami with a couple months ago. At the beach one of them kept his shirt on, which isn't a big deal at all, no one even cared to say anything about it, but HE decided to announce that he doesn't wanna take off his shirt standing by all of us because he doesn't want to look bad in comparison. That pissed me off because he is the one comparing his body to everyone else. No one else was worried about his body and he decided to let his insecurities ruin his beach trip. When we went swimming at the house where it was just us he didn't care. Meaning its not even our (his FRIENDS) opinions that he's worried about, he's worried about random strangers opinions.

At the beginning of my relationship with my current boyfriend I was set on making sure he wasn't insecure because dealing with insecure people is draining and trying to fix people is even more draining. Its so much less to deal with, I don't have to spend an hour convincing him that his outfit is good enough to be seen in. I don't have to check his photos and make sure he looks okay in them before he post them. The confidence is a great trait to me. Me and him jokingly call each other ugly all the time. My ex would have cried for at least 2 hours if I jokingly called him ugly. I know there's people who want their partner to kind of be secretive with their body and things like that. I go to music festivals every summer, I literally **want** to see my half naked boyfriend stunting on bitches there. Why the hell would I want to date someone who feels like they are less than the people they are around?

In conclusion, ""if you cant love yourself how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?"" Stop caring about whatever the hell the people around you think of you. It's annoying and it makes whatever you're insecure about shine bright as hell. On top of all that, it's a turnoff."

Now, it is 2022. We still have the smartphone, and it is hella useful. There's a cliche saying: We have the world at our fingertips.

We can buy shit, learn new stuff, and even schedule dates with this thing. The first highly marketed smartphone came out in 2007, but it actually didn't really noticeably get into consumer hands until about 2010-2012. It's been 15 years, and still no new innovation. It seems like humanity has stagnated, and really, technology peaks with the smartphone. Sure, there's been improvement to these things; but the fundamental fact remains that the way people interact with these slabs of glass remains the same as in the early models. They look at their screens with their neck bent downwards, in order to access any type of convenience they desire, be it music, Amazon products, and Uber rides.

This sort of stagnation is worrying because although the smartphone revolutionized human convenience it also has made us more and more disconnected. We do not pay attention to our surrounds and to other people, like we used to. Read any tabloid or article online using your smartphone, and they all provide peer reviewed studies about smart phone addiction, rates of loneliness/anxiety/depression, and a decline in belonging and community. This is having really detrimental effects to younger generation(Mid-Late Millennials to Gen Z).

You see, my favorite era was probably the flip-phone era(late 90s-mid 2000s). It was really a time where there was a balance between convenience and paying fucking attention to others during social situations. Communicating with others was still fast and readily accessible with flip phones plus really groovy ring tones, and mass entertainment was still confined to your bedroom via tvs and gaming consoles, not at the palm of your hands. Sure, there were still portable gaming at the time; but it'd still look really weird holding around those nerdy gadgets in public settings, so even kids were encouraged, whether subconsciously or by their parents, to put them away. The difference between gaming in mobile phones and gaming in portable consoles is that smartphones don't look nerdy or awkward to walk around with.

And so, there needs to be some kind of revolutionary breakthrough in technology for our civilization to truly get past the smartphone; and finally look up again with our heads, and pay attention and appreciate our surroundings and our fellow man.

Unfortunately, I do not ever see something, which will be readily used for human convenience, to be even more advanced than the smartphone. Unless my fellow redditors give some insights on why society can truly subvert the Smartphone with a more convenient yet less socially degrading technology, I will remain forever pessimistic about people finally adopting technology which won't require us to always bend our necks down."

Alex Hershaft a holocaust survivor also used this comparison along with other vegan holocaust survivors.
""We're focusing on the victims rather than the cancer of oppression itself"",[8] and that ""I noted with horror the striking similarities between what the Nazis did to my family and my people, and what we do to animals we raise for food: the branding or tattooing of serial numbers to identify victims, the use of cattle cars to transport victims to their death, the crowded housing of victims in wood crates, the arbitrary designation of who lives and who dies — the Christian lives, the Jew dies; the dog lives, the pig dies.""[6

Also Alex Hershshaft looks extremely young considering he's 88 and survived concentration camps. That's irrelevant but I thought it interesting enough to mention considering he claims it's due to his vegan diet.

Taking time and listening the things we oppose with an open mind we can have respectful discussions about our progress as species, we as a society can build something great for all of us. 

We as the majority decide who is in power and when at any time we see fit, so we as a people are the government.

Though this is the basis of democracy, it applies outside of democracy. This applies to every false form of government.

Through many decades countries have discriminated against others for race, religion, sexuality and many other reasons, reasons that by today’s people is considered objectively wrong. 

This is why we must demand the things we want by standardizing for the cooperation of the people.
By banding together we can abolish and rebuild a society we se fit.
Dictatorship, oligarchy, democracy, could always be overturned if people come together. But we must first gather as a people and discuss what the basics of society should be.
So we can help those in highly corrupt and or oppressive countries.

We as humans can band together and as a collective give voting rights to all the people around the world, turning the planet into a giant democratic collective."

13,2022-09-22,CMV: Truth is an objective concept and should not be termed in the same manner as subjective concepts which are true for the individual,u/thecowintheroom,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xkwboi/cmv_truth_is_an_objective_concept_and_should_not/,changemyview,"My viewpoint on Truth is that Truth is an objective reality that can be reproduced by anyone who seeks to observe the thing claimed by an individual to be True.

Subjective truths like the notion that God exists may be true for the individual: like it is for me. Gods existence is subjective because there is no proof that God exists. Likewise there is no proof that God does not exist. The question “Does God exist?” cannot therefore be answered in terms of Truth. 

The absence of provable fact in either direction on the question of Gods existence does not mean it is True that God does or does not exist. The absence of evidence to support a conclusion only means that a rational person cannot claim that the question of Gods existence is True for anyone besides the person considering the question. Even if one believes that God’s existence has been proven for you personally, through experience or faith, faith alone does not prove God. 

Therefore I propose that the word truth is too expansive, and does not appropriately describe things we think of as true or not. Truth must be reproducible, objective, and True for everyone. Otherwise we must create a new term for what is currently thought of as true. Perhaps some system of capitalization is sufficient.  Is Truth intact?

Edit;

Thank you everyone. 

I’d say my view has changed to truth being unknowable and what I would even call mutable in that what is true can change. I’m not going to pretend I understood every arguement. Pretty much everyone here is worlds ahead of me intellectually but I do appreciate everyone’s responses and conversation. I can say confidently that now I have no idea what truth is. There is only my existence. It’s the only thing I can verify because I keep being confronted by it. But even then I can’t discern if it’s a true experience. I know nothing at all and that’s okay. I don’t feel like I’d know truth if it slapped me in the face.

Truth is not an objective or subjective. It could be unknowable, But it’s definitely beyond my capabilities to discern. I feel like we’re all living in different worlds. I can see why people hold on to what they think they know. I can see why truth is so alluring. Of course we want to know something in this life, even if that something is rhetoric parading as fact.

The press won't do the one thing that would end him.  That's to ignore him. For a group that is supposedly against Trump, they happily oblige to the faux conspiracy that the news is out to get him.  Anything to sell clicks, anything for attention... The two love each other and make each other stronger.

What would happen if the spotlight was suddenly turned off? If his name wasn't mentioned?  He'd still be under investigation, he'd still be in court.... But nobody would be there to hear him scream... Which would mean he wouldn't be on the news cycle 24/7 which means the focus would be on things that matter.  

Politicians need to be ""in the news"" ... It's free advertising, and the only way to get in front of huge number of voters.  Being able to turn negative stories into positive ones is a talent.... Probably the only true talent that Trump has."

270,2022-09-22,"CMV: The right to protest against the government in the US is a facade that makes citizens think they have way more power than they actually do, and most modern-day protests are a waste of time and resources",u/MtnDewTV,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xl4tp0/cmv_the_right_to_protest_against_the_government/,changemyview,"First, I think history has shown what great achievements and civil liberties can be obtained through peaceful protests and demonstrations. The right to peacefully assemble was written into the first amendment and is always regarded as one of our most sacred freedoms and one of the most powerful tools for democracy. However, while I definitely appreciate having the right to protest, nowadays the US is a \~*relatively*\~ equal and fair society in terms of the law and protests have become less and less effective and/or meaningful. Maybe it's just from personal experience, but I believe that a majority of protests today are ultimately a poor use of time and largely inefficient, and that time spent protesting could be used in much more beneficial ways to advance a view.

To this, I see two main types of protests in my life; local protests that are typically focused on more specific issues smaller in size; and national protests that typically occur from a certain mass publicized event or national issue.

**Examples of** **Local Protests:**

I Lived in DC for 3 years and worked right by the white house, so I have had a lot of personal experience with local protests. Every day that I walked to work there would be a new group on the street corner protesting some weirdly specific cause. After a while it honestly just becomes commonplace and you don't even notice them. I saw hundreds of them over the years and honestly can't remember the specific cause for any of them. DC is seemingly the best place you want to go to protest if you want to be seen/feel heard, but honestly, protests are so oversaturated no one is listening to you.

Now in my new city, the issues I have with local protests are a bit different. Currently, I live in a much smaller blue city (really town) in a blue state. A few weeks after SCOTUS revealed their ruling on Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a protest marched down my street demanding women's rights be restored. Look I am all for a women's right to choose, but what exactly do they expect to accomplish from having a protest over a right they still have. As I said, I live in a pretty-blue town in a very-blue state. Our state has built-in abortion protections and an amendment in the state constitution granting women the right to choose. These types of protests are just a waste of time for the participants.

**Examples of** **National Protests:**

According to organizers, the goal of the women's march the day after Trump's election was to ""send a bold message to our new administration on their first day in office, and to the world that women's rights are human rights"". What is this really supposed to accomplish though? Trump wasn't going to be removed from office for being sexist, and I doubt he saw the protests and suddenly realized he should treat women with respect.

Same with the BLM protests in 2020 following George Floyd, I support the movement and also wish to see change, however marching on the street ain't going to do all that much. Think about how many people joined in protesting, and how many total manhours were used when protesting. If you want to better racial equality in America it would be way more effective for people to instead spend time doing things like mentoring underprivileged youth, raising money for local community centers, working in homeless shelters or soup kitchens, etc.

**Final Point:**

I can go on and on about all the dumb protests I have seen or areas where they are ineffective, but ultimately the only ""useful"" or ""successful"" protests I have seen against the government are those that are just online. If you want to use a protest to spread awareness then a hashtag is just as effective and less burdensome. Ironically I used to hate political activists on social media, now I see them personally as dumb still, however a much better use of time and efficient at spreading a message. Internet campaigns that include the phone numbers of local congressmen make it much easier for people to voice their displeasure, etc.

In-person protests though are only good at harming other citizens, and practically never bring about government change. I guess really just ""Cancel Culture."" Companies will pander to protesters, and universities have canceled speaker's events due to outcry. These are all areas where protests work, whether you agree with what they are protesting or not.

TL;DR: My CMV is that protesting against the government is rather inefficient today and any protest against government action or laws are almost always a less effective means at achieving a group's goal.

EDIT: After reading through some opposing viewpoints, I now believe local protests centered around local laws can be useful. However I don't think physical, national protests are that important anymore and don't bring about any real change that other efforts might. "

The people around me seem to feel very strongly that someone who had an OnlyFans account or worked as a stripper is not fit to teach or otherwise work with children. My feeling is that kids shouldn't be on OnlyFans or going to strip clubs anyway, so it's not like they would know about their teacher's past. I admit that a parent might recognize them, but that means that the parent was engaging those services. Since I don't think going to a strip club, for example, makes someone unfit to work with kids, I don't understand how working at a strip club makes someone unfit to work with kids. 

However, I recognize that I have a lot of biases when it comes to sexuality. When this topic came up I was in argument mode, not understanding mode. Now that I'm home, I'm researching to see if I have any blind spots when it comes to former sex workers as educators or generally in jobs that interact with children.

I want to keep the conversation focused on legal sex work, because I understand why a criminal background is a problem regardless of my feelings about whether or not the activity should be a crime."

I grew up as a Jehovah's Witness, which was unpleasant, and as such I hold a lot of strong views 

I think most of us know that nurture really defines a lot of us and our actions. I'll always maintain that not all actions are excusable, but they are explainable. When we start creating the idea of monsters, we negate the human aspects

I don't think there's even a collection of sins that could warrant an ETERNITY of torture. I grew up thinking that punishment was for rehabilitation . If there's no further step past hell, the torture is merely for the satisfaction of another; that's spite. Spite is a sin in itself. There you have a paradox 

""We are created sick and commanded to be well""

It's lunacy to impart guilt on someone who hasn't done anything wrong except exist. No innocent little child is fallable

Edit: Apparently hell isn't a bad place, and this concept of torture and eternity isn't want the bible says. This feels again like everyone can interpret what they want, and any discussion about what is promoted is merely just misrepresentation, that it isn't that bad. This doesn't change my mind on the stricter or even looser terminology

I would honestly like my view to be changed as my view is against the majority belief in my dorm. (lol). 

I had this situation I found weird recently where I called myself a retard and people called me out because I shouldnt be using the ""R-word."" I found this extremely weird, even to the point of frustration as it was a big culture shock. My family and friends all revolved around the belief that context matters infinitely more than individual words, so barely any words were off limits.

Anyways, after this incident, I decided to stay up for a few hours to research why ""retard"" was such a taboo word. After reviewing a bunch of articles and videos, the consensus seems to be - ""The word retard has been used to harm/put down people and therefore should not be used."" 

But to me, that makes no sense at all. If I used the word Fat as an example, I could call myself fat and no one would bat an eye, but if I call someone fat with the intent of harm - then fat fits in to the same criteria as retard.

I could also give an example of being rude or harmful without even using words. If I go up to someone with a serious mental disorder and say aggresively, ""The fuck is wrong with you?"" Im fairly sure that could be taken at a serious level of harm as just saying retard.

But all of these examples dont address the point of context - Any and every word can be used to induce harm, so why do we categorize specific words as off limits? 

Wouldnt it make more sense to condemn those who actually use certain words to harm someone else. Like rather than getting upset at a word, wouldnt it make more sense to get upset at the person calling a handicapped person retarded?"

-accept god as the creator and one true god.
-sin is human nature, but we must resist the urge.  
-if we have sinned we must ask forgiveness
-only by doing these things can we avoid eternal punishment.

My main problem is with the unflinching acceptance that god created our reality.  I don’t understand how anybody could be so sure.  Rationality is based in logical analysis of our experience and corroboration.  Without a material experience of something and no data whatsoever, it is impossible to make a rational claim about that something. 
So how can a rational person literally dedicate their entire life to something with no material foundation and no evidence.  The only thing validating Christianity is it’s widespread acceptance.  “If so many people believe it then it must have merit.”  But that thought in itself is irrational.  It’s irrationality has been proven over and over.  People believed that earth was the center of the universe, that’s obviously not true.  So how is Christianity any different?"

Small scale actions such as sending a small number of troops to destroy/secure a stolen nuclear weapon or sending some troops as advisors to a foreign country are not included in my CMV.**

According to Wikipedia,

""The Powell Doctrine states that a list of questions all have to be answered affirmatively before military action is taken by the United States:

1 Is a vital national security interest threatened?

2 Do we have a clear attainable objective?

3 Have the risks and costs been fully and frankly analyzed?

4 Have all other non-violent policy means been fully exhausted?

5 Is there a plausible exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement?

6 Have the consequences of our action been fully considered?

7 Is the action supported by the American people?

8 Do we have genuine broad international support?""

I think following this doctrine is good since it encourages the US to only get into war that are important for US interests, have a realistically achievable victory and an exit strategy, as well as support both domestically and abroad in many countries.  The Afghanistan and Iraq Wars failed to meet the Powell Doctrine which led to many problems manifesting even if the initial invasion was successful.  

Following the doctrine would help prevent the US from starting unpopular wars that do not provide benefits that outweigh the costs."

Im not sure how this world would work but I actually think that legislation in this world would be more strict as far as abortions goes if that were to happen.

It’s a decision made by a couple people so I don’t see why this would change if their reason for it is based on religion and morals so I don’t see why it would get less stringent"

0,2022-09-22,CMV: I should Abandon Canada,u/HellianTheOnFire,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xlhsfg/cmv_i_should_abandon_canada/,changemyview,"I've been noticing things in Canada declining since I was about 10 and I'm 33 now, so basically my whole life things have gotten worse and the rate they are getting worse is just getting faster and faster, things were bad enough under Harper but ever since Trudeau took over everything has just seemed to fall off a cliff.

Inflation is insane and cost of living increases are outpacing inflation, healthcare is failing, wages are dogshit, job searching is a horrible experience, infrastructure is getting worse, traffic is getting worse, taxes are getting worse and if that wasn't all bad enough the government is constantly passing legislation to roll back our rights and make things harder AND on top of that we have no community no culture, no social cohesion or interaction of any kind, I remember we used to have block parties when I was a kid... now the only way to meet anyone is to go to a bar or club or find them on a horrible dating site, there's nothing left.

If all those problems weren't bad enough it's not like the government (or anyone) is even trying to solve them, all our policies just make the problems worse even the ones specifically designed to improve them... ""affordable housing"" initiatives are just putting more money into the market and while it's helpful for the (very) few people that are being subsidized in the short term it makes everything more expensive in the long term. And then our immigration numbers and policies are just fucking stupid, they were high under Harper but Harper understood and mitigated the issues, for example we had programs to integrate immigrants and we'd take them from everywhere so they wouldn't form cultural enclaves, because there'd be one from Jamaica, one from japan, one from Afghanistan and one from Nigeria all in the same program, instead of taking 500 from the same place and putting them in the same place with zero programs to integrate them.

We don't build enough houses for the amount of new people coming, Trudeau has more than doubled Harpers already high numbers, none of our infrastructure can keep up, it's a big reason our healthcare is failing too, and you'd think with 600+ immigrants a year we'd have an over representation of doctors and nurses and stuff, you know the type of people we are in desperate need of? But nope, instead we increase the number of 65+ year old that can come, and do nothing to make it so the doctors/nurses that do come can get their credentials transferred so they can actually work in the fucking field... the fact that Trudeau can't even do that much is just flat out disgusting.

Then there's the rampant spending, debt and taxes. Despite everything failing we are paying a premium on taxes with the vast majority of it being shat away or flat out stolen (by our PM no less) 100 million on 2 spirit... how the fuck do you even spend 100 million on that... and then there's the SNC scandal and other stuff... meanwhile inflation is out of control, our debt (and our interest on that debt...) is rising. Oh and the one type of inflation that the government is interested in combating? Wage inflation, because god forbit people get enough money to weather this bullshit.

Then there's the right stealing bullshit, weakening the right to self-defense while letting murderers out in 5 years on a conviction the next day on bail... cracking down on the right to protest, freezing people's bank accounts because they donated to said protest, taking guns away from legal owners because the problem isn't the ones coming in from the states that the criminals buy... there's one that's like taking away our right to publish what we want on the internet or something I don't know the details, honestly it's too exhausting to keep up with all the bullshit the government is doing...

And to make matters worse there's 2 years before the next election, that's 2 years before things MIGHT start to start getting better and that's if the conservatives win and they'd probably have to win a majority to do anything anything and even if they do win and even if it a majority there's no guarantee they'll do anything to actually fix the problems, I'm confident they'll make things worse slower than Trudeau at the very least but that still means things would be actively getting worse...

Even as my own personal life gets better I find myself depressed, I got a raise last month normally something to celebrate but I'm just depressed 5% raise with 8% inflation and essentials being even more than that... basically my hard work is shat on in the environment that is Canada.

So yeah with all this in mind what other option do I have other than getting the hell out of dodge, but it's not like it's easy or fun or even something I want to do. First of all getting my passport is going to take forever (because that's another thing that's broken in this country) then there's the issue of where the fuck do I move to, the states is the obvious option if I can get in, that'd be lower taxes, lower rent, more money though the cultural issues will probably be similar but I have a feeling it's not as bad down there either given how anytime I talk about how bad things on in general online most people are like it's not that bad you're exaggerating and they are from the states. Then there's countries like Brazil and Romania that I've been eying places that might be worse by some metrics but are likely going to be infinitely better for me as an individual but then I'd have to learn the language and cultural norms and stuff. Then there's the whole abandoning my country instead of trying to make it better thing.

So yeah I'm starting to think leaving the country is the only sane option even though I'd rather not do it because of the issues involved with moving, going somewhere alone leaving all your friends and family which isn't going to be great for my anxiety (another issue with Canada record number of mental illness among young people), learning a new language and cultural norms (unless I can get into the states), getting my passport, moving all my stuff over there or selling it and buying new stuff... and of course the whole abandoning the place I was born and grew up...

So yeah CMV please."

0,2022-09-23,"CMV: The entire Star Wars franchise should be rebooted, not sequeled and prequeled. Even including the original trilogy as the continuity has become muddled and shackled to the events of the first film.",u/i_look_good_in_black,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xlufkv/cmv_the_entire_star_wars_franchise_should_be/,changemyview,"I am likely gonna earn some downvotes for this.

The Star Wars Movies and all the tv shows, legends, comics etc are victims of the old proverb ""too many cooks spoil the broth"". Released over 40 years ago, the entire franchise was never designed to be subject to the same canon for long and the new shows, Obi-Wan, Andor, Clone Wars demonstrate this.

Part of good story telling is consistency and not knowing how the story ends . The original movie was simple, good versus evil, giant killer weapon explodes and good guys (except the wookie) get medals. A classic movie. The sequels TESB and ROTJ build on this stories to produce the hollywood trilogy and each are good/excellent movies in their own right. Then the Ewok movies followed it in true direct to video fashion for the time and were forgotten about quickly after.

The prequel trilogy tried (and failed IMO) to recapture the magic of the first movies but here the spoilage began to show. Inconsistencies in the story/character background began to show: Eg Leia somehow being able to remember her mother through images/feelings (ROTJ) despite Padme dying in childbirth (ROTS). Of course there was some comic/EU novel that explain how that was the case but for most SW fans this is the non-original authors trying to patch/retcon something that the writers never thought to do a proper backstory to 20 years before.

Then came the CGI Clone Wars to fill the gap between Attack of the Clones and ROTS.  A seemingly endless thread of irrelevant plots that made the 3-4 year long clone wars seem like an eternity. Having already being made in the actual period between the movies (2003 Clone wars), this new CGI show introduced characters (Ashoka) who were never mentioned in the ROTS or even conceived of during the writing of the prequel trilogy. And now serious problems with continuity begin.

ROTS establishes that Anakin and Grevious never meet until that moment and now there exists a TV series that seemingly retcons that. (EDIT: I STAND CORRECTED ON THAT ONE. THANKS TO POSTER WHO POINTED THAT OUT : [https://screenrant.com/clone-wars-anakin-skywalker-general-grievous-never-met-why/](https://screenrant.com/clone-wars-anakin-skywalker-general-grievous-never-met-why/))   


There are dozens of more examples of this where the writing of older movies/tv shows gets superseded by the writers of the present material who probably get so frustrated with having these story/expanded universe limitations on their own ideas that they either accidental or deliberately ignore/disregard the canon in favor of their own original ideas about things went down.

The original star wars was not written and designed with the scale of expanded media that it would have being built on it. The constant efforts by disney and lucasarts to squeeze in as many interquels is dragging down the quality of the writing of shows that must conform to the fixed starting off points of movies/other tv shows. The more sequels that get produced further strains and dilutes the quality of the original films: the skywalker trilogy is an example of this, by bringing back the Emperor and the Sith despite Luke and Vader having destroyed them in ROTJ. The original ending was that Evil was destroyed and the empire smashed beyond repair yet the empire manages to make an evil bigger death star in the Skywalker triliogy. Rebels and the mandelorian also do this by having other jedi survive to the ROTJ timeline which contradicts Yoda saying Luke is the last Jedi.

On the otherside of this are the fixed estabished unchangable parts of the story that lead to the problems with the new Disney+ material. Obiwan, Leia and Vader have to survive because of the original movie. Cassian Andor's life is a forgone conculsion because of Rogue One. What he does in the meantime is just backstory and subject to the restraints that he must survive until the end and become the character we see. The Mandelorian also suffers from this because of the Skywalker trilogy. Baby Yoda must either die or never become a jedi, because the Skywalker trilogy establishes that Rey is the last jedi. Of course in 5 years Disney+ will release a TV show about another Jedi who contradicts this.

The only solution to this overbloated mess is to do a hard reset on whole Franchise. Reboot the whole thing. Reimage Darth Vader, make Luke skywalker a gritty dark character or the Death Star an allegory for something more contemporary. It would undoubtly trigger the same reaction with fans as when the expanded universe got demoted to Legends but to preserve the legacy of the series and prevent it from become more like the Simpsons (something that should have ended at season 10) and allow better story telling to take place, it should be done in my opinion."
0,2022-09-23,CMV: Trump cannot win the 2024 election unless he runs unopposed in the Republican primaries,u/Subtleiaint,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xlvjdf/cmv_trump_cannot_win_the_2024_election_unless_he/,changemyview,"I'm not American but, like many, I'm worried about a possibility of a Trump return to the Whitehouse. Amongst my peers there is a sense of dread with many thinking his return is inevitable. I'm not convinced, I think there's plenty of reasons he won't win (and I'm not even including legal disqualification due to criminal conduct) but I also worry I'm in denial. Therefore I wanted to test one of my arguments, that the Republican primaries are going to be a blood bath.

Let's say there are 5 Republicans in the primaries, one of which is Trump, Trump is the immediate front runner and will have a target painted on him. At that point the other contenders will go to town on his record in an effort to bring him down, they don't even need to to go after the big lie and Jan 6th, there's plenty for them to attack him without those. This causes a problem for the Republican base, they can shrug off  attacks from Democrats and the 'main-stream media' as partisan lies, it's much harder to do that when Republicans are saying it. Of course this will lead to accusations of 'Republican in name only' but that card's been played, it was east to dismiss Cheney but that accusation will sound hollow against someone like DeSantis.

We saw something similar in the recent Conservative party leadership contest in the UK to decide the next Prime Minister, they tore strips off each other and the campaigns got heated, the candidates were controversial, but nothing compared to Trump. The left wing press had a field day at the free ammunition showing clips of the Tories attacking their own record. It will be just as bad, and probably much worse, with Trump, there is no way he or his opponents are going to be civil or tactful.

The carnage in the primaries will hit the Republicans where it hurts, with the independents and centrists, they'll look at the Republicans spewing bile at one another and compare that to the calm, considerate Biden and the choice will be easy, they'll support Biden.

What do you think, can Trump succeed after a competitive Primary campaign?"

things like puppy mills and such require no explanation as to why they’re cruel, and i don’t see how breeding is any different. i understand there are breeders that care for the dogs and aren’t in it solely for the money, but i am still unsure of their motives, if not for money. forcing dogs to have sex to create puppies when there are too many puppies being mistreated on the street and in abusive homes is unreasonable. you want to mix two (or more) dog breeds because you think you’ll make this new amazing breed of dog? why? it’s unnecessary. dog breeds are fine as is today, and dogs don’t deserve to be treated like science experiments. they aren’t rats or guinea pigs- and especially the innocent puppies that are born as a result of breeding experiments. 

i want to be educated on this topic, because i must be missing something. why create new dog breeds other than you’re curious to see what will happen? and why do people think that’s okay?

edit: since people have commented and educated me, i now understand that breeding does have ethical purposes, such as creating hypoallergenic dogs, working dogs, keeping purebreds pure etc. i think as long as it is done safely, with the dog’s best interest in mind, and is done by professionals that understand they are working with the real lives of dogs and puppies, i don’t view it as unethical. i still think if breeding is done without true purpose, it’s unreasonable because of the dog breeds that are already existing and innocent puppies that need homes to go to. 

i respect and appreciate the ethical breeders that are only trying to improve dogs’ and people’s lives."
8,2022-09-23,"CMV: The harder it is to catch a method of cheating, the greater the punishment should be",u/minilip30,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xlwfn7/cmv_the_harder_it_is_to_catch_a_method_of/,changemyview,"Chess is currently going through a major scandal right now, where a Grandmaster is being accused of cheating. This has opened a major discussion of cheating at high level play, and how it is extremely difficult to catch certain methods. 

This got me thinking about cheating in general and how it should be dealt with. 

In my opinion, the punishment for cheating should be based on 3 factors:

1. The impact of the cheating on the result
2. The ""real world"" impact of the cheating
3. The difficulty of catching the cheater

Imagine a scenario where 2 people are cheating on their SAT's. The first person writes a bunch of formulas on their leg. The second person attaches a tiny vibrating button to their tooth that vibrates out the formulas in Morse code. They both get the same information, but one is practically impossible to catch while the other is relatively obvious. I believe that the person cheating in the harder to catch way should receive a significantly larger punishment to deter others from doing the same thing.

Catching every single cheater is going to be impossible. It is much more time and cost effective to prevent cheating in the first place. Making the punishment for hard to catch cheating more stringent provides an important incentive against developing these types of cheating methods.

I know that I'm late to the discussion, but here it is. Please don't slaughter me.

Quick  refresher, here's what started the beef. In 2012 MGK, who was a huge  Eminem fan at the time, tweeted ""I have to say, \[Eminems daughter  Hailie\] is hot as fuck, in the most respectful way possible cuz Em is  king"". At the time Hailie was 16 years old. MGK later claimed that for  one it was a joke, and for two he didn't know she was a minor. According  to MGK, 6 years later Eminem's team contacted him, asking him to issue a  public apology, and he refused. Allegedly he was subsequently banned  from a radio station, called Shade 45, by Eminem, but Eminem denies  this. MGK would go on to rap two lines fronting Eminem, them being:  ""You're not a rap God you just rap"" and ""I'm my favorite rapper since my  favorite rapper banned me from shade 45"". Eminem later dropped a  surprised album in which he fronted a multitude of people, one of which  was MGK. Two days later MGK released an Eminem disstrack titled ""Rap  Devil"", and two weeks later Eminem released an MGK disstrack titled  ""killshot"".

I guess who was  morally in the right comes down to who of the both was lying, but it  seems weird for MGK, who was a major Eminem fan up until then, to just  randomly fabricate some story about being banned from Shade 45 to  mention Eminem twice on a freestyle album.

Often  people will criticize both tracks for their superficiality. A large  amount of lines on both sided were dedicated to looks and fashion, and a  very large part of rap devil is dedicated to no more than Eminems age.  But I feel like this applies more to killshot than it does to rap devil.  Nobody cared for Eminems line relating MGK's manbun, not even, and this  is vital, MGK himself. As for Eminem, he's clearly insecure about his  age/looks, as evidenced by the fact that he's had multiple facial beauty  surgeries, so insulting his looks is really just the natural part for  MGK to take.

Additionally, while  Eminem's lines were pretty much exclusively shallow insults, clever word  play, or quippy comebacks, MGK does have some actual comments  addressing the beef at hand, or problems with Eminem on a larger scale.

A  lot of people will argue that Eminem's track was better as it had a  more complex rhyme scheme, more entendres, etc.. I think this is quite  relevant to which song would be a better poem, but isn't relevant to  which is a better disstrack. Rap Devil almost undisputedly sounds  better, and some cool stylistic tricks cannot make a song good; they can  merely make an already good song better, or make a bad song less bad.  Sure, Eminem did demonstrate that he is lyrically talented, but that's  it really.

Anyway, that's just my humble opinion."

My impression is largely from the 1971 debate with Noam Chomsky on human nature, published as a book \[and [aired on Dutch TV, abridged](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8)\]. I’m not using the debate to imply that Chomsky has the final word on anything, but I do think that much more of what he argued has weathered the subsequent 50 years of criticism from scientific and other academic fields. I understand why Foucault is taken seriously in philosophy. I don’t understand how he passes as a citable authority in other disciplines, especially ones that affect systems like teacher training and law.

I’d like to know what’s so impressive about his paradigm, preferably from someone who sees more of value than I do in it. I haven’t read him outside of this debate, and my best guess is that he had some insight or two into the weaponization of psychological science in the early-mid 20th century.

I know more about the context of Chomsky’s participation in the debate, which had a lot to do both with his criticism of the American war in of Vietnam, as well as with his linguistics work and subsequent criticisms of behaviorist psychology.

I’m no psychologist, but my understanding is that in the 1950s most psychologists considered humans to be more or less blank slates, moulded by social reward and punishment. Their models of human behavior ultimately rested on a set of simplistic causal assumptions about phenomena external to the subject, e.g. in goes social reinforcement, out comes behavior.

B.F. Skinner (easily the most influential behaviorist) explicitly rejected even the idea of an internal moral sense, instead favoring a characterization of morality in terms of social sanctions imposed by culture \[[example](https://youtu.be/Bc-j1PQBZvU?t=1191)\], though in this case, when pressed he pays lip service and acknowledges token contributions of genetic endowment. As examples he gives maternal behavior, and ironically a canard about animals sacrificing themselves for the good of the species, indicating he’s largely rejecting things he doesn’t fully understand.

I would assume behaviorism produced some things of value, but regarding our understanding of ourselves, I’d suppose fixating on inputs and outputs at the expense of innate cognitive structures could have been the [streetlight effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect) in action, given what little we knew about neuroscience at the time.

In 1959 Chomsky published his [review](https://chomsky.info/1967____/) of B.F. Skinner’s *Verbal Behavior,* which played an important role in overturning the behaviorist paradigm, as well as rehabilitating the study of mental faculties, which had become passé, antiquated, regressive, etc. I’m getting this from people like neurobiologist [Robert Sapolsky](https://youtu.be/SIOQgY1tqrU?t=2480) (who overviews the relevant literature in human and primate language acquisition), and linguists [Steven Pinker and John McWhorter](https://youtu.be/NeHW0MJSxMs?t=2073)—the latter painting Chomsky as having left Skinner “a smoking ruin,” rhetorically, at least.

Briefly, Chomsky’s argument (as presented to Foucault) goes something like: children can’t help but learn any human language they’re exposed to, they generalize universal grammatical structures from sparse and imperfect data, and they generate novel sentences appropriate to novel situations. Thus, there is something giving structure to human language, and giving us a generative capacity to use it. External reinforcement alone cannot explain this, suggesting an innate component \[[4:48](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=288)\].

As far as I can tell, the Foucault seen in the debate has no curiosity about language acquisition. His responses are generally tangential to the points, tending to focus on individual words and things he associates them with over Chomsky’s intended meaning in the current context—something that apparently absolves him of engaging the substance of any argument that uses words like “human nature” \[[9:04](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=544)\], “creativity” \[[18:19](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=1099)\], or “justice” \[[52:18](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=3138)\].

What’s the problem with these concepts? Ultimately, that they are constrained by existing society, i.e. [nothing gets past this guy](https://i.redd.it/cqup1pqz9sw21.jpg).

The most directly he ever addressed Chomsky’s central argument was during one dismissal that veered more toward counter assertion than misdirection. That is, he “wonders” whether language and all our important concepts are external to the human mind, in “in social forms, in relations of production, in class struggle, etc.” \[[31:07](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=1867)\]. This assertion appears again throughout the debate in less modest terms.

He gives the full account most concisely at the end:

&gt;\[[1:02:47](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=3767)\] “I will simply say that I can’t help but to think that the concepts of human nature, of kindness, of justice, of human essence and its actualization… all of these are notions and concepts that have been created within our civilization, our knowledge system, and our form of philosophy, and that as a result they form part of our class system; and one can’t however, regrettable it may be, put forward these concepts to describe or justify a fight which should—and shall in principle—overthrow the very fundaments of our society. This is an extrapolation for which I can’t find the historical justification.”

Foucault seems generally unaware or unconcerned that while his societal prescriptions obviously deviate from B.F. Skinner’s, they share a set of assumptions about causality in human behavior, i.e. a description of human morality, language, etc. solely in terms of external factors. Ergo, in giving no cause to dismiss concepts other than by virtue of their being (what he considers) arbitrary fabrications of class society, he undermines the legitimacy of his own paradigm (both its prescriptions and descriptions) by the same reasoning.

Politically, the only way to make sense of Foucault (as far as I can tell) is to seriously entertain a few things:

1. **Fundamental aspects of society are necessarily wrong, merely because they are extant**. This is heavily implied to hold more generally for any concept produced by society, except of course for certain variations on extant ideas about the malleability of human beings and the inevitability of social and political revolution.I understand the debate is short, but he spends so much time nitpicking words that avoids the substance of Chomsky’s arguments and his own just the same. To be fair, there’s something to be said for “do whatever the normies don’t do” as an aesthetic. It makes for interesting art and music. But it’s hard to overstate what a shit substitution it is for morality or epistemology.
2. **People are ideology’s way of making more ideology**, sort of like an evolutionary biologist might consider a chicken to be “an egg’s way of making another egg,” only in the case of people and ideology we’re supposed to assume it’s the most useful lens absent rational argument, empirical justification, or demonstrated predictive utility.I think in his work he’s got some vague notion of an “episteme.” He says it’s a kind of grid or collection of grids that impose structure on human language, morality, knowledge production, etc. I’m unclear whether he thinks this thing exists independent of humans, or it’s something like an emergent property of human societies—I’m sure some version of the idea isn’t completely ridiculous. But at his level of specificity, he might as well be trying to sell me on the luminiferous aether or the collective unconscious. And of course, again he tacitly assumes with zero justification the causal absence of biology in uniquely human behaviors and faculties.
3. **An effective way for human beings to escape the clutches of hegemonic ideology is to reject key words used by people who justify society**.Foucault’s rhetorical strategy often demands words to be borderline supernatural in their ability to convey insidious concepts, such that any two people who use the same word automatically mean the same insidious thing, even when the terms are objectively contentious ones. The closest hint we have of his understanding that words sometimes mean different things to different people is when he cites Mao Zedong for distinguishing “bourgeois human nature” from “proletarian human nature” \[[42:58](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=2578)\]. Aside from that he acts as if Chomsky’s concept of human nature would keep us in chains right alongside all the others, presumably because he hasn’t even sufficiently *modified* the words used by the capitalists.

And what exactly is the meat of the disagreement while they’re on the subject of justice and political action? Chomsky urges that that definitions of important concepts (civil disobedience, in this case) need not be ceded to states and other institutions that would define them in their own interests. Always with examples, in this case says that derailing an ammunition train on its way to Vietnam is a greater justice that’s illegitimately regarded by specific institutions as unjust and illegal \[[47:46](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=2866)\]. Foucault alludes in response to some contemporary ideas about police oversight in France, speculating that these will fail because people who talk about it use the word “justice” and… you guessed it, we’re back to #1: *society says X ergo not X*. \[[52:18](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=3138)\]

Foucault tries his best to say “class war” whenever Chomsky says “justice,” unfazed by the fact that they can both continue talking about the thing that plays the same motivating role in their political lives. Facilitating class war is what unmistakably animates Foucault (being the “real political task”) as if it were a moral imperative. But still, he insists he is not in the pursuit of justice:

&gt;\[[55:51](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=3351)\]: “the proletariat doesn’t wage war against the ruling class because it considers such a war to be just. The proletariat wages war against the ruling class because it wants for the first time in history, to take power. And because of its will to overthrow power it considers such a war to be just.”

And when Chomsky suggests that a proletarian revolution leading to a terroristic police state would be rightly viewed as unjust (I take that roughly as “you can’t fool all the people all the time”), we have Foucault, fallaciously:

&gt;\[[57:09](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=3429)\] “When the proletariat takes power, it may be quite possible that the proletariat will exert a violent, dictatorial, and even bloody power. But if you ask me what would happen if the proletariat exerted bloody, tyrannical and unjust power toward itself, then I would say that this could only occur if the proletariat hadn’t really taken power, but that a class outside the proletariat, or group of people inside the proletariat, or a bureaucracy or petit bourgeois elements, had taken power.”  
&gt;  
&gt;\[[59:41](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=3581)\] “I don’t think it would be sufficient to say that \[class war\] is in itself a greater justice. What the proletariat will achieve by expelling the ruling class and by taking power is precisely the suppression of class power in general… In a classless society, I am not sure that we would still use this notion of justice.”

So we learn that even though injustice is presumably still a bourgeois fabrication, we can use the word as long as the proletariat never perpetrates it, and is always its victim. This is because if any part of the proletariat were to inflict injustice on itself, it would… cease to be the proletariat and, never fulfill its telos of ending class society?

Sure, I understand that words change over time, and I could entertain the possibility that a post-revolutionary society might see capitalist baggage attached to certain words. But I would think that opting for an alternative in the case of justice (something bounded by our visceral senses of fairness and our instincts to protect life and limb) would be an exercise in filling a semantic void.

So in a way, Foucault seems to be advocating a euphemism treadmill, presumably for no other reason than in this case it could facilitate the end to class society. If so, there’s at least kind of internal logic to it. That is, I think the likely result of bringing a kind of group identity into the definition of justice would be to produce an obvious scapegoat for the personal moral and epistemic insecurities of any would-be revolutionaries. No doubt that would make for the kind of political violence Foucault favors.

He unwittingly illustrates: early in the debate he is concerned that Chomsky argues what amounts to a kind of *human nature of the gaps* in modern terms—what he characterizes as a “peripheral notion” in the sciences, which to him means *not* a well-established or central organizing concept, but rather a nebulous one serving to indicate areas of further study \[[9:04](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=544)\]. It’s a fair enough concern by mid-20th century standards, and one Chomsky agrees with. Of course, we subsequently learn that there is great risk in adopting such notions, and the proper intellectual task is to attack them for masking the (unspecified) “violence” committed by scientific and other institutions \[[37:45](https://youtu.be/3wfNl2L0Gf8?t=2265)\].

And then as the debate closes we learn he’s content to have an unmistakably peripheral, proletariat of the gaps stand in for his central organizing concept as needed, and we’re left wondering whether the proletariat is a class with a more or less objective relationship to production, or *the class which overthrows class society*. Suddenly he is unconcerned whether his notion (amounting to *the proletariat can do no wrong)* carries any risk of justifying violence.

I get why Chomsky would later say “I’d never met anyone who was so totally amoral.”

Help me out if you would be so kind. Why in the world do people take this guy seriously?

# Edit: reasoning behind a few deltas

* The question of whether Foucault postured as a revolutionary or counter-revolutionary is less clear than I thought it was. Still largely unclear, however.
* Though Foucault's says his political engagement consists of attacking (particular) institutions for embodying power and violence, I may have conflated these particulars with his general view of ""Power"" which is supposed to be more like the water in which a fish doesn't know it swims. Not a completely ridiculous idea, just flawed. 
* I should have clarified that the only way to inoculate oneself against bullshit is to engage bullshitters, so ultimately I'm glad Foucault existed and I'd defend to the death his right to bullshit. "

That it is ruining our mental health. That it is blurring the lines between truth and falsehood. That it is increasing peer pressure, and causing depression. And worst of all, that it is threatening society as we know it.

However, I don't currently agree with that. Here are a few reasons why I think social media causes much more good than harm.

First of all, social media is a community where we can learn from each other and share our thoughts and feelings. If we use social media, it’s a fun way to express ourselves and share knowledge. 

Using social media also provides amazing market research for companies. If you use a social media site, you help the big corporations and small businesses along with charities to find ground-breaking research about our world and help them interest us with products that can help us. 

Social media helps people stay connected. When before, you might see your family members once a year, you can now stay in contact with them every day. Social media brings people together.

Some might say that you can become addicted to social media which can be bad for developing minds (cause mental health issues) but that isn’t the site’s fault. It is your fault. If you spend too much time with your eyeballs glued to a screen, that is only you. YOU are just becoming addicted to social media. 

And as for those who say it increases bullying, social media has lots of options to prevent bullying on social media such as block, unfriend and report, so if we’re aware of how to defend ourselves it is virtually impossible for bullies to strike more than once. Once blocked, bullies can no longer communicate with you. Also, friends only can see your posts. Social media sites are forever taking more measures to tackle bullying. 

In the same way that the school must monitor behaviour in the playground and intervene if they see a problem, so the social media sites must monitor behaviour on their sites, and ensure people are behaving responsibly. Furthermore if bullying happens on social media, it’s about changing the behaviour of those who bully, not changing the platform which the bully used. 

In conclusion, social medi does unarguably cause harm. But my argument is that it **helps us more than it harms us**, and over time, as we learn more, we should actively manage its controversial effects. What do you think?"

# Background Information

**What is CinemaSins?**

""Cinema Sins"" is a youtube channel that makes content entirely based on popular movies (they also have a separate channel for TV shows). The premise of any given CinemaSins video is that there will be a counter labeled ""Sin Counter"" in one corner of the screen and a timer keeping track of the elapsed length of the main video portion in another. In the order in which they appear, short clips from the movie will be played, followed by commentary about what's ""wrong"" with that part, a stock ""ding"" sound effect (or some variation of it), and an increase to the counter (usually by 1, but it could be more). Occasionally the commentary will actually have a positive effect, in which case the counter goes down and a reversed version of the sound effect plays. It is part of the formula to speak quickly and cut these segments with very little time between them. At the end of the video, the value of the counter is representative of how many ""sins"" the movie got, and there is a comedic ""sentence"" that is usually themed in a similar way to the film and designed to point out one of the ""flaws."" Each video is titled as ""Everything wrong with &lt;Film Title&gt;"" usually (but not necessarily) followed by ""in &lt;elapsed time rounded&gt; minutes or less.""

**The Controversy around CinemaSins**

Many of the ""sins"" given are perceived as nitpicky, ignorant, overly critical, or just wrong if interpreted as serious criticism, but there is a large population of people that believe the channel is designed to be satirical or comedic. This has resulted in other content creators making ""anti-CinemaSins"" videos or putting the original videos under the same treatment they put the movies. **Eventually, a rift was created between movie fans based around the CinemaSins content, with many thinking that it's garbage and becoming aggressive to people supporting the channel. I can't entirely agree with this sentiment.**

# Overview

To clarify upon my position, I do not claim that the entirety of CinemaSins criticism is invalid or unwelcome, nor do I believe that they are justified about all or even most of the sins they give. I also do not justify all the behavior of CinemaSins fans. Instead, **I will argue that much of the content may be intended to be satirical and contest the idea that the creators are lazy or apathetic, independently of the ""immunity"" arguments that some fans make.**

I am unsure of the actual demographics of who likes or dislikes this content (especially after Youtube removed the ability to see dislike counts), but, based on experience, most are on the ""against"" side. I have been observing this for a while, but what finally triggered the creation of this Reddit post was [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/raimimemes/comments/uk13oz/do_you_know_how_much_i_sacrificed/) on r/raimimemes. In it, someone recommends [this video](https://youtu.be/apJnWkCuqkc) that expresses the opinion that CinemaSins isn't satire and other popular ""anti-sins"" viewpoints. I did watch other videos but thought that this would be best to use for the post because it is one of the shorter ones (therefore easier for the casual Reddit user to review in this context) and covers most of the points I saw being made in some capacity.

That video will be my primary reference for this post, as I believe it adequately represents many arguments against my view that people were using. On a high level, here is a summary of the points the creator makes (more in-depth summaries will be provided later):

1. **Comedy does not require incorrectness to be good.** Humor can be derived from being wrong, but that isn't what CinemaSins does.
   1. **Many of the sins directly misrepresent a movie** in order to make a joke at its expense.
2. **The fans themselves give criticism of individual points** and are not met with the ""satire card,"" but instead legitimate discussion, so it is evident that most people don't legitimately consider it satire themselves despite often playing the ""satire card"" on videos dedicated to CinemaSins criticism.
   1. **If satirical, CinemaSins does not communicate it**, therefore the channel either should not be considered satirical or should be considered very bad quality satire.

Additionally, I will be addressing the argument commonly deemed ""Schrodinger's Joke,"" which isn't explicitly mentioned in the video but is another common argument I see. ""Shrodinger's Joke"" implies that the channel simply changes whether they claim the content is satirical based on how people respond to it or that they have specific portions apply to one while everything else applies to another.

# Comedy ≠ Incorrectness

**Timestamps**

[1:32](https://youtu.be/apJnWkCuqkc?t=92) \- [3:46](https://youtu.be/apJnWkCuqkc?t=226)

[4:30](https://youtu.be/apJnWkCuqkc?t=270) \- [6:23](https://youtu.be/apJnWkCuqkc?t=383)

**The Argument (According to Me)**

Comedy can be based on reality. You can make a joke where you're wrong, but CinemaSins does not do that. They directly misrepresent movies (the example used was in [""Everything wrong with Hotel Transylvania 2""](https://youtu.be/6aY9ivbLC_k?t=668) where a wolf character was accused of not knowing any boys, despite the film making it explicit that she had 300 brothers) in order to make jokes at their expense. This detracts from writing quality - The joke no longer works when it is so clearly ignorant. Acknowledgment of these flaws is necessary, and ""comedy"" can't be used to deflect this.

**My Take**

Much of what is said here is true and valid - Comedy does not have to be incorrect in order to be funny, but the act of being wrong could be the basis for a joke. **The main thing I'm contesting here is the idea that this ""being wrong"" is not part of the joke itself.** There is a claim that incorrectness does not contribute to humor, but that is subjective, so I need to show intention here.

**I will do this by arguing that CinemaSins is a satire of a specific type of film critic that would misrepresent like this, and that should qualify as part of the joke.** But first, let's define ""satire"":

&gt;the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.

This definition shows that **a satirical statement can be considered a joke or humorous to some.** But does CinemaSins intend to make this joke? I believe they do, but in order to show this, we need another example.

I believe a clear example of satirically incorrect exists in the video titled [""Everything wrong with Red Notice in 18 minutes or less""](https://youtu.be/kxRvKV6YzvQ). At [7:41](https://youtu.be/kxRvKV6YzvQ?t=461) the video's narrator says that the scene where soap was present only existed to make a joke, but seconds later they admit the awareness that the soap plays a role in the escape that comes later in the movie. They then claim that everything is already explained in the later scene and make what is clearly a reference to their *own* channel (""Movie didn't reveal how soap was acquired. ding.""), in a sarcastic tone, even calling themselves absurdly pedantic. Later, at [8:22](https://youtu.be/kxRvKV6YzvQ?t=522), the same reference, word-for-word is used as a legitimate sin literally right after explicitly acknowledging the previous explanation for the presence of the soap.

**Clearly, this isn't a legitimate view - It's blatantly hypocritical and completely ridiculous if taken seriously.** However, as a joke it has meaning. By seemingly parodying themselves as clearly incorrect and even insulting themselves in the first sin, they show how flawed it is to take that view seriously. Therefore, when it comes back as seemingly ""legitimate"" criticism, you can tell it isn't actually intended that way. Instead, they could be satirizing some other demographic, specifically through the use of irony in this case. **The incorrectness is made clear and is undoubtedly part of the point they make.**

So, now that we've established that CinemaSins does make jokes where the point is that they are incorrect for the sake of satire, we must define if the original context is similar enough for the same logic to be applied. **This cannot be objectively shown, but I can establish that it's** ***possible*** **that both examples rely on the same satirical theme.**

As made clear by the creator of the video this rebuttal is addressing, merely seconds later a qualifier is shown that disproves the point. Then, a scene is shown that also appears in the corresponding CinemaSins video. **We now have CinemaSins clearly recognizing the existence of something in one part, but either discrediting or completely ignoring it in another.** I believe this is similar to the ""Red Notice"" Video.

Of course, I cut out one argument from the clip. That's because it will be addressed in the next section.

# It's not treated like satire

**Timestamps**

[3:45](https://youtu.be/apJnWkCuqkc?t=225) \- [4:30](https://youtu.be/apJnWkCuqkc?t=270)

[6:37](https://youtu.be/apJnWkCuqkc?t=397) \- [13:22](https://youtu.be/apJnWkCuqkc?t=802)

**The argument (according to me)**

On the videos criticizing CinemaSins for their incorrectness and flaws, comments come saying that CinemaSins is satire to deflect the criticism. Satire (such as the [""No man's Sky rant""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DhaUe6y-Co&amp;t=1s)) is usually clearly intended as such, thus you don't get people arguing with their points in the comments. In CinemaSins videos, there is no indication of the purpose, thus there are heavily-liked comments arguing. It is clear that most people either don't think CinemaSins is a satire or they have no problem with the criticism, which makes the ""Its Satire"" arguments seen elsewhere seem absolutely ridiculous and hypocritical. If it is satire, it is poorly written. If it is legitimate, it is poorly researched and lazily developed. Screen Junkies made [a CinemaSins video where the satire is more clearly communicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H53183mVc2o), being accurate, funny, and sharply written.

**My Take**

Before starting, I want to make clear that **I don't support the idea that all CinemaSins criticism channels should just shut up.** I think they provide a valuable service and watch them along with the regular videos. However, I do think that the conclusion of this argument is flawed and that **CinemaSins fans aren't necessarily being hypocritical, just aggressive and presumptuous.**

First, consider the contexts of each comment type. Both the CinemaSins comment and the criticism video have the general message of ""CinemaSins is wrong about things."" However, **unlike the comment on a CinemaSins video, the criticism video can be interpreted to imply that ""CinemaSins is wrong about things,** ***therefore it is bad***."" The people who make this argument assume that the original comments are saying the same, as there shouldn't be a reason to point out that they're wrong if not to imply that it is a flaw in the channel or satire. It is pointed out that in the  [""No man's Sky rant""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DhaUe6y-Co&amp;t=1s), no such comments exist. However, I think we need to take into account that both channels' satire is different in composition and therefore would be held to different standards.

**The ""No man's Sky rant"" is designed to recontextualize views that are** ***obviously incorrect*** **in order to show how they don't make sense. The creator does this through exaggeration. It is clear that the actual views do not extend to this length, but logically they could, so the argument doesn't hold up. This contrasts with CinemaSins, which recontextualizes more realistic representations of the view being satirized, showing how it isn't even justified if you keep the application consistent.**

A critic that everyone hates will occasionally have good points. They will have a clear logical process and apply it somewhat consistently. CinemaSins emulates this aspect of critic behavior by including sins that seemingly make sense with only the critique as a reference, but are either taken out of context or unreasonable when you expand your references to include the original work. **They're making a point about real-life critic viewpoints, not exaggerated versions of them.**

Coming back to the original point about how the correction comments can exist without implying that the whole is bad, **the arguments expand upon the joke by pointing out exactly how these critiques don't hold up. When you claim that the criticized sins are evidence of low quality instead of adding to the joke, you are going to get people to disagree with you on that front.**

Of course, this opens up the idea that jokes should be intuitive, and the act of explaining them makes the comedy worse. This is subjective and unrelated to my point of why these corrections appear on what is considered a satire, so I will not address it here.

Concluding this section, **I think that the metrics used to determine how good CinemaSins is at communicating satire are flawed**. As for the Screen Junkies video that was stated to be better, I fail to see a fundamental difference between that and the real content. **The ""better"" video includes fewer self-references and is generally more accurate to what's in the movie, but it doesn't communicate their joke parts any better than the originals did.** In fact, it uses almost the same exact language and talking habits. I suppose it could be something about the tone of voice, but as of now, I don't understand the argument. **Feel free to expand upon this in the comments if you wish.**

# Schrodinger's Joke

**The Argument (according to me)**

This argument isn't included in my referenced video, but it is one of the most common cases against CinemaSins that I see. It is based on the ""Schrodinger's Cat"" thinking exercise, in which there is a cat in a box and you cannot determine whether it is dead or alive without opening the box. Until you open that box, the cat is *both dead and alive*, but it becomes one or the other when observed.

There are two main variations that will be detailed here:

The first variation is that CinemaSins actually does mean all of it's criticisms genuinely, but they change the claimed motivation of each sin based on how it's responded to. If people say it's wrong, it was a joke. If people end up agreeing with it, it's a legitimate criticism. So, similarly to Schrodinger's cat, you can never tell if a sin is joke or not until you observe the response.

The second variation claims that each sin is intended as either genuine or joke, but it's almost impossible to tell which is which because they are designed with no differentiation between the two. It is only possible by asking, which can result in a similar effect as the one detailed in the description of first variation.

**My Take**

**I think the first variation is presumptuous, as it assumes that CinemaSins must be either entirely legitimate or entirely serious. In reality, CinemaSins is a satire that sometimes makes its points through legitimately plausible criticism (justification for this claim exists in the previous section labeled ""It's not treated like satire"").** It follows that some parts will be jokey while others can be used as serious argument elsewhere, so **you need to evaluate them on an individual level**.

The second variation recognizes this, but appears to be implying that it is bad. **I believe that it actually encourages critical thinking and discussion, and may be a factor in why the ""correction comments"" are so common on CinemaSins' videos.**

I think that most people watching understand that a lot of the criticisms are invalid, which means that they all go in with a critical attitude in addition to the desire to be entertained. When finding something they disagree with, they go to the comments instead of demonizing the channel. Thus, **there is a sustainable community of relatively open-minded people (overlapping with some of the fan-theorist community) willing to discuss whether it is valid or not.** These discussions can produce logical justifications for using any particular argument or expose them as false.

# Conclusion/TLDR

**Some final words**

This post has been very long, and I'm aware that I still may have missed some arguments against my position here. That's why I wrote this - to open this viewpoint up to discussion. Nothing I say here is meant to be taken as unquestionable - Everything is fair game to criticize.

**TLDR**

A - Opposer's Arguments

CA - My Counterarguments

&amp;#x200B;

**A: Comedy does not need to be incorrect to be good.**

**CA: Being wrong and misrepresenting is part of the joke.**

&amp;#x200B;

**A: The fans don't treat it as satire, so it should either be considered not so or poorly written**

**CA: They only treat it that way in specific contexts (the details of which make it not necessarily hypocritical - read the full section for details on that), and most actually do believe it to be satirical.**

&amp;#x200B;

**A: CinemaSins puts legitimate sins along with joke ones or claim some to be serious while others are not, so it's clear that the satire is inconsistent.**

**CA: CinemaSins is still satire, it just sometimes makes its points through legitimate criticism, as that's part of the satirical strategy (again, read the section for more on this).**"
48,2022-09-24,CMV: Machiavellian tactics are best only when short-term survival is paramount,u/terabix,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xmw5yl/cmv_machiavellian_tactics_are_best_only_when/,changemyview,"When I say ""Machiavellian"" I mean decisions made in which ""the ends justify the means"". The best way I can describe this is the prisoners' dilemma. You and a friend are facing justice for some indeterminate crime. You can snitch on your friend or stay silent. Snitching will condemn your friend to a harsh sentence and let you off easy. Your friend has the same options. If you both stay silent, a lighter punishment will come out for both of you. If you both snitch, both get sent away for a long time. Otherwise, the snitch goes free while the silent one is sent away for a long time. The ""Machiavellian option"" in this case would be to snitch, sacrificing a relationship in exchange for freedom.

My argument is that such a choice does not fare well beyond the short term. Imagine if you snitch, but end up in a situation in the future where your fate is now in your friend's hands. I wouldn't imagine that they'd be very merciful, knowing you threw them under the bus the first time. In dire straits such as the battlefield, finishing off your enemy is probably preferable to showing them mercy because if you finish them off, they're gone, for good.

But when you face the prospect of having the prisoner's dilemma thrown at you repeatedly and with the same actors or set of actors, suddenly there emerges the concept of ""goodwill"", the value gained from having the expectation of doing ""the right thing"". The thing I've discovered about Machiavellian tendencies is that while they give you the short term gain, they erode long-term trust. And thus to stay consistently successful with Machiavellianism you must cycle through new, unsuspecting victims."

677,2022-09-24,CMV: There are no Epistemologically sound reasons to believe in any god,u/Ramza_Claus,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xmxfpr/cmv_there_are_no_epistemologically_sound_reasons/,changemyview,"Heya CMV.

For this purpose, I'm looking at deities like the ones proposed by classic monotheism (Islam, Christianity) and other supernatural gods like Zeus, Woten, etc

Okay, so the title sorta says it all, but let me expand on this a bit.

The classic arguments and all their variants (teleological, cosmological, ontological, purpose, morality, transcendental, Pascal's Wager, etc) have all been refuted infinity times by people way smarter than I am, and I sincerely don't understand how anyone actually believes based on these philosophical arguments.

But TBH, that's not even what convinces most people. Most folks have experiences that they chalk up to god, but these experiences on their own don't actually serve as suitable, empirical evidence and should be dismissed by believers when they realize others have contradictory beliefs based on the same quality of evidence.

What would change my view? Give me a good reason to believe that the God claim is true. 

What would not change my view? Proving that belief is useful. Yes, there are folks for whom their god belief helps them overcome personal challenges. I've seen people who say that without their god belief, they would be thieves and murderers and rapists, and I hope those people keep their belief because I don't want anyone to be hurt. But I still consider utility to be good reason. It can be useful to trick a bird into thinking it's night time or trick a dog into thinking you've thrown a ball when you're still holding it. That doesn't mean that either of these claims are true just because an animal has been convinced it's true based on bad evidence.

What also doesn't help: pointing out that god MAY exist. I'm not claiming there is no way god exists. I'm saying we have no good reasons to believe he does, and anyone who sincerely believes does so for bad or shaky reasons.

What would I consider to be ""good"" reasons? The same reasons we accept evolution, germ theory, gravity, etc. These are all concepts I've never personally investigated, but I can see the methodology of those who do and I can see how they came to the conclusions. When people give me their reasons for god belief, it's always so flimsy and based on things that could also be used to justify contradictory beliefs.

We ought not to believe until we have some better reasons. And we currently have no suitable reasons to conclude that god exists.

Change my view!

Edit: okay folks, I'm done responding to this thread. I've addressed so many comments and had some great discussions! But my point stands. No one has presented a good reason to believe in any gods. The only reason I awarded Deltas is because people accurately pointed out that I stated ""there are no good reasons"" when I should've said ""there are no good reasons that have been presented to me yet"".

Cheers, y'all! Thanks for the discussion!"

When you leave a circle such as a job more people bitch about you since your not there to defend yourself and no one gets anything out of defending you, I've noticed that my last job which was a supermarket loved me, when I left a good majority has turned on me, same with changing schools

Good friends will turn for personal gain most of the time.

5,2022-09-24,CMV: Dehumanisation of people you don't like or agree with absolves them of their wrongdoing (from the perspective of the person doing the dehumanisation).,u/Presentalbion,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xmzsg3/cmv_dehumanisation_of_people_you_dont_like_or/,changemyview,"People in a society hold each other accountable within the structure of a society. 

These standards of accountability apply differently when someone does not function in the same way in society as everyone else - there is a different standard for people who appropriately plead insanity, or are disabled in some way, they are not as accountable for their actions. This is even the case when someone commits a crime of passion in the heat of the moment, that is a different thing to something premeditated, and is treated differently both in court and by society.

We do not hold entities that are not people to our human moral standards. We do not project evil intent onto a cloud when it rains and we forget our umbrella. We do not attribute cruelty to a lion when it slaughters and eats a gazelle. We do not attribute greed to a vulture when it eats the rest.

If we are to maintain a healthy operating system of ethics then something that is not human cannot be held to the same standards as a human.

If someone dehumanises another person, if they call a rapist a monster, or says that a murderer is inhuman, then they present a situation where that person and their behaviour do not need to be answered for.

Rape is a morally repulsive act by human standards, but if someone is not a human how can that standard apply? If they are not human then humans cannot condemn them. 

Only by humanising, by accepting that these are real human people committing these acts can we accept that the behaviour needs to be corrected.

All people are people, not animals or monsters, and people should be held accountable by the standards of the societal framework they operate in."

But since I’m white, I’m not bringing up race as it’s not my place.

We as people spend years, decades and even centuries fighting for things like gay/lesbian marriage, LGBTQ+ rights in general, the proper rights to female healthcare (abortions, cheap/free period products, etc) and better accessibility for disabled people. Eventually we do sometimes get them and it feels great. 

But despite not really being on the planet for as long as most people, I’ve been on it long enough and have caught up on enough history to know that things we spend 5-100 years fighting and even dying for can get taken away in a matter of weeks of months. More often than not by people who aren’t affected.

It’s gotten to the point where we’ve lost rights we fought for so many times in recent years, such as our rights to abortions being challenged, conversion therapy still being partially legal in the UK and so much more. That I think we should just accept that we all live on a miserable planet where our rights are no longer rights and are now just a game being run by children who keep changing the rules. 

Those who still want to waste their energy fighting and voting for temporary rights can go ahead but I’m giving up. No more fighting, protesting or voting. I also think we shouldn’t judge others for giving up either."

It means sharing a whole range of thoughts, feelings and experiences we have as human beings.

What I mean by companionship: Companionship can come from close friendships or even more intimate relationships, such as between siblings or spouses. When you experience companionship, it means you're frequently in the company of someone—**eating together, going places together, and generally spending time together**.

To be clear, I'm not saying that we don't need human interactions. As a society, we need each other regarding hobbies, learning and other services. My point is that intimacy and companionship are not requirements to be a decent human being or to be happy. I understand that they're things that most people want, and there's nothing wrong with that. However, the idea that someone is inherently evil or depressed because he doesn't care about anyone on a deep emotional level is just ridiculous to me.

Someone who doesn't care about anyone is only a problem when they're causing harm to others, if they keep to themself, they are doing nothing wrong. If they haven't chosen to have a relationship with someone, they are only responsible for themselves and nobody else, the only thing they have to do when it comes to other people is to be polite.

Regarding depression caused by loneliness, being alone does not equate to loneliness. The only way you can be lonely is by **wanting** those intimate relationships and not being able to have them."

Why? Well, think of how stupid the average person is and realize that half of us are dumber than that. Recent events in the US, UK, and some crossover in my own home of Canada have shown that there is a substantial percentage of the population that is sort of out of touch with reality to the extent that they shouldn’t be making decisions for other people. 

Greece restricted democracy to land owners. That’s discriminatory of course, but it was some kind of nod to the fact that not everyone is prepared to make decisions for the public good. In the US, there was quite an argument at the start about direct democracy vs representative democracy, and for good reason. 

I have no idea what a reasonable method would be for determining eligibility to vote that isn’t racist/sexist/classist, but my main point is that we should work on finding out what that is. Not every living body is educated/informed/reasonable enough to make decisions that affect people unlike themselves."

""It's just their religion, you can't judge them.""

Statements like these make no sense. If you hold a bigoted  or **awful** belief that directly reflects on who you are as a person. There is no reason that personal beliefs should be inherently respected.

Your beliefs are not a protected entity, if you hate a certain demographic just because they fall into that demographic, you're a bad person. If you politely ""disagree"" with someone else's basic right to live a normal life in the way they are naturally inclined to without hurting anyone, you are a bad person.

Looking forward to your responses :)

Edit: I'd like to elaborate and admit a mistake I made in my wording. I believe it would be more accurate to say hateful instead of **awful.**

Which means that you want to have sex but you can’t get it because of various reasons. Examples like anxiety, poor social skills, insecurity and being unattractive. Incels do have a reputation of hating women but not every guy that wants to have sex but can’t get it means they hate women. If anything those people hate themselves more than anyone. There’s nothing wrong with being a virgin involuntarily. People imply that you are a virgin involuntarily means that something has to be wrong with you. I’m very anxious around women. My ex girlfriend talked about other guys size and made ignorant racist comments about mine even though she never even seen it. This made me anxious to a lot of women. Sure you can say that’s voluntarily because I’m choosing to see women like that. I should probably be working on it but it takes time. As of now it is pretty pathetic to the point I get nervous when random girls speak on comms in my videogames. Of course I should work on myself but getting over anxiety takes time so I don’t think as of now me being an incel is that bad. The reputations of incels are that they are angry at women and are losers in society. A lot of people are just not good at socializing because they were born that way or they had experiences that made them that way so they can’t have sex even if they really wanted too. I don’t see how that makes you a bad person if you can’t get laid."

My cousin has given up on life and he would rather spend time working than be around people.  He's been a loner his whole life and enjoys solitude. He even works on Saturday and Sunday for around 18 19 hours a day.


He knows, he won't be rich or successful , according to societal standards.



*My cousin works 21 hours in a day.*

He works 16.5 hours in district court and 5 hours playing gaming and computer stuff which doesn't make him money.

Let me break it down for you.

1. He has a day job where he goes to district court and works under a senior criminal lawyer. 

His salary is very less compared to middle class people and he's lucky to live in parents house. 


*His salary is so low that he doesn't need to pay income tax*


2. After he comes home, he works on computers. It's not a job but a form of an escapism. He does coding, reverse engineering, scripting, tries to devlop 2D games, read about cybersecurity and just plays video games."

That issue is Platonism vs. Nominalism. Jonathan Haidt seems accessible, so you may be familiar with his notions in *The Righteous Mind.* Many people have come up with their own spin on this primordial duality.

There are two metaphysical extremes:

1)  those that believe in rigid identities and want to exclude all things that don't fit, and

2) those that believe all identity is relative and not necessary.

For simplicity's sake, just think of anything that can have a definition as an identity. The categories of sex, sexual orientation, gender, nation, economics, ethics, and so on. What *are* these things?

What you believe affects every aspect of your life, including the political, even if you don't explicitly know what you believe. Right wing people lean more towards something like Platonism; essences (essential properties of identities) exist, and teloi (the purposes of those identities) exist, and these are eternal and unchanging. They value tradition, their own culture, and are cautious of innovation because of the change it can bring to the community. At the extreme this can lead to authoritarian exclusion and tribalism, which can take the form of racism but it has many forms. You can insert whatever X-hate, or X-phobia you want, all of them stem from exclusion caused by a definition/essence.

Left wing people lean more towards fluid identities, and chasing potentials that have never been chased. This means that they are biased towards progress, innovation, novelty, strangers, outsiders, integration, change, fluidity, and ambiguity. The problem is at this extreme you can lose your connection to any identity, any community, any tradition, and literally destroy everything, *if* language (Logos) is perception and, therefore, reality. Everything is temporary. This also leads to ironic tribalism (identityless-identity) because the ingroup are the ones that deny identities, and the outgroup that values identity is excluded by the same authoritarian means. This can also be ironically racist, or ironically sexist; when ""white"" is associated with certain beliefs, whether explicit or implied, such as Platonism, punctuality, or hard working, you are implicitly affirming an essentialist worldview. [Source.](https://twitter.com/ByronYork/status/1283372233730203651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1283372233730203651%7Ctwgr%5Ee2d382e35b69a1c131c7126c9167de2086fa3e85%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aei.org%2Fop-eds%2Ftheres-some-truth-in-those-bizarre-charts-about-whiteness%2F) Or, when transgenders dress like the opposite gender, even though it supposedly doesn't exist, it implicitly points back to the duality, not an infinitely fluid spectrum.

So yes, the extreme on the right are the racist Nazis, and the extreme on the left are the ones who want to deconstruct the category of pedophilia in pursuit of destigmatizing all identities and therefore all taboo behaviors and removing boundaries, as opposed to a pedo right winger who does it hypocritically. Both exist exclusively to one side, but neither are representative of the whole. That whole, that bell curve, is what everyone is fighting about, for all topics. What is the essence of the right? Is it racist Nazis or are Nazis the insignificant fringe? And vice versa, what is the essence of the left? Is it LGBT pedos or is that the fringe? The battle is at the bell curve. Is the left stupid? Is the right stupid? Are there intelligent people on both sides or is it the insignificant fringe?

Here's the kicker, ontology is the study of what exists, but ontology can also mean the set of categories you see the world through in any given field of study. For example, the ontology of science contains evolution, natural selection, gravity, hypothesis, you get the idea. In order for a civilization to exist you have to have a shared ontology, because having a different ontology means literally living in a different reality, ***which is where we are now.*** Speaking as a U.S. citizen, even though this applies to any western and westernizing civilization, when you don't agree on what gender is, what sex is, what a woman is, what race is, what knowledge is, what justice is, what your country stands for, what it means to be ethical, and most importantly in the context of a state, what the constitution is, because the constitution has its own implicit ontology like free will, human dignity, etc, well than one group will have an ontology imposed on them by the other, and will necessarily feel oppressed, because policies follow ontologies. This is why there was a discussion about a SCOTUS judge's ability to adjudicate without knowing the definition of a woman. This is also why *both* sides fear slippery slopes. The right fears the deconstruction of a category, the left fears the construction of a category, like believing the fetus is a human instead of leaving personhood fluid, bracketing knowledge and default choosing the side of liberty.

For transparency's sake I am a conservative, I believe you need both; you need identity that is willing to change slowly and with wisdom, but something essential has to remain. This means that not all change, not all potential, is good. You have to separate the wheat from the chaff, drinking a cup of water as opposed to drowning in it. Immigration is another example.

Here's the unless, the only solution out of this is for someone to humble themselves and change their mind, otherwise these conflicting and irreconcilable metaphysical beliefs will collide."

Have any of you ever felt discomfortable around kids who are satisfied with literally anything?

Have any of you ever felt guilt about not being satisfied?

If you have,than I welcome you to the very topic that cuts both ways,Knowledge.In this text I will discuss the dual nature of this topic and give some examples that has shifted my point of view from pozitive to negative.Let's begin

All of us begin our lives with near to no knowledge, only our instincts.However, due to our natural curiosity,which is a common trait in nearly all sentient species by the way,we start to accummulate it.It forces both great and terrible changes upon us,we began to understand the enviroment around us and thus are now capable of influencing it.New paths are now open for us to pursue and thousands of possibilities lay down before us.

However with great power comes great burden.Our expectations from our enviroment and ourselves increase and failed expectations began to hunt us.In this situation people are divided in to two through their response.First group is generally considered succesful and are able to continuously fulfill their expectations.However, they are not a majority by any meaningfull way due to the conservative nature of the society.Thus the majority of people face a grave existancial crisis where they suffer due to their increased capabilities and are forced to defend their mind from dreams which they could not fulfill.In response vast percentage of people choose to cripple their minds.They achieve this through many different means such as substance abuse.

In conclusion knowledge is overall more detrimental rather than contructive."

First of all, their wealth and legacy is built on the idea that they are somehow superior to everyone else which in a way makes them as an institution racist and classist by default. The more honour and respect we show them, the more we encourage that ridiculous notion. They are not in any way superior to anyone else. Historically they have profited from the black slave trade and continue to leech off of taxpayers, despite contributing very little to society nowadays. I mean the Queen's funeral cost over a billion dollars, money that could've been spent elsewhere. 

Meghan Markle had every right to call them out. I'm not saying I believe every word she said. I'm just saying she has every right to tell her side of the story. The only reason people are angry with her and Harry is because speaking out about the family's problems ruins the illusion of the family's superiority. They try to silence anyone that speaks out. Princess Diana went through a similar thing  God forbid anyone reveals that they have flaws and are just regular human beings. 

Harry and Meghan deserve more credit for trying to distance themselves from the family. According to the Sovereign report, they were the only members that chose to be financially independent and not profit from taxpayers. 

What would change my mind?
If someone can explain to me their relevance and contributions to today's society and that those contributions are enough to warrant the kind of respect and worship they get."

EDIT: Adding a quick definition of oppression as requested below. Wikipedia's definition seems fine to me:

 **Oppression** is [malicious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malice_(law)) or [unjust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice) treatment or exercise of [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)), often under the guise of governmental authority or cultural opprobrium.[\[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression#cite_note-2) Oppression may be overt or covert, depending on how it is practiced.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression#cite_note-3)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression#cite_note-4) Oppression refers to [discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination) when the [injustice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injustice) does not target and may not directly afflict everyone in society but instead targets or disproportionately impacts specific groups of people. 

\------------

This is a bit of a vague post, pulling several points together, but consider stuff like:

* Minority representation in media
* Language use in universities being heavily biased towards English (as opposed to many other native languages)
* Many tools being catered towards right-handed people (scissors etc)
* Many environments being set up according to specifications for neurotypical people
* Lack of disability access in various sites (stairs-only access, narrow hallways, largely sight-only media and so on)

Now, these would all be positive to address in general, but my contention is the form that complaint often take - that these sorts of things are *oppressive* \- is patently wrong.

If you want/require a specific accommodation, that 95% of people don't require, it may well be good for society to make that accommodation. Not making it isn't oppressive though (at least actively), it's economic expenditure of effort, or at worst laziness."

Women participate more actively in the social world which is why a fem-fem relationship involves aspects of proper socialisation e.g Politeness, caregiving, non agression and non physical competition. Meanwhile men live in the physical world which is why a man-man relationship involves aspects of physicality over socialisation e.g Hyper compétition, agression and an emphasis on shared experiences rather than vocal bonding.

In the modern day more men have begun to exist in the social world more than the physical world. The biggest example being the active participation on social media. There’s a reason why women tend to do much better on social media than men in the same circumstances as them, because women have qualities that allow them to thrive in the social world. These days men want to be validated for simply existing and not contributing anything to society when we have no inherent value, unlike women who have inherent value, men want the luxury of being cared for and the respect of a provider all the same time. This is why men post pictures of themselves hoping to gain some measure of external validation that one normally has to earn in the physical world. 

Even the way men complain about women is an inherently féminine thing to do because in the social world an emphasis on non agression means that women voicing their discontent is often enough to make a difference whereas the physical(Masculine) world doesn’t work that way. Changes are enforced not given and hence where the idea of men being strong comes from. 

This idea men have that they need to be pitied and cared for and understood is where the red pill community comes in. A group of men sit around a table the way women do and try to validate each others feelings which is where the men who can’t cope with the physical world find their support system, making them bitter half women who have neither the inherent value of a woman or the earned value of a man."

13,2022-09-26,CMV: Teaching kids about sexual orientation and gender identity is perfectly fine.,u/vivivivivistan,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xoafyi/cmv_teaching_kids_about_sexual_orientation_and/,changemyview,"I've seen a lot of people saying that the left is trying to sexualize kids or make their kids trans or something and it's always in response to something about teachers teaching kids about sex ed or the gender spectrum. I genuinely don't see the issue with this education, sex ed is good for the youth and teaching kids about gender is a good way to normalize trans and nonbinary individuals and promote tolerance and acceptance, the idea that these things could be seen as indoctrination or grooming is insane to me. Just talking about sex with kids in an educational capacity is somehow sexual?

I believe that giving kids comprehensive sex ed is a good thing, in todays world the youth is learning about sex at younger and younger ages with the internet giving such easy access, even with parental controls on all your electronics it won't stop them from finding some other way to view it. I learned about sex in 4th grade from a friend, I don't think it's crazy to assume that that's happening more and more often now. I understand the worry about introducing sex as a concept to kids when maybe they wouldn't have learned about it, but I think that the education is also a positive too. I think it's good for girls and boys to learn about these things so they don't grow up feeling weird, maybe there aren't many boys who worry about that but I know there's girls who can relate to the experience of growing up thinking they're weird for just getting aroused at all and also being shamed for being attracted to someone. I'm not a girl, I've just talked to a handful of women who have told me vaguely similar stories about growing up. There's an argument to be made about how parents should be the ones to teach their kids about these things, but not every parent is a certified educator, that's why there's school in general. The majority of parents didn't go to college to gain knowledge on that subject and then also get training in how to properly educate kids in a way that's appropriate and effective. I'm not gonna try to teach my kids biology, I'll just leave that up to their biology teacher, similarly I'm not gonna try to teach my kids about sex when my experience is just having sex, not effectively teaching someone how to have safe sex. 

Teaching kids about the gender spectrum also doesn't sound bad at all. Trans people do exist and teaching kids about gender at a young age can normalize people being trans or nonbinary and encourage kids to be understanding and accepting and take that mentality into adulthood too. I feel like people misinterpret this in some way that the teacher is going to be encouraging kids to question their gender and encouraging them to do things that don't fit but I don't see that happening at all. I'm not even a teacher and I know that the entire point of teaching people about gender isn't to encourage them to do something different it's to encourage them to do whatever they feel comfortable doing. If a boy is satisfied doing or wearing stereotypically masculine things then that's great, that's what I feel other people miss when they think about this and think that their son is gonna come back saying he's a girl or something. If that happens, then that was always going to happen, the question is really just whether you want it to happen sooner when they're younger and can be more comfortable with themselves or when they're older and they have to go to therapy to understand their feelings because they've been trying to ignore it for so long. 

Ultimately, I don't see anything wrong with these things, sex ed is good for educating the youth and teaching them about gender is also good for promoting a more empathetic and accepting culture when the future generation grows up."

If you ask conservatives what gender is, they tend to give a simple definition, often based on chromosomes.

If you ask progressives what gender is, they tend to explain that gender is complex, but they will not give an actual definition.

The people who disagree about what gender is are not small fringe groups but appear to make up a large fraction of the western population.

Evidently, gender has no definition that the great majority of western people can agree on.

(I confine this discussion to ""the West"" because I don't know enough about ideas of gender in the rest of the world.)

Moreover, there are not merely two competing definitions. Rather, there is at least one definition, some sets of axioms and some sets of vague intuitions.

This has the consequence that many questions about gender simply have no right answer. Sure, there are some things that everyone agrees on, but there are large gray areas. The controversial questions such as ""are trans women really women?"" have no ""correct"" answer because there is no correct definition of _woman_.

I suspect that most progressives do not have a clear idea of what gender is, only some intuitions. This does not mean that their conclusions are necessarily wrong. Of course transgender people deserve to be treated as the gender they identify as whenever it is reasonably convenient. (And there are also gray areas which I will not get into here.)

But the matter is more nuanced than simply ""trans women are women"" vs ""trans women are not women"". Neither statement is objectively true; it depends on your point of view.

(I want to think that the gender debate would be better if more people understood this, but in practice I suspect most won't understand or care.)"

0,2022-09-26,cmv: Increased enrolment in higher education has been a net negative,u/Lost_Sand9666,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xoo9hx/cmv_increased_enrolment_in_higher_education_has/,changemyview,"For a long time, going to college has been touted as an unambiguously good thing.  If you look at the numbers, people with more education make more money and are more likely to be employed than people with less education.  Seeing this, a lot of people figured that if we send everyone to college then everyone can make more money.  

The view that college will teach you the skills you need to be successful is complicated by the open secret that few people use what they learn in college at work.  There are exceptions of course, such as lawyers, doctors, engineers, and research scientists, but few employers are going to ask you to analyze Shakespeare or to use your knowledge of prime numbers as part of your day to day.  Generally, If we wanted to better prepare people for the workforce, it would make much more sense to simply send people to work.  A bachelor's degree takes 4 or 5 years to earn for most people, and having 4 years work experience would probably be more valuable for most employees than a degree in the liberal arts.  I would guess and say that the only reason employers prefer to hire degree holders is because if nothing else, college proves that you are able to complete difficult, often boring tasks in a timely manor.  Because so many people have degrees these days, to not have one makes you look stupid, lazy, and unambitious.  Hence, I think that the premiums that graduates make in the workforce can mostly be attributed to selection bias and not skills or competencies, and that in practice, college is basically an extremely slow and inefficient way for employers to vet employees, one that is conveniently paid for by students and tax payers.  Worse, is that using college for vetting all but locks people who don't have the time or money for college out of higher paying jobs, therefore reducing social mobility.    

The immense financial cost of college is something that no secret to anyone.  The average student at a public university takes out over $25,000 in debt for a four year degree, and the numbers are even worse when we consider private schools and graduate degrees.  According to The Wall Street Journal, students in Columbia university's MFA program for film took a median of $180,000 in debt, and less than half of the borrowers were making over $30,000 two years after graduating.  And then there are the for profit schools which as far as I am concerned are the biggest scam in America.  It seems crazy to me that so many young people being burdened with tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans could have come to be seen as normal, or even good.   

Many might respond by saying that we should simply make college free and forgive all student debt.  Though I agree that doing so would be much better that what we have now, it still doesn't make things perfect.  Beyond the financial cost of college there is an immense opportunity cost of spending four years cloistered away in school.  In 2020, the average starting salary of a college graduate with a BA was $55,000.  Let us be conservative and say that in a world where college is free but also not the norm, most people with a high school diploma could make $40,000 after graduating.  After four years they would have made $160k more than somebody who went to college full time.  Not only is this a substantial amount of money (especially when you are young), but the person who went straight to work would have the added advantage of work experience.  Lastly, there is the social cost of going to college.  When you live on a college campus, there are a lot of things that you are probably not doing, such as buying a house, getting married, having kids, and generally, getting a taste of the ""real"" world.  Your late teens and early twenties are incredibly valuable and formative years, and I think that it is a tragedy that millions of people are required to spend them in classrooms they hate simply because doing so is the only way to make a decent living.  

Some will argue that I am missing the point, and that the true purpose of higher education is not to make money or to get a job, but rather self-actualization.  In an ideal world, I would agree, however the world we live in is not ideal.  If our schools were truly producing a generation of renaissance men, why is it that nationwide, attendance of our public libraries continues to decline?  Beyond that I do not believe that we can or should force anybody to self-actualize, nor do I believe that formal education is the only path to self-actualization.  If we actually wanted people to become their best selves, we would give them the freedom to make their own life choices without coercion."

So this is something I’ve thought for a long time. I personally can’t see any good reason NOT to legalize prostitution. 

First and foremost it would protect sex workers. If sex solicitation was legal then the industry could be regulated, measures could be put in place to guarantee the health and safety of sex workers. Clients who refuse to use protection or rape/assault workers could be punished (not just by the law, but they could be blacklisted from establishments, in general there could be accountability) In the same vein it would be better for clients as well, cleaner, safer; less risk of sexually transmitted disease when the sex workers have access to regular testing and medicine. 

It would reduce sex trafficking. Same argument for illegal drugs, if there is a legal means to obtain the product it will reduce the illegal market. It would also protect minors as you could vet for age before hiring. 

It could guarantee a more steady stream of income for sex workers. Obviously it’s vulnerable to predatory business tactics (just like any industry), but overall could be financially beneficial to all involved. 

If you’re one of those people, if it was legal it could be taxed as well. 

I often see arguments that it’s immoral because it’s “selling your body”, but you could also make the argument that almost any job is selling your body. For years miners were subject to conditions that permanent damaged their lungs, Amazon workers have died in warehouses, some construction and factory jobs are guaranteed to take a massive toll on your body over the course of your life, and joining the armed services means you are literally willing to put your life on the line. 

Skimming over the Wikipedia article for the history of prostitution in the US it all seemed steeped in misogyny. The way I see it is: we are all sexual (excluding my asexual buddies, but let’s be real y’all are in the minority) and acting like sex is some taboo thing we don’t all crave comes from outdated, puritanical morals that exist more  for control than for the betterment of everyone.

the first incidence is when cuphead was released, and there were academic debates about its choice of art style, as well as its implications of racism and sexism of the old. it was a very interesting look into the history of arts as well, but the gaming community did not take it well, citing ""SJW"" (a word so meaningless now) and that this conversation shouldn't exist

the second incidence is when a battlefield game came out with a female protagonist with a fake limb. gamers all over decided that this game was ""not true to history"" and not ""realistic"", yet examination would reveal that their views of ""historical accuracy"" and ""realism"" in their games are always never actually realistic. players doing unrealistic, athletic feats with unrealistic, dramatized portrayal of war is fine but a woman with a fake limb doing so is suddenly off the table. the gaming community once again fail to scrutinize their own views and prejudices and challenge their opinions, simply going for a ""SJW"" attack.

these are not the only examples, but my point is, these incidences presented a very good discussion about social science and critique, yet nobody want to even begin to listen to it, with the mere thoughts of it being considered bad.

I now deliver packages for a living. There's a common occurrence that I've had with bicyclists. I will be approaching an intersection, pulling up to the stop sign or line for the light so that I can see traffic moving perpendicular to me. Then I have to abruptly stop 6-10 ft sooner because a bicyclist crosses my path. 

This is not good. I do try to watch the sidewalks for bikers, but most people driving motor vehicles on the road aren't watching the sidewalk for bikers. Completely set aside who would be legally at fault in the case of a collision, *for the bicyclist's safety* they should either be prepared to stop at every intersection (treating it like a yield), or even better they should bike on the road. 

Obvious exceptions:

* If there are obstructions in the road, the biker can use the side walk. They should still be yielding at intersections.

* Different roadways might be structured in a way that allows a bicyclist the right of way and safe passage to cross an intersection without being prepared to stop. Like if the stop sign for cars is set back from the intersection with a bike path. And I'm not familiar with how roads are structured with bikes outside the US, so that's where I'm talking mostly about.

**For children:**

Studies have clearly shown that physical punishment isn't an effective way of discipling bad behavior in children. It is either less effective than a more positive response or it can have the opposite effect intended, it can worsen behavior.

For those who will argue that in some cases it is necessary as nothing else will work, one study that severity and justness do not change the outcome of the punishment.

Edit: I believe that it logically follows that if physical punishment is ineffective and verbal/mental punishment is ineffective as shown by the studies about prison, that the same goes for verbal/mental punishment with children.

**For prison:**

While many prisoners definitely deserve punishment, I don't believe we should base their sentencing off of what they deserve in all cases, rather what will help society in general the most.

Many countries already have switched to rehabilitation over rehab and they see many benefits. They see lower crime rates in general and lower repeat offenses.

Also here is a paper that finds that positive reinforcement is more effective in general:

[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083709/#:\~:text=Reinforcement%20and%20punishment%20both%20work,better%20and%20faster%20than%20punishment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083709/#:~:text=Reinforcement%20and%20punishment%20both%20work,better%20and%20faster%20than%20punishment).

In conclusion, the evidence clearly shows a trend: in general punishment is an outdated and ineffective way of changing poor behavior. Instead we should replace it with positive reinforcement and in the case of crimes, sentenced rehabilitation.

There are however, I do not believe the following people are ever capable of rehabilitation:

&amp;#x200B;

* People who point blank murder someone for no reason.
* People who cause extreme harm for no reason other than sadism.

**And to clarify I am speaking about the concept of punishment in general, not just physical punishment.**"
0,2022-09-26,"CMV: Members of the LGBT community tend to socialize similarly to neurodivergent people, and this is the main reason I've only had sex with other bisexual people",u/Poo-et,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xozlgp/cmv_members_of_the_lgbt_community_tend_to/,changemyview,"Apologies for that rambling trainwreck of a title, I promise I'll try to make this post less incoherent. I'm trying to understand a phenomenon in my life, so I think offering alternative explanations is the most likely thing to change my view.  

---  

I'm a 21 year old bisexual man. I also have diagnosed dyspraxia and prosopagnosia. My father is diagnosed with dyspraxia, and very likely has some kind of undiagnosed high functioning autism. I was tested several times as a child for autism, but it's been pretty firmly ruled out.  

Dyspraxia primarily affects memory and physical co-ordination, but a lesser known facet is that it also affects social functioning and emotional regulation. I was bullied growing up, and that contributed to my poor social adjustment as a teenager, ultimately leading me to be a firm disappointment to most of my teachers, and coast through school with mostly Bs. I went to university to study computer science, but I dropped out and now have a well paying job as a software engineer. Although I was borderline alt-right until I was 16, and a kissless virgin until I was 18, I managed to avoid the incel and 4chan pipeline many others similar to me fall into, and these days am pretty well socially adjusted, and do fine at sex and relationships.  

My sexual history consists of 12 people. 10 women, 1 non-binary, 1 man. I'm attracted to a quite narrow subset of men (feminine men exclusively), ergo the imbalance.  

The observation I've made that led to me creating this CMV is that unintentionally, every single person I've slept with to date has also been bisexual. I don't believe this is explainable by probability (since 0.03^12 is a very small number indeed), explicit discrimination (since I have equal interest in straight and bisexual women), subconscious discrimination (since usually I do not know the sexuality of the person until we have slept together), my own presentation (I am straight-passing), the groups I hang out in, or any other clear source of bias. *Even if* there was some kind of bias here, I would figure on the basis of numbers alone I would have had sexual interest from at least one straight person by now.  

I tend to stay away from most communities explicitly for LGBT people because the people there are universally... odd. Not odd in a ""obscure hobbyist"" kind of way, odd in a very similar fashion to the group of social outcasts I used to associate with at school, but aged up without any additional maturity. There's also definitely a much higher than normal incidence rate of developmental disabilities like ADHD, Autism, and so on.  

Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, ADHD, Autism, and other disabilities share certain common comorbid traits like a tendency for hyperfixation, concentration issues, and difficulties with emotional regulation in childhood. My basic thesis is that it's pretty clear all of these are part of some kind of cluster of psychological effects that also includes bisexuality. I know many gay people who do not socialize in a neurodivergent way, but my personal experience with bisexual people is that they have a disproportionate tendency to.  

I'm having difficulty putting a finger on exactly what I'm identifying here. Obviously it's easy to roll up and blast me with a counterassertion that this isn't true and my sample size is small. It *is*, but I think there's clearly something at play here. Socially, I get on best with people who are neurodivergent. Most of my closest friends have some kind of diagnosed developmental disability *or* are bisexual, and even without external stimulus, I tend to get on best with people in one of these categories, even if I am unaware of such and the conversation in which we bond is unrelated.  

Please, change my view."

As stated in the title this is only part of solving the issue of undocumented immigrants in the US, and couldn't be considered as a panacea. What I see as the underlying problem of undocumented immigrantion is the downward pressure on wages, if you are claiming that problem is some cultural/racial issue of having 'the other' coming into the country then just keep scrolling - this is not the CMV you are looking for. Where I'm open to being convinced is if there's a better alternative to get a upward pressure on wages than to have some premium for employing non-citizens than having guest workers having statutory minimum wage higher than citizens after having a background check verification of who they are they say they are with no criminal record.   
   
Increasing minimum wages over citizens would, in my opinion, create a disincentive for hiring non-citizens and alleviate the problem of immigrants pushing down the wages for everyone. The minutia of the implementation should assume that there's an enforcement mechanism for employers just as there's a enforcement of minimum wage right now, that the immigrants who have gone through the background check and are registered guest workers can't be threatened with deportation (without being convicted of felony or violent crime), and the difference in minimum wage is significant enough that they would only be sought out if it was necessary.
 
I get that the H1 visas for foreign workers aren't working for minimum wage, for the most part, but if you want to propose some policy that would handle the higher wages of the current foreign workers in medical, IT, and other sectors then propose it and if it makes sense I'll give you a delta.
 
In general the federal minimum wage being set to $12-$18 for citizens and the guest worker minimum wage being set to $22-$30 is what I have in mind to be a part of the solution, explicitly the solution for undocumented immigrants driving down wages. An ancillary benefit would be that guest workers could go back home when ever they were no longer being hired but come back whenever they were needed, likely maintaining their families in their home country rather than in the US further lessening the number of unauthorized immigrant workers.
 
So to CMV an alternative to my minimum wage proposal that would be more beneficial for American workers' wages.
 
Edit:     
This is a proposal to change what the laws and regulations that exist in the labor market regarding citizens and non-citizens, no matter what the current policies are, within the scope of the hypothetical of this CMV is not going persuade with ""but that's not how it is"" or ""illegals will always be paid less"" since this is a hypothetical that ostensibly eliminates illegal immigrants and the radically alters how things work. The problem of illegal immigration is there's a perception (the amplitude of the effect is debatable, but it does exist) that illegal immigrants cause wage suppression, so if I had a magic wand and changed that all non-citizens were legal but had a higher wage would solve the perceived wage suppression. Enforcement mechanism be primarily on the bottleneck of hiring managers with lengthy prison sentence if they hired illegally or less than the new statutory minimum wage would be far more effective than trying to get millions of human beings detained and deported and has shown to be impractical (if not impossible) to implement. Not sure why this is difficult to grasp but with the elimination of 'illegal immigrants' there's just 'illegal employers'."

While many of the nominees on the sub are simply victims or their own stupidity, many are victims of the world which they have been born into. I do not mean to say the community is ill intentioned but that they should not forget the historical context that has caused many minorities to loose faith in the systems that are supposed to encourage stability in society.

There is a very long history of unethical clinical trails being conducted in African countries. In 1996 for example, pfizers drug called trovan was tested on children in Nigeria without having their parents concent. 11 children subsequently died and many experienced brain damage.

The Tuskegee trial in America was a another heinous act in which black individuals with syphilis were given fake treatment and left to die so that researches could observe the natural progression of the disease. It is stories like these which are passed along for generations which produce systemic mistrust, and I would argue rightfully so. 

Personally I have had 3 covid shots and I still beleive this was the right choice. I do also however know that science is not a concensus and it is not a religion to ""beleive in"". The very notion that something is true because scientific authority says so is fundamentally unscientific. Any study or finding Is only as valid as the experiment that produces it, not the reputation of the voice the proclaims the findings. Science is at its best when every claim is throughly critiqued and examined under a microscope, not when things are accepted as truth because an establishment says so. History is rife with examples of the establishment being wrong. While they were right this time, it is important we do not forget that they are not arbiters of truth because they present arguments from authority and that when it comes to public health, the public should be trusted with the full details of the most up to date information at all times. Something that was not necessarily the case with information on covid in the early pandemic, only further eroding trust in public institutions. 

All I ask is that before a nominee is posted, ask yourself wether the individual had every opportunity through life to find trust in the amazing technologies that improve our quality of life. Because the reality is many people have not been given such an opportunity and I would argue they victims and they deserve empathy.

Often times it feels as if though when we try to argue against anti vaxxers or those who deny climate change its far too easy to say that some intellectual consensus exists that says the other group is wrong. The problem is that this is no argument at all, it's an appeal to authority. When it comes to science, you cannot beleive a fact simply becuase other people do. If you aren't versed in the relevant science you do your best to listen to the experts. This doesn't however qualify you to critique anyone who disagrees with what the experts say because that would require technical knowledge which most people don't possess. Therefore the only people who should be engaging with ""deniers"" are the scientist themselves as only they can truly describe the compelling evidence that supports the science. When normal people gang up on others with pseudoscientific beliefs with nothing better to say other than ""well the establishment says so"" we further alienate those who are scientifically illiterate. This type of argument has never changed anyone's mind.

I truly beleive that no layperson should be criticising anyone with pseudoscientific beliefs becuase the science itself is equally foreign to both individuals. At most a layperson should be able to say ""this is what I beleive and I do so because these respected experts also do"". Leave the criticising to the experts themselves who actually have a case to make and an actual chance of educating people. Acting like you are better than somone with wacky beliefs because you adhere to institutional guidelines is arrogant. It ignores the fact that we should always be critical of our institutions and it ignores the fact that it is a shortcoming of society that our education systems have failed many people who hold pseudoscientific beliefs.

The herman Caine award subreddit is mostly laypeople advocating for a science that they don't understand because institutions have told them to and its this type of behavior that gives the people with wacky ideas the illusion that they are right."

We are the most dangerous and sadistic things that we will ever know or experience collectively. ^(\*and by ""our existence"" I mean by the time all people who will ever see this thread have passed and this idea will forever be gone)

I am talking about only things that exist in the physical world. So philosophical or conceptual fears like social anxiety or fear of the idea of death, or questioning what happens after we die aren't included. Also not talking about individuals' phobias or fears or person experiences, I am saying Humans are the most terrifying thing in our collective existence and through the entire human perspective.  

Because of this, I am skeptical of including diseases, as I see things like cancer and heart attack as scarier in a personal experience kind of way. I guess there is a collective fear about developing those diseases, but I need to be persuaded more to really count them. ^(This is one area where you could CMV)

I do include viruses and pandemics like COVID as those are shared experiences and are potential extinction-level threat. However, looking back on covid the world was more scared of other people, not the virus itself. People either completely isolated themselves and saw humans as terrifying in case of catching covid, or they were terrified of people lying to them about the pandemic and tracking them with government overreach and tyranny.  Either side was truly terrified of humans 

There are make-believe monsters and other things but they don't exist in real life and aren't of any true threat to us. Humans are by far the scariest animal or living thing we will ever encounter. We are advanced, and have discovered a lot around us. Things like aliens will never be discovered in our lifetime. We have searched galaxies thousands of light years away, I am not saying that aliens don't exist at all, but if they do they are way to far for us to ever interact with each other while we are still alive. 

Seriel killers, rapists, stalkers, murderers, terrorists, etc. are the only true monsters in this world. Listen to any true crime podcast out there, or watch any true crime documentary, most all of them are absolutely terrifying. 

Everything else that exists doesn't give intent. Its not personal. If a lion kills you it needs food, it doesn't know you, know the human species, not nearly as well as other humans. Humans know how to make people feel pain. Doesn't matter if its verbal or physical, everyone has hurt people in some way, but some people actually enjoy that and seek it out, it's terrifying."

First, for strategic reasons. In Ukraine, the strategic reason is to stop the growth of Russian influence and set a precedence for Russian aggression. 
In Iran, that same strategy holds up. We know Iran is part of Russia/China’s foothold in the Middle East and strategically important for oil, which has become even more important going into winter with the Ukraine conflict.

Second, for moral reasons. In Ukraine, this is because we feel a need to defend the innocent Ukrainians and their self-determination. In Iran, it’s to defend women’s rights.

Hence, I think if you believe we should be involved in Ukraine, we should be in Iran. Not sure why the immediate response to Ukraine was widespread support and action unlike what we have seen for Iran.

Open to the possibility I just totally missed something here

Edit: 
Seeing a lot of “what do you think the government should do?” Or “should the US invade Iran?”

To clear that up, I’m referring more to general sentiment. The point isn’t about what exactly should be done operationally, but there was clear support for Ukraine at the start and there doesn’t seem to be support for the people of Iran.

Also seeing questions about “who is invading Iran”

I am referring to the unrest and potential regime change in Iran."

Men'slib is an obscure movement that the vast majority of people have never heard of. I have never heard a politician discuss it. I have never heard anybody talk about it irl. I'm not even sure they operate outside of reddit. 

But I think the bigger issue with Men'slib and the reason why it will never really take off is that there's not much fire. There's not that raw anger that's in feminists or MRAs.When I see posts from Men'slib members, I don't get the sense that there's any energy or passion. It seems they're very concerned about not blaming women or challenging feminism, instead of just focusing on the issue at hand and how it affects men (like MRAs would.) 

With MRAs, women might be criticized. Somebody might bring up stories about superficial women leading to someone else saying ""women are superficial"" or, in some cases, worse. And maybe things go too far sometimes. But at least there's passion. 

Feminists regularly say things about men in the heat of the moment that they do not believe/regret saying. They don't walk on eggshells. I think any movement that is really going to help men needs that same fire and Men'slib doesn't have enough of it to create change. But I'm of course open to changing my view"

He's highly controversial, because some people see it as being a whistleblower for things that the US maybe shouldn't be doing, whereas other people see it as treason.

Rising interest rates will only make the issue worse as the only people who can buy will be cash buyers and corporations. They’ll get the deal of a lifetime and force many of us to rent indefinitely.

I believe we should ban corporations from buying single family homes unless they’re buying the homes to tear them down and build multiple apartments (increasing overall housing supply). 

New sales should be halted immediately and existing homes would have to be sold or redeveloped over time to avoid tanking the market immediately.

EDIT: Adding a bit of clarification so I don’t keep repeating myself:

Managing a supply of single family homes for rental could be handled with a permitting process like Airbnb’s in some metropolitan areas.

If you want to rent out a home you own, you need a permit with a cap on how many can be given out. If you can’t get a permit, either sell the property to someone who wants it as their primary residence or redevelop it into a multi-tenant building.

The permitting process could favor individuals with only 1-2 properties over landlords with dozens / hundreds.

This would obviously drive down housing prices but that’s the point — if someone has the means to own their own home they shouldn’t have to outbid Blackrock or their town’s landlord to do it."

Furthermore, even when US Americans refer to exclusively USA people as ""American"", I don't see a legitimate problem. There is not another term for the USA, and not a word in our language to describe the country and its people. And no, this doesn't mean people in the US fail to recognize an entire hemisphere full of other people.

For those who think that it is unfair to ban Hans from professional play, why should he be given a  second ( or third or fourth..)  chance even after he has admitted to cheating to gain rank. why does his ability to continue to play professionally  supersede every other professional noncheating chess player *right to play under reasonable conditions?  Almost every  professional players’ livelihood depends on their ability to perform at their best during a chess match. If players believe they are no longer playing against a human opponent but against another player  using a computer to cheat, then wondering if each move you make will be analyzed 6 million ways each time would be an exercise in futility self doubt and frustration. The psychological advantage of a known  cheater even if they are not cheating for a given match ( because his opponents believes he is cheating ) is immense in a game of mental warfare nerves and stamina. I think those commenting on how unfair a lifetime professional ban is to Hans have little idea what it takes to be a professional chess player and to sustain that level of play game after game. Match after match. While being scrutinized  and ranked among other players in a very public stage (*edited for clarification)

Adding this to pre empt any of the many valid points  already made but only one delta awarded so far. 

“I feel like I am repeating replies to other comments which are valid points but do not address the challenge of the CMV. 
He  was playing in  professional tournaments when he cheated. He admitted cheating at age 16 (only 3 years ago) and was a professional at that time. Cheating on chess.com is not like a pickup game in Central Park.  Chess a mental sport is not  the same physical sports. The psychological disadvantage of playing a ( past) cheater is huge.

But I don’t think public execution is anything worse than a private closed-off one. I think a big reason for the death penalty is that it satisfies the public desire for vengeance. In instances of the death penalty, the state acts as an instrument for its citizens’ moral values and exacts an eye for an eye. There’s nothing practical about the death penalty - it’s an emotional/ideological construct. Taking that into account, there’s no reason to not go all the way and fully realize it’s purpose. If a state has the death penalty so that it’s citizens can feel a sense of what they consider justice, it might as well allow them to publicly witness the execution and be even more satisfied with the way their state is carrying out their will. I don’t think it’s crueler to the prisoner because they’re going to be dead either way. If you’re already killing someone, letting people witness their death isn’t such a big step up in terms of cruelty."

I put this here since people can't be bothered to read beyond the post title.

Edit: What I mean by the karma system is exclusively your karma score, not the amount of upvotes and downvotes shown. I think showing number of upvotes and downvotes is fine, what I don't think is good is keeping a karma score for each user profile.

I don't think this is the one thing that reddit should do to improve the platform, it is ONE of the things they could do. Overall, I think upvotes and downvotes serve a propose in shaping the platform in a positive way, but fundamentally people shouldn't be concerned with getting downvoted, and more than that, I believe reddit would be better if less people cared so much about getting downvoted. Upvotes and downvotes are a measure of agreement from people readding your comment or your thread (this is in it of itself not a bad thing), but other peoples agreement over what you decide to write shouldn't be a big influence over what you write or if you decide to write it at all. But by design, reddit wants you to care about whether people agree with you or not, because of the karma system. Karma in reddit is basically a score of how agreeable someone is and having what is almost a videogame scoring system on being likeable incentivizes disingenuous behavior, flat out virtue signaling, and lots of karma whoring and repost. It keeps opinions that run contrary to a community’s general belief out of the community, which in turn creates multiple information bubbles where people just keep reassuring themselves of what they already believe, and somethings pushing even further.

A better reddit would be one where if someone disagreed with the general consensus of a community they would directly address that with that community, they would get downvoted still, but I believe less people would care about that if it were not for the karma system.

But first and foremost, it is simply not a good thing for any platform to gamify social interactions, all platforms do it to a certain extent, but a scoring system on how agreeable you are is maybe one of the most blatant ones. This gamification of social interactions is what I believe to be the worst aspect of the karma system.

I don't think there are any pros of the karma system that manage to counter the cons."

The main issue with the polarization is that people on each side of the 'aisle' don't respect each other's opinions and go as far as viewing the people who hold opposing views as rivals rather rather than just people who share different views. There is no tolerance for the opposite view and no common ground. I know these are generalisations but still. Here's a few examples (again generalisations) from the US:

* LGBTQ+ rights (Republican vs Democrat divide)
* Strong gun rights (Republican vs Democrat divide)
* Belief in continuing systemic racism in the US
* Abortion
* Role of the government in society
* Climate change
* Election results 

It seems difficult for people to live peacefully together where there is very little for them to agree on and things as fundamental as elections can't even be accepted by both sides. It's hard to see how these issues can resolve themselves.

Even outside the US, while less polarized there is a large divide between so called 'progressives' and 'conservatives' which seem to have fundamentally different perceptions about what society should lok like"

Many prospective students do not perform a cost/benefit analysis prior to attending school and get there without any idea as to what career they are even pursuing. They finish school with significant debt, but with little benefit, apart from having an easier time getting an initial interview with a prospective employer. I personally did not attend college and now work in data management for a Fortune 500 company. My wife *did* graduate with a degree, but subsequently changed careers and works outside of the field she studied for. But surprise, surprise, we’re still paying off her student loans.

When it comes to specialized fields, let’s take the case of someone who is looking to become a lawyer: Why make them take GenEd courses similar to what they just completed in high school? Why should they have to take Oceanography or World Religion to practice law? Wouldn’t it make more sense to have them immediately begin studying case law and legal precedents?

The way I see it, my generation has been brainwashed into thinking college is the end all, be all goal of young adulthood, but so many leave saddled with debt and without any real prospects. The vast majority of people would be better off going to trade school, or working their way up from inside an organization. I’m open to hearing about why I’m looking at this wrong, but based on my own general experience I think too many people look at college like it's the only way to lead a successful life"

8,2022-09-27,CMV: The harmful political strife over Girls Who Code is based on misinformation and potential deception by the author.,u/Amoral_Abe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xpu1or/cmv_the_harmful_political_strife_over_girls_who/,changemyview,"I have begun seeing lots of news stories about how ""Girls Who Code"" are banned in the Central York, PA school district.  There are countless people online currently in arms arguing that this is proof that the right wants to control women.  However, when I delved into the publicly available facts on this issue, I don't see any evidence of what the presumed sexism.  This could be because I am currently have inaccurate information or perhaps I have not heard a good argument made for this case.  Either way, here's what I know about the case so far.  
  
* After the George Floyd Protests, in August of 2020, the school district decided to put together a list of books that could be useful for teachers (Specifically a ""Diversity Resource Reading List"").  Girls Who Code was sort of on that list but not really.  In that list, there was supposedly a link to another list which contained the book.  
* Girls Who Code was actively being used in an after school program.  
* In November 2020, A local school board found out about the list and voted to ban books on it that were not actively being used.  
* Enforcement of the ban may have been lax so parents reached out about it and the school board sent an email in August 2021 to remind teachers that those books should not be used in classrooms (outside of what was already in use, although it appears they didn't mention that in the email).  
* The media picked up on it and the school board backtracked and allowed those books to be used in classrooms.  
* The School Board was fired and replaced.  
* Months later the author joined in a crusade about how her book is banned.  
* The school district vehemently denies this.  
  
So, that's what I'm aware of.  My takeaway from this is.  
  
* The after school program using that book was never cancelled and was allowed to run uninterrupted.  
* The book may have been allowed in classrooms because it was already in use and the ban only targeted books that weren't in use.  
* The ban (which doesn't appear to target the book) appears to be a result of the culture war between democrats and republicans.  Democrats were trying to push more diverse material while Republicans were mad at the idea of books being pushed specifically because they are diverse.  
* There was never any attacks on women or attempts to block Girls Who Code, specifically but other diverse books were blocked from being active material in classrooms (although they were available in the library).  
  
Given this, how can people claim that there was an attempt to silence women or attack this book.  Given that the school had an after school program on the book it appears they never had any intention or desire to remove it.  Now, there's definitely arguments to be made about the ethics and morality of pushing books specifically because they're diverse and on the flip side, banning books specifically because they are diverse.  However, on this particular topic (Girls Who Code), it appears the Author jumped on a bandwagon and there was no actual ban of the book in question.  
  
Please respond in a polite fashion.  I'm not trying to take a political stance here, I am merely trying to follow the facts of the situation (as accurately as I can) and make a judgement on those.  If I am missing some key piece of information, I'd love to find out as it may impact my conclusion."

584,2022-09-27,CMV: An armed populace has real benefits and this should not be ignored when debating gun control.,u/justacuriousMIguy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xpw7wl/cmv_an_armed_populace_has_real_benefits_and_this/,changemyview,"So, this post is inspired by something I’ve noticed about American political discourse around gun control, which is that it mainly focuses on two questions: ""Will gun control lead to a safer society?"" and ""Even if it would, do people have an inherent right to own guns?"". I won’t focus on either of these, but I’m not here to deny that gun control can lead to fewer gun deaths or claim that there isn’t an argument to be made that people have a right to self-defense which extends to gun ownership. I just think this debate is leaving out another important aspect, that gun ownership can make it far easier for a society to resort to violence when defending against internal and external threats. 

The reasons for this are obvious: people who already own guns make more effective rebels and insurgents, and there is less of a barrier to becoming one.

To give an example, China’s actions in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Tibet have been widely opposed by the people there. But because of a long history of strict gun laws, they all lack the capacity to resist in the most effective way possible. Protestors in Hong Kong resorted to using [bows and arrows](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/17/hong-kong-protesters-fire-bows-and-arrows-from-campus-fortress.html). Imagine what these same individuals and many more could have done had gun ownership been common in Hong Kong. Perhaps China would have reconsidered if their actions are worth the cost. 

For those who say no number of civilians with small arms can topple a truly authoritarian regime, that is true but also rarely necessary. All that has to be done is make the cost of the government doing whatever it is doing so high as to be untenable. For example, the IRA killed a thousand soldiers in thirty years. While that is a lot, it is not operationally significant to the British Army, and yet the UK made significant concessions to the IRA in the Good Friday Agreement. A similar scenario is the US withdrawal from Afghanistan: the US military was more than capable of continuing its presence in Afghanistan indefinitely or even ramping it up, but because of insurgency the government was not willing to. Other examples include the mujahideen and resistance movements in World War Two.

To change my view you would have to show that such insurgencies are not effective, or that prior gun ownership does not help create them. Or something else I am not considering!

530,2022-09-27,CMV: kids in school should be taught basic adult life skills that are practically required to know in order to get through life successfully.,u/kensclit,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xpy2wj/cmv_kids_in_school_should_be_taught_basic_adult/,changemyview,"I can't tell you how many times I have heard a high schooler, or even newly graduated adults tell me they do not know how to do things like file taxes, buy a home, buy insurance, buy a car, read their credit score, etc. 

A lot of people in this age group have never had a credit card, or just got a new one. They have no idea how to use it or how it effects their credit score. They don't even know what a credit score is and how to determine if their score is where it needs to be. If it's a lower score, they have no idea how to bring it back up or how long it takes to bring it up or how quickly it can go down. What are hard inquiries? What are derogatory marks? How am I supposed to get a loan with no credit history/age?

You hit 18/19 and it's your first time having to file taxes and you have no idea how because the education you get in school doesn't actually teach you real life shit.

I strongly believe these things should be taught in schools. Math is a great subject to learn but I can't tell you how many times I've used the Pythagorean theorem in my life after graduation. Actually I can tell you, it's *zero*. If schools are not going to add an extra period to these kids school days for the ""*Here's Some Useful Information You'll Actually Use in Your Life After Graduating*"" class, then they need to at least make in a required elective class. High schools are requiring two years of foreign language and one year of physical ed., why not require a class that will actually be useful?

I am a grown woman and still go to my parents and ask them questions about the adult life all the time. I know an argument will be, ""Kids are taught the proper education needed to graduate high school like math, science, history, English, etc. When that same kid goes home to their parents, they can learn about the adult life from them. It is a parents responsibility to teach their child these things."" While I completely understand that perspective, there is far more that goes into it. Some children live with parents that either don't care to give them this information, don't even know it themselves, or some children just don't have parents at all. Some kids parents kick them out right when they turn 18, and didn't get a chance to ask their parents these kinds of things.

It is such a hard life after high school. When a child turns 18 it takes them a while to fully understand all of the responsibilities they hold as an adult. It takes a lot of time to learn and fully understand how to navigate this life. Why can't schools help?

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who’s commented on my CMV. A lot of you have brought up some really great points that I was not thinking of before! I no longer think a class like this should be added to the school day, but I do still believe it should be a required elective at least one year out of the four that high schoolers are in school. 

Speaking of electives, I would like to apologize for implying that classes like Foreign Language and Physical Ed. are not useful. I definitely should have worded that differently. I only mean that if classes like Foreign Language and Physical Ed. are required, (because these are separate from classes like math, science, history, english) then a “Life Skills” class should be required, too.

I will continue to respond to some comments for a while, and I’ve awarded Deltas to those who have changed my view!"

Don’t get me wrong- I’m not advocating for a wealth cap on individuals. This would be pure and overreaching authoritarianism, which is bad.

I am simply advocating for regulation of the wage gaps in companies and corporations such that in a company like amazon you don’t have someone earning millions and millions a year while entry level workers can barely put food on the table.

I suggest 500% as a starting number but feel free to suggest other numbers. Just something reasonable.

This would make executives actually consider the lives of those who make their companies as great as they are by putting in the leg work. It would also put them better in touch with their structure of the company as a whole, allowing them to think more carefully about where money is going and actually run their company better and maybe even make more money.

This would also stimulate the economy- as most all employees would receive substantial raises and actually have money to spend on things instead of not even being able to save anything."

Many will tell you that NHS staff are heroes, and they deserve at least a 10% payrise. Those same folk will, in the same breath, lament the growing gap between the rich and poor.                 
                  
But think about it: at +10% a nurse on £25k a year would receive a £2.5k payrise. Great. A medical director on £100k would receive a £10k payrise. Great for them, but that's a very clear widening of the wealth gap, with greater rewards given in proportion to higher earnings.

But big things like being honest about the Agojie being slavers, being very much pro-slavery, and the idea that enslaving people being bad was basically non-existent during the time period.

It could have been presented as a surprise, like 3/4 through the movie it's revealed just how evil (by today's standards) this group was. Or they could have just been honest about the group the entire movie.

It would have been interesting to see them fighting side by side with male warriors as well, as this would have been a much more refreshing way to present woman or black empowerment.

The point of the movie would have been about humans being capable of extreme evil. Kind of like how the movie Downfall was so good at presenting Hitler as just a human (with many flaws besides the obvious ones), not some mythological evil villain. And/Or about how historically subjective morality is.

\- That not being historically accurate is always bad

\- That this movie is bad

\- That many other good or bad movies haven't been historically inaccurate

And in my quest to find answers, I've skimmed through different philosophical viewpoints and learned about different ideas like nihilism, existentialism, utilitarianism, hedonism, and more, and throughout all of it, I couldn't find anything that I agree with that also directly opposes my claim above. 

However, I know that there must have been ideas that I have missed, possible rebuttals that I have overlooked. Frankly, there is a part of me that really does want to believe that my above claim is just false, but my outlook is not currently optimistic on the matter. 

To further clarify my viewpoint, I think that suicide is logically the best option for a typical human because an average human's life will be full of suffering and more pain than joy. Of course, there are outliers such as rich aristocrats who manage to live life happily and die before experiencing much sadness, but these people are only able to fuel their lifestyle by taking advantage of the suffering of others. This is not sustainable nor justifiable. In fact, every human has contributed to the suffering of others. Every time we consume, every time we build ourselves up, we take something from the world around us. 

To have every human cooperate and work together to enrich everyone's lives is an impossible task in my eyes. There is too much greed, selfishness, and stupidity in humans for this to happen. This is why I hold a misanthropic view, and why I think that people who continue to live are ignorant of this reality, or a simply a little insane to continue living despite the obvious problems. 

A rebuttal that I expect is one that claims that a human life does not in fact experience more sadness than joy, that one can find purpose in life by creating their own meaning from their unique experiences that makes life all worth it. Essentially, the concept of existentialism.

I argue that creating your own meaning like this requires a bit of insanity. As humans who have the ability to think and ponder, many of us search for answers, for purpose. But I think that there are ultimately no answers. For the human species as a whole, life is just Suffering Simulator 5000 - a constant, meaningless fight against the eternal force of chaos, and a fight that we will eventually lose. We only continue to exist because of the unreasonable primal instincts within us that defy rational thought. 

I'm not saying being insane is bad. I'm just saying that we are.

Edit: Okay, the number one comment I’m seeing is that the dictionary definition of insanity doesn’t support my argument. I agree, and I should have used a better word choice. I guess ‘absurdism’ might work in place of the word ‘insanity’, but ultimately my main point still stands. 
Also, I am not currently suicidal, and I am a functioning member of society. Please don’t worry about my mental health because it’s fine, since I do see how some people might get worried after seeing me write about topics like suicide."

But when the person is young, everyone suddenly gets all “uncomfortable” with their grief and pushes them to date, complete with platitudes about how “it’s what the other person would have wanted” (so putting words in the mouth of the dead), “there’s other people out there” (completely stomping on the other person’s regard for the deceased as their ‘one’), and/or “life goes on” (like the remaining person isn’t acutely aware of that as they sit without their partner).

It’s not cool and comes off as insensitive to their hurt and pain solely because of age. Losing a partner at 25 or 75 isn’t a competition, it’s traumatic no matter what. I haven’t heard a single person *dare* tell an 80-something widow(er) that there are more fish in the sea or that they have to move on, and treating a 20/30/40 something this way, dictating their future love life, is so commonplace. It’s almost patronizing. It hurts to have your partner’s significance minimized just because someone *else* feels you haven’t gotten far enough in life for them to matter that much.

TL;DR: We don’t rush retired widowers “back into the dating pool” with the same urgency we do college aged/workforce aged ones even though they both may not be ready, and it’s wrong to treat *either* group like this, not just older grievers."

There is a clear correlation between the cost of legal representation and the outcome of cases. Over and over again, wealthy people can afford the best possible lawyers who, in turn, get them out of all kinds of crimes and civil obligations that more impoverished people would be punished for. This effectively creates a tiered system of 'justice' that does not actually offer fair treatment under the law.

I don't see this talked about and I am more than open to pushback, I just wanted to get the conversation started and see what I am missing. Thanks!


ps. I would love if anyone has data on legal fees as they relate to the outcome of cases, I can't find it for the life of me (I recognize it probably isn't publicly available).

I want to be clear, I don't hate the idea of some kind of Universal Health Care system, but I see it as a **Privilege**, not a **Right.** So please don't be talking in the comments about how Medicare for all or some other system would be economically more efficient or cover more people, I am not saying it wouldn't, I am just saying that even if it was more beneficial to society it still doesn't make it a right.

I believe calling health care a right is akin to saying you are **entitled** to someone else's labor. People DO have the right **to** life, but that is protecting you from other individuals infringing on that right. Ie you can't murder someone. The right to life doesn't guarantee you immortality, and it doesn't give you access to luxury goods like health care. Again its a privilege, not a right.

If someone created a new medicine that cured cancer, why is it an individuals right to have it? I mean yeah I would want it, and I think that person should share it with the world, but its also their creation and intellectual property, why would it be our right to take it from them? If it was a right we would already have it, things like freedom of speech, religion, protests, vote, are all abilities we as individuals have. We have the right to those things because they come to us naturally and the government doesn't infringe on them. It is freedom **from** the government.

I think people have the right to **access** health care, but they don't have the right to demand services or forcibly take goods owned by someone else.

TLDR: Title

EDIT: I CMV, a ""privilege"" is a special right, so technically health care is a ""right."" However my original post stemmed from politicians calling healthcare a ""basic human right."" I still think its a privilege, a special right only granted to certain individuals. Not against it being a privilege all US citizens have, however I think it is vastly different then our basic human rights, or natural rights given to us. "

Crimes that are punished with a fine are essentially just things that rich people can get away with.

Poor people are disproportionately punished by fines.

Jail time forces people to sit and think on their behaviour.

For smaller crimes, the jail time could be a day or even an hour.


EXTRA INFO (optional):
I think that to replace the money going to the government from fines we should tax the rich.
If the jailed person has children their closest relative should be contacted and offered temporary guardianship as well as financial assistance for the duration of the primary guardian's jail time. If they don't want temporary guardianship the next closest relative should be contacted. If there are no other relatives (and the primary guardian can't recommend a family friend) then the child should be placed into temporary foster care."

For everyone's sake.,u/barbodelli,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xqqxxs/cmv_if_ukraine_can_deal_their_way_out_of_this_war/,changemyview,"If my compatriots in /r/ukraine read this. They would bite my head off. I get a lot of downvotes when I start even mentioning the idea of ceding territory. At least temporarily.

I believe in early April something like this deal was on the table.

1) Everything moves back to Pre February 23rd borders.

2) Crimea is frozen for 15 years. Meaning in 15 years discussions about it possibly rejoining Ukraine would restart. But for the time being it would remain occupied/annexed by Russia

3) Ukraine received security guarantees from several countries. US, Great Britain, Germany and a few others. These are legally binding promises to defend Ukraine in the event of future attacks by Russia. Not just supplying weapons like now. But actual boots on the ground.

4) Ukraine agrees not to seek NATO membership. I believe the wording was ""Ukraine will not enter into any military alliance or bloc"". But that would not exclude them joining EU.

I think #3 is the most critical. If you have a security guarantee from US. That is as good as NATO membership. If anything it's a much bigger liability for US.

This seems like a really good scenario. Which I'm fairly certain Putin would likely approve seeing how badly his military is performing since the counter offensive.

The other big elephant in the room is Nuclear Weapons. If it wasn't for those I believe US would have driven Russia back to their borders a long time ago like they did with Kuwait. Possibly even drove to Moscow to topple that fucker. But because of nukes they can't do that. The big benefit to this conflict being over is it would significantly lower the likely hood of an all out nuclear exchange. Which would indeed be VERY BAD for everyone. Including Ukraine. 

Russia still has a faltering economy and a devastated military. The West is under no obligation to remove sanctions. They would likely lift some but say ""You want all of them removed then give up on Donbass and Crimea"". Sooner or later Putin and his cronies will be gone and the new Russian government will want to do business with the West again. Very likely they just give those lands back without the need to spill a ton of blood or have a nuclear war. 

The idea that Russia could come back stronger in a few years seems totally assinine. As long as they can't trade with the West their economy is going to be a shell of their former self. And even with all the $ coming in from selling gas to Europe the military they did put together was not particularly impressive. They left Finland alone forever after getting their ass kicked in the Winter War. I believe the same exact thing would happen here. This would be the last time Ukraine ever had to deal with them. Especially with US covering your back.

Now I know it's not 100% US would actually sign such an agreement. But that's not really what my CMV is about. My CMV assumes that they would. I literally see ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to keep fighting if an offer like that was on the table. So yeah change my mind.

I know I argue a lot on here about many other topics. But I usually do give delta's in my own posts. If someone ACTUALLY changes my mind."

They say they have ADHD and I ask why “I can’t focus”, people say they’re depressed.. how do you know? “I’m sad today” 

It’s honestly just a cycle of people self diagnosing themselves without doing proper research/medical diagnosis. I understand, sometimes we know ourselves the best but whenever it comes to something serious and you need an actual therapist/specialist self diagnosing can be so so harmful. For example, there’s a girl in my class and she told me she has autism and ADHD. Then, she told me she hasn’t actually gotten checked up, but she still knows. Afterwards, as I spent more time with her she starting diagnosing me with autism also. She told me I have the symptoms and i ask her how she knows and she told me she looked online and I follow exactly what it says and that she has it too. I’m not mad at her, but I do think it was ignorant. Self diagnosing can not only be harmful to yourself because you might be wrong but harmful to other because you spread wrong information. 

I understand U.S healthcare sucks, and getting therapy and everything is soo expensive but that doesn’t mean people should be telling others about what they THINK they have.

EDIT: when I say valid I mean, end result, people shouldn’t be saying they have this and that then call it a day, self diagnosis should only be a basis in order to seeing if you need specialist help or not. many people I know self diagnosis and don’t seek further help, they end it on the self diagnosis; therefore not a valid (conclusion)."

Because it seems like to me there is one painfully obvious solution to one of the biggest environment pollution problems.

And because governments and cities REFUSE to ever bring this up is a tell to me that theyre all talk and no walk.

Why not just go back to the brown paper bags we used to have in stores? They are environmentally friendly are they not? They worked well enough for our needs? (Practically speaking I do prefer plastic bags as their handles make them easier to carry all at one and they dont rip 'as' easily).

But were the brown paper bags not a perfectly fine option? Already had em so obviously we can produce them en masse again... So why does no one ever bring that up?

What about glass bottles instead of plastic bottles too? Glass is bottles not only can be recycled effectively but they can even be hella useful in a lot of situations and reused, imagine if the world ended, glass bottle would be a hot item for breaking into shards as toola or used just as bottle. (Random tangent but still)

If I were in charge I see those two things as the most direct way to address some pretty big eco problems, afterall plastic bags I'm sure is the most common litter there is.

If I was a leader taking these environmental issues seriously no doubt brown paper bags would have been on the menu 10 years ago.

The fact that is swept under the rug seemingly and ignored tells me that even thr simplest most obvious solution is disregarded simply because they dont really care that much."

True for AUS and USA

Was this inevitable? I have been thinking about it and I conclude that it is inevitable, but I wanted to check my thoughts on here to get a better perspective from people more knowledgeable than me. **Disclaimer, my economic education is just 1 Microeconomics class in 1st year College**

If you think about it, unless a major scientific breakthrough happens land is limited. You can make artificial islands but good luck getting the permit to do that in a western country that cares about the environment.

Therefore, the amount of supply is going to get butchered as population grows, and over time more established families absorb more and more land to grow their wealth.

So the land that is actually going to be left for people who don't have any is going to be very little.

Unlike most things, you can't realistically just create more land. Yes, jobs become more productive as people get more educated over time, and as technology improves over time. But we are not at the point where we can just create more land. Therefore it is obvious that home prices will outpace wages.

Wages outpacing the price of a thing should only happen if said thing becomes easier and less resource intensive to manufacture to the point where competition between citizens doesn't matter.

In the middle ages books were expensive, because printing didn't exist.

As technology improved and books became easier to mass produce, books became cheaper. To the point where books will remain affordable even if everybody in the world wants to own the same book.

Even if everybody in the USA wanted a Holy Bible, the holy bible can be printed affordably to everybody with average wage due to the efficient printing technology we have. For a long time until the trees die out you can fulfill the need of everyone to have a bible.

This doesn't apply to land. There is only ever going to be small and diminishing amount of land left unless scientific breakthroughs happen.

(HYPOTHETICAL)

If there is enough land for 10 million people, and there are 30 million people who don't have land. Due to the law of supply and demand, coupled with the fact that the demand for land is nearly infinitely inelastic, (and by nearly infinitely inelastic I mean the demand curve is almost a straight vertical line because EVERYBODY wants a home) it doesn't matter how high the average wage is, house price growth will ALWAYS trump average wage growth.

Inelastic demand of homes due to everybody wanting a home is impossible to beat, and should be impossible to beat for any policy and government.

If the average wage out of those 30 million Americans is 50k, the house price is going to be so high that only 10 million of those 30 million can afford it, meaning 20 million are going to be unable to afford, this is the law of Supply and Demand, the consequence of markets in general shifting towards the point of equilibrium... The point where the price is as high as possible, but low enough that the amount of people willing to buy the thing is exactly the same amount as how much of that thing actually exists.

If the average wage of the 30 million Americans is 100k , the house price will inflate so that only 10 million of those richer Americans can afford it.

If the average wage of the 30 million Americans is 1 million, the house price will inflate again.

If the average wage is 10 million, it will still inflate.

And it is even worse than this, because there are like 200 million other Americans who already have a home, but want more homes so the competition is going to inflate the prices even higher.

So I am asking people on this subreddit, is there a long term solution (LONG TERM, PERMANENT) to rising home prices? Specifically home prices outpacing wage growth? Because from Basic Microeconomics, as long as the demand for homes is inelastic as it is today (Because culturally everybody wants a home, and everybody expects themselves to have a home, and everybody expects their friends to have homes, and you kind of have higher social status if you own a house and don't pay rent) , it is economically impossible for wage growth to even equal home price growth.

&amp;#x200B;

Only permanent solution I see, is for people to begin accepting that they might not ever privately own their own land. Its gonna sting for a lot of people, but after a generation or 2 living in rent houses and apartments your entire life will become the new ""normal"" and not many people will consider owning a private home to be normal."

**Texting is a way to avoid conflict**. Too many people use their text messages as a way to dodge in-person confrontations. A person today would rather send a long text message to voice their discontent than talk to the other person face-to-face. A relationship is about both parties having a say, and with this, it's one-sided.

* ***Lying is easier with texting***. The words written on a screen hide a great deal of emotion, so it's hard to find the motivation behind a text message. If a person lies to me, it would be much more difficult to spot any inconsistencies as opposed to if I were speaking to them in person. Texting makes it much easier to lie, which can in turn cause distrust among two people.
* ***Texting can be used to curtail conversation***. As a measure to forestall communication, people will habitually add a preemptive expression to their messages (e.g., “sorry running late”). Rather than sincerely being sorry, these texts are more often used to not have to deal with the consequences of having offended someone: to keep conflict at bay.

**Texting muddles communication**. Without inflection, tone, or pitch, texting reduces the interchange of human connection to simple words or photos on a screen. An absence of intonation confuses the communication one person can have with another.

* ***Texts are challenging to understand***. Too often, people will have trouble deciphering the meaning of a text message. Throw in a bunch of emojis, and it’s hard to understand whether that’s how a person’s genuine feelings are like at that moment or if it’s just an attempt at preventing tension from arising. Without facial cues and tone of voice, it’s challenging to understand the sincere intention of a message.
* ***Texting shares information one-sidedly***. Briefly mentioned earlier, text messages present a one-sided sharing of information, often leaving the recipient disappointed and confused. When one person is given the chance to express their feelings through text, it sometimes ends up doing the opposite of its intended purpose, leaving the receiver overwhelmed rather than assured.

**Texting misses the human contact and learning that comes from true dialogue**. Without true dialogue, text messages are often misconstrued, confused, and presented in one-dimensional terms. The absence of human-to-human contact prevents users from learning as they would if they spoke to one another in person.

* ***Texting encourages passive-aggressive behavior***. Typing on a screen without the ability to see the reflection of how texts impact another person’s emotions makes it easy to write impulsive things. The pain and bafflement a recipient might have from our impulsivity will remain unknown.
* ***Texting decreases the quality of our interactions***. How many ‘real’ moments can someone say they have over text? When communication is reduced to words on a screen, our interactions will lack the most basic fundamentals of what every relationship needs to progress. Sure, text messages might create a higher quantity of interactions, but does it not in turn decrease their quality? This ultimately harms our relationships in the long term.
* ***Texting prompts a lack of investment in personal relationships***. People will often resort to text to express their congratulations or condolences rather than taking the time out of their day to plan out a letter or card to send out. These perfunctory congratulations/condolences will never carry the same weight–or bring the same smile–as a letter would. Time and planning are things that a simple text message can’t begin to hold.

Here's where a lot of my opinion is based in addition to my personal experiences: \[[https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/texting-really-ruining-personal-relationships-ncna1097461](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/texting-really-ruining-personal-relationships-ncna1097461)\] \[[https://medium.com/the-partnered-pen/texting-may-be-destroying-your-personal-relationships-dc9df8f592ed](https://medium.com/the-partnered-pen/texting-may-be-destroying-your-personal-relationships-dc9df8f592ed)\] \[[https://relevantmagazine.com/life5/texting-is-easier-but-it-might-be-ruining-your-relationships/](https://relevantmagazine.com/life5/texting-is-easier-but-it-might-be-ruining-your-relationships/)\]

What would change my view? Give me a sound argument to believe that texting strengthens our relationships, not ruins them. I acknowledge that some of my reasoning might be faulty. This is your chance to argue against my argument or aspect of reasoning.

What would not change my view? Saying something like, 'it's the deranged way people use their text messages, not texting itself' or 'it's always...'. I don't want to hear sweeping generalizations. Because while that might be the case for Person A, that might not necessarily be the case for Person B. I want to hear solid arguments.

All thoughts, comments, and concerns are greatly appreciated.

Change my view!

0,2022-09-29,CMV: Timocracy is the ideal form of government,u/The_Saracen_Slayer,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xrfo0t/cmv_timocracy_is_the_ideal_form_of_government/,changemyview,"Obviously there is no absolute answer in terms of which government is best, it can all come down to personal preference, circumstance and individual bias. But here I will argue that a Timocracy (rule by landlords) is best government. 

1) It ensures that land (space) becomes the dominant power resource in a state and thus puts great importance on developing it and maintaining it. Similar to the Eastern Roman Tegmata system, defense of the state would be a regional duty. The landlords would have to raise there own troops/armies to defend there lands.

2) It ensures some form of egalitarian benefits to property owners since government would naturally respect the rights of private ownership. Which means for homeowners, laws would be in your favor and hopefully no squatters allowed!

3) It would ensure that local governing is beneficial to those that have stake in the land and not foreigners. By restricting power/voting to only homeowners, it would regulate those of less stable conditions from holding power in local matters. Which is good because it means those with lesser stakes won’t pollute the state with conflict of interest demands/laws.

4) Land is a limited resource which means, holding borders constant, it’s value will go up as population increases. Which is great for the owners and state since it means more money.

5) The last thing is about the virtues of this government, and it’s subjective whether it’s good or bad. A growing Timocracy will naturally lead to warrior/honor based society. Landlords derive their power from honor, those that live under his land must honor the right to his/her property. There will be great pressure for family ties and inheritance to continue the owning the land of their ancestors.

The biggest argument against my case I can only think of is being anti-war. A Timocracy will naturally morph into an imperialist empire since it will desire new land as population increases. Which will bring into conflict with neighbors. Which would put the state in peril if it can’t successfully transition to a military power.

Anyway, that’s my thoughts. Any arguments as to why I, or landlords in general, shouldn’t value a Timocracy? Why would another form of government be better?"

In my opinion, we shouldn't rebuild it at all. The people should relocate and the land should return to it's natural state.

Ocean levels are rising. Hurricanes are getting worse. If we rebuild, it won't take long for another hurricane to tear it all down again. Just as cities shouldn't be built on flood plains, they shouldn't be built where they can be covered in 6ft of storm surge.

Rebuilding will be a waste of money, and will result in the loss of human life time and time again. We can't get sucked into a cycle where we are constantly fighting nature. Nature will win, in the end.

Edit: This got a lot more attention than I expected. Thank you to everyone who were willing to have a discussion. I've changed my view slightly. My original take was rooted in a lot of climate anxiety. I'm quite concerned, but it's not the end of the world yet.

I still think that, sooner than we'd like, we need to stop rebuilding cities in low-lying, flood-prone places like the Gulf of Mexico. I still think that rebuilding the entirety of what was destroyed by Hurricane Ian is a bad idea (they're considering not rebuilding Sanibel Island).

My biggest change was that I was educated in the advances of technology, including the work done by the Dutch and in Bermuda. It gave me a lot of hope for the future.

Edit 2: I also want to apologize to anyone who was effected by the hurricane who saw this and was hurt. I didn't expect it to get this popular, and am not trying to make a hard time worse. "

Hello, everyone.

Sometimes i get the impression that altitudes that are condemned in men, are tolerated with women. 

For example sexual harassment much more tolerated with women than men (there are cases of women groping men against their will, even after they refuse their advances)

While misogyny is deeply comdemned, misandry seems to be justified in some places like r/askfeminism. 

Creepy Predatorial behaviours like older persons dating much younger partners are much more condemned with men (Leo diCaprio) than with women.


Domestic abuse is taken with much more gravity with men, than with women (Mrs Heard). There are thousands of cases of male crazy exes properly going to the jail, while female crazy exes are taken at lighter view by society, as simply spoiled persons.

I also get the impression that mental healthcare is taken much serious in women than men. If a women have antisocial tendencies she going to have easier access to healthcare and help, than a antisocial insecure guys ( No wonder JP, and red pills are popular among incels).

What you think, can you please change my view ?"
19,2022-09-29,CMV: The only reason to wear Breastforms size S or larger is for fetish or cosplay.,u/oshaboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xrjyej/cmv_the_only_reason_to_wear_breastforms_size_s_or/,changemyview,"It's Friday where I'm at.

Oh boyo, Breastforms are on the News now. For those who aren't in trans, drag or crossdressing communities. Breastforms are detachable fake breasts that are worn by crossdressers and the pre-transition trans people. They are supposed to mimic the appearance of breasts so you can pass better in low cut clothing. But they have been on the news because of a transgender teacher who wore X sized ones to work.

Ok, For context I am a crossdresser. I am not trans. And when I crossdress I wear a D cup breastform vest. But I do speak a lot to trans people and they all seem to agree with me on the topic. And also I got accosted once by someone asking me very specific questions about breastforms so apparently I am the expert now because I own a pair.

So breastforms in most places that sell them come in normal sizes that I can see looking decent on people based on build (A-H) and then there's S, X and Z (at least in royaner). Now I am aware there are women who naturally grow breasts that large, but I feel like if you have the choice (which you do if you are buying breastforms) you should always go for the smaller sizes.

There are 4 groups of people who buy breastforms, crossdressers (incl Drag Queens), trans women, cosplayers and fetishists. I'm going to go through why one by one.

so first, Crossdressers, the ones I understand the most. I usually summarize the goals of crossdressing as ""Cute, Feminine, Passing"" in that order. And I feel like using abnormally large breastforms harm all three. I know all 3 of them are subjective but IMO they look ugly, don't help you be feminine. And passing is usually best near the middle of the bell curve. Now of course every crossdresser is different but I feel like more or less, most crossdressers are like that.

Next what the original story which sparked the debate was about. I think for trans women usually the goal is first to pass, then be feminine and ""cute"" is really the last goal. (Correct me if I am wrong). And the bell curve argument still applies. So I have no clue what that teacher was trying to achieve and I feel like her breastforms were an obstacle to passing than a tool. You might say that it might ease dysphoria and that trans women often overcompensate early in their transition. I feel like there is quite a difference between wearing a dress daily and wearing X cup breastforms but I guess it depends on how your dysphoria manifests. Still I feel like you should still lean towards D or even G.

For cosplay, there are many anime characters that have huge boobs. i mean some serious honkers. a real set of badonkers. etc. So much so that it became a meme. So if you want to cosplay as one of those, it makes perfect sense to buy breastforms that size, even if you already have a natural set.

And lastly, fetish. There are many fetishes involving abnormally large breasts. And honestly, you do you. And you might even wear X cup in public because you enjoy exhibitionism. Though every fetishist would agree that you shouldn't involve others who aren't interested and if you do that's sexual assault. And a high school is definitely a terrible terrible idea to expIf they cast a white woman as Tiana that ress your fetishes.

&amp;#x200B;

Also to clarify. I recognize that this one off story is used to demonize trans teachers and fits very well into Chris Rufo's ""Gender Groomers in School"" tales. So much so that I have a hunch it might be fake (but I will assume it is real). There is a big difference between ""Don't teach while wearing X cup breastforms"" and ""Don't teach if you are transgender"". And I am vehemently opposed to the demonization of trans people.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Sorry masectomy patients. You completely slipped my mind. I'd assume masectomy patients would look for a match to their original breasts. Or maybe a size up or down. "
0,2022-09-29,CMV: Texas' latest free-speech law would be good for America,u/Chompchompers,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xrk5i2/cmv_texas_latest_freespeech_law_would_be_good_for/,changemyview,"It's no secret that people are more able than ever to live in bubbles. Before, if you had a fetish for dragons fucking cars you largely had to satisfy yourself with that. If your neighbor didn't like dragons fucking cars, you had to accept that there are different people out there than yourself. Nowadays we have a /r/dragonsfuckingcars for anything that you like; whether it's literally dragons fucking cars or conspiracy theories or your political views. No matter who or what (I'm looking at you, reptilians) you are, there is a bubble out there for you to thrive in -- and to isolate yourself in. I believe this is a problem, as it hinders our ability to understand people. It thwarts any and all efforts by others to challenge your ideas. It takes away all opportunities for you to learn how to defend your beliefs. Is your moral value or economical idea really that good if the simple question ""Why?"" utterly destroys your mind? Probably not.

Now I looked and failed to find any youtube videos explaining the details of the law; maybe the algorithm hates me; so forgive me if I'm missing anything important, but my understanding of said law is that it outlaws the censorship of viewpoints on internet based public forums. I do not see why this is an infringement upon free speech, when it is my view that you should have your free speech so long as you do not use your free speech to stifle an other's free speech; and right now that is exactly what social media companies are doing. 

Andrew Tate, an internet figure popular among younger Republicans and minorities, was recently banned from effectively all social media companies capable of making his voice heard by the world. His viewpoint outright censored -- I cannot find a single reason why he was even censored beyond that he is a ""dangerous person"" and that there was one school teacher who was upset at how some of her students were quoting Tate in ways that go against left-leaning ideology. It went so far that Riot Games, the video game company behind the eSports game League of Legends, [removed the G2 Esports VALORANT team from its franchise league](https://clutchpoints.com/riot-retracts-g2-valorant-franchising-ceo/) because Riot wanted the CEO of G2 to delete or denounce his tweet of a video showing himself and Andrew Tate at a party, and he said:

&gt;nobody will ever be able to police my friendships
&gt;
I draw my line here
&gt;
I party with whoever the fuck I want
&gt;
— 😌 (@CarlosR)

Sure the message may not have been professional, but is this really the shape we want our Free Speech to take? Should we really allow social media companies to coordinate their use of free speech to silence others' free speech? Should we allow video game companies to tell employees or franchisees who they can and cannot publicly party with?"

Spanish and Portuguese are heavily gendered languages, to the point that saying almost any adjective, profession, even any household item, there is an implied he or she attached. And a lot of people living in Latin America are creating new gender free language to break free from these language barriers. Latinx is a term that gives people a way to feel connected to their cultural and gender identity or to refer to a group of people without deferring to gendered language. 


Another point I’m sure people will bring up is *“you can’t pronounce Latinx in Spanish/ Portuguese”.* And I have to believe this is coming from Americans. Because English words are used in a daily basis in all of South America. Like come on, you’re gonna tell me “fútbol” is Spanish? But not just that, English is creeping into the average Latin American’s vocabulary, with words like “boy”, “date”, “call”, “checkout”, “hater”, “shopping”, “fast food”, “backup”. There’s way too many to count. 


So no, there might not be a Spanish pronunciation, but pretending like Latin Americans can’t physically say Latinx is a ridiculous argument."

If you have a relationship of a sexual nature with someone and they want to end it and ""just be friends"" and you do not want that... you are perfectly justified in not wanting to continue that relationship.

They show very delusional views on technological progress. Do want an example? In the discussions about for example AI generated art and future technologies, they are really defensive about new tech. They either resort to manthras like ""copium"" and ""so much cope"" or ""Technological progress is innevitable"". I found these type of arguments often on youtube comments and in sub-reddits like r/singularity(I was just sticking the noses there, I don't do comments).

I worry about their views, as they usually have very materialistic view on human cultures and don't understand the process of a creation and activity and focus more on the result.

The rest of scientific fields on the other hand, despite their flaws they can easily criticize how their knowledge work and they analyse things like human behavior, the function of ecosystems and geological structure of planets like the earth. For example, many psychologists are aware about the harmful effect that new technologies can cause(For example the tech i'm using now), unlike the computer engineers and tech bros.

You can easily debunk the social darwinists in biology, flat earthers in astronomy and geology and people who use psychiatry to pathologize their opponents. But it is almost impossible to change the mind of the engineers and AI programmers that are obsessed over efficency and think that our future can be like Star Trek.

A psychologist says that we can solve the problem with mental disorders like depression by creating a more simple environment and encourage healthy activities. A tech bro on the other hand thinks that we can solve by putting a chip in the brains of everyone.

12,2022-09-30,CMV: Nature vs. Nurture. Nurture is way more impactful,u/mbta1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xsciw8/cmv_nature_vs_nurture_nurture_is_way_more/,changemyview,"I do have a basic understanding of this argument, but I have heard that there is a debate about ""What affects how someone grows up, their perspective, goals, ideals, all of that, is it either nature, or is it nurture"", and I think it has to mostly be nurture. 

My view is that we are all human. All of us share a lot of biological similarities. We aren't comparing to carts or dogs, or ducks, or rhinos, or any other animal. We are all human, so the nature of each other is 98% similar with everyone else (again, kinda guestimating, just meaning my view is we are all human)

Now, nurture, how our parents teach us, or even our friends, neighbors, teachers, anything like that. Our environment, financial level, everything like that, changes how someone responds, grows, and acts. The person that they become.

Again, from my basic understanding, nurture is just a much more stronger factor in what a person becomes, compared to human nature. I don't see how nature can override something as impactful as how your parents raise you, or the situation you grew up in. I don't know if I'm misunderstanding the argument, but would like to know more and if anyone can change my view on parts of this

Edit: well shit..... good job yall. While I am not tossing off the importance of nurture, I definitely have seen nature's importance in just as many factors."

1945,2022-09-30,CMV: Lizzo playing James Madison's crystal flute is not important or worth talking about.,u/WithinFiniteDude,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/xsfi1b/cmv_lizzo_playing_james_madisons_crystal_flute_is/,changemyview,"From what i understand, the artist Lizzo ~~purchased~~ played a flute that James Madison owned. There are tons of videos of it on reddit, articles and discussion for some reason.

I would like someone to CMV on this because i think this is not worth the attention its getting, in fact i think its a total waste of time to talk about and is completely vacuous.

Lizzo owns/borrowed the flute, and she can play it, i dont see why it matters if a Founding Father/slave owner's instrument is played by an African American woman owns it and plays it now.

Who cares? Why? Of course African Americans own/use stuff racists used to own, and that as a broad trend is good and worth noting, as in worth briefly mentioning alongside other gains in civil rights. But this specific instance is probably worth mentioning once or twice, but it seems to be worth bringing up more than i would, why is that?"
