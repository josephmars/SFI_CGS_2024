I developed a tendency towards the online world in 2016. When I started my first blog and a Dot Com blog (a review blog about a niche in Electronics; very specific and very small and dying niche) and I was a good damn at it.

First year I made $12k, second year $15k (I was and still I'm great at SEO)
I managed to get +30K Organic Visits/mo (+90% fully organic from Google and maybe %5 from referral/ organic ""guest posts"")

In late 2018 I managed to create a private labeling product from one of the products I was reviewing); and sold  1k pieces in 2 batches ""Average 40-60 pieces a month and made about 20-30% profit. (Sold via Amazon and Ebay)

Then a personal thing came in 2020 and I stopped and I kinda lost interest and now I'm down and I don't have the interest in working on my blog neither selling the product or any new products but I miss it and I loved it and I still do.

Since 2020 I have tried to apply for E-commerce and SEO jobs via Indeed but I don't even get an interview because they require college degrees...

Today: what career advice you'd give me knowing that I am passionate and in love with SEO and E-commerce. (I want to work for a company, small business even a person in that field).",False,2022-08

Company A offers a higher rate than my salary expectations and has fixed working hours. Company B meets my salary expectations and has flexible working hours. Design-wise, I believe I will have more creative freedom with Company A as I will be the only in-house graphic designer and working with one brand; however, I believe there is more room for growth with Company B as I will be working with a team of creatives and working on different projects.

I graduated college in the US in May 2020, two months after the pandemic began. My job offer for after graduation was pulled, companies everywhere were laying off and going on hiring freezes. Getting my first job in the data analytics industry was absolute hell; it took over 400 applications and several failed interviews to get it, but it eventually happened. After that, I ended up getting a contract role at one of the biggest tech companies in the world,  and was there for 1.5 years. That contract ended a few months ago and I don’t even know how to comprehend the job market I’ve entered into.

I’m having more trouble getting a job now than I was with no experience, right when COVID started. 200+ applications with absolutely zero response. Not even an initial screening call. At least back then I was getting some phone calls. I’m seeing a ton of similar posts on here with similar situations. It truly feels like I’m throwing my resume into the ether.

How is this possible? I constantly see articles proclaiming how strong the job market is. I know big tech has been laying off for a while now, is it a flood of competition in the market? Is my experience not as good as I thought it was? I thought having experience at a name brand company would help, but it obviously isn’t making a difference.

My question is, if I don’t end up getting the job I just interviewed for, would I be automatically disqualified if I applied to any future openings at the company?

For a little  over a year and a half my job has morphed into a senior role of ""x and y"",  although my title has remained as an "" assistant"". I am recognized by colleagues as a senior which I think is important to this story.
I have raised this with my manager and he has said that they were working to fix it, however nothing has come from this.

Recently a coworker has moved on from their senior role of ""z"" and their role was replaced, their title was changed to be ""senior of x,y and z"" (x and y being my responsibilities).

I spoke to my manager about this and he has said that my tasks won't change and I'll still be responsible for ""x and y"" however I can't get the title or senior as I lack a qualification, for which I am currently in the process of getting (2/3 or the way through). I mentioned that why is it that I can do the work without the qualification and can't get the title. He said once I get the qualification he'll change my title.

My issue is I'm scared to escalate this further as I don't want it to get to the higher ups and they say ""he's right he shouldn't be doing the role, we'll have to make him redundant and hire someone with the qualification"". 
Further to this I'm worried I'm going to get pushed out by the senior that has the title even though they wont be doing my tasks.

Firstly, I apologize for the long paragraph but I really hope to receive help! Hi I’m currently a fourth year undergraduate in Global Health at a university in Ontario, Canada. I am currently searching for potential research opportunities as a full time student, which that said I’m looking to expand my knowledge and experiences by pursuing research of any kind. I’m interested in being able to make a positive impact on communities, through evidence based project and interventions. 

Im also interested in utilizing qualitative methodologies as I am most familiar with this, especially within developing countries like India. Observing health inequities and barriers people face to access healthcare programs and other resources has always kept me thinking, especially because I am able to compare and contrast many first hand experiences with health systems, and witness the gaps and obstacles which exist within other countries (India and Costa Rica) and my experiences growing up with the Ontario health system. 

My goal is to pursue higher education, (ex. Masters and phD) and I currently have a GPA of 7.0. I have past experiences working as a covid screener, and as an intern in a palliative care cancer NGO who delivers home based care programs. Due to course assignments I am familiar with citation softwares such as zotero, and even conducting thorough literature reviews by collating information from many sources. However I have a long way to go and I wish to learn a lot more, specifically with research methodologies, techniques and analyzing data.  

Although I don’t have clear objectives of what career path I want to pursue, I have a rough idea of what topics I am interested in within global health, due to my past experiences. I am looking for research opportunities, even at my university but it’s a struggle to find anything. I want to know what resources I can look into, and yes I am reaching out to professors within my faculty. However as someone with no proper and prior research experience I would like some guidance and advice as to how I could navigate my current circumstances to apply to places which have research opportunities, doesn’t have to be paid. As well as what people have done here to leverage their skills to get into research with no prior experiences. Thank you and I truly hope I could get some insight.",False,2023-09

I (25f) have been best friends with E (25f) for almost eight years. We have known each other since primary school but never talked until we studied together. We spent a lot of time together, but we never expected to hear from each other every single day. That was until she met her Boyfriend ~6 years ago. She rarely went out with me or other friends since her world revolves around her boyfriend.

 After three years of dating, they finally broke up, and that’s when she started seeing us again. The break-up lasted for a year, and then they got back together. She spent less time with me but still made time to see me. I feel things have changed, and I’m unsure if I’m overreacting.

So, whenever I ask her to hang out, she’s busy and has no time to see me. She also doesn’t offer to meet another day. She also doesn’t engage with me; I have no idea what’s going on in her life, not to be dramatic, but if I died, she would never know because she never asks. The last time I saw her was back in April for an Akon concert, but that’s about it.  After the concert, I asked her if she could help me move in June, which she agreed. We never spoke since. This week, she sent me a message telling me she doesn’t know if she can help because her car is not that big. I thought it was rude and disappointed that she only told me one week before moving, letting me all by myself.

We plan to go to the Taylor Swift concert in Zurich soon and see Coldplay in Munich, but I’m not sure whether this is a good idea. I feel like this will be pretty awkward, at least for me, “chilling” with someone who only talks to you before a big occasion. 

I also don’t want to throw away this friendship. Finding new friends nowadays is very difficult, especially from where I live. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not.

By the way, we kind of were in the same situation a couple of years ago when I told her I felt like this friendship was one-sided. I am tired of having to reach out to make sure that we’re still friends. I know she would never ask me to do stuff. She has lost a lot of friends due to her “business.” She’s not that busy; she’s either with her family or her boyfriend.",False,2024-06

My dream is to become an administrative assistant at least or a receptionist even but it seems impossible. I thought that being bilingual would help me and being a us citizen but I guess not 😭. I would like to work in an office without experience but I also need at least 16 an hour (full time) or even working from home full time is fine.

I (32F) moved to Austin, Texas with my husband 1.5 years ago from Denmark. 
I have a work permit and we recently got our GC approved. 

So a little bit of background, but feel free to ask as well. It’s a long post. Sorry 😊 and thanks to anyone who reads this and take the time to respond! 🙏🙌

I worked as a financial advisor in Nordea, Scandinavia’s largest bank, for 5 years. 3 of those in their international branch. 
I have experience with customer service, driving own portfolio of 500+ customers - some classified as high-net worth individuals, KYC, AML and investing that somewhat transfers internationally. 
I was an unofficial credit underwriter, meaning that my colleagues had to send their risk assessment whenever we had to lend customers money to me to read through, before they could send it to the proper branch for final approval. 
I wrote an SOP as guidance as we didn’t have one in this particular branch. 
I also helped onboard new trainees and was their mentor through the process. 

Furthermore I have experience with mortgage lending, retirement plans and insurance, but this is country specific as it is in the US. 

I have an associates degree in financial management from Denmark, after which you must do 1.5-2 years to become a financial advisor. During that period of time you just take 5 courses that is worth  5 ECTS per course. 
They were in:
- Tax
- Credit risk assessment
- Investment
- Mortgage and housing
- Retirement plans 

During my 3 years in the international branch I did 3 courses in:
- Compliance
- AML
- Behavioural finance

During my time in Texas I’ve worked 10 months as a QA engineer for a Google contractor, which unfortunately laid everyone off May as they moved the office to MEX. 
During that position I drove an innovation committee and helped our PM start out the process of creating an SOP as well as creating organised Google drives for the different teams. 

I currently have a part-time project based position for WeLocalize which is very sporadically, but the projects are for mainly Fortune 500 companies.

I’m hoping this will be a bit clearer. 

I have pretty severe mental health conditions that I’ve been managing for the past couple years through medication and therapy. I still have my triggers that will cause me to go into a panic/anxiety attack, but I purposely looked for jobs/roles that wouldn’t. I also asked during interviews point blank if direct customer contact would be part of my job responsibilities. I was given a clear answer of no, and that another department handles all customer questions/outreach, and we would focus solely on our work.

I’ve been in my role for almost a year now, and my company has abruptly changed this and is now requiring us to do this. Just the thought caused me to go into a panic attack and shut down for the day. My manager and previous manager pulled me into a meeting and all I could think about was being fired since I can’t do an aspect of my “new” responsibilities. I hadn’t during my hiring disclosed any of this as well since my role at the time didn’t include direct customer contact.

I’ve started a request for ADA accommodations but this is the first time I’ve done something like this so no idea of the full process or how screwed I am. Or if I need to keep my manager informed during the whole process?

Until about a year ago I was pretty poor and wore mostly Primark and H&M (nothing wrong with them, love them and honestly sometimes better quality at H&M than at higher end brands so please don't @ me). Anyway, I have since generated the income due to a lot of luck and circumstances that I can now shop at some higher end brands. Not Hermes purse-rich by any means but I have treated myself to some Ralph Lauren, Lacoste and Proenza Schouler just to name a few. I have noticed that the care instructions on them differ greatly from the cheaper clothes. Most of them say to either hand wash or dry clean only, some of them even have *everything* crossed out completely. How serious am I supposed to take these instructions? A lot of them are from similar material as the cheaper clothes such as viscose for example but even the 100% natural fibre ones (like cotton and wool mostly) say something similar while I've definitely owned 100% wool H&M jumpers that could go in 30° C washes just fine. 

So... do I really need to follow those instructions to a T? (And if so, what to do with the stuff where all the symbols are crossed out???) Or are there perhaps any resources online on what to do with each specific garment? Like, I'd get a wool blazer that one would need to have cleaned maybe once or twice a year with frequent wear to require one follow the instructions but a normal pair of woollen trousers? A viscose cardigan? Just seems a bit... much. Any input from people more well versed than me in garment care is welcome! 🙏",False,2024-02

Not saying that there are no good movies.My favorites are usually sci-fi because they tend to have the most unique plots for movies (even though I usually like traditional fantasy more). The problem with movies is that with the time restriction makes most of them feel the same. The main character and villain won't die until the end, the love interest has a 50% chance of dying, etc. With books, shows, longer format shows (1 hour episodes), anime, and even video games you get more of the world, lore, characters, etc. A 12 episode a season show that has 20 minute episodes has 4 hours of story tellings. That's already double the time of most movies. I get that movies are good for people that are busy and there are some good ones. But 90% of them are the same boring formula that always leave me wanting more. Lastly movies used to be the peak of production quality. But now these 1 hour episode shows get the same level of production, if not more. And you don't have to sit there for 90+ minutes at a time. So while movies did have their time in the sun, they are outdated and the worst form of story telling.

However, the email is definitely a scam in retrospect. Could phishing links work that way, completely looking like other links, or would they have some extension at the end to redirect me elsewhere? I think the scam might have been done later if I responded to the email, since it was a fake sponsorship offer.

Yesterday I lost my cat very suddenly. We went to sleep and she was totally fine. I woke up and she was laying in our bathroom(not normal for her) couldn't get up, was cold and pale but still crying. I went over to her and she was just staring and limp. I wrapped her in her blanket and took her to the emergency vet. The first thing they said to me is that she was very sick and they needed to do blood work and X-rays. The vet came in and said she had a tumor a very large tumor/mass. She mentioed leukemia and said they can do an ultrasound but even with that they wouldn't be able to  give a definitive and they could keep working on her. I asked the dr if she was pain and if they thought it would be more humane to put her to sleep or if there was a chance and the vet said that she was very sick and she thinks the best choice would be for her to be put to sleep. They brought her in to me and the look in her eyes was misery, scared, I don't know. She loved pets so I gave her all the pets and for a brief moment she purred then She buried head in that blanket. 

She was only 5, and she was like a shadow to me. I guess more so than I realized. I'm struggling with not crying all day, and feeling guilty like I gave up on her. I find myself questioning if I did the right thing and I feel just a bit lost and empty. Everything happened so fast and I didn't think not leaving with her was even an option. It was 45 mins and then I was left with nothing. It's 5 am where I am I can't sleep because I keep thinking about her last hour and I just wanted her to feel love but I don't know.

She slept with me every night and in my way to bed I would say let's go to bed and she's follow along.

This setup is preferable to returning to the UK for a graduate job, where I anticipate higher living costs for a lower quality of life.

I face a challenge: I don't have a portfolio to showcase my work due to unforeseen circumstances. I'm keen on staying in Thailand and am exploring ways to build my experience and credibility in Web development. Any advice on how to navigate this situation, particularly in creating opportunities for remote work, would be greatly appreciated.

I ask this with genuine curiosity and no ill intent. I considered asking on subs like AskAChristian or AskACatholic but those communities are tiny so I’ll just get downvotes. 

I saw a thread earlier today about Jesus not having a Y chromoskme since he was the product of successful human parthenogenesis.

 In modern recorded history there are no recorded cases of successful human parthenogenesis, which makes this case a very rare event - or you could say, truly a miracle. 

Now given that his birth was a miracle birth by the virginal Mary, in his human form he would’ve lacked the Y chromosome, which you would’ve received from a mortal father.

XX means you’re a biological female. Or “cis woman”. In any case is it possible then that he was in fact a female, and all historical texts have been translated poorly along the way?

Or was he the OG “female who identified as a male”? ",False,2024-04

I hope this is the right place for this but don’t know where else to ask. I just applied to graduate school for a masters program in counseling psychology in CA. I came back from an info session from the program and was so excited for the classes and the work I’d eventually be doing. I really feel like this is my true calling and would align with my skills and values. 

Im not going into this for the money but I still care to make enough and after spending some time in this group I’m second guessing myself. I’m just overwhelmed at the steps involved, the huge pay cut I’d be taking and the years it would take to potentially get back up there. I think I’d like to start a PP eventually but am also scared from the horror stories I’ve seen of therapists being burnt out and not making money after putting so much into it. I’m worried about the financial part of putting myself through school and I’d still end up with a job that wasn’t one I could take care of myself physically and mentally and financially. 

For those of you providing counseling, would you recommend the path or should I consider other ones in psychology counseling (or even consider staying in the corporate world)? What do you wish someone had told you or encouraged you to do before entering grad school/ this path? Curious to hear from outside MFT/ LPC too. I know I would find this work fulfilling but I need to make a living too. ",False,2024-03

I validated my ex’s feelings repeatedly, but perhaps we didn’t align on values or our opinions on this particular topic.

I don’t believe people need to agree with everything that others believe is right or wrong, but I can validate how they feel about something or their experiences around it.

So for the first time in my life I quit a job. Im 24 and don't have a degree, what I do have is 5 ½ years of work experience within the mental health sector as a support worker and lower management. As well as 6 months experience as a barista in a coffee shop. I just quit working within the mental health sector as I have had enough of it. Although it's my passion I can't do it anymore because of my own mental health going down the drain whilst in that type of work environment. 

Within the past week I've been applying for jobs left right and centre and currently have 2 potential offers of employment which are quite different. 

The first is a workshop maintinence job, in which I would be servicing and maintaining hydraulic machinery, the labor isn't intense and it would be Monday to Friday, with the addition of gaining a fork lift license and in future potentially gaining a HGV license. I'm unaware of the salary but am led to believe it is around £23k a year.

The second option is working within a local shop, which is looking to expand the business and I would be working within a van, no toilet on board... Which would be £11 p/h , with the chance it could go upwards after 3mo to £11.50 p/h then after 6mo to £12 p/h and experience, I have been told that if all goes well eventually I would be asked to manage the van I work within. This would also include a ""bonus"" money wise which I am not aware of.


I'm at a loss. I don't particularly like working in factories, and I really enjoy customer facing roles. And I know it's up to me but it's nice to have a different opinion. On the one hand, I could work my way up and gain a managment roll, on the other, a forklift license and a more stable place of employment rather than the side of a road and more than likely better prospects. I have no real idea of what I want to do with my life and I am being mindful that I'm nearly at my mid 20s and have decided on a career change, I just don't really know what to do. If I could I would ask both if I could split my time and be part time at 2 jobs, also with the retail job it would be part time hours (25ish) per week until after Christmas then would be full time..

I have been applying to multiple jobs as I am re-entering the workforce after being off for 2 years for personal reasons.

Needless to say, my reference pool is small because I have not worked in 2 years.  The people who have provided me references have been great and so generous in providing me these references.  

Two of the jobs I am applying for use this SkillSurvey Reference site.  Both of the positions require 5 references with two being prior managers.  

If all of the (very detailed!) reference forms are completed for one position, can I import the COMPLETED reference forms into the other position?  Because I see there is an “import references” option.  Or will the system send out BLANK reference forms AGAIN to my reference people?  

I really don’t want to become a pest to my references!  And the forms are time-consuming.

Me (30M), my sister(34F) and her wife (34F) are about to have a phone call about me possibly helping them have their first baby. We have had short conversations about this as a possibility but I know they are about to straight up ask me later this week. I've always thought I would just be down to do it because why not - it's just a donation of a plentiful resource of mine so my sister can create a happy family with the woman she loves. 

On paper it's just a nice thing to do to help them out a bit, but as this gets more real I'm getting questions like ""how are you going to tell the kid"" ""what would your relationship with the kid be"" and ""how will this kid be treated in relation to your other kids or your other neices/nephews?"" And I'm starting to think ""this is an issue for my sister and her wife"" isn't a complete and thorough game plan.

So I ask: What reasons are there to not impregnate my sister's wife? What do I need to ask myself before doing this, and how do I know if it's a good idea?

I'm particularly interested in talking to someone who has been on any side of this situation already and can give actual experience based input, but I value any genuine comments.

Thanks for your time.
